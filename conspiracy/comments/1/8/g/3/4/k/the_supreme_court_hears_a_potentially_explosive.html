        Noonan v Bowen
       </a>
       is being heard in conference by 9 United States Supreme Court Justices on 15 February.
      </p>
      <p>
       This particular case has been brought by Edward Noonan, a US Presidential candidate from the American Independent Party, who is accusing Barack Obama of social security fraud, and therefore ineligibility for highest office. This is a not a tea party ruse, not a racial issue, it is due to the verifiable FACT that the social security number Obama has been using since 1986, and which he used on his

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though this case is actually happening - the US President is being accused of fraud in the Supreme Court - not one mainstream media outlet has even mentioned it, even just to pour scorn on it. Does that make any sense to you?

       Nice use of the derogatory "birther" phrase, but this doesn't solely revolve around his birth certificate. He is using a fraudulent social security number 042-68-4425 which is tied onto many tax returns to his Chicago mansion, using the fake alias Harrison J Bounel. He has comitted a lot more felonies which do not relate to the birth cerfiticate fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of Orly's credibility the facts still remains that many affidavits have been submitted by government workers pulling information on Harrison J Bounel and his Connecticut social security number. These are people who were not associated to her and have taken their own time out to fight this. Lots of good research by

       Stop whitewashing the whole issue as a "birther" issue and stop putting all the credibility on this one attorney.

       I didn't claim either of the things you're arguing.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that people should not be writing this off as a "birther" issue like it's some junk loony conspiracy. There are plenty of real sources who have put out affidavits confirming they searched &amp; found public records connecting
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/y3R7TdJ.jpg">
        Harrison J Bounel and 042-68-4425

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court will probably brush it off because they're all bought and paid for. Doesn't matter either way. My point still remains that Obama has very likely committed social security fraud, whether the courts find this valid or not. Use your own discretion and do your own research.

       The best proof I can offer are signed affidavits by government employees(and citizens) who have looked through databases before these records were scrubbed. Here are some links to scanned PDFs of these affidavits below:

       There are many more which I cannot take the time to dig up right now.

      <p>
       An
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Aaffidavit">
        affidavit
       </a>
       as defined by Google:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A written statement confirmed by oath or affirmation, for use as evidence in court.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       These are just regular people who happened to dig a bit deeper with this evidence. They found something and are willing to stake their professional name in court by writing &amp; signing these affidavits. They each provide a different piece of evidence, and I recommend honestly reading through these documents. Get in touch with these people if you need to.

       you don't think maybe that's because I'm way more rude in all of the other comments?
      </p>
      <p>
       and really, if I'm gaming reddit why the hell would I only upvote one post. It seems more like people appreciate the context I'm bringing in that post, as opposed to my rude ad hominem attacks in the other. But that's just my take on how my posts tend to get voted - feel free to use reddit investigator to figure out the same damn thing

       SCOTUS is not "hearing" this case on Friday. They're determining whether to grant certiorari, which is basically just determining
       <em>
        whether
       </em>
       to hear the case. They almost certainly will not grant cert, since it's already been denied by Justice Kennedy, and this is a re-submission.
       <a href="http://www.obamaconspiracy.org/2013/01/orly-taitz-and-the-supremes/">
        This post
       </a>
       breaks down how run-of-the mill this is, as it's just a way to swiftly deal with shit suits so they're not constantly re-submitted until denied by a majority. Note the pre-inauguration prediction that Roberts would not administer the oath of office, which turned out not to be the case.

       So what you're telling me is that not only did Obama's entire family conspire for over fifty years make him appear a natural-born citizen with a social security number, but the entire Social Security administration overlooked an obvious error that should've shown up as a basic conflict in their database to get this one specific guy into an office he otherwise wouldn't have held. Here's my question: why would anyone do this?
      </p>
      <p>
       ETA: And what would his not having a SS# prove, exactly? That he's not a citizen? Because that's not true - non-citizens can get SS#s. And, even if he were born in Kenya or elsewhere,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_nationality_law#Birth_abroad_to_one_United_States_citizen">
        since his mother meets these criteria
       </a>
       , Obama would also be a citizen.

       Your arguments are not very impressive.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Social security fraud at the very least. Disclosure of which would have prevented him from standing for office.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for your irrelevant link about US nationality, it clearly states that it only applies to
       <strong>
        "a person born on or after November 14, 1986..."
       </strong>
       whereas Barack Obama claims he was born in 1961.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest that you inform yourself about the law as it stood in 1961, in particular about the fact that Obama's mother, Ann Dunham was only 18 at the the time she gave birth, and had therefore not fulfilled the 5 year US residency requirement (beyond her 14th birthday) that would have enabled her to pass on her US citizenship to Barack Obama as of right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't claim any knowledge of where Obama was born. However, for the reasons listed above, it is a legal fact that if he was not born in the US (ie Hawaii, as he claims), he cannot be a natural born American. That's why his birth place matters.

       how is it a discration if we found a chink in the armor?
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama didnt do this alone if true, he had the complete support of his party and those that pick who we get to choose from for our empty votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isnt about him, as much as it IS about the entire corrupt system that would support this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine he is approached and asked to run for president and he says "well, i was actually born abroad", and he's told "oh dont worry about that, a piece of paper is nothing." and it isnt.

       It is great that this is an actual thing.  I personally have no problem with people not being from america because there are so many other things that Barack is doing an awful job at, however, that is not the law.  And if he broke the law to get into office I would love to see him removed before he rapes this place any worse.

       Almost as brilliant as yours. ”Man makes claim about where he is born but refuses to provide proof. Therefore I have to believe him”
Don't be an ass. My claim rhat I don't know its perfectly valid given his record of lying.

       Yeah I've heard. A big deal was made out of sealing his official certificate. I do not know why. My point is not that he was born outside of the US, my point is that anyone who claims without proof that they know  he was born outside of the US, is the same as someone who claims without proof that they know he was born in the US. One side does not get to disparage the other.
In the end, it must be taken on faith. Personally, I'm not big on faith. I simply do not KNOW. I can tell you what I BELIEVE. But, what good if that?

       Hey guys, you Americans are cute....Obama has done waaaay more shit worthy of taking him and his administration to court...but this is another waste of time. seriously, cases like this deflect attention from Real shit he is doing. Where were these folks when the NDAA shit was going down? they could have backed up that legit Civil suit. Obama won the election because Americans voted for him, you can"t change that. Now is he fucking you over? Yes. What are you guys gonna do about that?

       Votes are the best way to make the sheeple feel like they are part of the process. And a proper shadow government must always make sure that the puppet looks like he is from the people. This is a very important criteria in shadowing.

       Orly? I read her argument... it is so flawed and full of misconceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mailing address on his
       <del>
        birth certificate
       </del>
       Social Security application was supposed to be zip code 96814 and whoever typed it up put 06814. 0 and 9 are best friends on the keyboard.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the basis for her argument. Even though the mailing address for the birth certificate does not mean a damned thing lol
      </p>

       Edit: mistyped zipcodes because it's that easy

       Edit 2: social security not birth certificate

       The typewriters I have seen from the 60's do not have zero next to nine. They have a key in the middle meaning it wasn't a slip of a finger. That's even assuming they had brand new typewriters. The old ones don't have zero at all.

       2 things.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) I just googled 1960 typewriters and every single one I saw had 9 and 0 next to each other. odd, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) You're right about birth certificates. I made a mistake, it was his
       <strong>
        social security
       </strong>
       which he applied for to start working in 1977.

       seems odd that this is being petitioned to the SCOTUS anyway.  SCOTUS is not a fact finding body.  what are they to do here, determine if the SS number if fraudulent?  This is something they don't do.

       A lower court needs to have found for the plaintiffs for this to be heard by SCOTUS.

       No news until Tuesday, apparently. Every other legal case against Obama has been snuffed out for trumped-up procedural reasons, so this one is more than likely to go the same way.

      <p>
       I just felt it was important for people to know that the US President is using somebody else's SSN. This is a FACT, irrespective of whether the SCOTUS (or diehard Obama fanboiz like your very good self) are prepared to look into it.

       So why are you so dead set against Obama's social security "anomaly" being examined by the courts? Not a rhetorical question, I'm genuinely interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since I've asked the question, I'll explain my motivation. Although not a US voter, I have an academic background international politics and constitutional affairs. I think the US Constitution is a fascinating but creaky document in need of updating in several areas, including the  anachronistic requirement that a US President be a "natural born" citizen. However, until/unless that phraseology is amended, it must apply without exception.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my judgment, Barack Obama's evasive, obfuscatory and frankly incomprehensible actions in fighting all requests for sight of documentation that would confirm his legitimacy, suggested to me that he had something to hide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posting a clearly doctored PDF on the White House website which purported to be his "long form birth certificate" convinced me beyond all doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, since the courts have repeatedly demonstrated they aren't going to touch the birth certificate issue, the (equally serious) SSN issue becomes a useful proxy in the quest for a judicial pronouncement on Obama's constitutional legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I want to see how this plays out constitutionally, and at the same time, I will admit to wanting to see Obama exposed as the compulsive liar that I believe him to be.

       I find it odd that only a fringe group keeps asking this question ad naseum when all other parties seem content with the documentation provided.  Especially given that the GOP have every reason to want this to be true and to get rid of Obama.  So why don't they pursue this if his citizenship is so obviously provably false? Why not impeach him on these grounds?  It's not as if the GOP hasn't impeached for less.

       I am not part of a group. There are many other people who are pursuing this (for a variety of reasons, including tea-party idiots) but I have never met or discussed this issue with any of them. There aren't any Tea Party people in the UK.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GOP are bought and paid for by the same interests that control Barack Obama. They are happy that some of the most oppressive executive orders and anti-constitutional legislation (NDAA 12/13) is being introduced by a silver-tongued Democratic President. Someone like Romney or Bush would not have got away with it, would they - America's "intellectual" class would have violently opposed it.

       Yet, Obama can do it and they (you?) are as meek as lambs.

       If you actually searched his SSN you'd see this article

       isn't even true about it being owned to someone else. All the evidence that the site uses you can search yourself even if for some reason the amount of evidence used by snopes isn't enough.

       Snopes wasn't trying to debunk the blog(who didn't even bother to use a name) it was debunking other blogs that haven been using names like they gave for example. The name is irrelevant if you can't even find a record pointing to someone who isn't Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like a good conspiracy like anyone else but it's hard to argue a site that sources facts to a blog that doesn't even provide Obama's SSN so you can do your own research.

       Could someone please explain this to me like I'm an idiot that can read but doesn't want to open twenty tabs to gather all the facts?
The Snopes article seems to deal with a different claim with a different name than the claim in the OP.
And I see there's a People Search link connecting the the first five numbers of Obama and someones else that has the same name as the claim in the OP but that is just the first five numbers, you share the first five numbers with 10,000 other people.
Is there a more solid conection between this number and someone else?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the 042 part, from the links I gather this is a Coneticut mailing address that the card was sent to?
Doesn't have anything to do with where you were born or where you lived but where you had the card mailed to?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was a mistake then there's a good story about how his card got mailed to CT and he got it back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he didn't get a SS card until he went to Columbia and had it mailed to a friend or relative?
Maybe he asked for a new number when he was there?

       The Snopes article is way off the mark, it's just disinfo, frankly.

       Another poster submitted
       <a href="http://theobamahustle.wordpress.com/2013/01/23/breaking-news-obama-caught-using-stolen-social-security-number/">
        this link
       </a>
       which gives plenty of details about the full SSN 042-68-4425 used by Obama. This number was actually allocated to an individual called Harrison J. Bounel. Furthermore, it appears that no SSN was ever allocated to anyone called Barack Hussein Obama.

       If there was a real difference, why didnt Gore and Kerry fight the voter fraud instead of rolling over because 'its best for the country". They dont care what is best of the country in any thing else.

       It seems like a few people in this thread are mixed up. Sabremesh's original post is correct that the case is to be discussed in conference on Friday by the US Supreme Court. That does not mean that there's a hearing. Conference is a closed time where only the 9 justices meet to discuss and vote on cases that have been heard that week in oral argument(if any), and to discuss and vote on petitions to hear certain cases(which is what is happening with this case right now). The court gets about 10,000 petitions a year from which the Chief Justice makes a list of cases with merit to discuss further. Any of the other 8 justices can also add cases to the list if they want. At the conference they'll discuss the case and if at least 4 justices vote to hear it then it'll be added to the calendar for oral argument. Out of those 10,000 petitions they get each year they only select about 80-100 for oral argument but being discussed at conference means you're at least on the short list.

       It's not going to be discussed.  This is how they usually kill a crackpot petition that's been denied by one judge, but then gets refiled immediately.  Instead of having the cranks refile over and over again until they run out of judges, they just bounce it over to the next conference, ignore it, and it'll then be automatically denied.

       It would be more interesting if you could attempt some sort of REBUTTAL to the evidence that Obama has been using somebody else's SSN.

       Get real. How are YOU proposing to fight his policies? You are not, are you, because you've given up the fight already. Instead you have turned your anger on those who are still trying to do something about it. Stockholm syndrome, much?

       A simple thought experiment to you. If I was the Criminal Mastermind Overlord,so you know what I would consider the individual crooks who work for me? EXPENDABLE.
      </p>
      <p>
       The battle has always been one of perspective and information,the individual politicians are useless,the president is also useless as a target.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is another thought experiment. If I were a super assassin ninja able to kill anyone,who would I target? the mass media, the brainwashing from them is the only thing that keeps the system in place. Although it would have a big enough potential to backfire it would be the only way to ensure enough chaos to destabilize the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm not hearing anything about Bill O'Reily birth certificate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is all about perspective,the amount of consciousness you can shift until you reach critical mass and the whole system breaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why they are desperate,that is why they want full fascism as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with every step they take so is the consciousness shifted to our side by there actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The presidency validity is meaningless,the birth certificate was already in there favor.

       If you actually searched his SSN you'd see this article

       isn't even true about it being owned to someone else. All the evidence that the site uses you can search yourself even if for some reason the amount of evidence used by snopes isn't enough.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Incidentally, the Snopes "debunking" contains some flagrant factual inaccuracies, not least the name of the person who was originally given the SSN that Obama has been using.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Snopes wasn't trying to debunk the blog(who didn't even bother to use a name) it was debunking other blogs that haven been using names like they gave for example. The name is irrelevant if you can't even find a record pointing to someone who isn't Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like a good conspiracy like anyone else but it's hard to argue a site that sources facts to a blog that doesn't even provide Obama's SSN so you can do your own research.
