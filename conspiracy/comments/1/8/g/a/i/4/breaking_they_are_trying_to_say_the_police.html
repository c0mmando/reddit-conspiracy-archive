    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people don&#39;t seem to know what a &quot;burner&quot; is.  A burner is an incendiary tear gas canister that is specifically made to start a fire.  These were used in Waco on the branch Davidians.  At the time the FBI claimed the cult member started the fire, but much later the FBI admitted to using incendiary tear gas canisters to burn the Davidians out of hiding.  It&#39;s the same tactic used on Dorner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely and unquestionably.  That&#39;s why the fire started right after they shot the tear gas canisters.

It involves plausible deniability.  Additionally, TPTB know that there would be too much public outcry if they used drones right now.  They&#39;re waiting on that.  That&#39;s how TPTB work.  They won&#39;t do something they know the public will be upset about.  They use FF attacks to trick the public and make them ask (beg) for shit they would have otherwise vilified and rejected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen the unedited video on some TV show where they confronted the
producer about it. It may have been 60 minutes, but it was around 1994
or 1995, and I haven&#39;t been able to find it on the web.</p>

<p>I did find the article, excerpted below, which confirms that it is not flame.</p>

<p>I think the government did some bad things at Waco, but a flame-throwing
tank was not among them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0178a.html">http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0178a.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most thought-provoking sequence in Waco: The Big Lie depicts an armored vehicle under FBI command ramming the Davidian compound. The tape&#39;s narrator states: &quot;The following footage proves beyond any doubt that the tanks intentionally set the house on fire. It proves that the Branch Davidians were murdered. You can see that this tank has a gas jet on the front that shoots fire. You can also see the fire quite plainly.&quot;</p>

<p>For many, this footage confirmed fears that the government deliberately torched the Davidians&#39; dwelling. Then Mike McNulty, chairman of a privately funded grassroots think-tank called the California Organization for Public Safety (COPS), obtained an uncut version of the original private film from which Thompson drew her footage.</p>

<p>McNulty forwarded the film to Machine Gun News columnist Ken Carter, who, in a February 1994 issue of the gun enthusiast periodical, described what Waco: The Big Lie didn&#39;t show: &quot;In the COPS version, rather than stopping the video at the point where the illusion of flame is most apparent, as in the AJF tape, the camera continues to follow the vehicle as it backs clear of the building....As [the] tank turns away from [the] camera, [the] reflection spreads to reveal what appears to be a large section of tan wallboard leaning against [the] turret.&quot;</p>

<p>Carter subsequently admitted: &quot;As certain as I previously was that the tank was spewing fire, I am now more convinced that what appeared to be flame was nothing more than an optical illusion created by reflector sunlight.&quot;</p>

<p>One month prior to the release of the Machine Gun News piece, Carter was interviewed for a January 21, 1994 Gun Week article entitled &quot;&#39;Waco: The Big Lie&#39; Revealed as Hoax.&quot; &quot;Linda Thompson suckered all of us with that one,&quot; Carter told Gun Week. &quot;And she had to have known exactly what she was doing, since the videotape sequence was edited a split second before the vehicle pulls back and executes a hard turn which clearly shows the &#39;flame&#39; image stabilize and turn out to be a piece of wallboard.&quot;</p>

<p>Even Soldier of Fortune magazine has spoken out against Waco: The Big Lie. A February 1994 feature article stated: &quot;What appears to be flames in the Thompson video is actually a visual trick....The apparent fire at the end of the CEV [tank] gas induction tube is actually wallboard and other construction debris knocked loose by the CS [gas] sprayer boom.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a friend in the military. Or rather was. He&#39;s informed me that there are two types of tear gas canisters. &quot;Burners&quot; which run hot after being deployed and ARE KNOWN to cause fires, and some other name (I forget) which run colder after being deployed.</p>

<p>The police had the choice and chose the ones they knew ran hot, IN A CARPETED CABIN. On the press conference I saw, they claimed they threw in cold canisters first, and when that didn&#39;t work they threw in burners, &quot;without the intention of setting the cabin on fire&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstand the use of &#39;pyrotechnic&#39; in this case. These canisters have a pyrotechnic expelling charge, and they do not burn very hot or for very long. They are most certainly not manufactured as intentional firestarters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you can argue that they aren&#39;t intentionally made to start a fire because pyrotechnic canisters are meant to be used outdoors.  Indoors they almost always start a fire. Because they do burn very hot and long enough to ignite anything flammable nearby. The police have non pyrotechnic tear gas canisters that they use indoors when they don&#39;t want to burn the place down.  When they choose to use these indoors it is because they want to start a fire.</p>

<p>We didn&#39;t have such a strong internet lobby back in 1993 when Waco went up in flames. We&#39;ve seen time and again that reddit and other social media sites can affect policy through exposure and pressure. Laying off the gas is not the answer. More like pedal to the metal.</p>

Then she called in sick and bumped her head until she and her cohorts could agree on which lie they were sticking with. Then she cried crocodile tears and feigned concern as she weathered a meaningless scolding that resulted in nothing. Her dismissal meant little to her and her pals other than giving them more time to get a head start on campaign plans for 2016. The bitch is fucking callous and evil.</p>

<p>[Updated at 9:14 p.m. ET] Earlier, we reported that U.S. Marshals Service district chief Kurt Ellingson told us a suspect tried to get out the back door of the cabin at some point today and was pushed back inside. But there are now conflicting reports about whether the suspect ever emerged.</p>

<p>&quot;The term &quot;burner&quot; had led to speculation that the fire had been started deliberately, but burner is thought to be police slang for tear gas, and may refer to &quot;BurnSafe&quot; containers for CS gas canisters, made by the Covina-Thomas Company in Covina, California. On its website the company lists among its recent customers the LAPD, although not the San Bernardo County sheriff&#39;s office, which led the raid.&quot; </p>

<p>The fire is just a coverup. This whole thing is a hoax to prove that even former cops can&#39;t be trusted with guns and neither are we. They are creating the fire videos to prove that this is like Waco, when in fact the fire and the building blowing out, which you will see the doors were which they said also on the tape were the result of a hellfire missle from the DHS drones. The fire and LAPD are the scapegoats for Obama&#39;s home drone war. Wake up sheeple. you are so gullible you&#39;ll accept the first conspiracy theory you see, even if it comes from the hand of those you claim to suspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an outsider I&#39;ve been watching this unravel. As was written plainly in Behold a Pale Horse, U.S. citizens will have their guns taken so they cannot fight back. The evidence of CIA involvment, past police officers and soldiers going on rampages, professional hitmen, psy-ops and drugged up shooters points to this being pre-planned. Boy was Obama quick to start rallying over gun control; lucky this culminated on the day of his annual speech. It was almost as aptly timed as Osama bin Laden&#39;s second death. Heh.</p>

<p>However, give people more credit regarding the planes. It&#39;s disinformation released to discredit the movement for transparency and truth. In reality it wouldn&#39;t even matter if the towers themselves were holograms; the important information lies in the money trail and all those stories that just don&#39;t add up. Anyone still arguing over semantics like that has missed the point. </p>

Who is to say that this isn&#39;t all a ploy by the LAPD, San Bernadino and the &quot;rogue&quot; officer himself to create a fear of those who can be trusted to own 34 legally registered guns? Burning the house down is a way to coverup his death when he&#39;s really cointelpro bringing about the destruction of our 2nd ammendment rights and generating sympathy for the police while they slowly gain powers over the common man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They haven&#39;t admitted that the fire was started intentionally, but the cabin owner confirmed it was empty.  I suppose it&#39;s possible that he could have kidnapped someone and held them hostage, but that wouldn&#39;t make much sense if someone is trying to lay low.  If a person is missing, chances are friends/family are gonna report it, which means greater chance of the kidnapper being found.  Also, it&#39;s possible they used infrared or some other fancy tech.  Either way, they were right.  Dorner&#39;s body was the only one recovered from the cabin.</p>

<p>It may be arguable that these are not made to specifically start fires, but they are normally deployed out of doors and when they are deployed indoors they usually start a fire because as the BBC article  states &quot;he acknowledged the pyrotechnic tear gas canisters &quot;generate a lot of heat&quot;.&quot;  - yes, because they are burning.  There are non-pyrotechnic tear gas canisters that are normally deployed indoors when they don&#39;t want to burn the place down.</p>
