       Tom Fuentes, FBI asst. director (I think it was?) on TV now doing his best to discount the police-scanner audio of them burning Dorner's cabin. He's claiming it's a fake, and also if it wasn't a fake then it's a panicy officer making a mistake.

       incase anyone wasn't aware of what we're talking about. UK news picked it up, I wonder if American news will at all.

       A lot of people don't seem to know what a "burner" is.  A burner is an incendiary tear gas canister that is specifically made to start a fire.  These were used in Waco on the branch Davidians.  At the time the FBI claimed the cult member started the fire, but much later the FBI admitted to using incendiary tear gas canisters to burn the Davidians out of hiding.  It's the same tactic used on Dorner.

       so then, although most people may not have know exactly what it is, we all had the right idea that it is used to start a fire.

       Absolutely and unquestionably.  That's why the fire started right after they shot the tear gas canisters.  People reporting on the police scanner activity said they used the phrase "burners deployed".  It is without a doubt that the police intentionally started the fire.

       Another aspect of this is, that is someone's personal property. You can't just bomb someone's house because you feel like it.

       Yes, and plus now they can claim that Dorner started the fire himself.  It gives them plausible deniability.

       why they didn't/couldn't just use drones.  It involves plausible deniability.  Additionally, TPTB know that there would be too much public outcry if they used drones right now.  They're waiting on that.  That's how TPTB work.  They won't do something they know the public will be upset about.  They use FF attacks to trick the public and make them ask (beg) for shit they would have otherwise vilified and rejected.

       I've seen the unedited video on some TV show where they confronted the
producer about it. It may have been 60 minutes, but it was around 1994
or 1995, and I haven't been able to find it on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did find the article, excerpted below, which confirms that it is not flame.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the government did some bad things at Waco, but a flame-throwing
tank was not among them.
      </p>

       <a href="http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0178a.html">
        http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0178a.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The most thought-provoking sequence in Waco: The Big Lie depicts an armored vehicle under FBI command ramming the Davidian compound. The tape's narrator states: "The following footage proves beyond any doubt that the tanks intentionally set the house on fire. It proves that the Branch Davidians were murdered. You can see that this tank has a gas jet on the front that shoots fire. You can also see the fire quite plainly."
       </p>
       <p>
        For many, this footage confirmed fears that the government deliberately torched the Davidians' dwelling. Then Mike McNulty, chairman of a privately funded grassroots think-tank called the California Organization for Public Safety (COPS), obtained an uncut version of the original private film from which Thompson drew her footage.
       </p>
       <p>
        McNulty forwarded the film to Machine Gun News columnist Ken Carter, who, in a February 1994 issue of the gun enthusiast periodical, described what Waco: The Big Lie didn't show: "In the COPS version, rather than stopping the video at the point where the illusion of flame is most apparent, as in the AJF tape, the camera continues to follow the vehicle as it backs clear of the building....As [the] tank turns away from [the] camera, [the] reflection spreads to reveal what appears to be a large section of tan wallboard leaning against [the] turret."
       </p>
       <p>
        Carter subsequently admitted: "As certain as I previously was that the tank was spewing fire, I am now more convinced that what appeared to be flame was nothing more than an optical illusion created by reflector sunlight."
       </p>
       <p>
        One month prior to the release of the Machine Gun News piece, Carter was interviewed for a January 21, 1994 Gun Week article entitled "'Waco: The Big Lie' Revealed as Hoax." "Linda Thompson suckered all of us with that one," Carter told Gun Week. "And she had to have known exactly what she was doing, since the videotape sequence was edited a split second before the vehicle pulls back and executes a hard turn which clearly shows the 'flame' image stabilize and turn out to be a piece of wallboard."
       </p>
       <p>
        Even Soldier of Fortune magazine has spoken out against Waco: The Big Lie. A February 1994 feature article stated: "What appears to be flames in the Thompson video is actually a visual trick....The apparent fire at the end of the CEV [tank] gas induction tube is actually wallboard and other construction debris knocked loose by the CS [gas] sprayer boom."

       I have a friend in the military. Or rather was. He's informed me that there are two types of tear gas canisters. "Burners" which run hot after being deployed and ARE KNOWN to cause fires, and some other name (I forget) which run colder after being deployed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police had the choice and chose the ones they knew ran hot, IN A CARPETED CABIN. On the press conference I saw, they claimed they threw in cold canisters first, and when that didn't work they threw in burners, "without the intention of setting the cabin on fire".

       a bit from a reporter describing what a Modesto, CA officer said about a similar situation about burners:

       <p>
        He said there are two types of tear gas cannisters police use. One is an incendiary cannister called a "burner," which can start a fire, Adams said. The department doesn't deploy burners; it only uses nonincendiary cannisters.

      </p>
      <p>
       It may be arguable that these are not made to specifically start fires, but they are normally deployed out of doors and when they are deployed indoors they usually start a fire because as the BBC article  states "he acknowledged the pyrotechnic tear gas canisters "generate a lot of heat"."  - yes, because they are burning.  There are non-pyrotechnic tear gas canisters that are normally deployed indoors when they don't want to burn the place down.

       I think you misunderstand the use of 'pyrotechnic' in this case. These canisters have a pyrotechnic expelling charge, and they do not burn very hot or for very long. They are most certainly not manufactured as intentional firestarters.

       Yes, you can argue that they aren't intentionally made to start a fire because pyrotechnic canisters are meant to be used outdoors.  Indoors they almost always start a fire. Because they do burn very hot and long enough to ignite anything flammable nearby. The police have non pyrotechnic tear gas canisters that they use indoors when they don't want to burn the place down.  When they choose to use these indoors it is because they want to start a fire.

       They're panicking. This story is all over dozens of subreddits and in the comments on dozens of news websites. Hundreds of thousands of people have already seen this,
       <strong>

       you to do the same.

       We have the opportunity to embarrass and expose the california PD as lying thugs and more importantly
       <strong>
        get people to start asking questions for once

       Why lead off with a remark that dissuades people from trying? If it takes 100,000 internet rabble rousers to force the media to address something, so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We didn't have such a strong internet lobby back in 1993 when Waco went up in flames. We've seen time and again that reddit and other social media sites can affect policy through exposure and pressure. Laying off the gas is not the answer. More like pedal to the metal.

       Hillary swept the death of Americans under the rug. She and her cronies lied to protect their political interests heading into the election. Then she called in sick and bumped her head until she and her cohorts could agree on which lie they were sticking with. Then she cried crocodile tears and feigned concern as she weathered a meaningless scolding that resulted in nothing. Her dismissal meant little to her and her pals other than giving them more time to get a head start on campaign plans for 2016. The bitch is fucking callous and evil.

       I'm with ya. "They" could give a fuck less about what "we" think, know, think we know or even suspect. On the other hand: fuck 'em. If you try you're at least doing something. If you're here you obviously have little need or use of "culture" (like bacteria, get it?) so you might as well do something with your time if you're not going to just zen out and find a different perspective on life. All this drama, all this violence: Fuck 'em.

       I'm not saying that you should pull the wool back over your eyes. Either worry about everything (external forces) or do something that makes you happy while you can. Either way: Yer fucked.

       a cop supposedly who was off the force who still has his badge, two wallets, and a burnt out truck. Oh and then he hauls tons of weapons and ammo in the snow and takes two hostages in a cabin..gets caught... steals a truck... moves all that ammo while having a gun fight and then offs himself because of a bulldozer. Am I missing anything?

       This whole thing is absolutely ridiculous and most people aren't buying it. But don't get lured in to the idea that we should federalize local police forces because that is where I fear we are heading and rather quickly. Remember Obama did say he wanted a domestic force as large as an army.. Cop's are already that force but they are entirely untapped so far. Soon enough though...mark my words.

       According to the law a person is not required to use the exact same amount of lethal force as the person attempting to kill them with lethal force. Are you a gentleman dueler from 1845 or what? Plus, the police have more rights in this situation under the law than a civilian does, right or wrong.

       According to the law, there is a limit on the amount of force you are authorized to use, even when defending yourself.  It's the same way in the military, but they have a shorter escalation of force than the cops (should) have.  Someone being shot at has the right to return fire, but when a suspect is holed up and trapped, you don't yell for a person to surrender while you're firing incendiary tear gas grenades and call it justified.

       I have tried to find the words to express the rage I feel over the lies they feed us. Here again they lie, without even trying very hard and expect us to just take it. I honestly don't know what to say, the thought that they can just say a live police scanner broadcast on television is fake or that what the cops was saying was the result of panic or a mistake and have people believe it is staggering. I heard them saying to burn it over and over, I have heard that tone of voice before I recognize and understand it, there was no panic in those voices, there was excitement, there was blood lust.

       Everybody will buy this story, too. What a shame. Words can be twisted any which way when big money tells the media which stories to report and which truths to bury. It’s incredibly frustrating when the evidence, or rather the inconsistencies, are endless. Your best friends and parents think you’re crazy for even trying to question the bullshit the people are spoon fed by the media. We are truly helpless.

       Let's go a step further and start a campaign to spread this information. Let's mass post on Facebook, Twitter etc so more people will start questioning the official story. Show how these tactics were used before with Waco, show how the gun fight was fabricated, show how those recordings came from police scanners.

       Once again we will witness reality in a major event and few days later we will be told that it happened completely different. tomorrow the Troll debunkers of the FBI will descend on the Internet with their version as truth, and all this will become a conspiracy.

       Next time, you won't have the benefit of recording the audio because the feed will be cut.  They just didn't get to it in time in this case.

       To me there is no mistaking what they said. Like others have stated in this thread...thousands of people heard it live on the scanners. Not only did we hear it live but I'm sure plenty of us among those thousands were constantly F5ing one of a probably a few threads that were going here on reddit where people were giving updates on what was heard on the scanners. I know the one I was F5ing was spammed with posts of several people hearing the exact same thing.

        [Updated at 9:14 p.m. ET] Earlier, we reported that U.S. Marshals Service district chief Kurt Ellingson told us a suspect tried to get out the back door of the cabin at some point today and was pushed back inside. But there are now conflicting reports about whether the suspect ever emerged.

       Maybe not the towers but I responded to someone still questioning if a plane hit the Pentagon just yesterday. I was on the road with hundreds of others in rush hour traffic that saw the whole thing. However, apparently I and every one on the road are called anecdotal evidence and/or government misinformation agents. I have been waiting on my government misinformation agent paycheck since 9/11/01. Nothing.

       Everybody heard it, no question about what was said. The videos aren't fake, the LAPD was on the radio and there officers said what they said. This time there is a massive amount of evidence to support this and the only way this can be played down is the media bullshitting people.

       Anyone can fake a video with audio over it. It happens all the time. usually police procedures are not to release any evidence even their tracking of a suspect till the investigation is closed and apprehended. This came from above, and is a shill scam if I ever saw one. Saying "I heard it" doesn't mean it's not a fake. Lots of people heard Orsen Welles' "War of the Worlds" but it was still fake. Wake up sheeple. you've been had.

       The fire is just a coverup. This whole thing is a hoax to prove that even former cops can't be trusted with guns and neither are we. They are creating the fire videos to prove that this is like Waco, when in fact the fire and the building blowing out, which you will see the doors were which they said also on the tape were the result of a hellfire missle from the DHS drones. The fire and LAPD are the scapegoats for Obama's home drone war. Wake up sheeple. you are so gullible you'll accept the first conspiracy theory you see, even if it comes from the hand of those you claim to suspect.

       As an outsider I've been watching this unravel. As was written plainly in Behold a Pale Horse, U.S. citizens will have their guns taken so they cannot fight back. The evidence of CIA involvment, past police officers and soldiers going on rampages, professional hitmen, psy-ops and drugged up shooters points to this being pre-planned. Boy was Obama quick to start rallying over gun control; lucky this culminated on the day of his annual speech. It was almost as aptly timed as Osama bin Laden's second death. Heh.

       However, give people more credit regarding the planes. It's disinformation released to discredit the movement for transparency and truth. In reality it wouldn't even matter if the towers themselves were holograms; the important information lies in the money trail and all those stories that just don't add up. Anyone still arguing over semantics like that has missed the point.

       You still have not addressed the fact that eye witnesses are very unreliable and claiming you heard/saw something can be polluted by disinformation spread. Who is to say that this isn't all a ploy by the LAPD, San Bernadino and the "rogue" officer himself to create a fear of those who can be trusted to own 34 legally registered guns? Burning the house down is a way to coverup his death when he's really cointelpro bringing about the destruction of our 2nd ammendment rights and generating sympathy for the police while they slowly gain powers over the common man.

       so I did some research.. apparently cops can use whatever strategy is necessary to neutralize a threat when lives are on the line.  This includes burning down a cabin.  (they also confirmed that nobody else was in the cabin before burning it down) so guess you can all stop bitching about Dorner now.. everything the police did was legal, case closed.

       They haven't admitted that the fire was started intentionally, but the cabin owner confirmed it was empty.  I suppose it's possible that he could have kidnapped someone and held them hostage, but that wouldn't make much sense if someone is trying to lay low.  If a person is missing, chances are friends/family are gonna report it, which means greater chance of the kidnapper being found.  Also, it's possible they used infrared or some other fancy tech.  Either way, they were right.  Dorner's body was the only one recovered from the cabin.

       Do you really think it matters?  This is nothing new, and the news media isn't going to hold them to task.

       OK, this BBC article
       <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21454483">
        http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21454483
       </a>
       the police say "The pyrotechnic-type canisters are commonly referred to as burners."
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be arguable that these are not made to specifically start fires, but they are normally deployed out of doors and when they are deployed indoors they usually start a fire because as the BBC article  states "he acknowledged the pyrotechnic tear gas canisters "generate a lot of heat"."  - yes, because they are burning.  There are non-pyrotechnic tear gas canisters that are normally deployed indoors when they don't want to burn the place down.

       The police quote from this is "The pyrotechnic-type canisters are commonly referred to as burners."
      </p>
      <p>
       There are non-pyrotechnic gas canisters that are normally used indoors.  This military type is normally used for outdoors only (unless you want to start a fire)
