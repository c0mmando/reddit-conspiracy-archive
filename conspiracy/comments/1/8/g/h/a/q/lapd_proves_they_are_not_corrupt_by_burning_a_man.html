       LAPD proves they are not corrupt by burning a man alive?  Don't you think they could have recovered their dignity in this situation by acting according to law and put Droner through the appropriate conduits?  Don't you think they should have set an example and had the dignity to try to capture him the right way instead of burning him at the stake?  I don't support dorner's murderous rampage and think he handled it the wrong way, so I think the police should have done this right.

       agreed - it's hard to discredit Dorner's complaints about the LAPD acting as if they are above the law when they dramatically proved him right every day of the manhunt.

       Oh, yes... Throw the race card in. He's a fuckin mass murderer. Most.. Well, the over whelming majority, see a guy who MURDERED 4 innocent people. But who cares about them... What matters is the murdering piece of shit and his "treatment." Right...

       Hey, remember how you're not supposed to call people guilty until it's been proven, and not just alleged?
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, some of us still want to live in a society where people don't just going around burning people alive and then making up excuses for it.

       Wow... We have way too many people like you in this country. He murdered 4 people, was on camera, and posted on the web he planned on murdering more. Too bad it wasn't you and your family he threatened... You wouldn't have asked for protection from law enforcement, right?

       Was he on camera murdering someone?  That's the only thing that would even
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       hold up as evidence in all of what you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you present evidence, it has to actually stand up to scrutiny.  That's supposedly why we have trials to begin with - both sides can present evidence, and it's up to the other side to demonstrate problems with that evidence.  Then the jury makes decisions about guilt based on that, and the judge makes a sentencing decision.  The police in this case skipped that entire process, and apparently just burnt him alive - something that's not supposed to happen in this country at all.

       No, what matters is bringing the guy and showing Americans that they can be harsh and punish him within the law. But they didn't want to, and there was no sign that they intended to. He deserved a trial and imprisonment if found guilty, not an execution by flames.

       You must think it's perfectly fine that police officers get to ruin peoples lives on a whim, with no repercussions. As soon as someone decides to do something about it, then you have a problem. The hypocrisy is pretty blatant.

       It's funny to me that the same people clamoring for transparency and truth use this kind of rhetoric. Let's break down what you really just said.

      <blockquote>

       Implying that I think unchecked police corruption is a good thing. No, I don't. There obviously is problem with this and I'm sure a lot of instances go unpunished and this needs to improve.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "As soon as someone decides to do something about it, then you have a problem."

      <p>
       As soon as someone decides to do
       <strong>
        something
       </strong>
       . An interesting word choice to minimize the significance of murdering people. Do I have a problem when people do something about it? No. It's not a justification for murder, though.

       Not sure what you envision would bring about any sort of change?  Same old, same old?  Like that gets anyone anywhere?  Sorry to break it to you, but the only way to begin the discussion of taking some of the power and anonymity away from the Police State will be a violent revolution.  Not some civil disobedient bullshit, just so they can use their weapons to beat us down once again and condition the collective public to look the other way and soon forget about it...

       Go back to your hypocritical bunker. So the police "murdered" this guy according to your standards, which is completely unacceptable, but the fact that he murdered people is morally justifiable since it fit some personal code of his (based on actions yet to be confirmed nor denied) that you happen to fall in line with? Seems legit. So whenever someone has a legitimate gripe they should kill people to bring attention to it and when they are gunned down in the process of their spree they should be regarded as a martyr for the cause.

       Wow, violence gets things to the forefront. Surprise. That doesn't mean it's the only method to do so - especially in this age of technology - and to suggest that is short sighted and ignorant.

       During the manhunt the cops shot three people who don't even remotely look like the guy but were guilty of driving trucks that were somewhat similar.  Nutball or not, Dorner accused the LAPD of sloppy police work and not taking the lives or rights of citizens seriously, and these were perfect examples of each.  He also accused officers of acting as if they are above the law.  If they indeed decided to burn him alive rather than take him into custody then they proved him right again.

       Science and religion - especially as they are so remedially understood by the puny human mind on this planet - are but two very tiny, very soluble grains of sand lying on the universe's beach of eternal truths.

       The big ones happen about every 150 years; it's been 163 years since the last one. The next one will be compounded by the long-term interruption of the delivery of goods and services; it will be hell on earth for the survivors, even with proper aid mobilization from other states. WebBot says something huge going down in the Pacific during April or May. Opportunity to immigrate to Oregon in March came up yesterday; it may not save me, but I'm going for it anyway.

       Burn man alive.
Destroy all evidence.
Never checked to see if there was a hostage before burning it all down. 
If there was it will be covered up, unless we stop that from happening.

       He should be in prison, not dead. I don't believe Dorner was innocent of the murders, but he was and is still only a suspect and innocent by law. He was supposed to be judged by a group of his peers before getting executed, and this is why I am pissed about this. This is evidence of police being able to execute without trial, and we have had evidence of police framing people. What this now gives us is the possibility of police framing people to execute them without trial (not that it wasn't possible before, but it's actually accepted by the people now).

       There should be a better balance. Police officers should know that they risk their lives for justice, they don't risk their lives for themselves. It isn't even close to your statement when the police just shoot at "similar" cars without IDing the "suspect" first.

       When did I defend the action of the police officers that shot up the random car? The actions of those police officers that shot the wrong car were indefensible and they deserve to be punished. Don't think I'm advocating a shoot first and ask questions later policy. It's not right to compare the two scenarios because they aren't similar in the slightest.

       A police officer shouldn't be obliged to lay their life down just so an accused murderer who refuses to surrender and still poses a very obvious threat to human life can be brought in alive to face a jury.

       I agree with that OP is saying, but please take note that the LAPD has little involvement in this affair. There were federal agents standing by, and the San Bernadino County Sherrifs lead this operation, because Big Bear is in their jurisdiction. The LAPD was working STRICTLY in cooperation with FEDERAL agents and the SB Sheriffs. This was done to ensure that they can receive 0 pushback from the public for this affair, and to ensure that they will receive 0 charges on counts of corruption.

       This was the chance of a lifetime for the LAPD. They could show the entire world that they could follow the letter and spirit of the law. I really can't think of an opportunity that could have provided some much positive PR than capturing Dorner alive or at least trying to with maximum effort.

       Technically, it was San Bernardino's Sherriff's Department who burned up all the evidence.  LAPD was stuck at the airport awaiting approval from SBSD for assistance.  Not sure that ever came.  But still, corruption runs amok!

       What this guy did was he gave in to the criminals. Their motivations are clear, this man was brought to the level of a criminal, and so reacted by behaving like a criminal. At that point they won. What TPTB want is to criminalize anyone at command, then they will be dealt with, just like Droner.

       Just a note about "burned alive". If you listen to the scanner audio, before the "burners are deployed", they make mention of opening up a hole in the 1,2 wall. They also mention blood splatter in a corner. My theory is that they got him, then went in with the bunker buster or something and made holes to look around and saw that there may be booby traps and decided to burn it all down to be safe assuming Dorner set explosives to cause as much carnage as possible.

       i can't believe people are posting they're shocked about the LAPDs actions. i've learned from stupid shit TV shows that law offices can be corrupt. and that's tv. it's way worse in real life. things you see on tv probably don't scratch the surface of the messed up stuff that goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean put yourself in a responding officers shoes, this guy just killed one of your friends you work with, he's shot other people you know and now he's shooting at you. it's no surprise to me they burned that building to the ground. And who are we to say it wasn't the right way? is it right to take him to court? have people relive the devastation and horror he caused, have to look him face to face and testify against him? you think he would he seriously have a fair trial? a black man pegged as a cop killer i doubt would get a fair trial. i'd like to be proved wrong but i don't see that happening

       so what were they supposed to do genius? keep engaging in deadly shoot outs and risk more people being killed? you have to remember dorner was an expert marksman. those cops i bet are no where on his level. so how else do you get this guy out of the house, when he is surrounded? light that shit on fire. he can come out and get apprehended or wait inside and see whats going to happen. seriously though, what is the correct way of capturing someone holed up in a house? especially when they have deadly force and the means to carry it out? it is not a conspiracy it is simple logic. 99% of people would've rushed out of that house. he's crazy and on a murderous rampage.

       Get the apc to break the wall since it wont be penetrated by small arms. Have snipers in the woods just in case dorner gets an opportunity to do something crazy. Have everyone wearing mandible protectors on kevlar. Send in team to clear entry point, if booby trapped the apc could most likely take it out and withstand any side effects(suck for the driver) even before entry team goes in. Once in clear room have second team come up surrounding and putting in blocking positions paying close attention to exit points (doors, windows). Have third team come in and clear next room, effectively leap frogging every room. Have apc ready to take down any room. Once target is located. Flashbang the fuck out of the room along with a coordinated assault from the non lethal weapon system that shoots audiowaves with immense power to dissorient target(big cities have these in their arsenal, lapd couldve provided one.) Take target down if he wont surrender but then you have positive I.d. on target at least. But I mean burning the motherfucker is way easier

       Are you freakin kidding me?? Wow!! He murdered 3 innocent people and then while being pursued, he opens fire and kills ANOTHER! I honestly cannot believe someone made a post criticizing the law enforcement for this. I'm literally flabbergasted. People like you are what's wrong with this country and others like it. How on earth do you sit @ your computer or phone and say a mass murderer that's on the loose should have a "right" way of being caught or apprehended or killed? Fuck you... Seriously. You're as mentally fucked up as this dude was.

       For a moment here lets pretend. Suppose one day that you commit a crime (or maybe you don't). Would you expect to be apprehended and proven guilty by the court system, or cornered in a house, forced to stay in the house (You'll remember he tried leaving the house, but they immediately starting firing at him, forcing him back into the house) then after they have you trapped, they set the cabin on fire and watch you burn to death.

       First off, go listen to the scanner recordings of what happened. I don't have time to waste right now finding the link, but I assure you it's not too hard to find. 
Exaggeration? Hardly. If you wanna believe that they had no choice but to set the house on fire and kill him; rather than take him alive, then you either have no knowledge of what tactics and weapons they had at their disposal, or are blatantly disregarding their other options.

       No, no, no, see what is wrong with this country is people like you who think its alright to burn a man alive. No trial, no jury, no due process. For fucks sakes the man had a million dollar bounty on his head and the largest man hunt in American history. How does that not sound like a man who knew too much/ broke the blue line. Either way you are sounding like cops lives and families are worth more then the average citizen.

       Yes, size of manhunt = amount of knowledge you have. Or it could be because he already had murdered people and released a manifesto declaring all out warfare on LAPD and their families. Maybe that one.

       The DC Sniper must have known some super secret stuff about the government because there was a massive manhunt for him(them), too.

       There are reports of 2 helicopters delivering 15 LAPD SWAT members into big bear. SB Sheriffs seemed upset about it.

       Oh, yes... Throw the race card in. He's a fuckin mass murderer. Most.. Well, the over whelming majority, see a guy who MURDERED 4 innocent people. But who cares about them... What matters is the murdering piece of shit and his "treatment." Right...

       During the manhunt the cops shot three people who don't even remotely look like the guy but were guilty of driving trucks that were somewhat similar.  Nutball or not, Dorner accused the LAPD of sloppy police work and not taking the lives or rights of citizens seriously, and these were perfect examples of each.  He also accused officers of acting as if they are above the law.  If they indeed decided to burn him alive rather than take him into custody then they proved him right again.

       Go back to your hypocritical bunker. So the police "murdered" this guy according to your standards, which is completely unacceptable, but the fact that he murdered people is morally justifiable since it fit some personal code of his (based on actions yet to be confirmed nor denied) that you happen to fall in line with? Seems legit. So whenever someone has a legitimate gripe they should kill people to bring attention to it and when they are gunned down in the process of their spree they should be regarded as a martyr for the cause.

       Wow, violence gets things to the forefront. Surprise. That doesn't mean it's the only method to do so - especially in this age of technology - and to suggest that is short sighted and ignorant.

       Let's go ahead and strip police of any power and say "Bring every suspect in alive! I don't give a hot fuck how many officers die in the process, but this man deserves his trial!"

       When did I defend the action of the police officers that shot up the random car? The actions of those police officers that shot the wrong car were indefensible and they deserve to be punished. Don't think I'm advocating a shoot first and ask questions later policy. It's not right to compare the two scenarios because they aren't similar in the slightest.
      </p>

       A police officer shouldn't be obliged to lay their life down just so an accused murderer who refuses to surrender and still poses a very obvious threat to human life can be brought in alive to face a jury.
