       Eh, I'm not so sure.  I was expecting it before the second term so that Mr. Obama could be a wartime President and be sure of re-election.  Now that that's over, my theory is that it'll be all talk and no action...

       Obama is actually worse because, while Bush came at you wielding a knife, Obama smiles and comes at your with an extended handshake...all the while holding the knife

       Intelligence DOES matter.  It is a weapon of sorts.  Intelligent people are well suited for doing a lot of good or a lot of bad, depending on what they are after.  At least a dumb person is generally less dangerous as they are not clever enough to convince people to follow them.  BO has done at least as much bad as bush, only people love him.  They are blindly obedient.  That is far worse than bush.  At least people hated him.

       Barack Obama has zero autonomy. He is controlled by an out-of-sight elite who selected him because he was weak, and because of certain skeletons in his closet. They own his usurping arse.
      </p>
      <p>
       So give the guy a break. He is trapped, and, like many others is genuinely frightened of what the elite can do to him and his family. It goes without saying he doesn't care about the rest of you.

       I was being semi-ironic. If you compare the platform of policies he campaigned on in 2008 and look where we are now, this looks like the greatest troll in the history of politics. He deserves our contempt for not fighting for what he campaigned on. However, I do think he actually believed he could make a difference.

       I may be wrong - he might be a sociopath with a will of iron and a genocidal masterplan, but at the moment I am inclined more towards the hapless stooge hypothesis.

       Maybe it is. Maybe they threatened his family, his reputation. Maybe they promised him wealth and power beyond his imagination - it is irrelevant. The puppet should not be hated, but pitied. Whoever pulls his strings is where you should direct your animosity.

       Because I am able to empathize? Because I am willing to offer redemption? You have an infinite array of human emotions at your disposal, but you utilize fear and hatred more readily than compassion? From my perspective, you're the delusional one. Find peace inside yourself, friend.

       i think most politicians go into the game with high hopes and big ideas. And then they find out the real deal and the higher you go, the more you are bribed, manipulated, blackmailed. It all just depends on the type of person you are to begin with. I like to think that I could hold out for  a long time but sooner or later, you are going to hit that wall where if you are immensely popular and the powers that be want to use that popularity to further their objectives and if you can't be bought then they let you know how easy it would be for them to kill you or your family if you don't want to co-operate. I'm sure Obama has been sitting at one of his daughter's soccer games, received a phone call and the voice on the other end let him know that they are watching his daughter play soccer through a sniper scope.

       I was researching his his childhood, his father, and mom, and there is a hint of the CIA with his pops...
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure there is more there - especially since our media did not really mention too much about Indonesia.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not the typical American upbringing...
      </p>
      <p>
       At the least, the guy had a very interesting childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my view, this guy was groomed for this position - he came out of nowhere into international prominence from being a "community activist" (race shyster).
      </p>
      <p>
       His mom liked non-White men, it seems (it was the 60's, after all).

       Obama merely soldiers onward with their coup.  He's the second-biggest criminal in U.S. history behind Bush/Cheney.  But to date, he hasn't surpassed their High Score.

       Hi, your neighborhood racist, bigot and anti-semite here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Howdy.
      </p>
      <p>
       NO ONE can be worse than 'w' bush.  It is scientifically impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is happening is that the lobbies got more and more claws into the country and government under 'w', and the natural progression of a rapacious predator is to get more and more, eat more and more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Presidents right now are just puppets dancing on a string.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, immigration from Mexico (I know, right, I am so racist for talking about it).  BOTH parties are for it.  Enthusiastically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reagan did an amnesty, 'w' wanted more and more so they could buy houses on loans from banks, obama is for it, and I guarantee the next president (R or D) will be for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       On MAJOR policies there is no difference between the parties (yes, some individuals might posture and grumble, but all it is is allowed opposition).
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: My favorite subject, the power of Israeli lobby in America, this article should be read by all (includes handy graphs!):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://nation.time.com/2013/02/04/just-who-do-they-represent-at-hagel-hearing-concern-for-israel-tops-u-s-troops-in-combat/">
        http://nation.time.com/2013/02/04/just-who-do-they-represent-at-hagel-hearing-concern-for-israel-tops-u-s-troops-in-combat/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now the Lobby is trying its utmost to torpedo Hagel's nomination - apparently the man received a few dollars from "Friends of Hamas" (at this point I assume an Israeli/Lobby false flag).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, at least re: my pet peeve, this black president is doing better than 'w', who allowed the neocons (jews) to run this country 100%.

       Why would you get banned first of all? Secondly, just because a worse place exists on earth, doesn't mean that this place is exempt from criticism. That is absolutely ridiculous for you to suggest.

      <p>
       Secondly, if you have been paying attention the last 10 years or so, you should be horrified at the direction the country went in. But I realize it's pointless to even argue with you because you are a status quo guy thinking that this is the freeist country in the world.
