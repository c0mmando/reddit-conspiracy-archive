<p>Like I said, he is suspected of killing three people. </p>

<p>Even if that were not the case, and he had only killed one person as you claim - would that make a significant difference? Would that make it acceptable to &#39;cheer&#39; for him? Regardless of what his victims have or have not done, <em>he&#39;s still a killer</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is how they get you. They confuse you, get you to root for their man because he is &quot;the lesser of evils&quot;. Do not settle for evil, period.

    <div class="md"><p>And that is why you must get mad - they are attempting to deprive this man of trial as is evidenced by their assault on those elderly women. We can not tolerate this behavior and we must demand that this man be brought in alive to testify against the LAPD.

    <div class="md"><p>Get the clue peeps there is another COURT CASE here. The People of California vs LAPD as a result of the police shooting those women. This ex-cop is a material witness in the case that is going to be brought against those bastards who shot the Asian ladies and should be made to testify on the police corruption that led to the obvious neglect that resulting in those Asian ladies being killed by LAPD. There is a process to be adhered to and this LAPD and LA.gov has already let anarchy take over by flagrantly ignoring justice and going vigilante to try and kill this ex-cop. They should all be relieved by State police and taken off this case as there is an obvious conflict of interest. The DA and Public Defender should be all over this, but is probably in bed with the most corrupt elements of the LAPD</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Military does it all the time. How many innocent people has that corrupt cop gotten away with killing? How many innocent potheads or non violent criminals lives had he ruined? How many people&#39;s lives and credit did he destroy by issuing pointless traffic tickets or excessive fines just so he could afford a top of the line house or car? How many people&#39;s kids did he kill or ruin? Khama is a bitch and LAPD has it coming to them. There are no good guys in this fight and I hope those corrupt officers and indeed the entire LA political establishment is overthrown by riot. Not a race riot - a riot that crosses all racial boundaries and destroys that corrupt disease infested government. Make no mistake about it, the LAPD and LA gov is a mafia infested rag tag crew of white collar criminals and dirty that all belong in prison. They can&#39;t protect you against anarchy - they are the anarchists - they pillage the local populace with excessive fees and fines - jail non violent citizens - over regulate while pillaging the banks and local businesses of trillions of dollars while engaging in elaborate extortion schemes. The LAPD are their puppets. Where were the manhunts for the death of regular citizens who were murdered? The LAPD and the LA.gov only care for themselves and to hell with the people. I hope the people of California find the courage to rise up and put an end to these anarchists in power that have raped and pillaged the good name of California.</p>

<p>It disgusts me that the gov in CA and indeed across this whole country would dare to tax poor minimum wage earners with no insurance just so they can assure it for themselves. These corrupt politicians and their lapdogs in the police all deserve the electric chair. Tax a wal-Mart employee with no pension or ticket a guy going 5mph over the speed limit with a $100 ticket when they can barely afford electric or ruin a boy&#39;s job prospects for using marijuana. No, fuck them, this whole system can burn.</p>
