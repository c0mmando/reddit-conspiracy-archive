       I just heard on the scanner that they blew the door down and thought he was underneath it when it fell. Then they described mattresses stacked against the wall and blood spatter on the number 1/2 wall.
They've already breached the cabin.

         Edit 4: "once the roof collapses and starts to settle have fire put water on it. The 2/3 and 3/4 corners have room not engulfed yet."

        <p>
         Edit 6: Listening to this live, it was absolutely clear that the police burned the building on purpose. This was not incidental to a flash bang and or from the suspect.

       No, in reddit's and America's worldview only black folk can be upset about police treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Me, a pasty white dude, is obviously privileged and treated very differently - with respect (heh), with helpful attitude (hehehe) and without the officer trying to be an intimidating asshole (hahahahaha) because he cares about my safety (HAHAHAHAHA).

       I can assure you, I am treated the same as a black kid in Chicago and its suburbs.
      </p>
      <p>
       At a "safety checkpoint", I saw White kids being pulled out of their cars and made to stand with hands on the hood of the car in a sweater or t-shirt during a very cold winter while the cops "checked them out".
      </p>
      <p>
       I was there for 15 minutes, and the guys were standing there, shivering, before I got there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Incidentally, here is Chicago's "finest" getting rid of some stress:

       He got 2 years probation (no jail) and was driven to his court dates in police cars and a back door was opened so he wouldn't have to face reporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, multiple visits were made to the bartender (vic) and she was threatened by uniformed police officers right after this beat down.
      </p>
      <p>
       But only black people can be victims in America, I apologize for my racist, not politically correct, bigoted views...

       Edit:

       WTF, read this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.recentpoker.com/news/david-peat-2029.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       About to board first class on a commercial flight in Detroit on his way to Los Angeles to play in a tournament on his way home to Vegas, Peat was allegedly approached by two men who identified themselves as federal government Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peat, who had bought his ticket with cash and had already passed through security, recounted: “I was standing against a wall talking on the phone when two guys ask my name.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “I answered ‘Peat, David Peat’. They showed me DEA badges so, obviously, I hung up and answered their questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       “They played good cop, bad cop and I had about $15 000 cash in my pocket and the bad cop asked why I had so much money on me. I told him what I did and where I was going. They reluctantly let me board the plane.”
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the DEA duo then apparently changed their minds and took Peat into custody, causing him to miss his flight and the tournament, and subjecting him to further questioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peat claims that he became alarmed and called over airport police, who confirmed that the men who had detained him were bona fide DEA agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       David Peat: "Help, police! I am being robbed, police!".
      </p>
      <p>
       The police, uniformed, show up, and while the victim points at his muggers, the uniformed police tell him: "Man, those ARE the police!" and leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Now, give us your money and your watch!," say the nice DEA agents.

       It's things like this where the smartphone app for instantly recording and uploading video straight to the internet is great. I think that everyone needs to have it on their smartphone, and maybe people can develop them for lesser smart phones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, we can't keep being tolerant of the police brutality. They are law enforcement, and have only one thing to protect. Not you. Not your property. Their pensions. A code of silence that is almost openly known about keeps crooked cops on payroll. I know my fair share of good cops, and not the good cop bad cop kind, but genuine good cops. They can't say shit about the things they see, because who knows if backup will show up for a snitch. Who knows if during a shootout if friendly fire might take off your face. We see prison guards essentially forming gangs against other guards and prisoners. They are the largest, most heavily armed gang in the country, and they aren't even supposed to protect you.

       I'd say it's a little insulting to bloods and crips to lump the police in with them. At least actual street gangs punish their members for disregarding orders.

       Yep.
      </p>
      <p>
       (black) people are forced to commit crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because racism, I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, again to drive the point home, cops only are abusive towards black people - White people are usually given sweets and candy by the police when dealing with them.

       I'm surprised they haven't confirmed it with one of their one hour DNA tests (Bin Laden) and dumped him off the side of an aircraft carrier where the hypothetical body can never be retrieved.  50% He's dead, 25% he escaped in a tunnel he dug before the fire, 10% he was never in the cabin, 15% they captured him running and wanted to make it seem like they killed him.  100% the cops and media are lying.

       What's most convenient to me is that this happened right before the SotU. Remember

       Gabby Gifford was shot days before the SotU in 2011?

       Here come the downvotes, but cooked off ammunition wouldn't "rip through" anything, especially wood. The bulk of velocity from a cartridge depends on the containment of the explosion from the load, that's why full auto weapons can send a projectile 715 m/s to a few hundred yards, and still have enough gas from the explosion to cycle a mechanism to chamber the next round. un-chambered ammo cookoff is dangerous, but 90% of the time you wouldn't even have to go to the hospital if you were hit with the projectile. We used to throw 30-06 cartridges into the camp fire, and once it hit a friend of mine in the hand, looked like he slammed his fingers in the car door, not much worse.

       hmmm well thanks for the enlightenment. 2 things i do want to mention. when i first saw the live video, the cabin, didnt look like it was very nice, thought the walls were thinner. I see now the house is...was quite nice. 2. I thought that the bullet would still travel at a higher velocity, and in a general, yet misguided direction by the shell casing.

       Not when public support for drone surveillance depends on the capture of an alleged cop killer. We're not supposed to question how or why there was a news copter on scene during the event. We're supposed to believe the "official" story, without question, regardless of any lack of evidence or legal procedure. Plus, a police shootout followed by the incineration of a house with a criminal inside makes for good news.

       It doesn't. They aren't even using drones in this anyway. Nothing of what the rest of what you say is even relevant to drones.

       This will get buried, but isn't it suspicious that this all happened on the night of the State of The Union, where every major news source is preoccupied with that? And they will be preoccupied with it for the next week or so..

       This whole story feels really fishy too me. It just doesn't add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, I knew they would kill him. We never saw him, the house burns down, all that fighting and he's done in ONE SHOT. All that talk and he shot himself? Multiple shootings this year and the one black guy gets 1 million dollar reward, drone, and no trial. I just feel like he knew too much for his own good. This is whole year just seems so lined for gun control laws, too convient for a political shift.

       These audio files and youtube snips need to be spread to as many people, sites, and comment sections as possible. We cannot allow the media or police departments involved to fabricate a differing story and sell it to the gullible masses. Everyone copy these links right now and spread them, like wild fire, ahem.

       The police are here to "protect and serve" - but what? Not us. They are to protect and serve our government. Us "civilians" mean nothing to them. It would not be surprising if this man was behind a huge conspiracy and they are covering up his "death".

       are you guys retarded or something? what were the cops supposed to do? keep engaging in a dangerous shoot out so that dorner can take out more cops? common sense people. he wasn't going to come out unless it was with a fight. instead of wasting lives, burn the fucker down. he will either A) run out and we can apprehend him, or B) wait inside and take his chances. guess what he chose? sure, it is shitty that we won't be able to get a verification on his body for a couple of weeks, but surely dental records or his weapon next to the body can be recovered. not everything is a fucking conspiracy.

       I don't live to far from waco.that was the first thing I thought.  Comedian Bill Hicks has a video of him trying to report live from it because he wanted to witness what was going down for himself.

       Very good points.

       My strategy: do not associate and be near gangs.

       That includes the police.

       I'd say it's a little insulting to bloods and crips to lump the police in with them. At least actual street gangs punish their members for disregarding orders.
