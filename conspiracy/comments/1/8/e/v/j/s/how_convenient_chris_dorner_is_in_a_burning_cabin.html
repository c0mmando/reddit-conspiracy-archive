<p>I just heard on the scanner that they blew the door down and thought he was underneath it when it fell. Then they described mattresses stacked against the wall and blood spatter on the number 1/2 wall.
They&#39;ve already breached the cabin.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Edit: 4 swat teams entered</p></li>
<li><p>Edit (4:24 pm): Live smoke on TV now. They finally know something&#39;s happening</p></li>
<li><p>Edit 3: Swat is concerned there are propane tanks inside</p></li>
<li><p>Edit 4: &quot;once the roof collapses and starts to settle have fire put water on it. The 2/3 and 3/4 corners have room not engulfed yet.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Edit 5: &quot;Control 61-lincoln we still have ammo cooking off in the fire&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Edit 6: Listening to this live, it was absolutely clear that the police burned the building on purpose. This was not incidental to a flash bang and or from the suspect.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit 7: &quot;The building is well constructed. The fire&#39;s taking it&#39;s sweet time reaching the 2/3 and 3/4 corners.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Edit 8: I lost my scanner feed. Someone take over if possible</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>No, in reddit&#39;s and America&#39;s worldview only black folk can be upset about police treatment.</p>

<p>Me, a pasty white dude, is obviously privileged and treated very differently - with respect (heh), with helpful attitude (hehehe) and without the officer trying to be an intimidating asshole (hahahahaha) because he cares about my safety (HAHAHAHAHA).</p>

<p>Sorry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can assure you, I am treated the same as a black kid in Chicago and its suburbs.</p>

<p>At a &quot;safety checkpoint&quot;, I saw White kids being pulled out of their cars and made to stand with hands on the hood of the car in a sweater or t-shirt during a very cold winter while the cops &quot;checked them out&quot;.</p>

<p>I was there for 15 minutes, and the guys were standing there, shivering, before I got there.</p>

<p>Incidentally, here is Chicago&#39;s &quot;finest&quot; getting rid of some stress:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeVlNV9Kgh4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeVlNV9Kgh4</a></p>

<p>He got 2 years probation (no jail) and was driven to his court dates in police cars and a back door was opened so he wouldn&#39;t have to face reporters.</p>

<p>Also, multiple visits were made to the bartender (vic) and she was threatened by uniformed police officers right after this beat down.</p>

<p>But only black people can be victims in America, I apologize for my racist, not politically correct, bigoted views...</p>

<p>Evidence on youtube and newscasts notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>WTF, read this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.recentpoker.com/news/david-peat-2029.html">http://www.recentpoker.com/news/david-peat-2029.html</a></p>

<p>About to board first class on a commercial flight in Detroit on his way to Los Angeles to play in a tournament on his way home to Vegas, Peat was allegedly approached by two men who identified themselves as federal government Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officials.</p>

<p>Peat, who had bought his ticket with cash and had already passed through security, recounted: “I was standing against a wall talking on the phone when two guys ask my name.”</p>

<p>“I answered ‘Peat, David Peat’. They showed me DEA badges so, obviously, I hung up and answered their questions.</p>

<p>“They played good cop, bad cop and I had about $15 000 cash in my pocket and the bad cop asked why I had so much money on me. I told him what I did and where I was going. They reluctantly let me board the plane.”</p>

<p>However, the DEA duo then apparently changed their minds and took Peat into custody, causing him to miss his flight and the tournament, and subjecting him to further questioning.</p>

<p>Peat claims that he became alarmed and called over airport police, who confirmed that the men who had detained him were bona fide DEA agents.</p>

<p>David Peat: &quot;Help, police! I am being robbed, police!&quot;.</p>

<p>The police, uniformed, show up, and while the victim points at his muggers, the uniformed police tell him: &quot;Man, those ARE the police!&quot; and leave.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, give us your money and your watch!,&quot; say the nice DEA agents.</p>

<p>Rights? Due process? Bill of Rights? Constitution?</p>

<p>What country do you think you live in, scumbag?</p>

<p>How about this one?</p>

<p>If you watch the video, you can see a fat police shit dancing a jig from happiness at what is happening.  They LIVE for this stuff.</p>

<p>Also, this is my favorite:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s things like this where the smartphone app for instantly recording and uploading video straight to the internet is great. I think that everyone needs to have it on their smartphone, and maybe people can develop them for lesser smart phones. </p>

<p>Point is, we can&#39;t keep being tolerant of the police brutality. They are law enforcement, and have only one thing to protect. Not you. Not your property. Their pensions. A code of silence that is almost openly known about keeps crooked cops on payroll. I know my fair share of good cops, and not the good cop bad cop kind, but genuine good cops. They can&#39;t say shit about the things they see, because who knows if backup will show up for a snitch. Who knows if during a shootout if friendly fire might take off your face. We see prison guards essentially forming gangs against other guards and prisoners. They are the largest, most heavily armed gang in the country, and they aren&#39;t even supposed to protect you. </p>

<p>Yep.</p>

<p>(black) people are forced to commit crimes.</p>

<p>Because racism, I guess.</p>

<p>Also, again to drive the point home, cops only are abusive towards black people - White people are usually given sweets and candy by the police when dealing with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here come the downvotes, but cooked off ammunition wouldn&#39;t &quot;rip through&quot; anything, especially wood. The bulk of velocity from a cartridge depends on the containment of the explosion from the load, that&#39;s why full auto weapons can send a projectile 715 m/s to a few hundred yards, and still have enough gas from the explosion to cycle a mechanism to chamber the next round. un-chambered ammo cookoff is dangerous, but 90% of the time you wouldn&#39;t even have to go to the hospital if you were hit with the projectile. We used to throw 30-06 cartridges into the camp fire, and once it hit a friend of mine in the hand, looked like he slammed his fingers in the car door, not much worse. </p>
