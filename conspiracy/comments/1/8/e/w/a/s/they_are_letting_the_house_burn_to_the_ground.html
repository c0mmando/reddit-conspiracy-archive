       the City of Philadelphia bombed an entire block in the 80s, destroyed 65 homes and killed 9 people (on top of the guy they were targeting). Never under-estimate the extent of stupidity under a lot stress.

       The
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOVE">
        MOVE Organization
       </a>
       was a Philadelphia-based black liberation group and in 1985, they made national news when police dropped a bomb on a house, from a helicopter in an attempt to end an armed standoff. The explosion ignited a fire in which 11 people died, including five children and the group's leader, John Africa. Only two occupants survived, Ramona, an adult and Birdie, a child. In addition, 65 homes were destroyed as the entire block burned.

       I was thinking the same thing.  Rather odd the house is burning and it is supposed to be the one the "suspect" was being held up in.  Not to mention the lady dodged the question if Dorner could be on the loose.

       Guy was dead the minute he started calling the emperor's lack of decency and when he shot a cop. I doubt anyone expected he to be taken alive so he could keep spouting embarrassing information on a hyper publicized trial.

       It has stunk from the beginning. Nothing has really made sense for me today. I feel as if I am rooting for him. I still don't get why Chris Dorner is in Big Bear in the first place. I have been getting downvoted all day for speculating but so far it's panning out.

       It's fucking out of control. No due process, no Miranda rights, and cruel and unusual punishment. No wonder he was shooting cops, eh? First they fired him, then fired at him, then caught him on fire.

       The weather has been slightly warmer and there are still patches of it. It just still doesn't add up. These aren't actions of someone who was on the run. Going into a store and paying for gas instead of using a kiosk, going to big bear of all places that has only 3 ways out of, burning your only means of transport... I never looked much into this until today. The second I heard he was in Big Bear, I knew it was all bullshit

       Gunpowder + fire = not safe. I think people here are looking for more suspicion than is really necessary. When a criminal threatens the police's family, they must retaliate with maximum force to beat down both the criminal and future possible similarities.. Of course, that is just a normal human's response. I think the LAPD is just especially violent.

       Corrupt cops - this police force should be hunted down like rabid dogs. Guilty or not - there is a moratorium on the death penalty in CA and police job is to bring suspects to trial - this is murder. This police is corrupt and must burn.

       Since when do police set buildings on fire? He has a right to a trial despite what he is accused of, I guess we as a country have decided to stand by and let our rights disappear.  They, they being the police, acted as judge jury and executioner,  they shot people remember the two women, they have given us a demonstration of what our police state has now become.  There is no doubt we are living in a police state,  with a dictator who with his pen just signed another executive order on cyber security because congress could not or would not act to his liking. America has changed and it isnt for the better. Our freedom, those tiny fragments we have left are in their death throws. The dormer case reminds me of the movie the running man he allegedly committed those crimes but he never got his day in court. If you dont see how the deck has been stacked your blind.

       He either never existed, or was dead before this started. Maybe the people who were killed were loose ends somehow. Maybe they were simple pawns sacrificed for the "greater good". Either way this whole thing stinks to high hell, and if we don't see any police repercussions for their response and handling of this situation, then there should be riots in the streets, cop cars being flipped, and political officials interrogated.

       the question of what's "right" as opposed to what's "wrong" has been replaced with a new system. The new system is now "legal and illegal". What right can be deemed illegal, what's dead wrong can be legal. See the burning cabin as an example of a wrong made legal.

       Well since there is reason to believe that there is ammunition in the building then it is not safe for the authorities or firefighters to go close to the house because the ammunition could be set off by the fire.

       This is bullshit. Burned ammunition is harmless. They simply don't want to recover an identifiable body.

       Then they can say that it was him and not have a reason to show the " unidentifiable " body in any public way . The police can then use their velvet gloves and tamper.

       Did you watch the video?! Sure. They aren't as fun as fireworks or shooting them from a gun, but they won't hurt you. And no. I wouldn't want to go into any burning building. That is what firefighters are for. Which they were held back not because of ammunition, but for some other reason.

       Yeah but it's not like they know that those people own guns or have ammunition. They believe that there are 50 caliber rounds in the house which would destroy lots of close by things. My dad is a firefighter and there was a house that was burning of a ww2 vet that had a bunch of ammunition in it and they had to let it burn down because all the ammo was going off. I have a 50 cal casing from that fire. If there is ammo in that house then they wouldn't let anyone go near that house because it could potentially injure more officers or firefighters.

       You're thinking way too far into this man. Gun shots are a lot louder than burning wood. He was involved in a shoot out with police. He shot from inside the house. He's an ex cop meaning he knows how well the police will be armed and he knows he needs to arm himself. They are taking precautionary measures. Would you want to go close to a buning house that supposedly had ammo in it that could kill you. Fuck no

        MOVE Organization
       </a>
       was a Philadelphia-based black liberation group and in 1985, they made national news when police dropped a bomb on a house, from a helicopter in an attempt to end an armed standoff. The explosion ignited a fire in which 11 people died, including five children and the group's leader, John Africa. Only two occupants survived, Ramona, an adult and Birdie, a child. In addition, 65 homes were destroyed as the entire block burned.

       I know I just mentioned the two women as a point that shooting unarmed people in the wrong color truck without identifying them is murder.  They weren't even the same gender they are just as bad as the criminal when they just arbitrarily shoot people.
