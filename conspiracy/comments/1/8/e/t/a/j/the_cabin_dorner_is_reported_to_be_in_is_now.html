       Names of the cops he killed? Im betting its fake. They cant produce names because they dont exist. The identities are still being constructed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They needed justification to burn this cabin down. No Judge, No Jury, No due process. What this proves is your rights dont mean shit. You have no rights.  The claim that he had a stock pile of ammo is the reason they cant put the fire out - Bull shit. We all heard the "send in the burners" on the scanner.

       No due process?! What about the lack of evidence that he did anything other then make a facebook post about corrupt cops?! For all we know the LAPD just murdered 3/4 people and blamed the deaths of 3 other people on one guy- and not only that, but we're suppose to actually believe a police department that was just accused of corruption by an ex-police officer from the same department!
I didn't trust the police too much before, but I have to say this takes the cake.

       Yes. No due process. He was denied his rights. You know what that means and what I'm implying, correct? Even murderers deserve a day in court.. Police order all media to stand back, even airborne media. The police even stated the cabin had no power to it so its safe to say he had no TV, Internet etc. Why kill the media? They even told reporters to stop tweeting. LOL. The execution was not televised.

       And even then, it was possible he had a hostage, yet the set the building on fire, they weren't even sure it was him, its still possible it was just a home owner shooting at police who broke down his door with no explanation.

       "the guns have been deployed - there's fire."
      </p>
      <p>
       given to the burners being police/gang slang on the west coast for guns..
      </p>
      <p>
       Fire could either mean the guns are firing of whoever's using them or that it is indeed fire being spotted in the cabin.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it doesn't make sense for them to go right up to the cabin and light it with close-range "burners".
      </p>
      <p>
       Also don't you think since WACO we'd have heard by now of such a weapon existing that any type of flame weapon would be in the hands of police, whether by leak or former officer?

      <p>
       Incendiary grenades are only a thing of fiction. What you're trying to say is thermite grenades that are used by the military to disable large enemy equipment such as artillary or vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're also not meant to be thrown but placed before being set off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Give me a source where police have used thermite grenades at any point in time.

       Ya whatever man. First you called bullshit on them saying it over the air. I provided proof. Then it was obviously meant to mean something else according to you. Your a shill. Trying to object anything and everything that doesnt fit the official story. Fuck off. EVERYONE knew they wouldnt take this man alive. The last thing they wanted was one of their own testifying to a grand jury about all the corruption and abuse he witnessed. Dead men dont talk.

       Clear as day. Officers recorded saying "Burn it down" on live TV. I guess that means to fix a cup of hot cocoa and start negotiations and lets get cozy warm up in this bitch.

       You mean when Silverstein was telling the fire commander to pull his men out of the building and let whatever happen, happen in order to not risk anymore lives of firefighters?

       Maybe I was talking about my leg?  Who knows?  Of course in this context you can take it to mean pull the building.  what else could it mean in such context?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes 'it' being the team that wasn't in the building.  And the conversation with the fire commander never happened.  Since when does the fire commander listen to the lessor of the building on when to pull their guys?
      </p>
      <p>
       There were no firefighters to pull.  Besides, pull is a very common term.  As an example I asked a policeman just the other day if they were going to 'pull the building.' that he was outside.  He understood me immediately and said no.

       I know right. We are sending in the burners! Right before a house catches fires usually only means one thing. Its like hearing "We decided to pull it" and watching WTC #7 fall on its on footprint yet believe "pull it" meant something entirely different. LOL

       Im not really into this conspiracy stuff... but the station Im watching (CNN), the smoke, well, looks really fake. For some reason everything on the screen has a harsh blue tint, and the smoke just looks like special effects. Im not too sure, though, they just panned the camera around and you can actually see flames, so I dont know.

       I thought thinking the smoke and fire being fake was ridiculous but ABC reporter just felt the need to explain that "those flames are real". Sort of odd

       Edit: A different reporter on the ground just said he cannot see smoke from where he is and explained he's 3-4 miles "as the crow flies" from the scene.

       The ashes were quickly confirmed to be Dorner.   What an idiot, announcing his plans on facebook.  You'd think a smart man like him would be smarter than that.
