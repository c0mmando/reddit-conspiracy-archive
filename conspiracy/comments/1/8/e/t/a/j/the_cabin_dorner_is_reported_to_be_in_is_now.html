<p>They needed justification to burn this cabin down. No Judge, No Jury, No due process. What this proves is your rights dont mean shit. You have no rights.  The claim that he had a stock pile of ammo is the reason they cant put the fire out - Bull shit. We all heard the &quot;send in the burners&quot; on the scanner. </p>

For all we know the LAPD just murdered 3/4 people and blamed the deaths of 3 other people on one guy- and not only that, but we&#39;re suppose to actually believe a police department that was just accused of corruption by an ex-police officer from the same department!

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. No due process. He was denied his rights. You know what that means and what I&#39;m implying, correct? Even murderers deserve a day in court.. Police order all media to stand back, even airborne media. The police even stated the cabin had no power to it so its safe to say he had no TV, Internet etc. Why kill the media? They even told reporters to stop tweeting. LOL. The execution was not televised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;the guns have been deployed - there&#39;s fire.&quot;</p>

<p>given to the burners being police/gang slang on the west coast for guns..</p>

<p>Fire could either mean the guns are firing of whoever&#39;s using them or that it is indeed fire being spotted in the cabin.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t make sense for them to go right up to the cabin and light it with close-range &quot;burners&quot;.</p>

<p>Also don&#39;t you think since WACO we&#39;d have heard by now of such a weapon existing that any type of flame weapon would be in the hands of police, whether by leak or former officer?</p>

The last thing they wanted was one of their own testifying to a grand jury about all the corruption and abuse he witnessed. Dead men dont talk.</p>

<p>Clear as day. Officers recorded saying &quot;Burn it down&quot; on live TV. I guess that means to fix a cup of hot cocoa and start negotiations and lets get cozy warm up in this bitch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I was talking about my leg?  Who knows?  Of course in this context you can take it to mean pull the building.  what else could it mean in such context?</p>

<p>Yes &#39;it&#39; being the team that wasn&#39;t in the building.  And the conversation with the fire commander never happened.  Since when does the fire commander listen to the lessor of the building on when to pull their guys?</p>

<p>There were no firefighters to pull.  Besides, pull is a very common term.  As an example I asked a policeman just the other day if they were going to &#39;pull the building.&#39; that he was outside.  He understood me immediately and said no.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know right. We are sending in the burners! Right before a house catches fires usually only means one thing. Its like hearing &quot;We decided to pull it&quot; and watching WTC #7 fall on its on footprint yet believe &quot;pull it&quot; meant something entirely different. LOL</p>

<p>There is no question to what burners mean here. Incendiary grenades.</p>

<p>25 minute mark. The burners have been deployed - We have fire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not really into this conspiracy stuff... but the station Im watching (CNN), the smoke, well, looks really fake. For some reason everything on the screen has a harsh blue tint, and the smoke just looks like special effects. Im not too sure, though, they just panned the camera around and you can actually see flames, so I dont know. </p>

<p>Edit: A different reporter on the ground just said he cannot see smoke from where he is and explained he&#39;s 3-4 miles &quot;as the crow flies&quot; from the scene. </p>
