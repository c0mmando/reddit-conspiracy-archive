       I posted this over to r/UK to hopefully give a little more insight into why things are as they are right now. Seems certain things should not be discussed.

       I am so confused that this issue riles people up so much Just why are they defending something so damaging? And this culture of silence about the topic is really starting to piss me off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had an experience with my father recently on this subject that kind of sums this question up for me. This experience worried me and really made me wonder just how much brainwashing is going down. I can only assume the mainstream media is responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       For context, I have not had TV for about 5 years now, so I have very little idea of just how bad it currently is. I can tell you that seeing a few glimpses of it lately at families homes makes me feel sick to my stomach. I really don't remember everything being quite so dumbed down, in your face, loud, bright and ADHD.
      </p>
      <p>
       But back to the point, me and my father were discussing Israel and Palestine (all pleasant and normal) and I put a clip on where someone was discussing some facts in relation to the two countries. It was quite damning on Israel as facts do not lie.  Suddenly he flips out like a complete psycho and starts seething at the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it just left me very confused. My father is not Jewish in any which way, but has had a relationship with a Jewish woman. That is literally the only reason I can think that he would defend a country so passionately that he has never stepped foot in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any how, can we please discuss Israel as it's own country without people wanting to kill each other? I am not discussing the Jews on a micro scale, but more the mistaken belief that a historically wronged group of people are completely averse from manipulation and power grabbing. Nothing is black and white.

       I'm starting to think this bizarre robotic mindset comes in built. Til that Israel is an infallible country beyond any and all scrutiny.

       Didn't take long for the neo nazi bullshit to spew forth I see. Do you 'normal' people have any argument of substance? Any at all? I feel like I'm discussing this with 10 year olds frankly.

       Strange, because I see the people that are extremely uncomfortable with facts as abnormal. If normal is living in ignorance, I'm afraid I'm not normal.
