But they&#39;ll try everything in the power to stop it. That&#39;s why they&#39;re ramping up the fear-propaganda machine to keep us in a constant state of fear which resonates on a lower level. If you keep people in fear they&#39;re easily controlled and manipulated. That&#39;s exactly what the establishment wants for the general public. However, when you start seeing their tactics for what they are you&#39;re able to discern through the constant stream of bullshit they&#39;re trying to feed you. You no longer become the sleeping zombie you once were. You wake up, start to ask questions, become a critical thinker, and ultimately a system buster/light bringer. </p>

<p>When you become conscious you indirectly affect everyone since we&#39;re all part of a global consciousness grid. When more people wake up it starts a domino effect. Eventually we hit critical mass and then my brothers and sisters we&#39;re hitting warp speed. Keep seeking the truth and spreading the light. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US Government and its partners in crime no longer have much to fear from a foreign power, the advent of the nuclear bomb has made conventional warfare obsolete and useless.  Guerrilla Warfare (Terrorism) is now the only thing that has the potential to harm the powers that be, but is it foreign Guerrillas that they really fear?  No, those (Al-Quaeda, Muslim Brotherhood, etc) are mostly manufactured and blown out of proportion to make the sheep-people on their couches cringe and clamor for bigger defense (Offense) budgets.  No, the only thing the US Government really has to worry about is its own citizens.  Irregular Militia groups deciding that enough is enough is the worst case scenario for Uncle Sam right now, and that is why all this gun control bullshit is being dropped on our heads now.  Does anyone REALLY think that taking away guns from private citizens and making sure that only the Police, Soldiers, and criminals have guns is a good idea?  The 2nd Amendment is in the constitution solely to ensure that the citizens of the united states can have the tools at their disposal that they need to mount a coup against a tyrannical government.  Of course, it&#39;s probably too late now.  They have unmanned aircraft that can put a hellfire missile down your throat from a mile away, sort of makes rebellion a moot point.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you try to solve the same problem from the same way of thinking ie - armed uprising to disarm a tyrannical government it won&#39;t work. If you were to remove the powers that be through violence than another authoritative control figure would step in to fill the void. What needs to happen (and is happening) is a shift in our individual consciousness - the way we perceive our reality, our connection to one another, and ultimately to our environment. When people begin to wake up and see that there is no separation from one and the many, and in fact we&#39;re all one - then we will have change and an end to the tyrannical rule and manipulation that has existed for the past 2,000 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive seen scenarios of a &quot; Praetorian takeover&quot;. Elements of the military physically arresting members of a corrupt establisment in a hopefilly bloodless coup like you saw at the end of the Soviet Union. I dont know how well it equates, but after that there wasn&#39;t too much progress, and within a few years, remnants of the old communist system grew like tumors into positions of power.</p>

<p>Personally, I think rule of law will have to completely vanish for a while for there to be a chance the old corruption to completely die off. For a generation or so.</p>

<p>The Regular Militia (National Guard) is several times the size of and has several time more training then the &quot;irregular militia&quot; which is really just a couple of guys here and there.  The governor controls them, but the President can take over in certain broad scenarios.  The ideal scenario would be to cross recruit National Guard members to irregular militias centered around gun ranges.  That would both increase the power and legitimacy of a security force of the people, by the people, for the people.  You couldn&#39;t hint at it at all at first, but I&#39;d ideally like to see these types of organizations strengthened so that issues like the Fed raiding California dispensaries or the Fed threatening to shut down TX airspace if they kick out the TSA won&#39;t be as much of a problem in the future.  Two other lines of security would also have to be Entitlement/highway spending and possibly repealing the 17th amendment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh you are a cunning one aren&#39;t you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ideal scenario</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could you please outline for whom and for what ends this scenario would be ideal?</p>

<p>On the face of it your post seems to be about strengthening the states and weakening the federal government of the United States of America however with very little imagination it is easy to discern possible alternative resons for wanting to make the changes you state.  In anycase even if the proposals you have made are for the sole purpose of strengthening the states and weakening the federal government they contain many elements that are extreemly worrysome   it is strange that they seem to be mainly focused on military and police like powers and contain only the barest mention of civil power and political power.  Even when mentioning civil and political power you use terms that suggest your intent is only about military and police issues.  You say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two other lines of security would also have to be Entitlement/highway spending and possibly repealing the 17th amendment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you describe these two measures as &quot;lines of security&quot;?  Security for who?  From what?  Why do you describe these two measures, which on the face of it seem to have little to do with security, in such terms?  Who or what is the threat that requires these security measures be taken?</p>

<p>In addition to my questions I also have a couple of points to make.</p>

<p>We have seen a number of posts in recent times here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> about the quantity of military style hardware being provided to local police units in the USA.  Things like armoured vehicles and the like that seem unnecessary for a civilian police force but more appropriate to a paramilitary security force.  It occurs to me how nicely and appropriate all that equipment would be in the hands of just such a militia structure as you have described.  </p>

<p>Would it be fair to say that the membership of informal irregular militias in the United States of America as they exist today could be characterised as people who are on average, more distrustful of legitimate authority than average, less likely to be engaged in their communities or politics or civil society than average, more xenophobic than average, more racists than average?  In short, broadly speaking of course, my question is, are people who make up the membership of informal irregular militias in the United States of America kind of a bit like people who identify with the tea party movement.  Isn&#39;t your proposal an attempt to bring the NRA, tea party, right wing element of United States society into the fold of a burgeoning militarized all encompassing security apparatus that will be hostile towards the legitimate authority of the United States of America including the legally and legitimately constituted government of the United States of America, foreigners and foreign looking people or people who look to be Arab, Latino, Black, or Asian?</p>

<p>The final point I wish to make is about cross recruiting National Guard members.  This seems to me to be a strikingly similar role to the role that is normally performed the special forces.  It seems to me, if your proposal was to be implemented the soldiers responsible for training and organising your  &quot;ideal scenario&quot; of citizen security police/ vigilante / political thug enforcement groups would most likely be drawn from the special operations and intelligence sections of the military and not the national guard.  In any case it would be almost impossible to tell weather the uniformed soldier holding meetings down at the gun club where members of the tea party and NRA are learning to act as a disciplined squad and obey commands automatically while on patrol as a paramilitary force in poor black and latino neighbourhoods that we all know are hot spots for trouble are national guardsmen or military intelligence officers, who acting under the auspices of the National Guard can be controlled by the governor or taken over by the president</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in certain broad scenarios.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Broad scenarios that I am sure we would all agreed would be very easy to create and manipulate in such a way as not only would the federal government have legal control of these militias, but public opinion would also wholeheartedly back the violent and brutal use of these militias against any and all groups within the United States who are deemed to be enemies.  And this isn&#39;t even the scariest scenario that can be imagined.  More likely is a situation were well equipped and trained militia groups are encouraged to take their own initiative and hunt down and persecute home grown terrorists and enemies of the United States on their own and in cooperation and networked with other militia groups across the country all the while the political forces that set this maelstrom of violence in action claim innocence.  Think about it.  Are you an enemy of freedom?  The militia is for good Americans who stand for freedom.  Don&#39;t get in the way of the militia or you are a terrorist.  You are either with us or against us.  Which is it going to be?</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t see anything ideal at all about your ideal scenario, except of course for the forces of tyranny.  If you really want to bring the criminal politicians into line the way to do it is firstly don&#39;t walk straight into the trap they are setting for you, and secondly....  hey but what do I know I am a foreigner.  It is a problem you are going to have to solve for yourselves.  I would seriously think twice before endorsing plans for further militarisation of American society.</p>

Is your idea yours alone our is it from a group, movement or institution that advocates the same thing.  Has some policy institute in washington put out a white paper outlining your idea?

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus man dat feel, some days I wish a fucking asteroid would just fucking annihilate the whole parasitic human race. But then I realize how utterly fucking stupid that is. Humanity has so much fucking potential it makes me sick to think of the position we are in now. To think that the beauty and complexity of the true human condition could become so polluted and distorted is just mind wrenching. Just think of what we as a species could be capable if science and spirituality could see eye to eye and work together, not for the betterment of an agenda or, belief, or corporation, or even self gain but for humanity. If the worth of a man was seen not by how many imaginary figures he had in his bank account but the amount of love and compassion and understanding he had for his fellow man. A world where the concepts of war, inequality, and injustice didn&#39;t exist because we as a species never allowed them to manifest in the first place. Because after all every cause of suffering and evil in the world today arises from the simple fact of an the plaque that is ego, &quot;I want more power&quot;, &quot;I want more money&quot;, &quot;ME ME ME&quot;. And in the process of this quest to satisfy the self we lose the true beauty of what it is to be conscious and aware, to not only be a part of the universe, but to understand that we all, every single human, ARE the universe. Now I am not saying that individuality is a bad thing in fact, it is one of the greatest aspects of humanity, the vast amount s of cultures and languages skills and talents are spread so much throughout our species, it is a true blessing. Although the confusion of the difference between embracing individuality and building up ego has turned this blessing into a curse and instead of realizing that the universe is the canvas and each and every human who has every lived are the individual brushstrokes, we decide that instead of embracing these beautiful different shades, were going to only acknowledge our individual color . And instead of creating a masterpiece we make a  bland and boring mess of individual splotches. Wow that was quite a  rant but, just like you said man shit like this has been eating me up for months. I know im doing everything in my power to spread this message and live a life to my greatest potential in love and harmony. Although then I realize that it doesn’t matter how much you ask someone do things or fight them people can not and will change unless they THEMSELVES confront their ego and what exactly it means to be a conscious human being on a basic level. Now when each and every human being can do this, and it may take years, or decades, or even millennium. But when humanity can finally do this on a grand scale I am positive  humanity will reach the ends of the universe bearing the messages of peace, love, and harmony.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was talking with my buddy the other night about what would unite humanity and this was his answer. It definitely would unite people but I feel that it wouldn&#39;t be in a positive way. Think of the weapons we have now and what we would do. We would instantly nuke anything that comes even remotely near our planet. Yes, we would be united but it would only be to kill the aliens(if we did end up killing them) and then we would be back to our normal ways of hating eachother. I personally would love to see it be a positive shift where we understand that though cooperation, not competition, we will have a chance of survival on this planet.  </p>

They&#39;re the global fucking elite, who knows how many resources they have at their disposal be it money, people, or technology, these dudes aren&#39;t going to passively allow this shift the wash away their self imposed values, stratification, and society for that matter. Right now men with billions upon billions of dollars funding applicable technology, and approaches to stifle the massive imminent civil disobedience. Riot gear, DHS purchasing hundreds of millions of hollow points (bullets specifically meant to mame, shred and fragment inside the target; more expensive ammo meaning this eliminates the a reason as to why this would be used for practice.) I live right next to Anaheim, CA and i swear to god that no one outside of reddit knew, and of the hundreds of friends on facebook, all of whom live in Los angeles county, were  oblivious to The incident at Anaheim. That&#39;s how fucking sheltered the general masses are. When i had seen The Anaheim &quot;riots&quot; i was in fucking awe, rapidly searching the local news outlets for any coverage whatsoever; none was to be found, and i live just a few miles from Anaheim. I think the media does, and for sure has the power to control by coverage, or lack there of. The powers that be are in control, not in control of all of us, but of most by a misunderstood, widely accepted authoritative appeal to mainstream media outlets. Buying time. Its only a matter of fucking time before the internet is going to be locked down in a non-aggressive, but stifling way. TPTB will learn how to oppress us and claim the sovereignty of our self philosophy. Resist ideologically.... The meek will inherit the Earth. The last shall be the first, and the first last.</p>

<p>If they are bending crops down, they could just as easily do so in front of people, during the day. Or hell, even carve a message into the moon.</p>

<p>If &quot;unknown physics&quot; is your answer, then I might as well say it is guys with boards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is to say its a common means of communication?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being that it is one of the 4 fundamental forces, only two at which work at any appreciable distance, and the stronger of those by like 30 orders of magnitude, I think it&#39;s a very safe bet they would have developed EM comms at some point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In terms of major response, they have the attention of millions of people worldwide. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Millions of people who say thousands of contradictory information and are largely ignored by billions. How stupid are they if putting messages in crops is a better idea than carving it into the moon, or doing literally anything else that would have recordings of the event?</p>

<p>The Shift is not a prophecy or a guarantee. It is not inevitable. It is necessary if we are to free ourselves of the generational enslavement we have suffered for so long; but it will not come on its own, and not without great difficulty. People don&#39;t want to give up the Matrix. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say the people with the real delusions of grandeur are the people in power right now</p>

<p>It&#39;s just that I&#39;d prefer to not be a rat myself as I deem the experience unsatisfactory</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason that the traditional western working world is called the rat race</p>

<p>Even if you win and get to be fabulously wealthy, you&#39;re still just a rat</p>

<p>There are plenty of good folks who wouldn&#39;t believe a word of this but are still very selfless and enlightened. Non believers I wouldn&#39;t consider rats</p>

<p>No the rats are those who support and defend the oppressive system which exists on this planet</p>

<p>And to say that such a system does not exist is simply foolish. There is enough wealth such that no one needs to go without, and yet people do. Because they are systematically oppressed. Were they not they would simply take what they needed from those with excess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you saying that you find nothing abnormal about the media coverage of sandyhook?</p>

<p>Between the following:</p>

<p>Incorrect shooter identification (it was widely reported that ryan lanza was a shooter in addition to his brother adam. This was corrected by saying that ryan had his brothers id, but many initial reports identified both brothers. Where did they get two people from one?)</p>

<p>Incorrect footage shown on tv (CNN shows rose school drill)</p>

<p>No footage of children being evacuated despite the presence of 600+ children</p>

<p>Gene rosen is just plain weird. Listen to the dude talk. Look at the fema photos from texas 2009. It is obviously the same person depicted</p>

<p>The medical examiner interview</p>

<p>The police chief threatening those disseminating info which conflicts with the official story</p>

<p>The man found in the woods alternatively identified as a parent working on a gingerbread house in some sources and other sources identify him as a police officer from a neighboring township. Which is it? Why was he in the woods? alone? </p>

<p>The reports that adam lanza was not a special needs child </p>

<p>Chroma key editing on some shots</p>

<p>No CCTV footage</p>

<p>Was a rifle used or not? If so how did it get back in the trunk? If not why were told it was?</p>

<p>Parents cannot view bodies of their children?</p>

<p>Add to this the shootings at the sikh temple in wisconsin (one of those who was murdered&#39;s father is releasing an ET disclosure documentary this year, amardeep kaleka. This is undisputed fact)</p>

<p>The shooting at aurora (wherein a correctional officer claimed to have been in a nearby cell to james holmes and proclaimed him an evil genius trying to fool everyone with his insanity defense)</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t take an einstein to know something is up here</p>

<p>Only the most foolish and ignorant would continue to act like there is no greater force at work here</p>

<p>and you have no idea how google indexing works do you?</p>

<p>also deleting a real persons face book is a sure way to raise suspicion among friends of the actor. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a web developer... I do this shit all day. </p>

<p>If you wanna keep acting like your smart go ahead</p>

<p>You wanna keep wolfing down bullshit and telling me it tastes great go ahead</p>

<p>I asked you to find the indexed profile. Have you done so?</p>

<p>As much as showing that person&#39;s face on the local news? Don&#39;t even get me started on why they would use a <em>local</em> actor on a <em>local</em> news broadcast. Hell the actor could always justify being tired of facebook and deleting account. </p>

<p>Also, if this group isn&#39;t more powerful than facebook and google, and can&#39;t &quot;convince&quot; them to delete said profile fully, then they really wouldn&#39;t scare me at all.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about whether they can or can&#39;t do these things</p>

<p>THeir power is waning and thats why these shootings even happened in the first place</p>

<p>A desperate attempt to hold onto their fleeting power</p>

<p>They probably could do these things but there is a lot on their plate so to speak</p>

<p>That is what op is on about</p>

<p>The with the internet is, theres no delete button</p>

<p>there are caches of caches buddy</p>

<p>Obviously you are like these idiots planning this shit and do not understand technology yourself</p>

<p>&quot;hacking&quot; into face book or things of this nature will only draw more attention because it just leaves more digital footprints</p>
