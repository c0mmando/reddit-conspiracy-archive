        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was originally going to post this in /worldpolitics or something, but I have been taking a real beating from the jingoists lurking around lately.  So I remembered you guys, always politically conscious, and perhaps ironically one of a few places of open discussion.  </p>

<p>I am definitely for the idea of a country like Mali protecting itself from invaders, especially radical violent ones, but how quick we are to forget that this is exactly what Gadaffi warned about.  </p>

<p>While he may have been a terrible person who sponsored violence himself, he also considered himself a vanguard against radical Islam and al-qaeda in Libya and throughout North Africa (and helped fund the African Union for that very cause).  </p>

<p>NATO overthrew Libya, and then Al-Queda announced that it sees Libya as an excellent new breeding ground for recruiting.  <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hWh19Uy9oEWu6sMz8MGwYLBh5tOg">Example1</a>, <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-12-29/middleeast/world_meast_libya-jihadists_1_al-qaeda-leader-ayman-al-zawahiri-gadhafi-regime?_s=PM:MIDDLEEAST">Example2</a>.   Flash forward a few months, and neighbouring Mali gets invaded by said radical groups.  </p>

<p>So, while I feel terrible for Mali which has been under invasion for months now, it pains me how few people realize this whole issue is direct blowback from our involvement in Libya.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Although such kind of blowback from the Libyan intevention was nearly universally predicted by antiwar advocates, I am unsure if unitended consequences describe the situation in Mali correctly. </p>

<p>While the US ally Saudi Arabia <a href="http://www.blackagendareport.com/content/mali-wahabis-and-saudis-following-money-trail">supports</a> the Wahabi islamists, the US had trained those Mali officers who initiated the coup d&#39;etat against the elected president Amadou Toumani Touré in 2012. This coup happened just 5 weeks before an election. The appointed interrim government reached out to foreign powers and called for help in the fight against the rebels.</p>

<p>So in a way the US and NATO supports one side in a proxy war, while the allied Saudi Arabia supports the other side. I no longer buy the humanitarian reasons (support for fundamentalists in Syria, but opposition to them in Mali). Destabilization and chaos might not be the dreaded outcome, it might be the goal.</p>

<p>Chaos usually goes hand in hand with a military presence and an undemocratic government. This makes it easier to ignore the will of the average Malian. Neocolonalistic corporations can loot Mali&#39;s resources (for example uranium and gold) without the necessity to outbid the Chinese competition. Furthermore African independence is subverted, and the military industrial complex is greased.</p>

<p>In this context it is also interesting to note that Gaddafi was very active in his attempts to emancipate Libya and Africa from corporate control. The revenue from sweet crude oil allowed Gaddafi to support various African nations and projects like for example the plan to build an African satellite (RASCOM) and the introdcution of a gold dinar as African currency.</p>

<p><em>Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity</em> might be a nice saying, but in these geopolitical situations the same kind of <em>stupidity</em> happens again and again. Those who push for intervention and covert support always seem to benefit from these scenarios. I believe more sinister motivations of the involved players describe the scenario much better.</p>

The movement is made up of Tuareg, and some of them are believed to have previously fought in the Libyan army,[7] during the 2011 Libyan civil war (though other Tuareg MNLA fighters were also on the side of the National Transitional Council[citation needed]) and returned to Mali after that war.</em></p>

<p>Just like Assad now, these dictators are cool with AQ when they are killing Americans in Iraq but when the tables turn they talk about global conspiracies.</p>

<p>AQ is going to recruit and train anywhere that there is an absence of the rule of law.  Chechnya, Somalia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Libya is not exactly special.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It isn&#39;t that simple.  The Tuareg of Mali were being used as mercenaries to kill Libyans opposed to Gaddafi.  Once they realized NATO was getting involved they took as much weapons and ammo as they could carry and came back home.  They teamed up with the local jihadist and created their own little country.  Within about 48 hours they realized just how bad they had fucked up (the Islamist were sawing people&#39;s hands off) and tried to kick them out.  By then the Islamist had outside support and had basically taken over the whole operation.</p>

<p>I definitely agree. Mali should rightfully call for whoever is available to help defend them from an invasion, absolutely.  But as complex as the situation actually is, the truth still is that if we did not overthrow Gaddafi, the Tuareg of Mali would not have been dragged into the mess as effectively as they were anyway.  And they would have most definitely not been able to use Libya as a staging ground like they currently are.</p>

<p>Dragged?  They were paid mercenaries.  They were hired specifically because they had no qualms about spraying peaceful Libyan protests with 7.62 fire.  They allied themselves with the Islamist and are feeling the blowback for that choice right now.  Mali was already a coop waiting to happen, fucking Mauretania was sending aircraft to bomb Islamist training sites inside Mali like a year before all this shit kicked off.</p>
