       Just some raw thoughts on porn observations and reading about Iceland and banning pornography, and it seems to me as one of the countries that stick out as far as losing a grip from a group of people who use vulgar exploits (media, movies, music, porno) for control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its because I got more empathy now and a better understanding of people. When I watch porn now I am triggered to think what has happened in society to where this girl has to be in this situation. Could be my sister, mom, relative, friend? I felt bad, and then bad that I have a condition where I get pleasure off it...and just in a matter of quick thinking im doing something else and have moved on. I still watch it when I get an urge, but its gone from 2-3 times a week to once a week. I hope to not watch it anymore and get pleasure from something else that is better in my view. Its like getting pleasure off people getting exploited...and if they really chose that position, would most encourage it? I dobut it...and the ones that do a very small percentage. The world seems to be suffering from exploits at every angle, but this one I think is one of the most bizarre to me.

       It is the criminalization of a victimless activity.  Some would view it as thought-policing.

       Probably what this guy said. Sex is natural and a part of regular human life, and porn has existed in one way or another since we have been painting shit on cave walls. I do think, however, that internet porn can be highly addictive and damaging to your brain in a number of ways. Moderation is the important thing, as with all pleasures in life. 
As other people have said, there is a lot of shady shit that happens even in the professional porn industry; exploitation is definitely happening. That doesn't mean that everyone involved is being exploited, though.

       What I would look at is the billions made by the leaders in the industry. I would liken their stance on what they do to others as what most banks and major corporations do and think... "Sure people are going to get hurt, but is it really our responsibility to inform them of the risks being taken? We are a part of society after all."

       For a girl, you could earn from $100k to $300k a year working in professional porn. I don't know about you but when I see those numbers I don't see them being exploited, that seems like more then a fair price for something you would be doing anyways (though less obscene). Amateur POV porn is just that, amateur. People who thought it would be fun, who wanted the attention or figured they were hot enough to make thousands climax from the safety of their own home. Is it wrong morally? Perhaps, but that is circumstantial when moderation is the key.

       About how much abuse, mental, physical and narcotics - goes on in the legitimate porn industry? Or is it about porn being used as a form of manipulation, population control, moral and social disintegration / gender segregation and objectification? I don't have time to read into it atm, if you could be more specific.

       I do feel like im educating myself when i read about this stuff, but i still need to chill out sometimes and do 'normal' stuff like play video games and watch TV. I'd collapse of fucking stress if this was all i did. Although commercials and the news now piss me off quite a lot.

       I wouldn't say sports is wasting time either - there's nothing wasted in being healthy and enjoying a physical sport.

       Nope. My brain and my balls are two different things. I love to think and learn but, that doesn't make me want to stop blowing my load. I think more clearly after I rub one out.

       It's a documentary about a woman going into the porn industry and how it changed her. It is worth a watch. The managers make money based on what the women they represent do in films. They coerce women into doing things they normally wouldn't do just to make a buck. It's sad and the porn industry, I am happy to say, is something I no longer support.

       As much as it might suck for some people in those situations, I am a firm believer that you have at least some hand in your fate and especially in America should take responsibility for where you are in your adult life. That isn't to say that times aren't rough or some of these people could very well be exploited. I just feel better about my life and opportunities and feel empowered if I hold myself accountable for my future.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said I know certain people involved in this sort of industry and can't say I have any pity for certain individuals. Some people find it empowering, some later find it stigmatizing, and people can be good or bad regardless of career choice. I would like to think by the time you are old enough to be in porn you are old enough to think through decisions that may effect the rest of your life.

       Same as you said, used to beat it everyday due to boredom but now its like watching an animal being treated badly.. Worse, a human who clearly isn't enjoying it.. Guess i'm not 13 anymore and that's whats up...
      </p>
      <p>
       When I do though, I try to search for the legit amateur stuff, at least I think their not being exploited...

       The more I see of it, the less I watch TV.  I probably watch less porn as a percentage compared to the rate of it being released too.

       When you're hungry do you watch a video of people eating? When you're tired do you watch a video of people sleeping? When you have to take a shit do you watch a video or do you take a shit? If you want to fuck go fuck a girl. If you can't get one you're better off using your imagination. Fuck Porn, for so many reasons.

       There's no restraint in our culture, it's part of the program, giving in to every urge is part of it. I don't care if the person is exploited or not. I just don't need it.

       I feel like those people are enjoying it on some level, whether it be there in room, when they get their money, etc, so why shouldn't I enjoy it, as long as i don't put it in their face or associate them only with sex. And we're all the same life so it doesn't really matter where you get off, it's not great for everyone but it's just a little orgasm here and there.
