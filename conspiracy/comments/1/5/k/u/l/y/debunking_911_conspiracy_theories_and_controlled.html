<p>I used to have a different opinion on 9/11 before looking at the information on this website. Really the only thing it dosen&#39;t cover is the Israeli/Mossad 9/11 connection. Take your time if you haven&#39;t seen this site yet. Carefully come to a conclusion and then let us have an intelligent discussion about the 9/11 disaster with no ideologies or emotions getting in the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. </p>

<p>Noting that some of those posts are likely paid debunkers it&#39;s always best to defer to the actual scientists themselves on the subject of science. After all a random amazon reviewer is in no better position to speak on physics than is a theologian. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but is the implication that every single one of the people featured in the film are not &quot;actual&quot; architects or engineers because they disagree with the official conspiracy theory. Does inquiring further than the watered down 911 commission automatically make anyone and everyone a &quot;wackjob?&quot;</p>

<p>Cause if so the heads of the 911 commission themselves (and other very prominent washigton insiders) would be &quot;wackjobs&quot; as well. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/contributed/high-level-officials-eager-spill-beans-about-what-really-happened-911-%E2%80%A6-no-one-washingto">http://www.zerohedge.com/contributed/high-level-officials-eager-spill-beans-about-what-really-happened-911-â€¦-no-one-washingto</a></p>

<p>Btw the correct spelling of that word would be whack-jobs. And tha word itself so clearly identifies any person who employs it seriously as a gov shill or an individual incapable of difficult analysis. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re both, but you&#39;re definitely one of the two. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure they all are, but architects and most engineers are far from structural engineers and would have no more knowledge of this than you or me.  There is no indication that any of those that signed that petition have any more information than &quot;I want more information&quot; which is a fair enough position.  But if it was seriously questionable to structural engineers why have such a small subset come forward with questions?  It&#39;s certainly not fear of losing their career as implied elsewhere.  No one would really care.</p>

<p>Well I make too much to be a government employee so I guess I&#39;m option two?  Or maybe I&#39;m neither and you&#39;re just calling me that because I don&#39;t agree with your beliefs?</p>

<p>You chose not to believe the official story.  I chose to not believe everyone with a youtube account.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can something fall at free fall if it has resistance? How were the plains not shot down (which is standard for the air force)? Why were there 50 plains that were &quot;fake hi-jacked&quot; by the US governments to test this if the situation could happen? Why was a passport of one of the alleged hi-jackers found in perfect condition in the reble, if the blast from the jet fuel, which he would have been directly in, was hot enough to melt iron? Why are many of the alleged hi-jackers still alive today? I really doubt the web-site could ever touch on all if any of those, but if it did, please enlighten me. Let us have an intelligent conversation.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t cover everything obviously. I just want people to be aware of these articles. I used to think that the towers were exploded via controlled demolition/nano thermite.

<p>I used to think that we didn&#39;t know how the buildings fell therefore it was an inside job. Not true we have answers now to how it fell.
<a href="http://www.debunking911.com/pull.htm">http://www.debunking911.com/pull.htm</a></p>

<p>Just read on the site. What it covers is that the buildings were not exploded and we know how they fell. Now I believe we did know ahead of time about the attack and could have easily prevented it. That said, the only thing the website covers is that this isn&#39;t &quot;the first time a steel framed building has collapsed by fire&quot; and other ridiculous claims that I used to believe and that people still spout off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems that most of this info is completely false. The part with world trade center 7, is horseshit, there is no fucking way in hell that building would fall, and all the closer buildings would be unharmed. There have also been plenty of scientists who found thermite as well as molten metal for weeks. The most important thing it is missing is the fact of the pass port being found. In addition, the person who designed the world trade centers said that it was pulled, and that it didn&#39;t collapse on it&#39;s own. That website is most likely, in my opinion, a misinformation website put up by the CIA. </p>

<p>Wow, thats a lot of blather... from someone with no credentials and no reason for anyone to consider he knows what the hell he&#39;s talking about.</p>

<p>Well, thats one theory. A stupid one, but ok. Sorry man, but you just cant make shit up and expect to be taken seriously, you need witnesses, evidence, and I dont know - experts? - to analyze it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/">theory</a> from actual experts, with credentials, evidence and a metric fuckton of witness testimony...</p>

<p>As laymen playing Top Trumps - you lose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He said cables pulled down tower 7.</p>

<p>NIST didnt say anything about cables.</p>

<p>There are no witness accounts mentioning cables.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no evidence at all indicated cables were used to &quot;pull&quot; the building - except 1 picture he posted with an arrow and the word &quot;cable&quot;.</p>

<p>There is no expert testimony saying that it is even possible to pull down a 47 story building using firetrucks and cables. And even if it were possible, good luck finding anyone who would tell you that this was a good idea under any circumstance.</p>

<p>There. Debunked.</p>

<p>Thats a false argument - thats like, after a local cop investigates a crime, saying &quot;yeah, but less than .0000009% of cops in the world bothered to come to his conclusion so it must be wrong&quot;.</p>

<p>Thats what separates professionals from jackasses. As a professional with decades of experience, you spend the time, analyze the facts - then put your career and reputation on the line - by coming out and accusing the governments story of being bullshit.</p>
