    <div class="md"><p>Fellow Engineer here.  Engineering is tough, but hang in there.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to look at your predicament.</p>

<p>1) Ease up on the &quot;conspiracy porn&quot;. You&#39;re right. It will make you depressed.  Stay aprised of news via alternative sources, but don&#39;t spend every waking minute on it.</p>

<p>2) Despite the nature of the world today, it really is one of the best times to be alive.  You&#39;re probably relatively safe, still have a fair amount of civil rights that were not afforded to your ancestors.</p>

<p>3) Get involved in an issue and become an advocate.  Gun rights, free speech, internet freedom.  Whatever you&#39;re most passionate about.  Persuade others, contact your reps (they will respond to pressure) - and better yet, get involved at the local (state/county) level where you can actually get stuff done.  Vote in the primaries, and organize for the primaries where you have better odds of changing the course of the discussion, albeit slightly.</p>

<p>So yes, things are bad, but things could be a heck of a lot worse.</p>

<p>The only alternative is to kill yourself and what a tragedy that would be.  We need you, your children will need you, the future needs you - alive, aware, and working for the good.  Don&#39;t give up on all of us.  Pull yourself together, get focused, get a decent job as an engineer and help advance the cause of liberty and freedom the best way that YOU see fit.</p>

<p>Good luck</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can do anything with that kind of knowledge.</p>

<p>Think of it this way; engineers in the zombie Apocalypse will be some of the most valued members of communities ;)</p>

<p>In all seriousness, there is real world applications through engineering knowledge, more so than economics or sales.  Math is powerful, and the application of math is &quot;godly&quot;.</p>

<p>Pick a topic that you enjoy in engineering and go down that road hard.  Let the knowledge that you have inspire you to be a knowledgeable engineer in the future.  Let it motivate you to get up and get to class in the morning.</p>

<p>I would even consider looking into some alternative thinking on whatever specialization you decide from engineering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just think about this, human history has shown that we have always had the master slave paradigm. It isn&#39;t new what they are doing to us (the mass propagation of lies to control their most valuable assets). You are just now seeing it so it seems new to you maybe.</p>

<p>I am sullied sometimes myself but life is that way. When it comes to the TRUTH we can get really emotionally invested, as we should. Although I am optimistic, and I&#39;ll tell you why.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundredth_monkey_effect">This principle called the &quot;100th monkey effect&quot;</a> is talking about monkey, but, with regard to primal social behavior I believe there is a critical point where the masses will open their minds. And that is truly where this fight should be fought.. in the minds of the slaves. We must all have the desire to free ourselves and, well, it helps if other people are doing it too. </p>

<p>There is a TED talk about <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2010/04/01/how_to_start_a/">how to start a movement</a> that shows the 100th monkey effect quite clearly. </p>

<p>So I believe this is also the case for the truth movement. I mean, even today I see the momentum <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/15mmad/amber_lyon_a_threetime_emmy_award_winning/">on /r/politics where a CNN is getting some much needed flogging by Amber Lyon</a>. The truth is gaining popularity. It wont vote out the traitors but if we were all on the same page... hmmmm we will see soon I think. I believe there is an era of enlightenment that is opening up to us all. The <em>modern</em> internet is making it possible to be so much more interconnected to each other. I believe that will have a major effect on how the 100th monkey effect will manifest.</p>

<p>And last but not least.  Fight back at them trying to make your life miserable by making it great instead. Cause FUCK em&#39; that&#39;s why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The important thing here is to protect yourself, your family, your friends and your community. If you are uneducated, it makes you weaker. You need to be strong to survive in this fucked-up world. You don&#39;t need/want to become rich or powerful, but you do need to survive. We need to fight against corruption. To do this we need smart educated people who know the difference between right and wrong. Talk to your parents about this type of problem. They may be able to tell you some good ideas about it. Talk to your friends/classmates and they may be able to give you a new perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take life less seriously, nobody makes it out alive.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to keep positive when you come to realise some of these truths but if you cannot preserve your own humanity then what is the point of being human?</p>

<p>Remember, now you have the truth and knowledge is power, it&#39;s up to you what you do with it.
I was in a similar situation when I first entered the rabbit hole, I was half way through completing my degree and I decided to drop out of University after learning more and more about the system we live in.
I took control and decided to start unplugging myself from the Matrix, it was the scariest thing I had ever done but after I had made up my mind, I felt liberated.</p>

<p>It took me a few years before I started to overcome those feelings of immense despair but it really is up to you how you take it all on board and decided to move on, just stay positive.
Can you understand why other people have such a hard time accepting the sort of information that comes up on this board, it&#39;s hard to have your entire system of belief collapse around you.
Keep your friends, loved ones and community at the forefront of your thoughts and spread the peace.</p>

<p>Practical steps that are always going to help:
*Start working out regularly, it&#39;s no secret, exercise makes you feel good.
*Start to eat healthy and learn more about where your food is coming from, if you have the space start a small vegetable patch, if you&#39;re in a dorm, start growing herbs in pots on your windowsill.
*Stop and smell the flowers, for every bit of dark make sure you see some light, it&#39;s still a beautiful world, get out in to nature, listen to your favorite album, appreciate things for what they are, don&#39;t start getting in to the trap of &#39;everything is worthless&#39; IT WILL KILL YOU.</p>

<p>I hope I&#39;ve helped.
Goodluck</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay Bubba. I&#39;ll give you some advice. That&#39;s exactly how the 1% want you to feel. That&#39;s to make you feel worthless than them as a human being and prey upon you. In effect right now you are letting them in your pyche and winning.</p>

<p>Now ask yourself and dig deep down in the soul. Are you gonna be a quitter, and cave in like a lamb? Else are you gonna rise up out of your funk, and be a LION of a man, get good grades in a shitty system. Play it back on them by succeeding in life, raise a good family, and help your fellow men overcome the bullshit. Sometimes you just have to get ornery at the crap bit at the same time know when to be happy and spread good things as well.</p>

<p>Therefore who do you answer toward: yourself or them? Now snap out of it or else you are gonna fade away and die off.</p>

<p>Never let the bastards get you down and never be like them. It&#39;s a fight that you will always face for the rest of your life. Just like the rest of us and the majority of the world will walk on you if you let it. Decide what kind of man or boy you want to be. Start planning your life and where you want to be 10 years and 20 years from now. You don&#39;t have to be financially rich. Just strong enough to support yourself, family and help a few others out when the time comes.</p>

<p>Now go get up and go get them sob&#39;s!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Focus on your heart. Think of every breath in and out going into your heart (hold your hand over your heart at first to bring awareness to it). Slow even breaths at a pace that is comfortable; not forced. Then think of something that makes you happy like a loved one, a walk on the beach, appreciation, etc. Do this for 5-10mins everyday. If your going into a situation that especially makes you depressed ot anxious do this before hand and direct the good feelings into the space your going to occupy. </p>

<p>The people who commit atrocities against mankind are evil. They love to think of you suffering. They feed off your sorrow and despair. Deny them the pleasure of disimpowering you. If you allow them to put you into a state of depression they&#39;ve already won. Fight against them by living your life in a positive way.</p>

<p>You will find that happiness, like depression is contagious. Don&#39;t become and agent for despair. Help uplift those around you. You think more clearly and are healthier in happier  states of being. Don&#39;t let them cripple you! </p>

Just take a deep breath and go out and have a drink with your friends. Don&#39;t believe everything you read. Also - be prepared. If you follow conspiracy theory your eyes are open. If you are thinking, you are winning.</p>

<p>-Bill Hicks</p>

<p>“Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly, and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love – for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment is it perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you from misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labours and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world.” </p>

<p>-Max Ehrmann</p>

<p>My wife started reading a lot more before I did and had the same issue. Here is how we helped her get over the hill.</p>

<p>Start with something small that you have control over, like your health, and when you feel you have a good grasp on that move on to something new that interests you that you might not have as much direct control over.</p>

<p>The key is to start small and move forward.  If you bite off too much at once you&#39;ll feel overwhelmed and not have as much progress to show as you think you should (and get more depressed).</p>

<p>Make small little goals, and if you win, celibate them.  If you lose look at why you lost and try to correct and move forward.</p>

<p>This is not something that is just with this kind of stuff; professional athletes use methods like this to improve also.  Take a goal break it down into small manageable tasks/goals and get to it.</p>

<p>Godspeed and good luck.</p>

<p>I say <strong>Fuck That</strong>.</p>

<p>This is my life and I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m going to give up and give in that easily. There IS a point to putting forth effort, even if that means you simply die on your feet. Because at least you didn&#39;t die on your knees. </p>

<p>For day to day living - I say you should spend no more time reading conspiracies than you spend on homework/schoolwork. At least until you bring your grades back up. Even though I know the education system is corrupt as well, it is still important to do your best at school. It&#39;s important to do your best at anything you do, be it quantum mechanics or sweeping floors. </p>

<p>Ultimately, you have to be the one to decide what is best for you. But you do have to decide... otherwise someone else will decide for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in school when I learned of these things.  I didn&#39;t care much for HS so it didn&#39;t affect my grades.  The best way to live in every case is to live the way you want, with happiness.  There is time for more achievements.  Keep certain things in your life seperate from world ideas.  As if you were leaving the matrix to find calm and refuge, only to step back in to fight hard.  When I think about the future it charges me up because there is so much potential for good, which is what I want to witness and the bad, which is what I want to fight against with all my heart.  As we get closer to the intersection between destruction and salvation, the tides are turning. I think there is a resonable chance our kids may see a better world.  After all, these people want you to fall apart, stop, amd give up, to be passive and stay on the sidelines.  If you bring your spirits up and live the best life you can despite the forces working against you, then you&#39;ve already won.  I know I have.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We didn&#39;t come into this world as a society, or as a civilization, we come into this world as people; as individual human beings. The goal is to make it okay for yourself and those around you - more than okay, preferably, for everyone that you possibly can.</p>

<p>You need to love them, that&#39;s the only answer. Fighting isn&#39;t going to work, universal human compassion and understanding is the only thing that&#39;s going to help you.</p>

<p>See the elite and their followers as mind-numbing children - because that is what they are. You spend too much time thinking about it, you either become Alex Jones and begin trying to make money off of it to &quot;awaken others&quot;, or you don&#39;t, and end up cynical and unhappy, unable to care because you know too much. You either see everyone <em>else</em> as retarded, or you end up seeing yourself that way for not being able to DO anything, knowing things that &quot;no one else&quot; does.</p>

<p>The only thing you can do is take strength from the fact YOU are doing the right thing, genuinely, the right thing - pretend like you&#39;ve been placed into adverse conditions by yourself to see how well you do, to see if you let your soul be crushed by it, or if you thrive and help those around you to do the same.</p>

<p>Fighting isn&#39;t going to do anything. You&#39;re going to die. Your mom and dad, your brothers and sisters, your girlfriends - they&#39;re all going to die. There was never a bit of &quot;hope&quot; to hold onto. Everyone has their own experiential course through life, some of them are based on our own choices, some aren&#39;t - worry about the things that ARE, rather than the things that aren&#39;t. You are in power over your own life, try to help other people have power over theirs, and love them the same way you would love yourself, even an &quot;unawakened&quot; version of yourself who had been brainwashed/psychologically conditioned from birth.</p>

<p>You have to find a way to survive, thrive, live, and love in the world that you were born into, you have to find a way to make your own life meaningful to yourself and those around you in a good way. Pretend like this is the only life you&#39;ll ever live, but at the same time, realize you came into this world alone, and you&#39;ll be leaving it that way. Remember what is important to you, and don&#39;t let anyone make you stray from it; also, forgive those who don&#39;t hold the same things as important, because you&#39;re living your own life here - so are they.</p>

<p>You&#39;re alone, but you&#39;re not alone. We&#39;re all going through that. Don&#39;t fight, be okay, love one another. Find a way to be okay in your own life. You didn&#39;t create the problems here on your own(AT ALL), and you&#39;re not going to solve them on your own. All you can do is be part of a wave of people making things better and more true to the spirit of everyone&#39;s hopes and dreams rather than worse and less true every day. That&#39;s all; and that&#39;s good enough.</p>

Things will be and stay fucked for at least a few generations still.  That means that your life and my life won&#39;t necessarily get any better.</p>

<p>That being said, I also know that these bodies and these lives we are currently living in are only individual manifestations of a greater creative expression on the part of a greater identity that is responsible for these lives and bodies...and this greater creative expression/identity exists beyond whatever happens here on this planet.</p>

<p>This life might suck, but the energy that is responsible for it exists beyond and independent of it and this place.  After this life is over, things should be a bit better...for a time at least.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see...</p>

<p>While I&#39;m here at least, I try to be as cool and chill and nice and helpful to others as possible.  Doesn&#39;t always work out that well, of course, and sometimes I&#39;m an outright asshole, but I at least TRY to be as cool and good as possible - knowing that we all come from the same place, and we&#39;ll all get to the same place eventually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand how a lot of articles on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> can be very alarming. But I try and talk sense whenever I can in this subreddit, because its kind of irresponsible to spread misleading info. Things aren&#39;t as bad or urgent as a lot of conspiracy stories claim. They are just that, stories, they aren&#39;t fact, they might be based on some facts but the vast majority is sensationalized. Think about it this way: these articles are written to get a rise out of people so more people will read them, the authors aren&#39;t concerned with reliability of sources and they are never concerned with giving the reader the whole, unadulterated, facts. </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t lose hope for all society just because of a couple of alarming stories. They will never affect your daily life, so you shouldn&#39;t let them affect your mood. Be concerned about your immediate surroundings, spend time and take care of your family, they are the ones that need your attention more than some far off problem that probably will never affect you directly. </p>

<p>Corruption isn&#39;t as common as you believe, observe the people on a local level and you will see people are mostly good. This system we live in has been built up for thousands of years, and the people that keep it going are more concerned about people&#39;s rights than you might believe because they themselves are people and so are their families. </p>

<p>Maybe school is just not engaging enough for you, you might feel like you are not making a difference. Maybe if you volunteer in a cause that you feel is worth your time. Maybe helping seniors live a happier life, or helping to protect a national park, maybe even working at an animal rescue center or whatever gives you a sense of community and accomplishment. </p>

<p>Edit: If this doesn&#39;t help it is never wrong to ask for professional help, your mental health is as important as your physical health, if you see big changes in your mental health it is important to get it checked out.</p>
