        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As per the Wikipedia article:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots">&quot;In a departure from the usual procedure, which is to tackle and cuff a suspect, King was tasered, kicked in the head, beaten with PR-24 batons for over one minute, then tackled and cuffed. The officers claimed that King was under the influence of PCP at the time of arrest, which caused him to be very aggressive and violent towards the officers. The video showed that he was crawling on the ground during the beating and that the police made no attempt to cuff him.  A subsequent test for the presence of PCP turned up negative.&quot;</a></p>

<p>This happens all the time now, and no one bats an eyelash...ಠ_ಠ</p>

<p>...up nort in the &quot;civilized&quot; part of the country, throw-aways were practically standard issue.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not as much fun shooting someone dead as it is beating the living shit out of them until they&#39;re dead, but hey, at the end of the day the effect is the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The video showed&quot;.. This right here should raise a red flag. We see a tiny piece of a 13-minute video, and we are making a ruling? This is a problem with the media: improper focus and spin. If this would have happened now, I bet this case would have played out differently. Do we know or not whether there was violent behavior by King? Also once the outrage spreads, King is the clear-cut victim, making his test results &#39;negative&#39;, even if they weren&#39;t. </p>

<p>*Edit: I&#39;m not advocating the LAPD beating peoples&#39; asses. I&#39;m merely pointing out the need for proper perspectives. </p>
