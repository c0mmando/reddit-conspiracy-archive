       Puzzle pieces seem to fit. They attach extras onto bills all the time. A last minute fix all bill for the fiscal cliff, rushed through on new years, later found out to have a gun control bill attached. Just guessing.  What do you guys think? Possible?

       Yeah, possible, but not really worth worrying about, because it happens or it doesn't - if a deal is made and a law is enacted, chances are the Congresspeople and their staffs won't even have had time to read it before voting, and will be trusting their leadership who tell them how to vote.

       If a law does pass nothing will happen. It'll be the quiet before the storm. Eventually the government will go after a militia or enthusiast with a stockpile and there will be minute Waco incidents all over. They may happen at the same time or spread out over a few years. Finally most of the guns will have been round up.

       Are there any stats on gun theft spikes around gun buybacks?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems odd to me that multiple people with rocket launchers decide they don't want them anymore, so they give them to family members in other households to go turn in for $200.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, as a wise man once said "sometimes they don't think it be like that, but it do."

      <p>
       Perhaps I need to heed this wisdom.

       why are you people so afraid of gun control? you think your pea shooter will matter against tanks and jets? Jesus, the government wants us to have guns, we are really good at killing each other with them but so far have failed to use them to stop any of the bull shit laws from getting passed. they conveniently make us feel safe from government control, but constantly afraid of each other.

       Does the government represent the people anymore? No. So why would you just give up to those who infiltrated the peoples government? It is a transition stage to take all control away from the people. I have many answers to this but don't want to rant.

       transitional stage my ass, they can jail any one indefinitely without a trial for the slightest suspicion of terrorism. that's taking control anyway, and here you guys are cradling your guns murmuring about freedom, if they are suppose to protect our freedom, why are we loosing it all? america has the most guns our of any country by a long shot, shouldn't that mean we have the most freedom? gun control is not a problem its just another issue to keep us divided and afraid.

       Punishing law abiding citizens for the illegal crimes of a crazy person is illogical... ............................I am a fur tanner for a living. Guns control would effect my ability to make a living. Do you understand all the jobs that rely on legal gun ownership? Way more than you think. About 100 full time taxidermist just in my tiny tiny county . Or the double digit billions of dollars that our economy receives from legal gun ownership and hunting.....I understand you probably live in a big city where guns are illegally owned by gangs and criminals, that won't change with gun control laws. Criminals don't follow the laws. This country is bigger than your personal bubble.

       Automatics are not being sold to the average gun owner. The media and gun grabbers are portraying any hunting rifle without a wooden stock as an assault rifle. Even though that is just aesthetics. Watch the video, the policeman explains this..

       I think you will find that when the assault rifles are banned they will not be defined as one without a wooden stock.  Relax your business will not be affected.  How many hunters hunt with a 50 magazine automatic weapon?

       gun control laws don't often try to outlaw all guns. they try to outlaw guns designed to kill people, fully automatic weapons and concealable weapons. they also try to put restrictions in place to prevent crazy people from buying guns, or sane people from allowing their guns to fall into the hands of crazy people. this is r/ conspiracy not r/ politics, so the political aspect of gun ownership hardly belongs here, all i am saying is that the government is using gun ownership against us, saying how they keep us same from government control, but they are not stopping anything, they just keep us afraid of crazed gunmen

       "Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership" i have to admit, interesting source.
      </p>
      <p>
       and i have not looked into all of the claims in that chart, but "The 1938 German Weapons Act" was actually fairly relaxed, it just boiled down to "no jews" you only needed a permit for hand guns, most people were exempt for needing a permit (nazi party members, government workers, hunters, etc..) no regulation on rifles of any kind and the only real requirement for a permit was that you be 18.
      </p>
      <p>
       also on the opposite side of the argument, japan has very strict gun control laws, no genocides recently, and a gun related death rate of about 10 a year. so the chart is just sort of cherry picking a few events and trying to link them together. im sure you could find a number of innocent events that happened before a genocide and throw them in a chart like this, like fierce nationalism tends to proceed genocides and tyrannical leaders, so i guess we had better stop liking america so much...
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway not trying to argue with you personally, that chart just sort of irked me by being sort of misleading
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: also Guatemala kills 100-200 thousand people over 20 years? that's suppose to be a genocide? thats about 1/4 Americas suicide rate..

       really? i dont even know how to respond to this. pistols and assault rifles are meant to be used against people, semi auto rifles, like the hunting ones, not very good VS human, huge damage penalty, they do bonus damage to animals though.(yes i am being sarcastic in that last part).
