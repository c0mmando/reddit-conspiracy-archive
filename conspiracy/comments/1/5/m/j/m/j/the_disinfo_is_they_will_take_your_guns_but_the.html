       With that said, how did you come to this conclusion? I figured that people overseas have access to rifles all the time but its not really used compared to other weapons they make when fighting tyranny (LRAD, armored vehicles, etc etc). I knew Alex Jones was an agent when he had those staged videos of him going to Bohemian Grove. Anways most people on Reddit concerned about this topic are in fear/panic mode and sleepwalking while seeing your local police department turn into military-style-soldiers.

       Did you know even in jail (DMV-area) they are switching out the cop uniforms to BDUs?

       Idk, as a veteran who's seen my local PD in action I disagree with the "military-style-soldiers" part. The local cops are ALL fucked up like a football bat, tactically speaking. Give me 8 men with CIBs and I'll bet you we could take out a relatively large opposing police force. A uniform does not a soldier make.

       I don't know where you live, but here in Texas, most of the larger cities (sans Corpus Christi) have been switching from blue to black uniforms gradually over the last 2 years, all while we have less marked police cars on the streets, and and they're getting more armed all around.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with your last statement, 100%. But to the population at large, just a VISUAL change is enough to impose a threat.

       I'm from Texas. Idk what threat you're feeling but I dont feel one... at all. Cops dont scare me. Even a cop with his gun drawn doesnt scare me, I've seen them shoot. They're fat, inaccurate, slow, weak and inexperienced in unit to unit combat. Look at how many cops that ONE Marine who had only been to basic killed. Now imagine 10 of that guy, armed with better weapons and all combat experienced. If the GWOT vets that the DHS labeled a "potential terrorist group" ever unified and went active, we'd take this bitch over in a few days. Looking dangerous is not the same as being dangerous. Spread that info around to the public. You and me can effect major change just with word of mouth
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a vid of the aforementioned Marine:

       Again, totally agree, so long as you're John fucking Rambo. The 95% of the population with absolutely no combat training whatsoever might not have the same mentality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also never said I felt threatened. I was just pointing out how the police in Texas have changed their visual tactics in an attempt to appear more menacing to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as me personally, SAPD is full of asshole cops (lead by asshole #1, Manus), but nothing that intimidates me any more than any other cop in any other city. I think all of this boils down to the shift that's become more clear lately: the cops no longer protect the citizens, but are now only just the imposer of rules/laws/intimidation to the lower and middle class.

       For the most part, yes. There still are some good ones out there like the one that went viral with his defense of peoples 1A rights. But, for the most part you're spot on with your analysis of cops.

       Just wanna add as a side note- the police who showed up to columbine were too afraid to enter the school to fight the kids, the only time they shot back was when they were fired upon from the library windows. I wouldve gone in alone if I were in that position and would rather die trying than be a coward like that.

       Some PD's have been going paramilitary for longer than others. The NYPD, for example, isn't 40,000 uniformed killing machines, but their ESU (like SWAT) is armed to the teeth and has access to APCs, drones, and helicopters.

       I'm up in Spokane,Wa, and the cops here are brutal. There are still some fat ones, but most of them are big guys who like to shoot stuff. I've lived here for twenty years, and they've always had black uniforms. They've also started standard issuing AR-15's instead of a bean-bag shotgun. I guess there's a reason why Snoop called us Spocompton.

       One has to come before the other, it would be near impossible to disarm the unwilling without this militarized police force (or simply a military force).
      </p>
      <p>
       I do find the militarization of police disturbing, it shows much confidence in their foot soldiers and a lack of confidence in the "slow and steady" approach we are used too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had my safe money on government-assisted secession leading to the first coup, but more and more it seems like slide into tyranny will be fully organic and almost entirely unopposed.

       because this is 'Merica, where they try to scare you into beliveing their agenda. after this last tragedy, even tho you cant tell when someones gunna snap, they have to do someone thing in support of the children, so the GOV makes the impression to the people yes were here to save you, and were doing everything we can to prevent this, even tho they cant prevent anything.

       I've seen them in straight up camo, &amp; that was like nearly two years ago. It was in a local gun shop that sells their own custom AR (I forget the brand name), that also was advertised that they supplied the local PD with them, possibly said SWAT. But ya, cop totally in camo, it was disturbing.

       The switching to bdus has no relevance to militarization. I work at a gun store/ leo supplier. Most of our departments we have switched to TDUs as a class b simply because theyre cheaper. Most class a uniforms range in the 200-300 dollar range, whereas a BDU/TDU getup is half that price for each officer to pay.

       Also, fuckin pockets man. Pockets galore.

       What crap title and crap info. The police much of it is already federalized and militarized and has been for the past 3-10 years, depending on which department individually.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: And yes more police state overall isn't good, doesn't change the fact they are going for the guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, that is already a done deal, what they want to do now is really ban guns and they will do it, in fact I think(know) you are a disinfo agent, based on your 1 hour profile and name.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you are scared that Alex Jones has been on the forefront exposing the gun grabbing agenda and Israel's hypocrisy when it comes to protecting their schools, but having agents like Fainstein come and introduce gun bans.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know he reaches over 10 million people each week, you know you can't shut him down as that would confirm much of what he's said and is going to be the biggest news internationally, so you need to use Alex Jones and some of the other Israeli shills who pretend as normal users, but bash Israel and Jews all day, to create the illusion that everyone is against Jews and Israel, but also use some real people ignorance of the situation and use Alex Jones to improve your point that "oh no they are not coming for your guns, don't be conspiracy theorists, ahhahaha, you are not going to be taken yours guns), while at the same time there are bills introduces in the senate, calls for Obama to act executevely, calls for confiscation of guns and forced buy-backs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm exposing you shill !!!!
