    <div class="md"><p>Serious question, how do we know he even went to Sandy Hook? There are no eyewitnesses, no camera footage, no independent evidence of a body (unless someone has a picture?), no autopsy, no confirmed cause of death, no car belonging to him or anyone who knew him that could have taken him there. </p>

<p>And who identified the body as Adam Lanza, and how were they able to do it so quickly? If Adam Lanza&#39;s body is at Sandy Hook, did someone (eg Chris Rodia) deposit his dead body at the school?</p>

<p>All we have is &quot;official sources&quot; saying they found Ryan Lanza&#39;s ID on a dead body. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a television interview with the Chief Medical Examiner the day after the shooting in which he gave details of the number of bullet wounds and the type of weapon used on at least 7 of the dead children. </p>

<p>Bearing that in mind, as well as how we have been told about Adam Lanza&#39;s life, his medical issues and so on, it seems odd that the details of his death have not been released. </p>

<p>This was clearly wrong, but how was Adam Lanza&#39;s existence even know of at this point, let alone a positive identification made? </p>

<p>The only ID the police claim to have found was Ryan Lanza&#39;s.</p>

<p>The early reports mentioned that Adam Lanza had pleaded &quot;Let me in, let me in&quot; to the teacher in one of the locked classrooms. Those are the words of somebody trying to escape from something, rather than a killer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is some group grabbed him, killed his mother, dressed him up like the actual shooter, then massacred the kids, shot Lanza - the patsy - and ran before the cops got there. If Adam shot the kids then shot himself, how did the assault rifle get in the car truck? Does it make sense he&#39;d do the massacre inside, go outside and put the gun in the car, then go back in and kill himself? Do we get all neat and tidy about stowing our gun before we suicide?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The assault rifle was in the school. Shotgun in the truck. You are conflating reports of a rifle in the car, when reporters were out of sight from the scene, with actual evidence.</p>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-2" data-depth="2" data-id="c7l8tc5">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/pork2001.html">pork2001</a> 2012-12-23</p>
    <div class="md"><p>What truck? It was a Honda passenger vehicle and a rifle taking .223 ammo. That&#39;s not a shotgun.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I see in news reports: &quot;Earlier reports said that Adam Lanza had relied on two handguns, a Glock and a Sig Sauer, during the shooting, while a rifle was found in the trunk of his car. But according to a CNN news update:  [Lt. J. Paul Vance] told reporters that Adam Lanza used a Bushmaster AR-15 “assault-type weapon” most of the time at the school. Lanza was armed with magazines that held 30 bullets each, according to Vance. He said there were hundreds of bullets for the weapons as well. Vance told reporters that an additional weapon, a shotgun, was recovered from a vehicle Lanza parked outside of the school. &quot;</p>

<p>But I see conflicting reports that say there were three weapons inside the school. Washington Post says &quot;He had two semiautomatic pistols and a .223-caliber rifle, law enforcement officials said. He apparently used only the handguns, which were later found in the school. The rifle was found in the vehicle.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, all of this is confusing as it is conflicting.  No cop would mistake a rifle in a trunk with a shotgun. But it would make some sense if Adam was the patsy, and someone dressed like him to frame him did the shooting with a similar rifle, while the mother&#39;s rifle was in the truck of the car outside. Although there are witnesses who say he was the shooter, wasn&#39;t he in an outfit hiding his body and face? So it could have been someone masked setting him up to take the fall.  I&#39;m open to any news reports showing this is not possible. How could early reports have identified an AR in the truck, and then it switched to a shotgun. Doesn&#39;t sound right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s assuming they chose to be so stupid as to make it obvious it was a team and a frameup. An efficient really large massacre would have blown their attempt as impossible for one guy. So clearly they would have kept the numbers down to a plausible level, since the object was not to kill as many as possible but to create a talking point incident to take arms away from Americans.</p>

Why did the DHS buy 1.5 billion rounds of hollowpoints for use inside the US? Their life would be a lot easier in a takeover if the public was disarmed. So there&#39;s possible motive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the police scanner recording that went viral right after this happened. The police are heard apprehending several suspects and getting them &quot;proned out&quot;. One officer even says, &quot;be advised, we have multiple rifles and shot guns.&quot; How is one scrawny kid going to carry all that by himself? If the other guys they caught by the fire house and in the woods were innocent, why&#39;d they run and why&#39;d the cop report on his radio finding so many guns on them? The interview Katie Couric did with a family whose children survived was interesting as well because the woman got there right as it was happening. She said there was a car parked out front with &quot;all the doors open and black sweatshirts strewn about.&quot; Look for this interview. It&#39;s called something like &quot;One family&#39;s story if survival&quot; or something. Why would one shooter open all the car doors? Why would he have multiple black sweatshirts in or around his car? Could there have been more than one shooter, wearing the sweatshirts who then took them off and had cops uniforms underneath and pretended to be the first cops to arrive on the scene? Finally, what about the part in that police scanner where you can cleat hear a cop quietly say, &quot;End the life of Adam.&quot;? Has that been debunked yet??? As far as I know the recording is unedited and you can find it on an archive site. It&#39;s easier to do a YouTube search for it. What if the whole chase in the woods was a decoy or a plan by cops who might have been involved in the plot to get focus away from the school while the last pieces were put in place (Adam&#39;s suicide)? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I agree with you. It&#39;s gotten to the point where it&#39;s pretty disgusting. No one here seems to care or bother that 20 children and 7 adults died. Instead, they point their very fingers at people that don&#39;t exist and the very parents of the murdered children and call them fakes with little proof other then &quot;odd behavior&quot; that they don&#39;t agree with because it&#39;s different then how it&#39;s portrayed on tv shows and movies.</p>

<p>It&#39;s shit like that which drives people to suicide from harassment after their lost their family from a crazed gunman. </p>
