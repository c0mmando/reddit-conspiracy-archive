They are committing a holocaust in palestine, palestinians are semites. They committed a holocaust in iraq who are also semites. They are committing a holocaust in syria who are also semites. They are deporting and killing ethiopian immigrants in israel who are also semites due to racial mixing. They are more examples of this yet they still whine about the holocaust.  Ant criticism of the jews is anti-semetic yet they are not semites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jews are committing holocausts against every race in the world, not just Semites. They are directly contributing to the degeneration of Europeans as well, through the promulgation of homosexuality and abortion. They promote ghetto culture among the blacks through their control of the popular media, which contributes to their crime and the rate of children being born outside of marriage. There is no question that Jews are the biggest anti-semites and anti-human group on this world, as they have been for centuries and centuries, since the bastard Turkic Khazars converted to and corrupted the religion of the Hebrews. There is not much we can do but call attention to the plight of the Palestinians as much as we can. Help people see the Jewish root of the problems in Syria, Egypt, America, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, England and so forth hundreds more!</p>

You can deny it all you want, but I know this to be a fact about the Jews, the leeches of Europe. They regard us as animals unfit for anything but to serve them and leech off of us they do. Unfortunately, you can&#39;t get rid of a leech Jew because they&#39;ve indoctrinated our society so deeply with their double-speak. You get called an antisemite even if you don&#39;t hold a door open for a leech Jew these days.

    <div class="md"><p>From your linked article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The theory that the majority of Ashkenazi Jews are mainly the descendants of the non-Semitic converted Khazars or Europeans was advocated by various racial theorists and antisemitic sources in the late-19th and 20th centuries, especially following the publication of Arthur Koestler&#39;s The Thirteenth Tribe and Shlomo Sand&#39;s The Invention of the Jewish People.[46][47][48] Such proponents are motivated by the belief that if Ashkenazi Jews are primarily Khazar or European and not Semitic in origin, they would have no historical claim to Israel, nor would they be the subject of God&#39;s Biblical promise of Canaan to the Israelites, thus undermining both the historical/ethnic/national and theological basis of secular and religious Zionists, respectively. Despite recent genetic evidence to the contrary,[1] and a lack of any real mainstream scholarly support,[49] these beliefs are still popular among antisemites.[50][51]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do not understand the term &#39;Semite&#39; nor how it is applied to heritage.<br/>
Being a Semite has nothing to do with language. It describes a genetic origin. In other words, where your ancestors came from.        </p>

<p>And for a people who claim that they have the right to a land that they were expelled from 2000 years ago, where your ancestors are actually from is quite important.<br/>
If 90% of Israelis have no genetic roots from that part of the world, then even if you believe what they claim about their god promising the original Israelites that land, by definition they are excluded from this claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do agree with you, and am aware of the genetic origin of the people who claiming to be israelites. Unfortunately the term &#39;semitic&#39; is one of much ambiguity. I personally do not believe these people or any people have a divine right to Israel or any any land for that matter. Especially when atrocities as such have been committed in the name of such purpose. </p>
