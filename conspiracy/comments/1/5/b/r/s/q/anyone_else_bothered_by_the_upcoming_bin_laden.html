       yes. This is how I know that the official story is probably complete bullshit, because the media is releasing a movie containing what they desperately want us to believe.

       Although there is a book out called, "No Easy Day" that was written by one of the members of Seal Team 6 where he tells the story of how exactly the event happened. What I have seen in the previews actually looks rather similar to the book.

       It's actually a pretty interesting book if you're looking for a good read.

       I can unfortunately believe it. Propaganda is alive and well. To this day, I mention how the guy she based the movie on sued her because it wasn't realistic and the lawsuit just went away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I knew someone who was in the real life "Black Hawk Down" and he said the movie was about 90% fiction compared to what really happened. And then there's Jessica Lynch, Pat Tillman....

       I can agree with this, it was a great film, but should have lost to Avatar. That said, if you were to ask me about more recent war movies; they are blatantly propaganda.

       Maybe The Hurt Locker was overrated, but Avatar wouldn't have been a worthy Best Picture winner either. Avatar could've been written by my 5 year old niece the story was so cliche. In terms of more recent war films, outside of Act of Valor, which have been blatant propaganda? Genuinely curious here.

       idiots will still think it is what went down. The same people that think reality TV is real. Even though some people know that it is a movie they are watching and not a documentary it still becomes the official narrative... or at least cements it.

       Not sure where you're getting "nearly unanimous praise" from. Search for "zero dark thirty" just brings up news stories about inaccuracies, bias, pro-torture controversies, and how Jessica Chastain is pretty and can act well.

       Green Zone is good. Fun Fact: All the expensive military vehicles (helicopters, tanks) are CGI because the Pentagon's script department didn't approve the script, and as a result, didn't give the production big toys to play with. The script wasn't approved because it criticized the handling of 'WMDs' in Iraq, and didn't follow America's narrative. Pure propoganda.

       I enjoy watching it with the mindset that I KNOW there is going to be specific techniques used and I am going to try and find them all and laugh about it. It's usually pretty entertaining.

       Plus sometimes some of the action sequences are pretty entertaining.

       Since this is turning into a film discussion I would like to recommend Generation Kill, a 1 season HBO show about the first gulf war. Really well done, and definitely doesn't come off as propaganda.

       Seen it. Terrible dialogue. Quite boring. Pro torture, based on the mounds of evidence against torture that were left out. Everything bad that happens shows the lead characters as victims for the cause. The Seal Team is portrayed as a gang of ruffians. It's trash. And it saddens me.

       I dunno, I really didn't get a big "pro-torture" vibe.

       None of the torture scenes in the movie result in meaningful information, and they are EXTRAORDINARILY uncomfortable to watch.

       Lincoln was BS as well. Lets portray a highly paid, corrupt ex-railroad lobbyist who asked all black people to move out of America as someone who was so anti-slavery that he spent every waking moment on it (the emancipation proclamation only applied to the south, and it was a political move to prevent European countries from being politically able to support the south, in case anyone is interested).

       Just like Pearl Harbor didn't mention that we baited the Japanese into attacking us so we could have an excuse to go to war.

       Its not getting unaminous praise.  MANY mainstream news sources are stating very clearly how the CIA and Pentagon are upset with how it portrays their behaviors, and movie reviews them selves are stating how its basicly torture porn.

       With that said, yes its disturbing that its being presented as the factual story of Bin Laden's capture/death/end of the story.   I do agree that its very much classical hollywood propoganda.  Telling a story with out asking the hard questions.

       Its hard to watch any new war movie. it all seems like propaganda. i haven't seen the Bin Laden trailer but Act of Valor defiantly had a propaganda feel to it. It was openly paid for by the Navy’s Special Warfare Command. anyone else have a problem with this.

       Well usually I found that if critics rave about a movie. It means it sucks. Hollywood has paid them to market the movie as Academy Award worthy. it's all marketing.

       Not really no. A quick scan of the cable offerings (at least around here) comes up with all kinds of indoctrinate offerings for the viewer to eat up his plate of propaganda-pie. Movies such as 'Flight 93' and their ilk are rotating heavily through the movie channels. And to tug at the heart-strings, there's 'Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close', a nice film to watch, but on the same tip nonetheless. So now we have this, 'Zero Dark Thirty', of which I saw the trailer for. It's more of the same reinforcement. Seeing these factors alone tells me that we are expected to internalize their official story.

       the movie was already in production when Bin Laden was killed and they had to obviously rewrite the movie and shoot new scenes. But I find this to be entertainment based on some facts, Edutainment.

       I thought the original version was shit.  And they did a remake? I hope they weren't trying to turn a prophet.

       The first three Google results I get for this movie:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The fact that it has a 94% on Tomatometer (meaning 6% of reviews, in the aggregate, did not "praise" it)
2) Several stories about the CIA not liking it because of inaccuracies
3) Stories about various sources calling it controversial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, not "unanimous" praise.  The raison d'etre for your post is, therefore, obliterated.

       if there's a movie about the bin laden killing, and it's highly approved of, it should likely be believed to be the story they wanted you to hear. regardless of people pretending to be upset about it. honestly, congressmen or whomever getting on TV saying it shouldn't be allowed to come out will only make more people go see their propaganda. i'm of the belief that absolutely none of that story is true, i've personally translated bin laden videos for years and firmly believe he not only had nothing to do with the attacks, but that he died years ago. again that's my opinion, and it's something that i've come to on my own that i won't be putting out anywhere because i don't really want that level of heat.

       This is the final chapter in the Governments 9/11 Trilogy. First came World Trade Center, then Flight 93 and now Zero Dark Thirty.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's most dissapointing is that Oliver Stone and David Fincher participated in the first two movies. Makes me wonder about Oliver Stone being a disinformation agent for the Government. Makes me question his other movies, like JFK. I think they figured using him would help give some sort of credence to the Official Story since Stone is supposed to be known for Conspiracy Theories and if he's on board with the Official Story, it must be true.

       Trust No One. 9/11 was an inside job.

       So did that Nicholas Cage turd, like a decade ago; so did the PATRIOT Act and invading Afghanistan.  Not only are people easily scared idiots, but critics face the same potential backlash for divergence as do politicians and journalists (i.e., you are demonized and your career is over).  If you're not already expecting this... why not?

       Film student here: Please don't dismiss the movie completely without seeing it. Does it look like propaganda? Yes. However, Katheryn Bigelow is a talented director, and a lot of the praise is centered on how it's a good movie, not the messages it tries to convey. It really bothers me when people flip a shit about movies they haven't even seen,

       No.  That's like saying the Avengers movie is propaganda BS because it is different from the comics and will never be able to capture the actual 'facts' of the comics.  Why can't we just enjoy the movie for what it is and separate reality from fantasy?

       I can unfortunately believe it. Propaganda is alive and well. To this day, I mention how the guy she based the movie on sued her because it wasn't realistic and the lawsuit just went away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I knew someone who was in the real life "Black Hawk Down" and he said the movie was about 90% fiction compared to what really happened. And then there's Jessica Lynch, Pat Tillman....
