       I was looking around at articles just passing the time as was on
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2250173/Nancy-Lanza-Her-time-running-Sandy-Hook-shooters-mom-feared-end-coming-discovering-dark-family-secret.html?ICO=most_read_module">

       So I thought just to play with some of the pictures and throw them into google image search. Now the 5 x 5 picture is one giant one and didn't really turn up anything. When I put in the single picture of Allison Wyatt I got some odd results. It linked it to this blog from Sept 2009 however it is private but you can see it if you use the google cached version.
      </p>
      <p>
       handmadecathygaubert.blogspot.com/2009_09_01_archive.html
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I found this one called My blog about Megan from Oct 2011. The blog entry as since been deleted however again you can use the cached option to read it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://meagansspeechjourney.blogspot.com/2011/10/my-dear-child-is-meagan.html">
        http://meagansspeechjourney.blogspot.com/2011/10/my-dear-child-is-meagan.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no clue if this means anything but I just found it kind of odd that this picture of a 6-7 year old shows up having been used up to 3 years ago. Someone who is more knowledgeable about google image search might be able to explain why these results returned the exact same picture used in the recent story. Possibly just another case of a bad job reporting?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you would like to recreate these results and get links to the cached blogs go to the dailymail article I posted, find the picture of allison wyatt, right click copy image url, go to google and click images then on the camera and select from url and paste url and search.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I know the images are not actually on the cached site but how are they connected.

       It was my thought too that it was possibly just a mistake by posting the wrong picture. I do not know how reputable that site truly is. Though I have seen that link around a lot and part of me wonders why no one has brought it up that it isn't Allison Wyatt. I wish I could find out how those two blogs are connected and like someone else posted why it was just recently deleted at the start of this month. On Cathy Gauberts blog when I did the image search last night the date it showed I believe was Sept 29th 2009 and there is no blog post on that date. I think I will keep visiting some of these news sites and look at some more of these pictures. Thanks for looking that stuff up.

       Um mm... This photo is EXTREMELY Photoshopped!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       What does this mean? I dunno... But check it out: Cake and candles appear to be a sep layer or from another pic. At the very least, the foreground and background elements were assembled here. Most OBVIOUS alteration: The curtain, right above the candles.

       I've never used photoshop and I don't know anything about it (like "smudge tool") but I looked at the link and everything around her looks (to me) like it is separate from her (I mean the back of the chair as well looks like it was added behind her).
      </p>
      <p>
       As you said the curtain and cake both look fake to me as well. Maybe the photo is real and just gives me a fake impression but it looks fake.

      <p>
       But why would they photoshop things like the cake and curtain?

       Who knows WHY they faked it? Maybe they felt a birthday photo would elicit a stronger emotional response? Maybe it was a legitamate reason like removing other children from the photo? But wouldn't it be easier to blur other kids faces?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that it IS apparently 'Shopped just raises one more suspicion surrounding this whole case.
      </p>
      <p>
       And check this out! 
Here is another photo of one of the "murdered" children that was TOTALLY FAKE!!!

       I just went through some old threads on here that I remembered about before I took a little leave from reddit (I know crazy, right?)  Anyways, I came across ed this one and I've read most of the post and I have to tell you how refreshing it is to see someone else who is as open to different information as I am. Lately all I see is people attacking other people who have different opinions.  It was nice to see someone who didn't put others down, but rather took in their information. Anyways,  not to be a total creeper just thought it was nice to see this.

       Its all good sometimes I dont log in and check messages for a month. I mean I get conspiracies are just that but you can't go justifying things without proof. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and most with fight for it til the end. However I see people who follow conspiracies blindly just as I see people who dont see anything going on. You can't force stuff to be there and no one knows everything. Anyways sorry for the delayed response to your comment. I hope you are having a nice weekend.

       It appears to be posted on dec 15, so does that user know the girl?
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless the facebook user just searched the image of the little girl being used in the news and found the blog. Otherwise the name for the girl is different in the blog than in the news so fb user wouldn't have a reason to know that is the girl they are talking about unless fb user searched images on google, and why do that type of search? just to write a tribute comment about 1 out of the 20 kids? something is weird about that post to me.

       Sorry to reply again I just wanted to mention that both the speech therapy blog and the hand made cathy blog seem to have been deleted within the last month (google cache of both seems to be within the last month) and they both may have been deleted after the 14th (considering the cache date for 1 and the facebook post for the other).

       Or it could be that the Daily Mail is populated by shitty journalists who make stories up to sell their awful rag, and this one just used random images from Google because he was too lazy to do any research and print real photos of the victims.

       I searched google for "Shannon Fithian, Meagan" and found a blog post about how Meagan had a speech disorder.

       Notice the google cache date of Dec 01, 2012. That means that the blog had been deleted some time THIS MONTH.

       That is a very good catch! The blog post seems to be a year old it is another coincidence for it to be deleted within the last month. (i.e. not deleted a couple months after it was written, but coincidentally around now).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it was deleted after this person posts it on facebook on what appears to be dec 15

       In "edit 5" user "fake accountant" gives the web cache of another blog that may have had photos of a "lily" that may be the same photo as the "alexis" dailymail photo.
      </p>
      <p>
       That google webcache appears to be from dec 14 2012, so 2 blogs that may have had that photo both seem to be deleted in a coincidental time.

       I am a part of a lot of subreddits that I don't comment in. Doesn't mean that I dont lurk. So to me that doesn't really mean anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The things to me thats weird is that why would Cathy Gaubert take an partial picture of her own computer screen with a camera/phone and upload it to her own Instagram? Also if her Instragram profile is private how is it that you can post a link to a picture on her account. Wouldn't it make sense if something is private it just can't be hotlinked somewhere? These misunderstandings by me could be because I have no clue how to use Instagram or the point of it. The only thing I would be interested is to actually see the time stamp of that post she made on facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not trying to sound like I am accusing you of something I just dont get how that site works. Anyways thanks for adding to the conversation.

       I don't know the workings of Instagram either, but I did get the link off of her Twitter account (easily found on Google). That possibly may have allowed the picture to be publicly viewable since it was shared by her.

       All of TexasGamer's comments seem to be in technology related subreddits (phones, video games). I guess maybe it is luck he knows Cathy and stumbled on this in the r/conspiracy subreddit (since he doesn't seem to usually comment in r/conspiracy).

       Do you not see how nonsensical and deeply ironic it is to 1) Use an insult that implies the recipient can't think independently because they disagree with you or question you, which itself shows they
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       at least think independently and 2) Be unreceptive to any discourse by choosing to insult someone instead, thereby demonstrating yourself to be the closed-minded one.

       Basically the thought process is, 911 was a organized event, there wasn't really any passenger planes that hit the towers just unmaned ones(or a missile, or it was holograms) so all the dead passengers are fake.

       I went to the google cache of the blogspot link you posted and it doesn't have a picture of a child on it. (mostly just text).

       There are no images posted on any cache versions but if you actually put the image url or saved the allison wyatts image and did a google image search it pulls up both of those blogs. My question is why would it pull those up if it weren't attached to them at one time.

       It has the same picture. It claims the blog was about the girl that was shot, gives a different name for her.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you said this could mean either the blog didn't use the child's real name, or the reporting made a mistake.

       True but the issue I have with that is the blog is dated Oct 2011. So this girl had to have been shot over a year ago if it was about her. I am not claiming this is something huge its just another weird occurrence to pop up. Computer is dying though I will check this thread in the morning to see if something else comes up. Thanks for looking it up.

       Also not that this proves or even means anything but her dress or top seems to be pretty out of style (it looks older style than today's walmart stuff).

       Do you not see how nonsensical and deeply ironic it is to 1) Use an insult that implies the recipient can't think independently because they disagree with you or question you, which itself shows they
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       at least think independently and 2) Be unreceptive to any discourse by choosing to insult someone instead, thereby demonstrating yourself to be the closed-minded one.

       If that is the case what is with the other blog that showed up called megan's speech journey? I mean I am not tryin to get too personal but just wondering how they are connected since they are listed using the same picture.

       I don't know the workings of Instagram either, but I did get the link off of her Twitter account (easily found on Google). That possibly may have allowed the picture to be publicly viewable since it was shared by her.
