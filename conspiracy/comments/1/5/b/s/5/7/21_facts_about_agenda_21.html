        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>21 Truths About Agenda 21 &amp; Sustainable Development </p>

<p>1) From the largest metropolitan cities to the smallest towns of Main Street America, communities all across our nation are being influenced with a new political philosophy known as Sustainable Development and its primary framework for implementation called Agenda 21. </p>

<p>2) Agenda 21 is the global blueprint of implementation for Sustainable Development devised by the United Nations and was signed by 178 world leaders at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992. </p>

<p>3) Sustainable Development and Agenda 21 call for a complete re-orientation of the world system of governance in every area in which human impacts on the environment. </p>

<p>4) Sustainable Development, like Communism or Fascism, is a doctrine or philosophy of governance complete with its own agenda, beliefs, and goals. </p>

<p>5) On June 29th, 1993 President Clinton signed Executive Order 12852 creating The President’s Council on Sustainable Development. This step began the full-scale implementation of Agenda 21 and Sustainable Development within the United States of America. </p>

<p>6) Sustainable Development is entrenched throughout our government at every level from federal, state and regional agencies to county, city and community councils and planning boards. </p>

<p>7) Sustainable Development or “Sustainability” is often promoted with the environmental message of “going green”, or “being a good steward” but in reality there is actually a much, much deeper political philosophy of control and governance at work. </p>

<p>8) Sustainable Development is a political philosophy that is built upon three pillars. These three pillars are known as the “3E’s”, or “the triple bottom line”. The three pillars of sustainable development are Ecological Integrity, Economic Prosperity and Social Equity. </p>

<p>9) Sustainable Development demands that the perfect balance of “the triple bottom line” be the deciding lens through which all community development, growth, and decisions are viewed. All growth which fails to achieve this perfect balance is considered unsustainable. </p>

<p>10) Communities are being drawn down the path of Sustainable Development by the lure of numerous monetary grants and incentives from state and federal government agencies as well as non-governmental organizations. </p>

<p>11) Sustainable Development views traditional capitalism and the American way of life as a failing and inequitable system that must be replaced with a new governance system in order to achieve sustainability and a just world. </p>

<p>12) An overwhelming number of businesses and corporations have began shifting to a Sustainable Development operational model and in so doing have rejected the traditional “bottom line” of American Capitalism replacing it with the “triple bottom line” of United Nations Sustainable Development. </p>

<p>13) Almost every College and University in the nation has become indoctrinated with the philosophy of Sustainable Development. From campus infrastructure and administration to student life and the curriculum America’s Colleges and Universities are awash in this radical, collectivist philosophy. </p>

<p>14) The philosophy of Sustainable Development calls for a complete change in the lifestyle of the average American citizen. Numerous aspects of normal American life are subject to intense scrutiny under this radical new philosophy. Where and how we build our homes, what products we use, which foods we eat, what and how much we consume, and which methods of transportation we choose, are just a few examples of American life that United Nations Sustainable Development seeks to bring under its controlling grasp. </p>

<p>15) Sustainable Development and Agenda 21 promote a paradigm shift in attitudes away from the norm of national borders and individual nation-states toward a globalist, collective, one-world, interdependent, and interconnected planetary mindset. </p>

<p>16) Sustainable Development philosophy teaches that mankind is living beyond the “carrying capacity” of the Earth and that we are in the midst of multiple crises that are converging to create conditions that are not livable unless they are halted by a rapid global transition to a sustainable development system. Some of these perceived crises include overpopulation, global poverty and wealth inequality, manmade global climate change, and rampant environmental destruction. </p>

<p>17) Across our nation numerous communities of all sizes are putting into place the radical policies of Sustainable Development and United Nations Agenda 21. From new comprehensive land use plans, to smart growth, and sustainable community planning, the ideas and infrastructure of Sustainable Development are being implemented and added to daily. </p>

<p>18) The policies of sustainable development and Agenda 21 seek to change the way people live and build their cities and towns. Sustainable Development promotes high density, urban, pedestrian oriented, low carbon, walkable communities and discourages traditional American automobile usage, suburban lifestyles and development. </p>

<p>19) The Sustainable Development philosophy perceives the automobile and the ongoing use of fossil fuels as unsustainable. </p>

<p>20) In addition to the high level efforts within the United Nations and other similar globalist organizations, much of the work in promotion of Agenda 21 and Sustainable Development is being carried out by a massive network of Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs). These organizations have been fully consumed by this radical collectivist philosophy and are working overwhelmingly to advance the Sustainable Development Agenda. </p>

<p>21) Sustainable Development and the implementation of Agenda 21 are not some far off future possibility. In fact, America and the world are in the midst of what the sustainable development movement calls “the great transition” to a sustainable new model of living.  </p>

<p>Come over to <a href="/r/UNAgenda21">/r/UNAgenda21</a> for related posts.  This is the &quot;open conspiracy&quot; folks.  World government under the guise of &quot;environmentalism&quot; and &quot;equity&quot;, run by the same people who do all the damage.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Democracy also has its own agenda, beliefs and goals.  Way to go with the inflammatory language.</p></li>
<li><p>Here&#39;s the language from that Executive Order:  2. Objectives, Scope of Activities, and Description of Duties</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The Council shall:
advise the President on matters involving sustainable development. In furtherance of the mission, the Council will develop and recommend to the President a national sustainable development action strategy that will foster economic vitality;
advise the President on fashioning an annual Presidential Award recognizing exemplary efforts toward the achievement of sustainable development ideals and submit nominations for the award to the President; and
advise the President on conducting a public awareness and participation campaign on the importance of and appropriate uses of the nation&#39;s natural and cultural resources. The Council shall provide a copy of its advice to the Secretary of the Interior.
The duties of the Council are solely advisory in nature.</p>

<p>The Council may form subcommittees and teams to assist in the accomplishment of its objectives and duties. The subcommittees and teams may include individuals other than members of the Council and shall be balanced in terms of the interests represented and the Council&#39;s objectives and duties. The chairperson of the Council may invite experts to submit information to the Council and report to the Council on specific matters concerning sustainable development.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>(#7) Accusation with absolutely no proof.</p></li>
<li><p>(#19). Anyone with more than a high school education knows that fossil fuels are not sustainable.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think an unelected, UN directive based, Executive Order created council, making public policy decisions, is a good idea... hmm, I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re really really stupid or just hardcore indoctrinated by the &quot;more than a high school education&quot; that you&#39;ve probably not completed.  My guess is both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama doesn&#39;t need to convene the panel, the panel has run it&#39;s course, the NGOs, universities and non-profits have taken over the &quot;sustainable development&quot; area.  Obama&#39;s area to cover on Agenda 21 is the &quot;social equity&quot; area, this is obvious.  His campaign slogan was &quot;Forward&quot; for fuck&#39;s sake.  &quot;Forward&quot; all through the 20th century was another way of describing communism, look it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Communitarianism.  If someone wants a garden they can plant it themselves.  By having &quot;community gardens&quot; that is the first step to communitarianism.  The land used to make these gardens could be used to house people, but instead they are using them for &quot;public&quot; reasons, for the &quot;good of the community&quot;, which is unamerican and in the end doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;s another expense on the public.  If a church wants to start a community garden on their own property, great idea.  If a school wants to do it for educational purposes, awesome.  But the city allocating land for a &quot;public garden&quot; undermines private farmers who farm for a living.  genius.</p>

There&#39;s all sorts of open space surrounding the city, if people owned cars maybe they could go there, but they&#39;ve trapped themselves in urban hell and Agenda 21 advocates the abolition of cars for &quot;public transit only&quot; and &quot;walkable&quot; cities.

There is so much open space it is not even funny.  Try LEAVING the city once in a while, you will see there is a lot of room.  Open your eyes to what is <em>really</em> happening and you will see that the hoarding of resources is a great way to put everyone into a literal slave system where everyone is under the thumb of who controls the resources, water is next.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me guess you went to thinkprogress.org and called that research. LOL.  It&#39;s an &quot;open conspiracy&quot; there is nothing behind the scenes happening.  It is being implemented at local levels and state levels using federal grants and NGO grants funded through big-money foundations like Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Ford Foundations.  Think tanks like the Club of Rome(whom Maurice Strong and Al Gore have been members) advocated all of this prior to the Rio Earth Summit where Agenda 21 was codified. If you had researched an gnat&#39;s ass amount of information regarding this topic you would have found all of this.  There is an incredible amount of evidence to support something that is not even a &quot;theory&quot; it&#39;s fact bro.  Almost every city/town in the US is adopting a &quot;sustainability plan&quot; that lines up almost exactly with the goals stated in Agenda 21 in regards to development and &quot;environmentalism&quot;, the universities and colleges are all on board with these goals(they get foundation grants to do so).  They won&#39;t <em>call it</em> Agenda 21, because Agenda 21 is just the agenda, the implementation of the agenda is right in front of your face, it is just disguised with nice fluffy words like &quot;sustainability&quot; and &quot;social equity&quot;, it&#39;s Marxism gone green.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have come up with another euphemism now for it, actually several, &quot;developmentally delayed&quot; or &quot;mentally handicapped&quot;(although this one is becoming &quot;offensive&quot; now).  </p>

<p>Retard literally means slowed down, so if someone is &quot;slowed down&quot; retard is an appropriate word.  It has just been demonized by the retards who figured out that they are retards and don&#39;t want to be called that.  Actually if retards knew that the new euphemisms they are using actually <em>mean</em> retard they would be just as offended.  I think words are words, they have specific meanings and if you are offended by a word, get over it you fucking sensitive.</p>

They are taking money from the &quot;developed nations&quot; and giving it to &quot;undeveloped nations&quot;(read: uncontrolled cultures) to set up &quot;sustainable cities&quot; that are literally stack and pack serf cities built around factories and mines.  </p>

<p>Also if you read the findings of the Reece Committee on Tax Free Foundations, they found that big-money foundations have been funding social engineering projects at the university level and public school level since the early 1900s, nothing has changed since then in regards to foundation practices.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make some good points. The philosophy of sustainable development is being used as a tool to implement an extreme draconian socialism similar to that which existed in the USSR. It is a power grab by the government -- an attempt to take power and wealth out of the hands of the people and to put them into the hands of a few ruling individuals, who, for the most part will not be elected politicians, but members of the ruling class.</p>

<p>The ruling class in America is Jews. In Russia the Jews brought about the Communist Revolution, and took power as its leaders and leading officials. Now the ruling class of America wants to do much the same thing through Agenda 21 and &quot;sustainable development.&quot; It is using the irrational affection ordinary people have for anything that promises to heal or help the Earth to leverage itself into a position of  greater control, greater wealth, greater power.</p>
