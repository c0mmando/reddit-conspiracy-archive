       I've been around this subreddit for a while. The best way I can describe a "skeptical conspiracy theorist" is someone whom endorses conspiracy theories that have evidence of which actually stands up to scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       A sidenote, I feel skeptics are very much mistreated in this subreddit by people who call themselves truth seekers. I feel a lot of these people only seek the truth they wish to believe in and discard any evidence to the contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask me Anything, this is an open discussion thread.

       Edit: Spellign mistake in title, but oh well. ;)

       Edit2: Downvoting is mean :( No karma whoring here, this is a self post. Also, rather curious nobody has yet asked the question "as a skeptical conspiracy theorist what conspiracy theories do you believe in or think are tangible?".

       I never looked into these particular incidents enough to form much of an opinion on them. I would hazard a guess and say that crazy people tried to do some crazy things, but that is purely a guess not based off of evidence or content.

       I can answer that one.  Two giant planes crashed into the building.  If it truly is a conspiracy it wouldn't have been hard to say "We're not gonna test for thermite because it's pretttttty obvious that it was the planes"

       Wouldn't the fact that 3 steel-framed skyscrapers completely fell when only the tops of 2 of them were damaged after being hit with airplanes, after a experiencing fires so "minor" that people were photographed standing in the holes where the planes hit and the NYFD said the fires were very close to being under control -- but then 2 skyscrapers simply collapsed, at near freefall speeds, falling into their own footprints; wouldn't that be something to be investigated?
      </p>
      <p>
       If such a things can be caused by fires, wouldn't it be logical that office workers all over the world should be revolting and refusing to go to work tomorrow?

       They werent just caused by fires. Don't forget, those buildings had some very large planes fly into them and explode, causing massive structural damage. Regarding WTC7, a lot of debris fell onto that building when the first two collapsed, in fact one side of it was nearly completely exposed and emergency services abandoned their attempts to save the building so they could attempt to save other nearby buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, do consider that buildings of that height are designed to fall into their own footprint if they do fall. Furthermore, they aren't solid objects (like the trunk of a tree) so physics dictates they will not topple over and fall to their sides. They will fall near their own footprint.

       The evidence found that "supports" the theory of thermite usage at the WTC 9/11 events is shaky at best - the findings can also be explained by destroyed computers and particle board. They didn't find "thermite residue" per-say, they found (laymans terms here) residual trace compounds that may result from thermite usage. These compounds also happen to be found when you destroy and/or burn electrical equipment, such as computers. They can also turn up as a result of burned particle board which contains various materials within.

       While in the Army I saw some grunts use a thermite grenade on an old howitzer breech. That thing was a huge chunk of steel. One grunt popped the grenade and set it on the breech and we moved back. It melted through the breech, fell on the floor of the tracked vehicle that carried the howitzer, and melted though both the floor of the vehicle and the armor plate below the floor.

       If the earth were hollow, we would observe a much lesser gravitational force than what we currently observe.
      </p>
      <p>
       if the earth were hollow, seismic activity would crumble the earth together and over time form it into a much smaller, much more solid sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't much like this one personally, because its one of the more outrageous ideas I've heard of that totally throws science out the window in every aspect of the theory, same goes for flat earth theory.

       Well one can not say with 100% surety. In theory anything is possible. Should it be discovered we would have to restart a few different scientific fields from scratch. I would say that its very
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       unlikely. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       According to our current understanding, If the earth was hollow
       <em>
        and if
       </em>
       there was a mini star in the middle of it, that star would forcibly suck the earth into itself, forming a hard sphere of some kind and effectively destroying everything.

       fact check
1. the federal reserve is a private for profit institution
2.it is allowed to do buisness as a "qauzi" government agency, meaning it is a private company that has been granted a "charter" to have exclusive rights to perform a service for the corporation of the united states of america, the service they preform is creating our currency supply.
3. They make their money by printing digital loans and "loaning" "air" to the treasury, which then monitizes the "loan" and turns them into bonds and then sells them on the open market, the bond market is oversaturated lies and so therefore the fed is creating loans, the treasury is turning them into bonds and then te fed is buying them back...this is the equvilent of eating one cheeseburger and then shoving you head up you ass and eating your shit over and over again...

       Its going to be a slightly chilly day. More serious answer: A lot of people made money off of a crazy idea that had no actual scientific evidence to back it up. A quick example: Planet X or niburu or a brown dwarf drifting into our solar system, had any of these things been true the millions of amateur astronomers the world over would have detected them. Governments can't simply hide what happens in space for there are way too many eyes looking up on a regular basis. If it was a brown dwarf drifting into our system, we would have noticed its gravitational pull affecting our neighborhood planets in extreme fashion many years ago.

       legit question right there. There is a lot of mapping of the ocean floor that is actively being done. In fact most of the ocean floors surface around this planet has been mapped out using various technological advances of our time. Also, space is the next tourist destination. We all want to fly around in starships at warp speed and explore the stars.

       What jets? If you're referring to our local star the Sun, its in a period of solar maximum, right on schedule too.

       To hazard a guess here, I'd say climate change has to be the culprit.

       This would be cool, but its all about what the people want. We want to goto space and journey to the stars. I think its more likely that in the future we'll see floating cities instead of underwater cities, if at all. Lots of issues when you try to build in that environment.

       While in the Army I saw some grunts use a thermite grenade on an old howitzer breech. That thing was a huge chunk of steel. One grunt popped the grenade and set it on the breech and we moved back. It melted through the breech, fell on the floor of the tracked vehicle that carried the howitzer, and melted though both the floor of the vehicle and the armor plate below the floor.
