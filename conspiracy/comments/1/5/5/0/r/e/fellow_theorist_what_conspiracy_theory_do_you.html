    <div class="md"><p>I believe that David Icke was quite aware of what his fellow countryman David Irving went through in the 80&#39;s. Irving was attacked and vilified for his non Politically Correct historical writing. So he adopted a different strategy to expose Zionist bankster control.</p>

<p>So he used metaphors. Kind of like the movie &quot;They Live&quot;. Or maybe he was just referring to a cold blooded group, either way it was sort of clever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s fairly obvious, based on the sheer number of coincidences, that Israel and Pakistan were involved somehow.  The &#39;dancing Arabs,&#39; the schoolkid in Brooklyn, the van pulled over on 9/11 near Giants&#39; Stadium.  One of those arrested went onto Israeli TV a fews years after and &#39;fessed up Israeli fore-knowledge.<br/>
It&#39;s not a &#39;Bohemian Grove&#39; strata of upper-level conspiracy, but it&#39;s close to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find many elements of the moon landing to be highly suspect. The Van Allen Radiation Belts and the Apollo Capsule lacked significant shielding to pass through them. Not since the Apollo Missions has any manned spacecraft gone any further than low earth orbit. The Lunar Landers were never properly tested on Earth and Buzz Aldrin actually ejected from one of the few flight tests because the craft was highly unatable, yet we&#39;re supposed to believe it performed flawlessly on every moon mission. The lack of any engine noise in the video of the moon landing despite the astronauts literally sitting right on top of a rocket engine. No crater under the lunar lander. Highly suspicious video and photgraphs showing tampering. Suspicious gravity effects in video. One video shot on the way to the moon that has the astronauts holding slides in front of the window to appear farther out into space than they actually were. The fact that all video and audio went through Nasa so we had to take their word for it. The suspicious behavior of the astronauts at the press conference following their return and their inability to recall being able to see stars from the moon surface and no stars appeared in the photos from the moon. The size of the lunar lander was basically the size of a phone booth for each astronaut. How did they get their apace suits on and off? How did they fit the Rover on the Lunar Lander? Many more questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All voice, telemetry, biological data lost ~50 years ago; Ridiculous temperature differences in shadows/light on lunar surface and the total lack of equipment able to keep a human alive through a more or less instant 500 degree temperature change; Lack of shielding from cosmic rays/radiation on lunar surface; highly suspect and seemingly repeated use of backgrounds on lunar surface; Never before attempted (by US) maneuvers performed <em>flawlessly</em> six times in a row (command module/lunar lander docking in moon orbit); extremely convenient timing related to popular dissent surrounding the Vietnam conflict; etc.</p>

<p>The one that really grinds my gears is the &quot;laser reflector is there, we went&quot; argument, as if it&#39;s totally impossible an unmanned flight put it there or that what amounts essentially to a reflector you&#39;d find on the back of a bike tire &quot;required professional adjustment to be accurate&quot; like that&#39;s possible wearing six inch thick gloves. In reality they are designed to send light back from the same direction it was received like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Corner_reflector.svg">this</a> and are based on simple mathematics. </p>

<p>Why haven&#39;t we gone back? IMO, because it&#39;s still impossible from a technological standpoint.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was arguing this with someone here before and they used the reflector as their basis that we went to the moon.</p>

<p>And I think it&#39;s pretty ridiculous that we&#39;re supposed to believe that they lost all of the original film from the first landing on the Moon. One of the most important events in the history of mankind and they lost all of the original film from the mission. Right.</p>

<p>People have also argued that they brought moon rocks back so we definitely went there. We could have easily obtained moon rocks without going to the moon to get them.</p>

<p>And finally, they could easily prove this story by showing photographs taken from Hubble or some other telescope of any of the landing areas but I have never seen a picture of it. If anyone can point me to a link, I would appreciate it. You would think if we have telescopes powerful enough to see distant star systems, then we should be able to see the moon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, please don&#39;t mis-understand me, I certainly aren&#39;t above any <em>suspicions</em> of general fuckery by Uncle Sam, my disbelief stems from the general air of engineering and resourcefulness that was committed during those years i.e. the Space Program.</p>

<p>For example, does anyone here doubt Kelly Johnson built a titanium bullet as a spy vehicle, and flew it past 3 times the speed of sound ? Does anyone here doubt the U-2 pilots spent <em>days</em> aloft, under radio silence, taking pics and gathering intel ? The engineering leaps needed to make those programs happen were &quot;science-fiction&quot; when conceived, but we <em>did</em> them. We made them happen. And <em>that</em> is no bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s see, taking your point step by step. </p>

<p>Aldrin &amp; Armstrong (Apollo 11) had radio transmitters <em>in the Moon Lander</em> powerful enough to reach Earth. They brought their &quot;infrastructure&quot; <strong>with them</strong>.</p>

<p>They communicated to Mission Control <em>on the way to the Moon</em>, and comments were relayed live from Mission Control to TV audiences.</p>

<p>While in orbit they were able to share radar telemetry with Mission Control, they brought that gear <em>also</em> aboard the Apollo 11 capsule.</p>

<p>And lastly, they landed with <em>samples</em> of moonrock. dust and carbonaceous chondrites. (meteorite slag, far in excess of Earth samples
<em>with no O2 contamination</em>).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was a guided missle that hit the Pentagon with an approved transponder thus the missle batteries that protect the Pentagon weren&#39;t activated to shoot it down. The planes that flew into the Pentagon were remote piloted, the Muslims on board had no control of the planes and may not have been aware that was the plan. I think they were told it was a highjacking to support the official story and once on the plane, it was taken over by whoever was running the operation. There were several AWACS spotted in the air on the morning of 9/11 and the planes were probably controlled from there.</p>

<p>As for JFK, I think the kill shot came from the driver of the Limo as Bill Cooper pointed out. Search Bill Cooper JFK and watch the video. It&#39;s the Zepruder film but everytime it is shown, the driver is usually cut out of the frame. You can see him point a gun with his left hand over his shoulder and then Kennedy&#39;s head explodes and Jackie attempts to flee the car. The Secret Service was definitely involved in the Killing. They set up the route, had lax security and then stole the body once it was on the plane so it could be taken to a hospital and cosmetically altered to make the wounds appear as though the shots came from behind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. While I am not by any means convinced of the &quot;lizard theory&quot; I recommend you, at minimum, watch a FULL Icke lecture before drawing any conclusions. I watched all of Wembely and am currently watching all of <a href="http://youtu.be/2DYhfRXHvdo">this one</a>, and honestly it really isn&#39;t all that far fetched the more you learn about the Illuminati and understand all of Ickes theory (<strong>the theory alone takes 7 hours to explain</strong>; if you want to see the evidence you need to read the books). I am fairly convinced of about 80% of what he says (from studying other sources), and to say that he is wrong about the other 20% without even reviewing the evidence he has presented is kind of closed minded. He came to the same conclusion that most of us accept as fact but he did it 15 years ago. If he IS telling the truth, the it&#39;s obvious that it won&#39;t make sense to us if we are 15 years behind in research. </p>

<p>Again, I haven&#39;t read any of his books yet, so I can&#39;t say of any relative certainty that he is right, but I think, as someone who used the same techniques and the same logical analysis as we all do (Except FAR more in depth and to the source), to say that his conclusions are wrong before even reviewing his evidence or even fully understanding his theory is just ignorant and closed minded. Not trying to call you out, but that&#39;s what it is. If you have no opinion, that&#39;s fine, but to say that someones conclusion is wrong when you don&#39;t even know how they got to it nor have reviewed the evidence, is pretty closed minded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I said is that I don&#39;t believe in it. I have no authority to say that is is wrong. I am nobody.

If it is about Lizard/reptilian &quot;people&quot; among us, I just cant entertain that. I cant spend 7 hours on that. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t mean to be so bull headed and closed minded, I really don&#39;t. And I especially don&#39;t mean to cause any offense to you or any one else by seemingly mocking their interests. So please, take no offense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not 7 hours about lizard people. He probably talks about lizard people for 30 minutes of a lecture tops. And even if you fully disregard the lizard people or say it&#39;s allegorical or whatever, it&#39;s very good information and a new way of seeing the world. Watching the Wembley event changed the way I see the world, even though it didn&#39;t make me believe anything new. It&#39;s more of a philosophy class than anything, just really solidifying the ideologies of descartes; as a result breaking apart every thing you were certain of about the world. I would honestly be amazed if you were not satisfied with spending 7 hours of your life watching an Icke event. For all the stupid, mindless, unproductive shit we all will spend tens of thousands of hours of our lives doing, using 7 of them to enhance our world view is definitely worth it IMO. A David Icke lecture is kind of like taking acid; 7 hours of mind fucking. </p>

<p>And as I said, an Icke lecture is more of a philosophy course than a history course (at least for me), in the sense that it helps you to break down everything you believe and be open to new ways of seeing things. I never said that he was <em>correct</em>, nor have I even done enough research to support or refute his claims, as I said. Watching a lecture is like learning about a new religion, or a new scientific hypothesis; you have no idea what the evidence is or whether it&#39;s true but that&#39;s not the point (at least not the point in why I advocate David Icke). It&#39;s about how seeing the world from different perspectives can open your mind. Taking acid isn&#39;t &quot;real&quot;, it&#39;s not how the world <em>actually</em> is, it&#39;s just how the chemical affects your perception of reality. But that doesn&#39;t mean that the experience can&#39;t help you to be a better person. The way that I advocate Icke is the same way. It&#39;s not about the information he provides, it&#39;s about the radically alternate view he provides to the way that most people see the world. </p>

<p>And even if it isn&#39;t philosophically stimulated to you, as I said, not even 10% of his work is about lizard people. You can interpret the lizard people as completely metaphorical and it doesn&#39;t detract from anything else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the link to the David Icke video <a href="http://youtu.be/VWxPAtkcUE8">http://youtu.be/VWxPAtkcUE8</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve listened to a few of his talks and I believe some of his theories but the lizard people bit kind of discredits his work. I can talk to someone for two hours about sensible topics but if at the end, I throw in that I think Obama is a Bigfoot, my audience is going to think I&#39;m a loon. David Icke is about making money for David Icke. In the interview, he couldn&#39;t just answer the questions, he kept insisting that you either read his book or watch one of his 7 hour lectures. Now I have no problem with someone making money but if you interview them and they can&#39;t answer questions or back up their claims without telling you to buy something, I find that to be problematic. Surely he can afford to give some answers for free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, wow. I have never watched anything Jesse Ventura or Alex Jones related(aside from Invisible Empire), and that video was just ridiculous . I felt like I was watching Pawn Stars: Conspiracy theory. Second, it is important to take <em>everything</em> you see with a grain of salt. If any significant portion of the conspiracies any of us believe to be true, you bet your ass there will be disinfo out there, and you truly cannot trust any one man or one source to lead us to the truth. And, I would argue that if anyone is &quot;disinfo&quot; it would be Jones and Ventura. There has been a lot of talk lately about Stratfor and the evidence of Jones/Ventura being shills. Bill Cooper, one of the most trusted &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; that I know of, a man who predicted 9/11 (so I hear at least, I haven&#39;t looked into it), repeatedly stated how Jones was a shill. With that said, I think anyone should be skeptical of Jones and Ventura from the start. Well you should be skeptical of everyone, but Jones and Ventura especially. It is pretty clear that they put out <em>a lot</em> of legitimate info, but they have been found to have connections to the &quot;elite&quot; on more than one occasion. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how much effort they put into demonizing him. Whether he&#39;s telling the truth or not, they sure put a lot of effort into convincing people that he&#39;s full of shit. And, with shows like that, you really can&#39;t trust how much it&#39;s edited. There were more than a few times where words were spoken but the video was edited, so honestly they could have easily chopped the audio to skew his responses to certain questions (I have noticed that most shows do this for the &quot;drama&quot; factor, but to see it on a show that is supposedly based around truth seeking really just makes me sad).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that they <em>did</em> do that, but that the fact that they very well could have, on top of some relatively founded evidence (at least to my understanding) that Jones is disinfo, and the cable-TV-esque structuring of the show <em>really</em> just would cause me at least to want to do a whole lot more research on Icke before discounting him. Especially if Jones <em>is</em> a shill and he out there discrediting Icke, would lend <em>more</em> credence to his theories.</p>

<p>Honestly, regardless of the truth factor, forcing opinions (as it is pretty clear is the intention in this video), is everything wrong with the world. Conspiracy theorists need to separate the facts from opinions and draw their own conclusions. If Ventura or Jones&#39;s other videos are anything like this, I guarantee that they make it very hard for people to do that. Whether they are telling the truth or not, they way they present their information taints the waters for the critical thinking and open mindedness that is necessary for any truth seeker.</p>

<p>Next, in regards to &quot;read the book&quot; or &quot;watch the lecture&quot;, I would have said the same thing. Icke&#39;s theory (note, it&#39;s one theory; everything he says is based around one grand theory that encompasses everything that is occurring int he world and the universe)  <em>is</em> very radical, and you, as I said in a previous post, <em>literally</em> need to watch an <em>entire</em> lecture just to get the gist of his theory (and that doesn&#39;t even include the evidence). Icke&#39;s lectures are available for free online, and he has put out over a dozen books and has probably done hundreds of lectures. If his goal was money I truly believe that this is a horrible way to achieve that. And, he lives in some tiny ass apartment (look hi up on youtube and there is so long haired kid who interviews him). </p>

<p>To sum this all up: Don&#39;t trust anyone but yourself, especially when it comes to conspiracies. Don&#39;t take anyone else&#39;s word for it, or at least don&#39;t be convinced of anything until you have done thorough research and formed your own opinions, <em>not</em> adopting the opinions of those you trust. </p>

<p>I still don&#39;t know if Icke is right, but I can assure you that <em>even</em> if he is full of shit (which I would argue is far less likely than Jones being full of shit), taking the time to watch one of his lectures <em>will</em> change the way you see the world, and you will appreciate it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like Jesse Ventura but his show, Conspiracy Theory is pretty much just pure entertainment. The first two seasons were a little better and I would recommend watching the 9/11, Pentagon, Denver Airport, HAARP and a few other episodes. This season he added his son and Oliver Stone&#39;s son to the team and they&#39;re terrible. Now it&#39;s just over the top cheesy. They&#39;re inside &quot;sources&quot; are pure character actors and for drama purposes, they meet them in Vans on the side of the road or bridges or back alleys. But what really bothers me is that it&#39;s shot like a lot of these new shows, Fact or Faked, Ghost Hunters, etc. where they  go to commercial and when they come back, they recount for about a minute what you just fucking watched and since I download all of my tv watching, it&#39;s especially maddening. </p>

<p>As for Alex Jones, he does report on some legitimate shit but he&#39;s full of himself. He&#39;s always talking about how the Government is after him and trying to shut him up or whatever and he also comes up with some wacky shit. He&#39;s kind of like Fox News.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll believe in shape shifting lizards when they catch one and show it to me. Same with Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m convinced that the CIA were flying &quot;illegal enemy combatants&quot; through Danish airspace during the Bush years, thereby making the responsible Danish authorities break  the Geneva convention on human rights.</p>

<p>I find it pretty ludicrous that shapeshifter octopusses should be some kind of alien race visiting us from outer space; that they have taken on the most clever physical form possible in our Earthly environment, and ultimately will travel on to other planets, as they continue their ancient quest to explore this Universe.</p>

<p>The general idea:  Pedophiles rule the world&#39;s governments.  </p>

<p>People don&#39;t like what some of the posts have to say, so they have attempted to blackball the entire domain.  IMO, WOT is terribly ineffective and gamed easily.</p>

<p>I dunno man. Personally, I&#39;d prefer a body or a live specimen. Why don&#39;t they put together some awesome trackers and really put some work into it? Track one of them down and bring it back, dead or alive.</p>

<p>Is there really that much money in Bigfoot? I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve watched that cheesy Tracking Bigfoot show with the fat redneck that calls them Squatches but that&#39;s about the extent of the Bigfoot Industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jews in America have maintained a complex relationship to &#39;whiteness&#39;. Light skinned Jews do not always consider themselves white, and often identify themselves, and are identified by others, as a separate race. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jews also think that they are &quot;gods chosen people&quot; - and I assure you, for various reasons, they are not.
Besides, it really doesnt matter what the fuck the average imbecile thinks - even if they happen to be jewish imbeciles. Jews are most definitely not a race.</p>

<p>Jews are a religion. Even if they claim people who belong to their group who share family lineage, but not religion, this does not make them a race. It just makes them annoying.</p>

<p>At .01% of the worlds population or whatever the fuck it is - even if they WERE a race at some point, they would have been absorbed into one of the more dominant races hundreds of millions of years ago. Just like the cro-magnons, and all the other evolved races in the fossil record that bred and combined into the dominant few races that we have left in the world today.</p>

<p>In short. Inbreeding does not create a race. Evolution does. Jews are not a race. If inbreeding made a race, we&#39;d have to start calling mormons their own race, and the Amish, and West Virginians and probably the Irish too. Nope, sorry still not a race. </p>

<p>And guess what? In 100 million years from now, if we&#39;re still around? There wont be any white people/black people/asian people etc. anymore either. They will have all crossbred into each other to the point where they are indistinct anymore.</p>

<p>Just look at most black Americans compared to an actual African. There is already a huge difference between them - and they&#39;ve only been interbreeding with whites for a couple hundred years.</p>

<p>Jews a race? No. Someone who thinks they&#39;re not white because they&#39;re jewish? Not a race either, an uneducated asshole yes, but still not a race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jewish laws of return are largely racial. I don&#39;t say that they do. Being Jewish is racial, cultural, religious, and tribal. More so than most groups. </p>

<p><a href="http://forward.com/articles/155742/jews-are-a-race-genes-reveal/?p=all">http://forward.com/articles/155742/jews-are-a-race-genes-reveal/?p=all</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/cohanim-dna-connection/">http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/cohanim-dna-connection/</a></p>

<p>The Jewish Encyclopedia (l948 edition) in Vol. 6 regarding the striking differences which exist between Judaism and other religions states:  The very name Judaism sharply differentiates it from other religions. Whereas  Buddhism centers in Buddha, Christianity in Christ, Mohammedanism in Mohammed, Judaism centers in no particular personality - but in the Jewish people themselves ... while Christianity is based upon events in the life of Christ, Judaism is based on occurrences in the history of the Jews.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if those who practice Judaism, or Jews, were a race, which they are not, if you even stop to think about it logically, the Palestinians they are oppressing now, very likely have a far purer &quot;jew&quot; bloodline, than the people who today call themselves jews - simply because, the &quot;jews&quot; of today, were the outcasts from Palestine 2000 years ago - they nomadically wandered around Europe for 2000 years, pissing everyone off, and getting kicked out of every place they went, but still interbreeding and diluting their bloodline along the way, while at the same time the Palestinians who the same people from the same area - just of a different religion - stayed in the same place for 2000 years, and didnt cross-breed with a bunch of Europeans nearly as much.</p>

<p>TLDR : Even if &quot;jew&quot; was a race, which it is not, the real jews are the Palestinians.</p>

<p>The only thing that gives me any cause for alarm is the way that people such as you are treated in a community which includes people who think aliens are opening our umpteenth chakras so that we can &quot;evolve&quot; (in our current bodies, mind you) to &quot;higher dimensions&quot; (read: &#39;I don&#39;t understand what &quot;dimension&quot; means, but I&#39;m TOTES spiritual in this bitch&#39;)</p>
