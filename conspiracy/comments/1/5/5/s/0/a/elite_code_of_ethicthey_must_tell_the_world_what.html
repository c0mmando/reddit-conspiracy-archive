<p><a href="http://survivalist.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/a-prediction-for-2012-world-war-iii-so-the-bankers-can-consolidate-their-control/">&quot;Lindsey said that it is because they have some weird “code of ethics” whereby they must let people know what they are going to do before they do it – some kind of weird cult game with them. (Many of these elite are occultists or Satanists.)&quot;</a></p>

<p><a href="http://lindseywilliams101.blogspot.com/">One of the facets of their code of ethics is they must tell the world everything they are going to do before they do it and this is where the word “buzzwords” come in.” - Lindsey Williams</a></p>

<p>Major similarities between, Batman: The Dark Knight Rises, Gotham City map, and the Sandy Hook school area. The distance from the highway below matches, the area is circled as a &quot;strike zone&quot;, the contour of the highway matches, both locations share a very similar size (large), but most of all, they have the <em>exact same name</em>. There&#39;s no way in hell this is a coincidence. No way, not in a million years.</p>

We must make the right decision in the coming years, or we will ensure the destruction of our species. Ever heard of John Titor? Ever heard of Carroll Quigley? Humanity, at this very particular time and place, has exactly one shot to get it right. I believe the future is sending us help in order to move us along.</p>

<p>We&#39;re actually swiftly approaching the time when everyone has to shut the fuck up and do their job. Life will go on, but it will be more and more controlled, and monitored more heavily.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t much we can do at this point, they will snuff out any kind of extreme act as terrorism and make it like it never happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think that we will be incapable of resistance to such a regime? After all, there are only a few of them and there are many of us. Divided, we are weak, easy prey for their machinations. United, as we are becoming more and more, we are strong, stronger than any form of control they could seek to subject us to. Money is a form of control, yes? What happens when we burn their money?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>how you gunna organize anything bro? the interwebs? they have that shit on lock down. if any real threat actually arose they would snuff it out as a terrorist act and blast it all over MSM...</p>

<p>the only real solution is massssive peaceful protest... but that wont ever happen, they&#39;ve got everyone so jacked up on fear we flinch at the sound of a pin drop.</p>

<p>we missed the boat, it was like, when 9/11 happened. but everyone still just thinks it was a bunch of terrorists and there was nothing else to gain.. A majority of people are not &quot;awakened&quot; </p>

<p>Thats why... I get your V for Vendetta enthusiasm, but even that is not what you think it means. V is highly satanic and symbolic in the illuminati. They are laughing in our faces bro, and there&#39;s nothing we can do about it except for go along while our lives slowly get devolved to a constant state of fear and control, or shoot a few bullets in the air and go down &quot;in a blaze of glory&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you think of any particular reason why &#39;they&#39; would have an &#39;ethic&#39; of revealing their plans? It&#39;s not like &#39;they&#39; (whoever they are, exactly) are badly written villains in a B-movie! I think this is all some sort of educative process for our species, to teach us how to love one another so we can begin to move into a higher form of existence. All these little clues and signs, people are seeing what they want to see and coming up with interpretations. I don&#39;t privilege one interpretation over the other, they&#39;re all equally (in)valid, the point I&#39;m trying to make is that they all share some kernel of truth--we are being oppressed/controlled by those in power over us. The natural conclusion of this train of thought is that we shouldn&#39;t let people control or oppress us. Perhaps someone or something (I would claim that it might be ourselves in the future) are trying to teach us this lesson, so that we may begin to live with one another with love, respect and harmony?</p>
