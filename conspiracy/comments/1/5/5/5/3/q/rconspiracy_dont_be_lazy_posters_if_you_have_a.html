       Regarding Sandy Hook, don’t make claims like

        "people in town don't seem to recall any of the victims "

       without providing at least an MSM commentary to support it. If you have a link for this, please provide it.

      <p>
       Regarding another statement by the same poster saying "Now that we know the "parents" are actors…", please investigate sources before assuming this.

        Robbie’s pre statement demeanour is suspicious

      <p>
       SPECULATE all you want about evidence and news reports, but make sure you’re discussing evidence and not hearsay. Think critically about both bogus MSM reports and tin foil hat reports.

       <strong>
        Edit:
       </strong>
       I in no way am trying to insinuate that MSM is reliable and that we should only agree with the BS they try to feed us. In context to the rant above I simply mean it's better to not make claims like "people in town don't seem to recall any of the victims " without providing some sort of source. It's easy to lead forums like this down dead ends or wild goose chases with claims like that.

       Yes. Alex Jones and Info Wars is not a source either, unless Jones links to official documentation which in some cases he does. In that case youre probably better off to link to the official source.

       Seriously?  I agree with supporting what one says, but to think that the entity that ESTABLISHES the very lies that we try to get passed should be the actual
       <em>

       That's actually not correct though.  I see where you're going with that, but that's actually simply not true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could say "Humans are 99% related to chimpanzees", and if I were to say "I have absolutely no source to back this up with", it wouldn't make the information any less true than it actually is.
      </p>
      <p>
       What this means is that while information given on any topic would indeed benefit from a source or two, failing to provide a source doesn't automatically invalidate the information itself - no matter
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       upset some might get that a source isn't provided.

       Well certainly.  This applies to literally any and
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       source that one can give or site, however.  Regardless of the source, it can and should absolutely be verified and possibly torn apart to test if it's valid or not.  This is very much independent of whether the source comes from the MSM or not, however.

      <p>
       Okay but now we have just inserted another dynamic into the paradigm of "validity assessment" whereby the extent to which something is "publicly known and/or established" commensurately mitigates the need for reference citing.  I see what you're saying (again), but this extra factor can make it even more of a convoluted mess - if not a slippery slope.  People can argue pretty effectively about just
       <em>
        what
       </em>
       kind of information is or is not - should or should not - be considered "common knowledge" or "publicly known".
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone could, with decent justification say about a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of things something like "What?  You didn't know
       <em>
        that?
       </em>
       Well that's not
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       fault, man.  That shit is
       <em>
        totally
       </em>
       well-established."
      </p>
      <p>
       Next thing you know, one is arguing deeply about whether something is indeed "common knowledge" or not - to say nothing about the actual source information.  In other words, it can get pretty darn relative - making the conclusion to your statement (that the comment about monkey's is a bit different) quite a bit relative and subject to debate, as the validity of your premise (that the information is already established and widely known) may very well fluctuate from person to person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, I would actually agree with what you're saying within certain parameters.  The problem with this is that there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       indeed things (many, it turns out, in the world of global corruption and manipulation that we unfortunately live in) that really
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       fall outside of these given parameters.  Therefore, there is actually quite a bit of valid information out there that is either not acknowledged, undermined by disinformation, or flat out denied by the MSM outright.
      </p>

      <p>
       Ha.  Yeah.  You DEFINITELY have to be careful, as there is indeed a lot of "squat" around these parts.  I agree with your general sentiment that one should attempt to source their information, but I also think that it should be acknowledged that this is by no means an easy thing when it has definitely been shown that we live in a world where corruption and lies and deceit are absolutely replete and pervasive throughout the whole of this society, and the top tier of the pyramid is JUST as if not
       <em>
        MORE
       </em>
       likely to spread lies and disinformation than the bottom base of it where the masses reside.

       This post is regarding people making claims, admittedly specifically about Sandy Hook, as though they are fact as opposed to "do you think it is possible that...", or "Can anyone confirm that...".
      </p>
      <p>
       The example given at the top of the page where the video creator claimed Tony Hawk is Robbie Parker and that Lt Vance is actually John Stephen Goodman is so retarded it should cast doubt on the poster's credibility of identifying Sandy Hook "actors". I want to post it to r/conspiratard myself.

       See edit above, in no way am I saying that MSM is reliable reporting. Its better however to avoid claims like ones about "career victims" without checking legitimacy (
       <a href="http://wellaware1.com/fairfield.htm">
        clearly not legitimate
       </a>
       ) and make statements like "people in town don't seem to recall any of the victims" without some sort of source for the comment. If you heard it on shitty MSM or elsewhere tell us so we can prove/debunk.

       Its difficult to find rock solid proof of government cover up, I concede that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could however start posts saying "Now that we know the Pentagon wasn't hit by a plane...", and you might go "WAIT, although I believe that, what do you mean now that we know?" Whereas if I
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=Hsqvg059_1M">
        post the link to the claim
       </a>
       , even though the footage is shitty it's at least a claim worthy of looking into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus I now consider that video my proof  of a conspiracy "that hasn't already been proven".

       Agree. I enjoy following conspiracy theories. But I'm getting bummed out by the lack of logic and critical thinking that I'm seeing here. Example: "A second shooter was arrested; they were in cuffs in front of everyone." Let's not forget due process, and innocent until proven guilty. It's irresponsible to declare someone a second shooter just because they were in cuffs on the scene. Putting someone in cuffs is not a verdict; rather, it's evidence.

       Agree.  If we are to point out how full of shit the MSM is we can't in turn just make Bullshit claims and stand by them.  If we do that we are no different from them.

       95% of what you'll find here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       isn't valid and has no actual facts to support it. Conspiracies are made up by people who're so afraid of the truth they invent a fake reality to find comfort.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 5% with valid claims is typically posted on another board (like technology) weeks before it reaches this dumpster.
