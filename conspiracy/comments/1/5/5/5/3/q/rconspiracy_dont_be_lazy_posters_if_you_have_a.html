        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Regarding Sandy Hook, don’t make claims like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/154v4e/newtown_emt_and_police_also_actors/">&quot;people in town don&#39;t seem to recall any of the victims &quot;</a> without providing at least an MSM commentary to support it. If you have a link for this, please provide it.</p>

<p>Regarding another statement by the same poster saying &quot;Now that we know the &quot;parents&quot; are actors…&quot;, please investigate sources before assuming this. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMINqFGNr-w">Robbie’s pre statement demeanour is suspicious</a>. A video going around however claims that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfScPPysADQ&amp;feature=player_embedded">&quot;Career Victims&quot; are at work</a>. The video poster also <a href="http://wellaware1.com/fairfield.htm">claims TONY HAWK is Robbie Parker</a>. Please investigate the Picasa account yourself before buying into this.</p>

<p>SPECULATE all you want about evidence and news reports, but make sure you’re discussing evidence and not hearsay. Think critically about both bogus MSM reports and tin foil hat reports.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I in no way am trying to insinuate that MSM is reliable and that we should only agree with the BS they try to feed us. In context to the rant above I simply mean it&#39;s better to not make claims like &quot;people in town don&#39;t seem to recall any of the victims &quot; without providing some sort of source. It&#39;s easy to lead forums like this down dead ends or wild goose chases with claims like that.</p>

<p>Seriously?  I agree with supporting what one says, but to think that the entity that ESTABLISHES the very lies that we try to get passed should be the actual <em>source</em> that you think should be used and cited in order to validate one&#39;s assertions is, it seems, utterly and completely undermining to your point and to any attempt to get to the <em>real</em> bottom of things.</p>

<p>That&#39;s actually not correct though.  I see where you&#39;re going with that, but that&#39;s actually simply not true.</p>

<p>I could say &quot;Humans are 99% related to chimpanzees&quot;, and if I were to say &quot;I have absolutely no source to back this up with&quot;, it wouldn&#39;t make the information any less true than it actually is.</p>

<p>What this means is that while information given on any topic would indeed benefit from a source or two, failing to provide a source doesn&#39;t automatically invalidate the information itself - no matter <em>how</em> upset some might get that a source isn&#39;t provided.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If basis is MSM then tell us, we can then verify/tear apart the statement. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well certainly.  This applies to literally any and <em>every</em> source that one can give or site, however.  Regardless of the source, it can and should absolutely be verified and possibly torn apart to test if it&#39;s valid or not.  This is very much independent of whether the source comes from the MSM or not, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Your comment about the monkeys is slightly different. That information is established or at least widely known and believed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay but now we have just inserted another dynamic into the paradigm of &quot;validity assessment&quot; whereby the extent to which something is &quot;publicly known and/or established&quot; commensurately mitigates the need for reference citing.  I see what you&#39;re saying (again), but this extra factor can make it even more of a convoluted mess - if not a slippery slope.  People can argue pretty effectively about just <em>what</em> kind of information is or is not - should or should not - be considered &quot;common knowledge&quot; or &quot;publicly known&quot;.</p>

<p>Someone could, with decent justification say about a <em>lot</em> of things something like &quot;What?  You didn&#39;t know <em>that?</em>  Well that&#39;s not <em>my</em> fault, man.  That shit is <em>totally</em> well-established.&quot;</p>

<p>Next thing you know, one is arguing deeply about whether something is indeed &quot;common knowledge&quot; or not - to say nothing about the actual source information.  In other words, it can get pretty darn relative - making the conclusion to your statement (that the comment about monkey&#39;s is a bit different) quite a bit relative and subject to debate, as the validity of your premise (that the information is already established and widely known) may very well fluctuate from person to person.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I would actually agree with what you&#39;re saying within certain parameters.  The problem with this is that there <em>are</em> indeed things (many, it turns out, in the world of global corruption and manipulation that we unfortunately live in) that really <em>do</em> fall outside of these given parameters.  Therefore, there is actually quite a bit of valid information out there that is either not acknowledged, undermined by disinformation, or flat out denied by the MSM outright.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Ha.  Yeah.  You DEFINITELY have to be careful, as there is indeed a lot of &quot;squat&quot; around these parts.  I agree with your general sentiment that one should attempt to source their information, but I also think that it should be acknowledged that this is by no means an easy thing when it has definitely been shown that we live in a world where corruption and lies and deceit are absolutely replete and pervasive throughout the whole of this society, and the top tier of the pyramid is JUST as if not <em>MORE</em> likely to spread lies and disinformation than the bottom base of it where the masses reside.</p>
