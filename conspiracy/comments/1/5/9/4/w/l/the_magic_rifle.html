<p>During a newscast on the <strong>morning</strong> of the shooting it is reported that, according to &quot;federal officials <em>and</em> state officials&quot;, an AR15 style rifle has already been found in Lanza&#39;s car and four handguns inside the school. Then much later that <strong>evening</strong> we have a video of officers retrieving a semi-automatic shotgun from the trunk of the car.</p>

<p>So, two long guns were found in the car. Yet the medical examiner confirms that the victims were shot with a &quot;long gun&quot;. In this video he doesn&#39;t specify but other reports say they were shot with a .223 caliber weapon which is consistent with an AR15.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If a search of the car turned up an AR15 in the morning, why wasn&#39;t the shotgun also found at that time? </p></li>
<li><p>Why wasn&#39;t the shotgun &quot;found&quot; until evening?</p></li>
<li><p>Was there yet another AR15 found inside the school along with the four handguns?</p></li>
<li><p>If there was only the one AR15 that was found in the car how could it have been used on the victims?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone have new updates of the gun count and where they were found?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rifle we see in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNRqp9pcfY8">this</a> video is clearly not an AR platform. It&#39;s most likely a semi automatic shotgun, like a saiga, as you can see by the cartridge that is ejected on the first cycle and then further you can see that the breach is far too large even from a helicopter. also it wasn&#39;t a bolt, or a charging handle. They can&#39;t make up their minds as to which gun was used, or they aren&#39;t telling us. but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s likely that we will get a solid report any time soon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s shown in the video I posted and yes, as I pointed out in my text, it&#39;s definitely a semi-automatic shotgun.</p>

<p>Edit: My point was that officials stated that an AR15 had been found in the car in the morning and this video takes place in the evening.</p>

<p>stating that a rifle is found in the trunk of a car and then reporting that it was used in the school conflicts. no one would take the rifle from the school and just set it down on accident, so where are the reports coming from and why are they incorrect.</p>

<p>They originally said 4 handguns, but there were only 2. What could this be but a mistake? Why would they need to cover up 2 more guns?</p>

<p>That&#39;s backwards. Originally they said two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because this incident was broadcasted worldwide and made into a large event. Not to mention that identifying a weapon isn&#39;t difficult when they have the weapon. The inconsistencies aren&#39;t in areas that are easily messed up on. A shotgun barrel and an AR barrel are completely differently bored. The police are also trained and familiar with guns enough to the difference of that at least, especially with the amount involved. If you honestly believe that not one of them would have noticed what kind of weapons they physically saw, then you truly must undermine human capabilities. </p>
