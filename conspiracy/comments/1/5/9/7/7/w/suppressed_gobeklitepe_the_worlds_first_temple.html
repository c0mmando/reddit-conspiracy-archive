        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Having noticed an absolute dearth of information concerning the mind blowing discovery that shakes the conventional history of human civilization to its very foundation; I finally discovered a film about Gobeklitepe. A quality documentary with real information that bravely and effectively questions convention. </p>

<p>I had run across one from National geographic, and it was good but seemed overly reluctant to fully embrace the significance of the site by making it out to be a simple matter of reordering the catalysts of human civilization:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=7ceXk_VLQAE#!">National Geographic Lost Civilization</a>  &lt;-- (on youtube for the moment)</p>

<p>The NG film is good but unfulfilling to a large degree.</p>

<p>Unlike the National Geographic video, the documentary, <strong><a href="http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/1908/40465130354517009337130.jpg">Gobeklitepe: The Worlds First Temple</a></strong> asks the questions and takes risks, but no leaps without a firm basis. This isn&#39;t a youtube based production, it&#39;s a marvelous presentation with details and bona-fide experts.</p>

<p>The official site is here:</p>

<p><a href="http://worldsfirsttemple.com/">Gobeklitepe World&#39;s First Temple</a></p>

<p>But, unfortunately there are no links to where you can purchase the movie.</p>

<p>The IMDB site is equally vacant of information:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1622984/">Gobeklitepe: The World&#39;s First Temple  (2010)</a></p>

<p>Amazon.com has nothing on it as well.</p>

<p>Over 2 years since release, a wonderful documentary and hardly anything about it.</p>

<p>Well, I downloaded the 80 minutes long (969 MB) video last night via a torrent link from this site:</p>

<p><a href="http://kat.ph/gobeklitepe-the-worlds-first-temple-576p-x264-aac-t6195044.html">Gobeklitepe The Worlds First Temple 576p x264 AAC</a></p>

<p>I use <a href="http://qbittorrent.sourceforge.net/">qBittorrent</a>.</p>

<p>I highly recommend anyone who has an interest in &quot;forbidden&quot; archaeology to watch the video. </p>

<p>For those that don&#39;t know:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gobeklitepe.info/">What is Gobeklitepe?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The World’s First Temple, Gobeklitepe … a pre-historic site, about 15 km away from the city of Sanliurfa, Southeastern Turkiye. What makes Gobeklitepe unique in its class is the date it was built, which is roughly twelve thousand years ago, circa 10,000 BC. </p>

<p>Archaeologically categorised as a site of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A Period (c. 9600–7300 BC) Göbeklitepe is a series of mainly circular and oval-shaped structures set on the top of a hill. Excavations began in 1995 by Prof. Klaus Schmidt with the help of the German Archeological Institute. There is archelological proof that these installations were not used for domestic use, but predominantly for ritual or religous purposes. Subsequently it became apparent that Gobeklitepe consists of not only one, but many of such stone age temples. Furthermore, both excavations and geo magnetic results revealed that there are at least 20 installations, which in archeological terms can be called a temple. Based on what has been unearthed so far, the pattern principle seems to be that there are two huge monumental pillars in the center of each installation, surrounded by enclosures and walls, featuring more pillars in those set-ups.</p>

<p>The two hour film discusses findings of particular interest to people who have found the official history of humanity somewhat lacking. This isn&#39;t about Aliens or the Illuminati but is about openly questioning conventional history and not being afraid to say &quot;Atlantis&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just finished watching it and found it all to be quite interesting. It&#39;ll take a while to digest it. I did notice a couple of interesting things that I&#39;ll comment on here though.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I&#39;ve read all of Velikovsky&#39;s works years ago and he paid only passing interest in Atlantis. It was a far cry from devoting his life to it as stated in the video.</p></li>
<li><p>Again with Velikovsky. In the video when I first saw the &quot;eye&quot; with the crescent under it on a pillar at Gobeckli Tepe my jaw dropped. Velikovsky made much of this symbol and it&#39;s usage in ancient times and tried to equate it with Saturn as it would have looked to the ancients if it&#39;s orbit were closer to the sun than it now is. He was very interested in showing how the ancients were writing about planetary events that they actually saw in the sky which evolved into worship of the &quot;gods&quot;.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s late for me here so I&#39;m off to bed now.</p>

<p>Thanks again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I forgot to mention this last night but it was the first thing that struck me.</p>

<p>At the beginning when the timeline was being shown there was a big, blue Star of David. I found that to be totally contrived and it stuck out like a sore thumb. If it had been an actual artifact showing a Star of David then that would have been perfectly reasonable. That alone almost ruined the whole movie for me and as I watched I was expecting to see more of the same. Thankfully that was all, at least that I noticed the first time through. I&#39;m going to watch it again within the next few days.</p>

<p>As a side note, I have about 10k files on my computer relating to ancient history.  I&#39;ve been studying it as a hobby for about 25 years. I find the arguments of <a href="http://www.varchive.org/">Immanuel Velikovsky</a> and others like <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/NewChronology/">David Rohl</a> for a revised chronology to be quite convincing, even though they don&#39;t quite match.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have watched it three times now and with subtitles for the non-English segments. The downloaded file was high quality, really a beautiful film.</p>

<p>The time-line at the beginning did have a <a href="http://www5.picturepush.com/photo/a/11746838/1024/Picture-Box/SoD.jpg">Star of David</a> on it, I didn&#39;t think too much about that, it had other icons for historical events as well bu went by rather fast so it was hard to parse it out but went back and paused it. It appears it&#39;s their to show the founding of Jerusalem or the Great Temple of Solomon.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you must be able to quote and provide a source for any such law. Otherwise you wouldn&#39;t have said it... right?</p>

<p>Ok, I guess that <em>maybe</em> you know what encryption is but now how it <em>works</em>. </p>

<p>Right - I&#39;m not at all trying to come up with a ridiculous scenario to point out how silly you are. The situation I offered is about as likely as getting busted for torrenting while encrypted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just finished watching it and found it all to be quite interesting. It&#39;ll take a while to digest it. I did notice a couple of interesting things that I&#39;ll comment on here though.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I&#39;ve read all of Velikovsky&#39;s works years ago and he paid only passing interest in Atlantis. It was a far cry from devoting his life to it as stated in the video.</p></li>
<li><p>Again with Velikovsky. In the video when I first saw the &quot;eye&quot; with the crescent under it on a pillar at Gobeckli Tepe my jaw dropped. Velikovsky made much of this symbol and it&#39;s usage in ancient times and tried to equate it with Saturn as it would have looked to the ancients if it&#39;s orbit were closer to the sun than it now is. He was very interested in showing how the ancients were writing about planetary events that they actually saw in the sky which evolved into worship of the &quot;gods&quot;.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s late for me here so I&#39;m off to bed now.</p>

<p>Thanks again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I forgot to mention this last night but it was the first thing that struck me.</p>

<p>At the beginning when the timeline was being shown there was a big, blue Star of David. I found that to be totally contrived and it stuck out like a sore thumb. If it had been an actual artifact showing a Star of David then that would have been perfectly reasonable. That alone almost ruined the whole movie for me and as I watched I was expecting to see more of the same. Thankfully that was all, at least that I noticed the first time through. I&#39;m going to watch it again within the next few days.</p>

<p>As a side note, I have about 10k files on my computer relating to ancient history.  I&#39;ve been studying it as a hobby for about 25 years. I find the arguments of <a href="http://www.varchive.org/">Immanuel Velikovsky</a> and others like <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/NewChronology/">David Rohl</a> for a revised chronology to be quite convincing, even though they don&#39;t quite match.</p>
