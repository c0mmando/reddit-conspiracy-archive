       That's a pretty self-centered attitude.  In context we are talking about compulsory school attendance enforced by courts of law.

       Do you think everyone who lived before public schooling led empty, sad lives?  We just swung down from the trees and got mopey for several thousand years until someone forced us into classrooms?

       Without education, we wouldn't be speaking to each other now. I can't understand how you fail to comprehend the basic importance of education. Just because you didn't like school doesn't devalue or delegitimise the concept of educating either our children or ourselves. If you genuinely believe this, I hope to God you never have offspring of your own upon whom to inflict this screwed-up ideology.

       I was distraught that we spend money enforcing compulsory education through our judicial system while homeless people starve in the streets of the greatest nation in the world.

       In response you posit the ridiculous notion that life without education is "pretty darn worthless" while ignoring that several billion years of life without education which inevitably led to your birth, and subsequent succinct self-depreciation.

       If schooling wasn't compulsory, there would still be schools and rooms full of children, because the overwhelming majority of parents understand the value of basic education.  How would a lack of compulsory schooling equal no schools?

       Why don't we all live in our own houses, in our own countries, and grow all our own foods? Then we can marry our own siblings, and in-breed with each other propagating inbred families and never living the pure human essence.

       This is a terrible thought. The very idea here is simply promoting the idea that we need to be afraid of everyone, which is the fundamental basis for the increased security over the past decade - be afraid of everyone else and be afraid of being in public because everyone else is bad. Let's just put security up at all the schools, at all the malls, theaters, and public places because something possibly could go wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not look at the actual reason things do go wrong.

       Guess what? Adam Lanza was home-schooled.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Marsha, who lives in the Chicago suburb of Crystal Lake, said that Nancy had home-schooled Adam after pulling him out of the Newtown public school system. "She mentioned she wound up home-schooling him because she battled with the school district," said Marsha.

       The best way to increase sociopathic tendencies is to not interact with people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your line of thought is 100% along the lines that led to the Patriot Act and the NDAA. If 0.001% of people get hurt in one random act of violence, let's overthrow all of what has led us to becoming the society we are. Do you approve of the TSA too?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you honestly propose that we further society without public schooling? I agree there are numerous faults with public schooling, but there is no way that our society could exist without it. We would not have basic public servants to take out your trash, make your food, run your stores, provide your utilities, and run your government. How do you think we get the fundamental ideologies to run these functions? How can you home-school someone if you haven't been taught by someone else previously?

       Public schools does not encompass all interaction. Equating the two shows me your are not at this point capable of reasonable thought.

       Here in Britain we let people choose whether or not they want to watch a film. Perhaps it's different in the States though?

       I don't know.  This is a slippery slope.  Education is important.  However the actual education system we have is very outdated and causes more problems than it solves.   Its become more of a scam and a babysitting service than actual education.
