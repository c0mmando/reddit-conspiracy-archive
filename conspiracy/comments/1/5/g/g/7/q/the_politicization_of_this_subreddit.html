       Ever since the beginning of the 2012 Presidential campaign I have watched this subreddit get more and more politicized and less about conspiracy. Our top post today was about the inaguration and how much it costs, no shady plan as to why, no alterior motive. Just bitching about politics. Hell, our sidebar picture has been more attacks on the president than anything connected to conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to end the takeover of this subreddit by those who would misdirect our thoughts and questions elsewhere. Stop posting articles on political news and information that isn't conspiratorial.

       Disarming could be a conspiracy, based on how you word it and your veiwpoint. Simple "guns are my right" is political, "They are trying to take away the guns to better install a police state" is more to the conspiratorial tune.

       Partisan of political viewpoints should simply be downvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, criticism of the President, Government or Congress is NOT in and of itself, partisan or political, particularly if these entities are behaving in a way which is ultra vires (ie beyond their remit) and/or directly contradictory to your rights as a citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Congress and the US President deserve to be publicly excoriated for their roles in creating the frankenstein's monster that is the NDAA, even by people who support the Democratic Party.

       While we are on the subject of what is and is not a conspiracy I wanted to say something that I feel is related. Prior to the economy taking a total shit around 09 you very rarely saw conspiracies involving the Fed,The Rothchilds these days everything is connected to them. My favorites lately are how the Rothchilds,Masons, Illuminati and the Fed are all the same organization.... I bet these fuckers run area 51 too.

       What did someone say on this thread?
"Dictionaries and their definitions change with the whims and fashions of the masses,"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that about sums it up.
      </p>

       Further I want to state that there is an exception to the rule that leftists are anti guns.

       I think if two guys want to live together and get married and raise little gay kids with their lesbian friend from the communist meetings they should have free healthcare and the right to bear arms and should exercise it.

       I am forever disappointed with my colleagues on the left who do not see that their first amendment rights(and most of the others) are entirely dependent on their second amendment rights.

        The etymology of the word conspiracy.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Dictionaries and their definitions change with the whims and fashions of the masses, some words are even created to be cute and to sell dictionaries, (such as staycation{a word for total plebes}) One wouldn't seek to gain gestalt of the art of music listening to something as profane as Soulja Boi, yes that is the level of vulgarity I compare modern dictionaries to - To truly understand a word you must delve the etymological sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        mid-14c., from Anglo-Fr. conspiracie, O.Fr. conspiracie "conspiracy, plot," from L. conspirationem (nom. conspiratio) "agreement, union, unanimity," noun of action from conspirare (see conspire); earlier in same sense was conspiration (early 14c.), from Fr. conspiration (13c.), from L. conspirationem.
       </strong>
       An Old English word for it was facengecwis. As a term in law, from 1863. Conspiracy theory is from 1909.0
      </p>

       Good one ol' chum, you are correct in a manner, yet realize you are using a highly watered down version of the word conspiracy it's depth and emotion narrowed and divided to fit the masses, it's edge - dulled. it's original intent - swayed. A definition watered down and safe for intellectual bleaters.

      <p>
       I beg to differ. In both common and legal parlance, a conspiracy is a (secret) plot between multiple parties to commit a crime or other nefarious act. The word also suggests an element of scale, ie a non-trivial event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Primo, eating pizza is not a crime, so you cannot "conspire" to eat pizza, (other than in an ironic sense).
      </p>
      <p>
       Secundo, purloining a pizza is fairly trivial crime, and I would suggest that two people planning to illicitly avail themselves of such, is not an act of sufficient import to qualify as "a conspiracy".

       I'm flattered that you added my coda to your definition, and I like how you remind people of the precise meaning of conspiracy. That word's convenient misuse is a bugbear for me as well. But I wish you would quit deleting yourself, because it means you don't stand behind the definition. You probably won't even see this.

       There are a lot of left-wing extremists on this site pushing the whole socialist thing I've noticed.  Right-wing types are a staple on something like this, but the socialists arguing
