       I've never called anybody an actor. The part of the story I question is the lone gunman, and all the misinformation surrounding which guns were used at which point. The reports are all over the place on this story, yet some of you don't question that.

       The problem is we have a 24/7 news cycle, and a requirement to keep informed, no matter if it's "good" news or "bad" news.  We had tens if not a hundred people calling up the different news channels with their tips or what they heard and the stations calling their contacts trying to find out news.  And whatever they heard was what went on the air, and the stations were also feeding off each other.  I recall when CNN finally had a credible source on the air, and what she said happened was vastly different than the story at the time, but they still kept reporting a low body count and other things that were found to be later wrong.  THAT'S the reason that the reports are all over the place initially, and it's the same thing that happens EVERYTIME there is some kind of disaster.  How accurate was the initial reporting at Virgina Tech?  But people insist that the news can't foul up, or it's a conspiracy.  You also have these same news agencies knowing the formula on how to broadcast, which many people don't.  We are coming up on a holiday, and there are little children to bury and a White House which wants to make people think that they are talking care of things.  So the coverage they are broadcasting now is funerals, talking head pundits, and less of the gory details.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also have people basing arguments off of the interview of  6-8 year old children whom I'm sure would tell you that they were a fire truck a week before if you asked them or they REALLY met Santa Claus at the mall.

       He's got to be a shill. After examining his actions. And all those upvotes to him, down for others? Many from well-known conservatives who haunt the Conspiratard sub and attack other subs. Couple of shills in their numbers, who are present here.

       To read the posts on here, Sandy Hook was the first shot in the final push to disarm and enslave you. An insidious false flag. But what's everyone in the conspiracy world up to? Breakfast, work, internet, yawn. No one is going out there to expose the "lies." No one will go up to one of these parents and say to their face that they're a fraud. Your big chance to expose the machine and the only finger any of you can bear to lift is the one that takes you to YouTube and reddit.

       Hey, I'll have you know looking at YouTube videos is probably the most enlightening thing someone can do. Reading and writing cannot express the complex info fast enough, plus it's boring and can't show visual evidences. Who is anyone to tell me what counts as Research? Reading mainstream news or science is a pollutant to the mind. And I don't need to divulge any of my info to anyone, that's mine! If you want to learn yourself you can start by doing some research on YouTube. At least I'm not a sheeple like everyone else. Anyone who would let you believe otherwise is probably a zionist. I've linked sandy hook with 9/11, I wonder if you'll be barely not retarded enough to do the same.

       The media circus isn't cool, either.  These people need time and space, but the frightening part to me is that you people don't believe they need either.  You think they're "B grade actors" at the heart of a massive plot that you've uncovered by
       <em>

       .

       The fact that the conspiracy community has a history of total and complete inactivity is the only fact I find comforting about you right now.  But the victims' families will still have the displeasure of finding your conspiracy media circus online one day, where you call their dead loved ones frauds and laugh at their grief.

       It's because you've taken a situation that's particularly devastating to the people involved, partially because a lot of children were killed, and you've attempted to exploit the people who are left mourning in order to inflate a false sense of importance in your talentless ad hoc detective agency.

       The media circus isn't cool, either.  These people need time and space, but the frightening part to me is that you people don't believe they need either.  You think they're "B grade actors" at the heart of a massive plot that you've uncovered by
       <em>
        sitting in your chair and doing nothing
       </em>
       .
      </p>

       The fact that the conspiracy community has a history of total and complete inactivity is the only fact I find comforting about you right now.  But the victims' families will still have the displeasure of finding your conspiracy media circus online one day, where you call their dead loved ones frauds and laugh at their grief.

       Must feel good to be on that high horse of yours. Was the theater shooting not devastating to those involved? I didn't see you in here bitching then.

       Also, may I ask you what brought you to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       in the first place? I mean, you're obviously not open to alternative stories than what's being reported on MSM, so you don't really fit the conspiracy mold. Especially if you can't even
       <em>
        consider
       </em>
       the possibility that something isn't right here.
      </p>

       Go ahead, continue your hate though. If you ask me, you're too self righteous for your own good. BTW, I hope you enjoyed that Carlin video.
