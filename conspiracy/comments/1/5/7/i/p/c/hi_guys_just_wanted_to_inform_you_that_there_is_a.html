Just because you have a rifle locked away in a gun cabinet does not make you an unstoppable anti-takeover machine. Even just using foot soldiers, they will easily defeat us. Also a fun thing to ruminate over, how plausible is it that every U.S. soldier will be willing to mercilessly slaughter/capture their fellow citizens? Wouldn&#39;t a robotic, non-guilt feeling implementation of takeover be more reasonable? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with many of the ideas expressed in this forum and find it a useful source of information. I don&#39;t think that gun control is the biggest threat. In fact I find gun manufacturing to be much more dangerous and I worry about the creeping militarization of everyday life. The US has a lot of guns and a lot of problems... and the weapons seem to create problems in the other places that the US exports them to. Consider that the NRA has a lot to gain from this backlash against Obama... and plenty to gain also from sales to the police and to the military. I don&#39;t trust the NRA and the gun industry any more than I trust the oil or pharmaceutical lobbies. Peace &amp; have a good baktun.</p>
