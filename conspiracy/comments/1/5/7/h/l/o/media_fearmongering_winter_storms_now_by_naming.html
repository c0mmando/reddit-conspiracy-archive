        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is an obvious ploy to push the whole &quot;climate change&quot; alarmism by equating winter storms with hurricanes.  Problem is, is that hurricanes are named because there are certain criteria that need to be met to be classified a hurricane.  Winter Storms come in many different varieties and are a very normal part of winter in the northern states.  The average TV addled mind however may see these new &quot;named&quot; storms as further &quot;proof&quot; that man-made climate change is real because for fuck&#39;s sake, <em>the storm had a name!</em></p>

<p>Edit:  It&#39;s just the Weather Channel naming them, it&#39;s not &quot;official&quot;.</p>

<p>The Weather Channel is owned by NBC Universal and BAIN CAPITAL.  </p>

<p>NBC is owned by Comcast and GE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>damn, maybe he was watching the weather channel too and saw the name.  Kind of an ominous name too, Draco, as in Dragon.  I see it as media manipulation of public perception, fear mongering basically.  If a storm has a name people equate it with something HUGE as opposed to just something normal that happens every year.</p>

Jesus I forgot how everyone on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> doesn&#39;t actually know about the Big-oil foundations funding the AGW bullshit.  Do some research you&#39;ll find your precious &quot;environmentalist&quot; groups and NGOs are almost exclusively funded by big-oil or other mega-conglomerate corporation through tax-free foundations.  There have been books written on the subject and countless articles, they don&#39;t make it to HuffPo though so maybe you didn&#39;t read them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was resisting trolling here.  I didn&#39;t criticize your views.  I was trying to be helpful.  Don&#39;t get all semantic happy when we both know perfectly well what was bring referred to.  I read your post when it was in new and had no upvotes.  We can go all pro choice vs anti abortion but what good will that do?  If you want an actual criticism I can throw out a million.  I&#39;m not being a prick, don&#39;t be a prick back. You don&#39;t even know where I actually stand on this for heavens sakes.  I find it dubious you weren&#39;t listening to ground zero when you basically repeated verbatim something on the radio right after it was said.  I didn&#39;t jump on your denial if knowing about the show did I?</p>
