    <div class="md"><p>But 16 year olds are OK? ;)     </p>

<p>In all seriousness though, I think that prohibition just gives something a more enticing aura and causes people to not only want it more but also to be less responsible when given the chance to finally indulge. When something is just always there and less of a big deal (such as a farm kid driving at a young age) then while there is always exceptions, it is more likely that the thing in question won&#39;t be such a big deal and handled more responsibly. The second you tell someone they can&#39;t do something, the more they will want to at least try it.     </p>

<p>Maybe we should look into what about our society causes us to so badly want to escape reality and/or act irresponsibly without regard for our own or others well being and address that rather than prohibit the things we tend to indulge in irresponsibly. That&#39;s just my two cents on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends if you think the units consumed in irregular binges are more than would be consumed by regular legal drinking.</p>

<p>In all the countries I&#39;ve lived in that allow drinking at the age of 18 people below 21 still go out drinking a lot they just do it at bars and clubs instead of fields and dorms.</p>

<p>The reason it&#39;s 21 in the US is because of organisations like MADD forcing a partial prohibition(since a full one would never pass now).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is incorrect, of course any theory of my own would be just as speculative without numbers. </p>

<p>However the reason I think this is incorrect is because you are saying that the government has determined that 18-20 year olds will be so blinded with desire to drink they will break the law and drink more than is necessary and increase alcohol sales. </p>

<p>Are you for increasing or decreasing the age? Because either way this rule would still apply apparently. If you lower it to 18, now you&#39;d just have a bunch of 15-17 year olds binge drinking. Increasing it? Now you have 21-23 year olds.  In fact a 16 year old has more disposable income than an 18 year old with bills...by this logic the government would want to lower it to 18 so 16 year olds waste 100% of their minimum wage movie theater checks on beer.</p>

<p>Wait now you come back and say they already do this. Even with the law at 21 the 15 year olds are binge drinking? Then according to your argument it doesnt even matter what the age is with regards to the law. Because if we lowered it to 18 or increased it to 29...someone below those ages would drink.</p>

<p>Bottom line at no specific time is anyone responsible enough to do what they may be legally allowed to do. Laws are in place to keep a little order at the minimum. You can be 15 or 35 and be an irresponsible piece of shit. It comes down to education, parenting, and social responsibilities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in the UK too.  The &quot;drinking age&quot; of 18 is actually the age you need to be to <em>purchase</em> the alcohol... it&#39;s not an alcohol age of consent.</p>

<p>Young children can drink at home in extreme moderation under parental supervision.  Obviously, if you have a nine year old alcoholic child you&#39;ll get Social Services paying you a visit but you know what I mean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Utah and the Alcohol content level of our beer is 3.2% I realize that is the level in alot of states, but two of our neighboring states that I know of have 5.0% alcohol. It dawned on me that Utah might have done this to sell more of their weaker level beer than what they would sell at the 5.0% level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, think about it when I go to Wyoming and buy a twelve pack of their beer I usually have a good buzz after three beers, but the Utah crap usually takes four or five and I buy more. I know the attitude here in Utah is heavily influenced by the LDS church and all, but the more you spend whether or not you have a problem will eventually lead to more tithing money in their coffers if the business is owned by a church going mormon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am British, and I think the entire American attitude to alcohol [&#39;scuse the alliteration] is just plain wrong and outdated.  I think your problem is that your society doesn&#39;t understand alcohol properly.  By demonising it, you don&#39;t give people a chance to properly adapt or take it seriously - in continental Europe, kids grow up around controlled alcohol consumption and they have much less binge drinking than most other places.  The Kennedy family [yes, that one] made at least part of their vast fortune through moonshine smuggling in the Prohibition years.  Ironic considering how revered and genuine JFK apparently was.</p>

<p>In the US, when aged under 21 you can: drive; join the military and die in service overseas; own a house; get married; graduate from college; start a career; be sentenced to life without parole; be sentenced to death [if aged &gt;=18]... but you can&#39;t touch a drop of alcohol?  I&#39;m sorry, but that is absurd.  Old enough to be blown up in Afghanistan but not old enough to have one celebratory drink at your own wedding, is this leaked SNL stand-up material as part of some comedy extravaganza or is this how things actually are in the US?</p>
