As long as we downvote the shills who have nothing to contribute, and keep investigating, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will be just fine. I also just wanna say that it&#39;s not enough just discussing these things on the internet, you gotta go to your friends and family and talk to them about Mossad and 911, talk to them about the HSBC bullshit, talk to them about Bilderberg and the Bohemian Grove.

    <div class="md"><p>if it makes you feel any better, I joined in that time frame and I downvote only the people who immediately dismiss things without a discussion, and the of course caustic individuals who don&#39;t contribute. I think it would do people well to come in here with an open mind. if you want standard by the books information and discussion go over to world news. If you want to question everything come here. I&#39;m sure many people in here would find this offensive to their ideas and theories, but I treat here like I do nosleep. it is ALL possible, show me how.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually disagree. I think this /r/ has grown substantially in the last months as people are increasingly aware of the fact that the stuff that is posted here (or has been posted here) has been closer to the truth than what would be seen (and censored) in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>The mods of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> do not speak with each other much, but it is pretty clear that we all feel the same way about content in this /r/; that we allow posts for the free thinking and discussion of the users.</p>

<p>Even the mods see some of the problems with certain ideas and posts, but I think that the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subscribers do a fantastic job of calling out things that are not thought-out well, false, tenuous connections etc. There is a good deal of self-moderation among the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subscribers.</p>

<p>But the base point is that we do not want to apply a heavy censorship to the topics and content posted here. This is a double-edged sword, as we can tell that there are issues with some things.</p>

<p>I have been trying to figure out the best way to allow for better classification of content; either through content tagging, flair tagging or sub-sub-reddits to classify various niches of content. </p>

<p>At this time though, the admins state the best way to categorize content is just to make a completely separate sub for it. As you can see, we have been adding the subs to the sidebar when we have been requested to do so, though I think that simply having a whole slew of additional /r/ is cumbersome and disorganized...</p>

<p>Also, people were complaining about the &quot;availability heuristic&quot; when we hit 40K subs...</p>

<p>I am open to any discussion and suggestions on how the subscribers would like us to better moderate. Some of the tools given to users are simply not usable in this subreddit. E.G., the ability to &quot;report&quot; posts is utterly useless as pretty much the <strong><em>only</em></strong> content that gets flagged with the <em>report</em> feature is anything critical (even remotely) of irael/zionists. I flatly approve every single one of these simply on the principle of free speech - you are free to criticize and discuss anything and anyone in this subreddit. (Though you&#39;ll need to be composed and calm about it, we have banned many people who are only capable of expressing their views in antagonizing, abusive way)</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong>: Another user was asking about traffic, I posted <a href="http://imgur.com/a/axQt9">THIS</a> in response... we have grown 14,437 users in the last 2 months. With ~7500 new subscribers in December alone.</p>

But sadly no one does. No one ever comes to me and says, &quot;hey, we noticed you arguing with some asshole on an obscure internet forum. How about we pay you to keep arguing with him? That&#39;s totally not a misappropriation of funds at all!&quot;</p>

<p>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong. I wouldn&#39;t accept their offer because I&#39;m supporting some secret agenda or something. Hell, I don&#39;t even really support Israel. Nah, I&#39;d accept their offer because I&#39;m happy to take the money of any sucker who would pay me to try to convince a bunch of schizophrenic backwater white supremacists that they&#39;re wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I was giving example for social networks. Reddit is social network. </p>

<p>You can logically conclude that they would include Reddit in program that is targeting social networks.</p>

<p>Of course, I do agree with you this is not a proof but it is never the less interesting information which can be upgraded with new information when it becomes publicly available. Just something to keep an eye on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, from what I understand, 1 in 4 hackers is now working for the government to help find other hackers with threat of jail.  In the military, in recent years, they started pushing &quot;networking&quot;.  In other words, make buddies and friends to get the job done.  Now in order for someone to do their job, you have to be buddy buddy with them.  It&#39;s breaking down the very system our military was built on of discipline and responsibility.  To get promoted you have to be &quot;in&quot;.  If you&#39;re someone who asks questions and doesn&#39;t practice &quot;instant obedience to orders&quot;, you&#39;re eventually forced out.  Same thing works in the government and all over.  People are reporting each other left and right.  People are being desensitized, being fooled to blame people of certain beliefs that stand out and don&#39;t go with the flow.  Interesting times we live in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit has always been left leaning, at least in an American context, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has always been more libertarian leaning, within the context of reddit. The American military industrial complex has always been right leaning, in any context. </p>

<p>From the perspective of most people on the planet, Obama is a right wing war hawk. From the perspective of the right wing in America, he is a communist. </p>

<p>I would suggest to you that for certain elements of the military intelligence community, opposing communists and controlling the populace are not mutually exclusive goals.  </p>

<p>I do not presume to know the various mission objectives of the various agencies from various countries which all frequent reddit. I&#39;m not even sure I want to know. However, there is no denying that reddit&#39;s demographics have been changing, and there is a growing body of evidence that many of those new visitors are not here to fap, talk nerdy and look at cats.</p>

<p>You want to fight a good fight? Get off reddit and start working on yourself. Read a mind-expanding book. Exercise. Meditate. Bring positivity into this ridiculously negative world.

Those facts may be misinterpreted to support their crazy idea but they are still facts. I think it&#39;s healthy to push the envelope a little so people here get practice making their own choices about what to believe and what is too far out there. Alchemy turned out to be completely wrong, but alchemy experiments led us to some of the science and chemistry we have today. This doesn&#39;t make science crazy because it had crazy roots.
