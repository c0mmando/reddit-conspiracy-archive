    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Space travel would let people dream again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The honest truth is that humanity doesn&#39;t <em>deserve</em> to dream if it will likely do in space what it has already done here on Earth - i.e. enslave, pollute, torture, and have no respect for its own planet, let alone any other.  No.  You have to have a great level or responsibility before you are ready for that step, and we have shown that we don&#39;t have that yet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dreaming of a risky frontier worth working for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We would need to figure out first how to be able to go to a risky frontier without possibly enslaving and being violent toward any indigenous population that might be encountered.  We have BY FAR not done that here on this planet, so what is the likelihood we would do that elsewhere?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>worth getting lost and romanticized with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not worth killing and causing much pain to other beings, though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have been to the moon so I&#39;m told.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we are all told.  Very appropriate qualifier.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say &quot;WORK for freedom&quot; and I can&#39;t help but think of concentration camps &quot;Arbeit macht frei&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why on Earth would that ever be associated with what I said?  Nothing whatsoever there has to do with my point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What should we work for at this point?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Autonomy, discipline, freedom, peacefulness, and intelligence - all things we seem to be very much lacking in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fucking money? Just money? That&#39;s it? Go be a corporate drone. Shuffle paper? I&#39;m curious. </p>

<p>What exactly is wrong with you?  What would ever make you think that anything even REMOTELY similar to this is even being talked about?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>First of all, yes.  I <em>do</em> want utopia to happen.  I would love that.  However, I as well am also a realist.  The two postulations are not mutually exclusive by any means.  I know what I want, but I also know what we do and DON&#39;T have as a species currently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d rather be dreaming about the stars and the possibility for new beginnings than here on earth trying to lecture people on why their ideas are wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I personally would rather actually be UP VISITING THOSE STARS and their neighboring planets than merely dreaming about doing it.  However, as I said before (realist that I am), I realize that a species needs a certain level of collective discipline and development before it can accomplish things like that.</p>

<p>In other word, <em>fuck</em> dreaming.  Figure out what you need to do to ACTUALLY <em>DO</em> IT.  And let me tell you:  We are NOT on the path of accomplishing this &quot;dream&quot; at the rate we are currently going.  Right now it&#39;s simply nothing more than a pipe dream.  If the species really wants to accomplish space travel, then there are a LOT of things it&#39;s going to need to do FIRST <em>right here on this planet</em> before it can get its primitive ass up to the stars.</p>

<p>This is truth.</p>

<p>How&#39;s that for utopian thinking?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The thing is, the current drive to &quot;work&quot; is to make money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For many, this certainly is true.  Actually, it seems to be the case for everyone actually...just in different degrees.  Some more than others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People aren&#39;t getting into careers because they&#39;re passionate about them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am and have.  You need to be <em>really</em> careful with your gross oversimplifications.  They certainly don&#39;t apply to everyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are going to where the money is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol.  I&#39;m poor as <em>fuck</em> specifically <em>because</em> of my career choice and passion.  I have a degree and can be doing something very different than I am - actually making steady money - but I am not and have not been for many years BECAUSE of my passion and career choice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course there is exceptions to this, but it&#39;s a pretty general rule of thumb people equate success with money/things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is agreed, unfortunately.  It is unfortunately true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As far as Space having the same problems on Earth. Well, that&#39;s humanity for you.</p>

<p>I think it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to REMAIN like this.  I think we have the capacity to rise above our current psychological and emotional limitations if we but earnestly and consistently make a continued effort.</p>

<p>This might not be incorrect on your part, but I am willing to be open to other possibly effective options that don&#39;t involve a military rank and file type scenario.  All in all, however, I - again - agree in the sense that one thing that will indeed be necessary (as I have already mentioned and as you yourself have just indirectly mentioned here) is a LOT of discipline...but that discipline has to be coupled with a great amount of evolutionary maturity as well on the part of the species.</p>
