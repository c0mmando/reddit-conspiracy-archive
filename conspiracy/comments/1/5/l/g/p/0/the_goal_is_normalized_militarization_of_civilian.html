        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The goal is increased militarization of the civilian police force, making preparations (socially, psychologically, and physically) for an upcoming wibble in societal calm. The goal is <em>not</em> to disarm us, although that is just seen as a bonusâ€¦sauce for the goose. </p>

<p>Consider the events:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>School Shootings result in legitimate push for armed guards in schools.</p></li>
<li><p>Subway Pushings result in legitimate push for armed guards in transit.</p></li>
<li><p>Arming Mexico results in increased horrific border crime, resulting in legitimate push for better armed border guards and civilian police. </p></li>
<li><p>Internet Sliding results in changing the subject from &quot;our cops have become stormtroopers&quot; to &quot;they want your guns / lol no they don&#39;t / lol give up your guns&quot;. </p></li>
<li><p>9/11 in context resulted in increased patriotism and direct militarization of the civilian police force. </p></li>
<li><p>The TSA is an extension of point 5, and resulted in an entire new infrastructure. Note that the TSA will be used to satisfy the needs of point 2. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>All of the above serves to convince the public, and especially our youth, to obey authority under threat of punishment of death. </p>

<p>All of the above illustrates a concerted effort by TPTB to prepare for mass civil unrest, or at least to mitigate loss of social control and cohesion due to outside factors. </p>

<p>Your guns may come under threat, but probably not until we are further through the wibble - around the time the DHS has taken to rationing water in your community. Then it will be easy, right now, not so much, we are not a broken people. Yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So on point.</p>

<p>But what does it mean that so many people are aware of this? I know that we are painted as &quot;crazy conspiracy nuts&quot; but there are a lot of us. And the number of awakened people is increasing everyday (I hope). I doubt there were this many of us around when the Communists took control of Russia, or during the French and American revolutions. Will our presence make any difference at all? Even a tiny bit?</p>

<p>What I find scary is thinking of how the history books are going to look 25-50 years from now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want a government agency trying to provide security for me.  </p>

<p>The myth of a protective police force is laughable.  It seems that the militarization of the police force has already been well accomplished.  Look into what weapons and gear local units are buying, how many of their force are acting as &#39;reserve SWAT&#39; members (their training).  Even small town forces are receiving funding for M4s and Benellis.  The police are ready to go.  They already have the mentality for it and a huge number of them serve simultaneously in the National Guard or Army Reserves.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately for them, they are severely outnumbered and outgunned.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately for us who care, there&#39;s a new reality show on the &quot;History Channel&quot; to distract from the sleight of hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reality is that you have unlimited targets that need to be secured and you can never really have &quot;enough&quot; security if what you are looking for is 100% <strong>guaranteed security</strong>.</p>

<p>That is unless you want a camera and a security &quot;officer&quot; at every corner of the nation and in every single home.</p>

<p>To try to list everything you need to secure would be a list that would eventually include every single physical and network based object. </p>

<p>Everything... and there would still be leaks. It would never end. it is about control, and quite right - image 25-50 years of securing the country. You would live in a rather large and crowded prison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all started right after 9-11-2001, thanks to <strong>The Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs</strong> (JINSA)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit think-tank focusing on issues of United States and Israel in national security.</p>

<p><strong>In 2002, JINSA initiated a program</strong> aimed at exchanging counter-terrorism experience and tactics between U.S. law enforcement agencies and their counterparts in the Israeli National Police. <strong>The primary focus of the program is to bring U.S. law enforcement executives (chiefs, sheriffs, deputies, etc.) to Israel for an intensive two week program aimed at educating U.S. law enforcement officials on the possible threats posed by the specter of domestic terrorism in the United States</strong>. Over the course of four trips, nearly 60 police chiefs and sheriffs from departments in major American metropolitan areas (including Los Angeles, California (LAPD); Orlando, Florida; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Chicago, and the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD) of New York and New Jersey) have participated. <strong>The program has already led to significant changes in local law enforcement counter-terrorism tactics and training.</strong></p>

<p>In addition, the Law Enforcement Exchange Program (LEEP) brings Israeli police and counter-terror officials to the United States for intensive two-day seminars that to date have trained more than 1,500 law enforcement officers and officials around the U.S. LEEP has also played a life-saving role in training members of the U.S. Marine Corps in how to better protect civilians and soldiers, alike, against the threat of car and suicide bombers in Iraq.</p>
