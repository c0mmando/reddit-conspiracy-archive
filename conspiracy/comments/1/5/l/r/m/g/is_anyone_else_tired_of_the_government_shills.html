    <div class="md"><p>I think sometimes people overestimate the importance of what people say and think on the Internet. Most, if not all of it, is a distraction and purposefully contentious. The mix of facts and fakery fog up any true sense of understanding for the majority of people. The majority of people who can&#39;t spend hours upon hours sifting through text and videos comparing facts and interpretations simply pass all this stuff by, they have no time for such things.</p>

<p>The PTB can shut the Internet&#39;s backbone down by command, sites like reddit play the largely unwitting role of contributing to the illusion that we are still somewhat in control and able to question authority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wonderful, I wasted 5 minutes of my life to find that the only recent newsworthy occurrences of anything like this were the incredibly controversial arrest of two women in India, a country not exactly renowned for it&#39;s freedom of speech, and an arrest in Fiji, which is still in the hands of a military dictatorship.</p>

<p>Not to mention I don&#39;t have any issue with people looking for themselves, they&#39;re far more likely to get an informed idea about a given subject than they would from the typical <em>&quot;evidence&quot;</em> advanced by a conspiracy theorist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is, these amplifiers that you speak of come under the purview of one Federal Communications Commission, who will go to ridiculous lengths to shut said amplifiers down if and when they find them. </p>

<p>And, if they have more than a few users, find them they will. </p>

<p>In reality, the only way of accomplishing this in a practical manner is by micro-meshing on pre-established and licensed frequencies and even that is riddled with issues...not the least of which is <em>cost.</em></p>

<p>I mean, I simply love the idea <em>in theory</em> but in practice there are very few &quot;hackers&quot; altruistic enough to shell out more than $50 for hardware that would benefit people other than themselves-let alone the expense of, ahem, <em>launching a satellite</em>! </p>

<p>We can dream though, right? It may be realistically doable using some type of P2P cellular protocol if user density is high enough.</p>

<p>A type of highly censor-resistant data networking already exists and has existed for some years now...packet radio. I messed around with it right after getting my HAM ticket in the late 90s. Depending on distance and jamming resistance the speeds could be very good...especially if a company with the resources of an early-90s Lucent or US Robotics got behind it. </p>

<p>made me smile! </p>

<p>Very insightful comment...and the idea of the amps being aftermarket to circumvent FCC regs is also very clever; just like Apple did with the Apple II RF mods way back when. </p>

<p>The more I think about this the more ideas I&#39;m having. Easily the most thought-provoking comment I&#39;ve read all day. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll let you know if I have any brilliant insights into the problem (not bloody likely) and you please do the same if you wish. Thanks again friend and I hope you have a great 2013.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, I know, there&#39;s gold in them thar packets! </p>

<p>If this were fully thought through and the proper FCC channels/loopholes could be found I can see NO reason whatsoever why the company that did it wouldn&#39;t eventually make Comcast look like a low-end Spanish UHF channel. </p>

<p>One thing is for certain my friend...I think that this inevitably is coming if the NWO can be held off for long enough. Combining these attributes with very tough public-key encryption would change the world as we know it. </p>

<p>Problem is, I can&#39;t see the government allowing it...that&#39;s why I&#39;m thinking it would have to be a type of P2P-like system using an already established and proven (and licensed) decentralized system...kind of like a wireless BitTorrent on amphetamines. The low cost of terrestrial radio with the coverage of a satellite and the &quot;hardness&quot; of a wired network would be the goals I&#39;m thinking of. </p>

<p>Definitely cool stuff to think about in depth for geeks such as ourselves. Cheers for making me stop and consider the possibilities. Also thanks for that link a few posts ago. The thought of this is very exciting for me...I sure hope that people smarter than me get on this--hell, I&#39;m betting they already have. Hope so at least! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aah, I like that! A mysterious firmware update would be brilliant, would it not? ; &#39;) </p>

<p>I also have a TF300 (an upgrade from my TF101) and you&#39;re right about that for sure...I&#39;m currently 600ft away from my Linksys (also with an internal antenna) and my gain and S/N are <em>astounding</em>. </p>

<p>Of course amps will be needed, technically, but I get your drift. I know that the 300 puts out far under 1W which is utterly astounding considering it&#39;s performance with a very small and wholly internal antenna. My forte is not radio by any means but I can see where you&#39;re going with this. </p>

<p>These advantages are only growing with the advent and furthering of nanotechnology...radio propagation is a tricky old bitch and nearly every &quot;trick&quot; to it can be implemented in miniature. </p>

<p>I like the way you think. Smart People, you listening? Get on this! </p>

<p>I mean, would I pay, say, $10.00 per ASIC (on the end-user price) for even the <em>possibility</em> of this being implemented in the future? </p>

<p>Fuck yeah I would! ;&#39;) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, actually a watt is pretty conservative. I believe that you can broadcast up to three watts without regulation. I had my own only-Grateful Dead FM station in the mountain town I used to live in and 3W will push an FM signal quite a long way, even in mountainous terrain.</p>

<p>There is a type of very inexpensive experimental radio being used by hobbyists today...it&#39;s name escapes me at the moment (will look it up when I get home) but it allows data communications that can span the entire globe on 1 chip and about a tenth of a watt. It&#39;s very easy to build and is interfaced through the sound chip on a PC. It was featured in, I believe, <em>Nuts and Volts</em> magazine a few months back. It was really fascinating stuff; students are using it to communicate, among other things, weather station data. It&#39;s so low power that I believe the FCC doesn&#39;t regulate it at all.</p>

<p>I will try to find out more, as I said, and get back to you on it OK?</p>

<p>If you are really interested in learning radio there&#39;s no better and faster way than getting a &quot;tech no code&quot; HAM ticket like I have. If you have the time to join a &quot;club&quot; (user group) you will learn VERY quickly indeed as every question you have can be answered, usually, by an old pro. 2m is a great starting point, it&#39;s a very useful and interesting band!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Phish is about ALL I listen to. ; &#39;) Lots of Dead, Furthur, Allmans, WSP, Umphreys, and SCI too. I&#39;m your stereotypical old head brother... I cut off the dreads a few years back but my heart&#39;s still in it and will be forever, hehe! </p>

<p>Not doing NYE this year, new son, but I did summer tour from Deer Creek on. Doing couchtour though. Actually, I&#39;m seeing Leftover Salmon on NYE in Chicago it looks like. </p>

<p>I used to tape back during 1.0--&quot;my&quot; biggest era was 1991-2002. I&#39;ve been at about every &quot;classic&quot; show luckily. </p>

<p>Wow, so you&#39;re a head too? Amazing! </p>

<p>I would love to hook up for a show in Spring or Summer. Would love if you kept in touch as I am a &quot;dieselphiend&quot; also!</p>

<p>If you&#39;re even near Chicago we could have some great times. Please keep in touch! Where are you at in the world? </p>

<p>BTW, I have to run to the library to grab that magazine (mine is MIA) but I WILL get you that radio information...you simply MUST read the article. </p>

<p>I know the packet end pretty well (I&#39;m a UNIX admin and a pilot) and the radio part ok. Lets keep this idea alive and I sure hope that you keep in touch. Lets PM each other info and do some shows...I travel all around the country and would love to meet you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reality of the history is one of tribalism/religionism. The Jews could not or were not allowed to assimilate. It is not that big of a surprise as they would have spoken a different language than the host country and of course had a different religion, ethnic background so they probably looked different. Different cultural practices etc.</p>

<p>But, all of that said, we can see today Jews in the US who are more concerned with the Jews than with the country. Jews who are more concerned about Israel than the US. This dual alligence philosophy is not something which I can agree with, given the present nation-state system that the world is run on. There are lots of Jews who contribute to the US in many ways, but there are lots of Jews who just pollute the public discourse too. A complex entity, the Jews are.</p>

<p>I&#39;m Jewish, but not Ashkenazim. I see what these people are doing to my once-great nation. I think that the entire dual-citizen model should be scrapped (at least in government). If you are a citizen of Israel how can I trust you to make decisions that benefit the US and only the US? </p>

<p>There seem to be a LOT more that &quot;pollute the public discourse&quot; IMHO. Sure, there are Ashkenazim that have helped the world immeasurably but look at the cost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Between the rip-offs by the banks and the Jewish financed Holywood movies promoting anything from sex to violence to drugs, people have had enough and they are beginning to question why they should have to put up with this type of bs. You want to smoke dope? Fine. You are an adult and if you decide to break the law, you can pay the fine. But promoting drug use thru pushing movies and music and the whole trash lifestyle that comes with it, to kids? Sure, you can fool them and you can hook them on the lies. But at some point the push back will come. The last time it happened was Europe. This time it will be the US. The only difference will be that the technology is much more advanced this time around.

<p>The only &quot;chosen&quot; status Jews have is that God chose them to keep a special covenant He never offered any other group and told them that they would be the &quot;apple of His eye&quot; if they kept it. But, ultimately God gets tired of the Jews and their ways. He told them when they reached the promised land to &quot;Go on up. but I shall not go with you for you are a stiff-necked people and I will kill you on the way.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s as chosen as it gets for the Jews. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you had interest in that sort of thing, it&#39;s rather easy to find the information.</p>

<p>The Bible is a Christian text for the most part, the Old Testament is more applicable to the Jewish religion, but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> in particular.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews_as_a_chosen_people">Jews as the chosen people</a></p>

<p>Following Christianization of the Roman Empire, the general implication of the word gentile became &quot;non-Jew&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much for the information. I <em>do</em> have some interest in this (admittedly not much) and had no inclination to slog through the Bible again. </p>

<p>Aah, gotta love the Internet... </p>

<p>EDIT: Any sources other than Zionist-centric (to put it lightly) Wikipedia? I guess what I&#39;m asking is are there any sources for the &quot;chosen&quot; claim <em>outside</em> of Judaism itself? I mean, that&#39;s kind of a joke (no offense) -- by those guidelines <strong>every</strong> religion could consider themselves &quot;God&#39;s chosen people!&quot; I mean, come on, trusting Wikipedia with this info is akin to asking a circle of bitchy old rabbis after synagogue. </p>

<p>Thanks anyhow for trying. </p>

<p>A light perusal of the bible will show that god <strong><em>hates</em></strong> the jews, <em>almost</em> as much as he hates everyone else.  If the jews ever lose a war, it is not because god likes the other people, he is just being an asshole to the jews.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Made this as a self post but it was deleted...</p>

<p>I often post here as what some of you would call &#39;shilling&#39; under a different account. I make the odd comment questioning the logic and evidence which is given for certain posts. Debating, or reasoning. For this post I made a new account because it would be embarrassing for me if my friends found out how much thought/ time/ pride I put into questioning &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39;.</p>

<p>Firstly, I don&#39;t work for the government. I&#39;m a 23 year old from the UK. Not working much at the moment so I have a lot of time which is mostly spent reading stuff on the internet. The internet is of course full of opinions, and the ones that have always interested me the most is those of conspiracy theorists. The ones I pay attention to are intelligent, thoughtful and passionate; the kind of people who&#39;s opinions I always like to hear.</p>

<p>Thing is, no matter how much I try to take on board these views, they are never backed up with conclusive evidence, just loose bits of third party information which there is always more to disprove. I genuinely hold having an objective and unbiased point of view as a personal high priority for myself, so I hold a lot of non-mainstream ideals (such as U.S. warmongering and Israeli &#39;settlements&#39; being bang out of order, I also believe Tonkin and Northwoods should be as famous as Watergate) but 98% of the stuff you guys talk about (which I won&#39;t argue about specifics here, my point is to prove that &#39;shills&#39; are simply skeptics like yourselves, and to question your methods of coming to a conclusion) is unfounded unquestioned because it supports the narrative and part of a collective conjecture. You always seem to come to a conclusion then look for evidence and I think that&#39;s a big mistake.</p>

<p>So I question people. Sometimes I&#39;m genuinely looking for more information, other times I&#39;m a little more provocative, but it&#39;s always myself simply curious for some reason or another (I love people and psychology is an armchair interest of mine). I&#39;d imagine most of the other &#39;shills&#39; are the same.</p>

<p>You can be critical of the government, question whether the system is flawed or not, believe those in power have their own interests as a priority, but that doesn&#39;t mean you have to be sure that they&#39;re the source of every problem. The biggest mistake of all you can make is labelling anyone who disagrees with you/ opposing your views as a &#39;shill&#39; who&#39;s opinions are completely void: if you really see the truth you should take on all opinions especially if they differ from your own because that&#39;s how progress in made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BYCNTM is a very visible shill who does nothing but defuse discussion of government actions and who never takes the side of citizenry. He poses as a skeptic, but he has a visible mission and he&#39;s a shill. A skeptic is one thing, but a shill whose purpose is to always deny and defuse discussion is another, He is VERY active opposing any discussion that seeks truth about government actions. One has to ask, what is his main purpose in this?</p>

<p>He demands evidence, but gives false distorted evidence himself. His purpose is to wear people down and to make them look uninformed.</p>

<p>I note that he frequently insists that eyewitness testimony has no validity. His stance being &quot;Who are you going to trust, your own lying eyes, or the government story.&quot; He does this all the time. I note that the essence of the scientific method includes observation and testimony to the scientific community. But this means nothing to him; it&#39;s all invalid.</p>

<p>He seems to be supported by multiple partner voters to support his assertions and downgrade opponents. I get the feeling this is organizationally run.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The comprehensive plan laid out in 1992 at the Rio Earth Summit that 180 countries signed onto.  It entails bringing about a socialist world government from the bottom-up using non-profits and NGOs funded by government grants and big-money tax free foundations(such as Rockefeller, Carnegie, Ford) that go into local communities and change public policy via city planners and public policy.  Most of the initiatives are started by seemingly &#39;grassroots&quot; organizations that operate under the guise of public opinion but are actually part of a network of organizations that are working in tandem to create sweeping, worldwide change.

    <div class="md"><p>Well right now they are just setting up the infrastructure, they are still in the process of getting the NGO influence into the local governments in the US, in the third world countries they have begun to build so-called &quot;sustainable cities&quot; around mines and industrial centers that literally amount to serf cities, this is what they want to accomplish in the US as well.  They are meeting heavy resistance.   </p>

<p>Right now most cities have &quot;sustainability&quot; plans otherwise known as &quot;2020&quot; plans or &quot;comprehensive&quot; plans that are laying out the new infrastructure.  The plans are literally setting up poverty infrastructure, getting the country ready for abject poverty under the guise of &quot;livability&quot; or &quot;walkability&quot;, life without cars or cheap food.  </p>

<p>All of this is gradual.  The goal is to have everything built and implemented by 2050. It is a long term plan so that &quot;geniuses&quot; like you will have a hard time spotting it.  </p>

<p>The foundations have funded educational organizations to push the mindset into the university system, this is predictive programming.  &quot;sustainability&quot; courses are now almost universally required to graduate with a bachelors.  It is indoctrination in its purest sense. </p>

<p>Like I said, this is all documented at <a href="/r/UNAgenda21">/r/UNAgenda21</a>  everything is gradually happening, nothing is just going to pop out and happen, that is the point.  DO SOME ACTUAL RESEARCH YOU FUCKING MORON.</p>

<p>It seems very clear that there is one, or more entities operating to implement plans to basically subvert democracy and institute a society where control is with the elite. Government has been subverted from withiin and no longer truly is a servant of the people but its attempted master,  When some of us with perception try to point this out in social media, the shills come flooding in to dilute, defuse, mock.  We have to ignore them and do our job. People aren&#39;t stupid, but they have to have their attention brought to truths,  And that is why shills try to prevent that.</p>

Besides, to think that the government or other entity has paid shills that worry about what <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> thinks is one thing, but to think they&#39;d spend the time, energy, and money to have 40,000 of them (or enough people to manage that many accounts) is absolutely insane. </p>

<p>Personally, I think people in this sub just forget that some people like to argue and some like to troll, and the &quot;shills&quot; are really just skeptics and trolls. I&#39;m very distrusting of my government so I actually read this sub and believe in a few conspiracies, or at least parts of them, but I also consider myself to be a skeptic. As such, when I doubt things like the Sandy Hook/Aurora conspiracies due to a complete lack of evidence (notably the whole LIBOR connection bullshit), I get called a shill here all time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my observation, shills consistently are pro-government and pro-establishment, never pro-citizen, and 98% of their posts are solely in these areas.  Normal people would at least sometimes comment on normal items, but shills are visible by always focusing on their core topics. Almost as if they were assigned to the topics.  Also, they often post distorted or biased data (lies).  Plus, shills, as opposed to mere trolls, are often accompanied by vote machines that upvote them and downvote opponents quickly. By vote machine I mean either stes of linked/friended personas, or even software in some cases. At least one shill is very clearly active in this thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>have you read even 1 page of David Icke&#39;s about 20,000 pages published in his career? I didn&#39;t think so. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe &quot;reptile aliens from space&quot; (even though that&#39;s not even a correct assessment of his view point and more importantly that&#39;s only 5% of the information he has to offer), and I have doubts daily about every single thing I believe whether it&#39;s mainstream, conspiracy, or reality itself. I have a feeling a significant number of those here do and feel the same. Just because someone attempts to provide you with evidence contrary to your view point does not mean that they believe it. Just because someone posts something regarding the illuminati or false flags does not mean they are convinced of it. Just because you say or anyone else says &quot;aliens space lizards are bull shit&quot; and I link to you a 7 hour David Icke lecture (of which I have watched 2 of), or write you an essay on what his view point is, doesn&#39;t mean that I believe it to be irrefutable fact, it means that you&#39;re an ignorant fuck who says that something isn&#39;t true based on absolutely zero study of information and I&#39;m trying to fucking educate you.  It&#39;d be one thing if you read dozens of books regarding the matters and came to the conclusion that the premises are false, but for anyone to say that something is wrong, in regards to anything, when they have done little to no research is absolutely asinine and is the definition of everything wrong in our society today. </p>

<p>This subreddit, and the vast majority of the conspiracy community is based around entertaining ideas, questioning everything, and looking for the evidence. There is much contrasting evidence and it is up to us to make assessments on what is the most probable. We, as a community, are a think tank that operates outside of what is socially acceptable, we are not crazed lunatics who believe everything we read. In fact, I would say that, contrary to how &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; are portrayed, we are easily one of the most studious, rational, and open-minded community that I have ever known. Almost every work day for the last 6 months I have watched (more like listened to) at least one full documentary/lecture, and then I go home and watch another one or read for a few hours. For the past 2 years I&#39;ve watch documentaries, study, or read in most of my free time. Ranging from psychology, science, conspiracy, technology, religion, and everything in between. And I&#39;m sure a significant portion of this community does something similar. I&#39;m not trying to boast, I am simply trying to make a point. Conspiracy theorist&#39;s are seekers of truth and knowledge. If we come to enough credible information that everything we believe is false, then so be it (but so far, we have come to the exact opposite conclusion) It&#39;s not about feeling good or the way we want it to be, it&#39;s about the way it is regardless of our perception of it. </p>

<p>Edit:  Not sure why this is getting down voted. The only point I am trying to make is that I have done significant research into many conspiracies and still cannot come to a conclusion of their validity, and don&#39;t see how anyone who has done no research at all can legitimately say that they know for a fact that something is not true .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look man, I agree with you.</p>

<p>I do. </p>

<p>Facts and evidence should be based on a reasonable accumulation of fact, with no reason to believe otherwise.</p>

<p>Therefore, I don&#39;t even begin to lend credence to space lizards after hearing and reading about them for 1 hour tops.</p>

<p>Because, I agree with you completely!!! Facts and evidence fucking rock. I know that statistically speaking, and empirically speaking, (both) it is a total fucking waste of my time to drill down any further.</p>

<p>We are more likely to find Mermaids on Venus than Aliens traveling massive interstellar distances with unbelievably advanced technologies beyond all comprehension just so they can impersonate popular figures in order to make minimal control over a worthless hunk of carbon...</p>

<p>No really. We&#39;re not important. We aren&#39;t. And no one gives a shit about us... not god. Not aliens, not even our neighbors dude.</p>

<p>So Yes! I agree. Let&#39;s move on with realistic conspiracies. And let&#39;s embrace moving on from the white noise, and the crap that ruins the actual interest in that which matters... Actual, questionable conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If someone were to dedicate their time - as much as you have - to the study of say . . . heaven, dragons, volcanoes, migratory patterns, etc, does that make that subject a fact of reality?  It depends on whether or not that person is producing claims that have a place in our reality - claims derived from data that can be <em>repeatedly tested</em> and provide the same results .</p>

<p>I think it is a common attribute of people who subscribe to the theories that are the least supported, the least validated, and have no ties to or bearing on reality - that they consume data voraciously, but only from certain sources that provide that confirmation bias.</p>

<p>The mind of the theorist is an amazing thing.  He pores over data, consumes volumes, analyzes, runs the threads, and ties the story together in highly interesting ways.  However, unfortunately and frequently, those relationships are not supported by facts or empirical evidence.  They are intuitions which rise from issues of mistrust and other anxiety issues.  Sometimes the results are true and are supported by evidence.  And bravo to everyone for trying.  There is a need for questioning and discovering truths and lies.</p>

<p>But there is a need to distinguish between <em>truth-seeking</em> and <em>entertainment</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At what point did I say that anything I have studied is true? The point I am trying to make is that you can&#39;t say that they are false until you have actually studied them. Also unless you have done the research yourself into a significant number of &quot;conspiracies&quot;, you have no legitimate right to say &quot;those relationships are not supported by facts or empirical evidence&quot;. And to reiterate, most conspiracy theorists stay skeptical even in lieu of overwhelming evidence for our case. Our intention upon presentation of evidence is not to prove that we are right, it is simply to provide evidence, of which, the debater or arguer or whatever they may be, has, 99 times out of 100, never even heard. </p>

<p>Also your assertion that nothing we argue or believe is backed by &quot;evidence&quot;, what do you have to say about MK-Ultra, Watergate, Operation Northwoods, The Iran Contra Affair, CIA drug running, that the Gulf of Tonkin never happened, the Bohemian grove, or the dozens of other &quot;theories&quot; that turned out to be reported on by the MSM or was declassified, and are accepted as &quot;facts&quot; in today&#39;s world just completely forget about? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love when people scream paranoia here, when a former military President of The United States (Dwight Eisenhower) addressed his nation and told them that:</p>

<p>&quot;In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.&quot;</p>

<p>I guess he must have been a paranoid pot smoking parent&#39;s basement dweller as well.</p>

<p>I mean, isn&#39;t this just automated forum-sliding? Why, pray tell, do the mods on this sr even allow this to occur? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. That&#39;s how I found this subreddit. I was linked to it in a main sub I think.</p>

<p>I too act as a skeptic so I may come off as a shill to some people.</p>

<p>I really just like to see what this sub has to offer and I think about these ideas. But before I accept anything, I will debate it. Only to see how strong or weak a stance is.</p>
