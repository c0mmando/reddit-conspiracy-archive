        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So in the Tesla movie thread some dude said something like &quot;it makes you wonder who is the greater genius, Tesla or those who managed to suppress his work,&quot; and I jokingly said that maybe he was a government shill put here to perpetuate the egoism that allows that kind of thing to happen in the first place and he deleted all of his comments from the thread within minutes. Maybe he was afraid of looking like an asshole but his comment had about ten upvotes so I&#39;m a little suspicious. I feel like the three best explanations are that he&#39;s either a bizzare troll deleting his comments to seem like a possible shill, he didn&#39;t want to seem like an asshole or he&#39;s an actual fucking shill. Either way I now believe there might actually be fucking shills here and all of you don&#39;t just need to loosen the tin foil a bit. Maybe I need to loosen the tin foil a bit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see you don&#39;t comment here a lot so your experience he may not have been like mine. I am not a racist I can tell you I fucking loathe the jackasses in that sub. They are run by the JIDF and exist to make people feel like shit. What I&#39;m saying is if you get caught by them posting in here? You will be labeled a nazi it doesn&#39;t matter your content they only want to be accusatory. If you read the whole thread you would see my best friend is Jewish but he is not a Zionist. Thats what these guys are. They are blood thirsty and laugh histerically and jokes about Rachel Corrie getting ran over by a bull dozer. I hope that puts things in perspective for you if not?

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I always say they&#39;re alot of Gov trolls here. One guy cited the sub-Reddit rules to me, that&#39;s suspicious. He probably was trying to get me banned. Not seeming like a paranoid idiot. But Looking at the the CNN comments which are &quot;moderated&quot; you see alot of hate and discrimination towards Muslims. Whats sad is it was in the Hindu gang rape murder. The comments were all steering towards Saudi-Arabia and 9/11. Somethings I don&#39;t see on the NYT, NBC or other major news sites. As a christian I know fanatics can be crazy but you don&#39;t generalize people based on the alleged actions of a few.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How long have you guys posted here? We understand that there are shill brigades that swoop through here all the time. Yesterday&#39;s excitement was like the 4th of July. You could get 30 downvotes in 15 minutes and that&#39;s if you make the agent your bitch too. 
They have a set style of argument if you know it you can destroy them. They will go after the weakest point. The last thing you do is get angry. The first thing they do is become the victim and squeal racism. You see they are 50/50 Jewish pseudo intellectuals from r/conspiratard.

Edit: see you didn&#39;t even see those little bastards just now swoop in and give me two dowvotes. It&#39;s like they have a bat phone. If someone types a key word a bell rings somewhere and the downvote brigade comes in. If I knew what word it was I would type it over and over again.</p>

When I first exposed the pancake thing ( with a ysk post) they denied it and spent weeks doing damage control now they revel in it saying its a joke to piss people off, jokes arn&#39;t meant to piss people off. It&#39;s an inside joke for them to laugh at , they are fucking sick</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whats that about Tesla being a government shill? If he was the Media wouldn&#39;t try to make people worship the Liar Edition, the thief Einstein and the heavily discredited Freud. Outta topic but it&#39;s like Assange. The media over exposes him because he never released anything we didn&#39;t know already and he never implicated Israel for anything. The Media doesn&#39;t put the spotlights on real whistle blowers.</p>
