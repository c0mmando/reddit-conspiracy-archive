       All paranoid thoughts of militarized towns and overly intense spying aside wouldn't a one world government be good? One group rules over us all and limits tensions rising amongst conflicting ideas. One group is really the best way to run an entire race, it is nearly impossible for the system to become as unbalanced as our world's separate governments and will provide the world with what they need. Yes, it can be abused but lets pretend for a moment we are run by real, altruistic, intelligent people. Wouldn't it actually be a nice thing and a chance for peace?

       The government can only exist if it has authority over our lives, which I find immoral.  So to answer your question....I don't know.  It does not matter though. I want to live in a free society, void of those who have authority over our lives, whether or not we consent.

       I am skeptical of that statement.  We've been led to believe this notion, but I do not think it is true, especially given the source of that information, (government, public schools, the police).  I understand people do commit murder, theft, and agression, but not at all to the level of the government.  It was once thought that in the US, if the slaves were freed, chaos would ensue and there would be nobody to pick the crops.  As we know, that did not happen.  I cannot help but sympathize with your statement, but I have to disagree.

       If all associations, in their default state, were voluntary, I think the perceived necessity of government would vanish, thus leaving us nothing to which to opt out.  Or we could all go stark raving mad, riding around in hot rods in the dessert with mohawked bikers wearing assless chaps.

       Well, first of all, realize that there are many religions that don't have a "heaven" paradigm.  This is a typical western perspective, and for anyone to equate Christianity with "religion" constitutes the height of ignorance.  I hope you're not doing that, but, alas, I have a feeling that you - like most redditors - might very well
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       be meaning "Christianity" when you say "religion".  This is a typical, but particularly egregious error, as some religions have nothing to do with the things Christianity has to do with.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, however, I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       agree that the ground up corpses of many who AREN'T willing to change their ignorant ways
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       indeed make mighty fine bio-fuel.  That would definitely be one benefit of grounding up those unwilling to stop thinking ignorantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I mean to say is that, while I certainly don't think that
       <em>
        EVERY
       </em>
       religious person is an ignorant, close-minded idiot, I do think that many are, and I'm not unwilling to ground those fuckers up either.  This is a slippery slope, however, as there many, MAAAANY people who
       <em>
        aren't
       </em>
       religious yet who are
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       as if not MORE ignorant and belligerent than the most devote religious bigot type.  Heck, just go by r/atheism.  You will ABSOLUTELY find just as much ignorant, unthinking, uncritical, very aggressive dogma there as you would in the most baptist church anywhere.  Those types of people should be ground up and used as bio-fuel too.

       If you use the "ground up the stupid people into bio-fuel" rule effectively, unanimously, and across the board, I don't think I would disagree with this.  It would indeed seem like a win win situation.

       Well, we have no evidence that a Utopian society can exist, nor does it appear that humans as a whole even have the capability. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean it is merely fantasy. Ideas should be discussed, not stone-walled. What is wrong with treating this idea as a possibility, even if it is improbable? The majority of humans, in my experience, are basically alright people, but every person's ideas regarding 'Heaven on Earth' is different, and considering the countless varieties of beliefs and opinions that exist, a utopia might very well be impossible. Yet, it is a unique idea that we can, and should, offer our attention toward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even just achieving an essence of utopia is a direction in which we can aim ourselves towards as a species, and instantly be better for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need critical thinking taught from an early age. We need to personally accumulate knowledge, and learn to respect logical discourse, no matter the difference of opinion. Most of all we need empathy. We need to provide one another the facility to state our imaginations, our ideas, and our beliefs, without ridicule, and encourage debate, no matter the topic. We seem a long way off (though I don't really think so, the flow of information has changed the game somewhat), and it would be a significant moment in our history when we begin to seriously analyse and discuss forms of an existence that would most closely resemble a utopia, on a scale that shakes the foundations of our current paradigm. A better reality we can share, with the foresight to recognize only an essence of most ideas can be achieved, but aimed for all the same, because we owe it to our descendants, and to ourselves to act with the future in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I agree, a world government would not lead to anything beneficial, except to those with the power to manipulate it. In the end -- written within the tomes upon the death of our sun -- we will have long known that we never needed rulers, nor governance from a central authority. We do not need any authority over our own free will to act and practice a life that is pragmatic and ordered. We do not need administrative powers tangling our social fabric with false representation, nor corporate management of our shared resources, as we endeavour to pursue a prosperous life at the expense of no one. No one except those who wish to undo our struggles for peace, and replace it with exploitation and oppressive systems of power and property, greed and coercion. The internet provides us with the facility to be, as of one consciousness, the mind of The Earth, all striving for different ends, but with the means that respect this place we live in and all that exist in, and on it.

       The UN is pretty much as close you can get to a one world govt. 
The US revolution is a good start when looking at what happens when you're far removed from the governing power.  A world govt. would have to have individual governing bodies for each country and they would have to have absolute power within that country, and control over it's individual country specific laws. Without this kind of power, the global governing body would not be able to control each individual country and civil unrest would be much more wide spread than it is today.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this in mind, I think it's fair to say that we would probably never be able to have anything more than the UN without causing major issues in the world.

       realistically, it is not only a good thing, it is inevitable, short of humanity destroying itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       the problem is that currently, the people steering globalization are doing so for personal/family gain, rather than any altruism whatsoever. And being the ones in power, are unlikely to gain it anytime soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand the downvotes, but it is a decent question to ask. I think that a lot of anti-nwo people are in the right to oppose the current regime, but have not really thought about global culture in the long run...
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider that our languages are different due only to time (thousands upon thousands of years) separated by geography. That geography is now our ward, and we can move across it at ease. We will of course have to deal with generations of war and worse as the cultures unite, but it is the only path forward, as I said, other than destruction or mutual ongoing stalemate. But the latter is probably not likely due to the nature of information freedom in our era - the people in the third world don't like finding out they are being fucked.

      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Lord Edmond Rothschild of London and Jacob H. Schiff of New York City, two of the Elders of Zion, got Theodor Herzl (of Austria) to arrange for the World Zionist Congress at Basel, Switzerland; 197 delegates met there and laid out a plan of World Conquest with plans for a World Government. Herzl, founder of Zionism, in opening the meeting, raised his right hand and repeated an ancient oath of the Talmudists:
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its cunning." Herzl also said at this meeting: "We are one nation. We are neither American nor Russian Jews, but only Jews!" He also said: 'With a few exceptions that do not figure at all, the entire press of the world is in our hands."
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Dr. Mandelstam said on August 29 at the opening of the Zionist Congress of 1897: "The Jews will use all their influence and power to prevent the rise and prosperity of other nations and are resolved to adhere to their historic hopes; i.e., to the conquest of world power." LE TEMPS, Paris, September 3,1897.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Zionist Organization of America was organized in 1897 with Richard Gottheil of Columbia University as its first president, and Rabbi Stephen Wise as the first secretary. Branches for women (Hadassah), and children (Young Judea) were soon organized. ZIONIST NETWORK, p. 32.
        </p>

       There is much more documented about this.

       Oh yes, world government.  Great idea.  There is no "one group" on the planet.  There are billions of individuals.  That's the problem with people with collectivist mindsets like yourself, you fall for the group mentality.  The reason there is so much conflict is so that a world government can be formed,
       <em>
        think about it
       </em>
       , think about who is calling the shots and their ultimate goal.... how is that a good thing?  Answer: it isn't.  It's "unbalanced" because equality is a myth, everyone is equal in the fact that they are born and have sentient minds at birth, people are then either assimilated into the borg, or become free-thinking individuals.  The latter is the most rare.

       The only equal worlds I can think of where people exist peacefully are in stories. If you haven't read them check out "The giver" and I'm not positive on the second one's name but pretty much everyone has to wear something to handicap themselves to make themselves all equal.

       "Harrison Bergeron" and several other Vonnegut books feature the handicapped society where everyone is "equalized" by handicapping their strengths.

       A one world government could never lead to peace, in the same way that national governments have not led to an end to civil wars. Sadly, human nature dictates that the idyllic utopia you hypothesise can never exist.
