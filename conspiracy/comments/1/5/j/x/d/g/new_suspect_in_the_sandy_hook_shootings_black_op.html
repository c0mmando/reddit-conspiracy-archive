    <div class="md"><p>We need to sit back every now and then and look at the situation to see the big picture.</p>

<p>I sincerely think that this was a staged, false flag attack. I also think that the people that did it are <em>not</em> stupid. They may have covered their tracks EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY well. With that being said, we may just have to entertain the possibility that what we may find out in the next couple of weeks still isn&#39;t even the truth - because it was expected we would investigate this far - and that nearly everything so far is just a red herring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just listened to newly released police dispatch audio, and amended my report information on the other reported shooting accomplices driving in a purple van.</p>

<p>• On 14/12/12 11:09 AM Danbury Police reported over their scanners that they were on the lookout for a PURPLE or MAROON VAN in connection with the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Radio dispatch further relayed, &quot;Two occupants with possible ski masks that may be involved with this incident. Exit 8 heading down Stoney Hill towards the center&quot;. At 11:10 dispatch continued &quot;They may be involved with this incident. Also we are getting reports one of them maybe wearing a Nun outfit, heading towards Danbury, Stoney Hill, purple van — unknown plate. At 11:17 AM dispatch reported, &quot;People in the van had masks, one was dressed in what appears to be a nun&#39;s uniform… outfit&quot;. 11:17:29 AM: &quot;Is 1089 available to go on route 8 and make a post for this purple van?&quot; Unidentified police unit responded, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll continue to Griffin… once I get to Griffin we&#39;ll figure it out. 1089 will post for that vehicle.&quot; Dispatch responded, &quot;Alright roger that, I&#39;ll try and get more information on the van&quot;.</p>

<p>also who were the two guys running past the gym? </p>

<p>where&#39;s the cctv footage acknowledgement?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the evidence to connect this guy to the Sandy Hook shooting is the fact that the local news says that Marsh stole the gun on the 16, but surveillance camera footage says it was the 11th? And the gun he stole may or may not be an identical model to the one that was allegedly used in the shooting?</p>

<p>Is there any links to the facts that this blog states? Did the rifle used in the shooting come from this store? I thought it was Lanza&#39;s Mother&#39;s gun. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>My question is, Is it possible that this Windham .223 rifle was used in the school shootings? Only to be recovered, removed, and then taken back to Marsh&#39;s hotel room to be &quot;discovered&quot; and associated with another case altogether. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? Why do this? What possible motivation would there be to do something like this?</p>

<p>This is an interesting theory, but I&#39;d like to find out more facts. </p>
