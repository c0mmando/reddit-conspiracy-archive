       I don't think you guys understand the significance of this. You understand that Rothschild = Red Shield in Dutch right? I can agree with Sincerely about the bad satire, but I don't think thats the point. It looks like our "Ron" friend here is exposing an actual illuminati front. This is significant for me as I just requested that kind of info in another subreddit - then one of the replies directed me to this subreddit and this thread is here. Mind = Blown.

       Usenet's dead now compared to the early to mid 00's, resubbed a few months ago for a month and all my old fave alt.bin dvd/game/music groups were just spam catchers.    Think giganews charged this guy a clean up fee for his cross posted cp?

       Which god?  You're using 16th century goetic definitions.  Basically Eliphas Levi and later Crowley inspired creedo and term meanings.  Ba'al is WAAAY older historically than you're using him(and was not so much evil),
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_%28demon%29">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_%28demon%29
       </a>
       and your definition of Vehuiah is from semi modern Kabbalistic practice after the popularization of goetic riuals (17th cen). (what you're espousing)   Everything you just postulated is almost modern occult.  Some is even post illuminati.  Ritual (satanic) sexual themes also weren't added (injected into public paranoia) until about the 20th (19th) century and are of christian design and propagation.  Remember historically sex was viewed very differently.  I'm not saying it didn't happen i'm saying I was an honor in the OLD PRE CHRISTIAN pagan cultures to be sacrificed and so sexual torture was kinda pointless.  Not terrible satire but you could have gone older.  It would have been scarier.  Not to mention I drive by that spot on Ben white all the time. This was posted on the 22 of January (twitter) which is pppllllleeeeennnnntyy of time for your "supernatural" gov'ners to "destroy" you.  Its already been up on prison planet (which automatically kills it for me) and beastiality is a bit of a christian construction as well.  (see the Greeks)  God I love history!  If anyone knows any better please feel free to chime in or correct me!

       I don't know if this MonadMan actually wrote it, my honest guess is no due to his hard on for the FBI. I don't see your connection to him from his comment history. But, going on your theory check out what I found:
1) His first name is Zach and he has a wife named Tamarah:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       2) His last name is Smith:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/17u3th/will_smith_hungry_on_this_fine_cake_day/c88zewr">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/17u3th/will_smith_hungry_on_this_fine_cake_day/c88zewr
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So "Zach Smith" is MonadMan's name. I googled around and get this:
Zach Smith WORKS AT GIGANEWS:

       OK now YOU just posted that twice and you've only been a redditor for a few hours.  Are you spreading information or are you monadman?  Did I just step off into the twilight zone?
*Haha those posts are like an hour old!  Good troll monadman!

       I saw your
       <a href="/r/rothschild">
        /r/rothschild
       </a>
       post and researched it myself before adding to it on both subreddits. Are you MonadMan?? If not, the fact that you uncovered a redditor that works at the operation is quite significant on its own, good job. If TheBloodening = MonadMan then you're just wasting our time.

       Dude I all I have to do is post your time stamps, when you showed up, your past comments and the messages I've received in my inbox and against the other guy and it seems pretty obvious.  Just saying.  I'm not monadman.  A look at my past account will make that clear I believe.

       I just posted a request for information on an actual illuminati corporation in

       - Wow! what an awesome coincidence. Interesting.

       My take is its real information, but satire - is this the case? It wouldn't surprise me if demons are actually what powers Evil Incorporated.

       BTW, Ron's original post here was removed, but it looks like he reposted it on Usenet. Its readable here:
