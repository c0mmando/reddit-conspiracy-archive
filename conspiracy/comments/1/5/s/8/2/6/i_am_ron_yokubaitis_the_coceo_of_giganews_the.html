<p>Our invisibility comes from our third Co-CEO whom is our god, the 1st demon named Baal whom we worship and greatly revere. I made pacts with my god in my earlier years where I depended on his ability to hide my subrosa activities. I paid with my soul, but was the transaction not worth a great deal to you? Baal handles our newsgroups, recruitment, planning, content, customers, support, billing, servers, software, management, and marketing at our offices in Austin, Texas. Visit us anytime at 1044 Liberty Park Drive, or at the Texas 1 data center at 4100 Smith School Rd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which god?  You&#39;re using 16th century goetic definitions.  Basically Eliphas Levi and later Crowley inspired creedo and term meanings.  Ba&#39;al is WAAAY older historically than you&#39;re using him(and was not so much evil), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_%28demon%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_%28demon%29</a> and your definition of Vehuiah is from semi modern Kabbalistic practice after the popularization of goetic riuals (17th cen). (what you&#39;re espousing)   Everything you just postulated is almost modern occult.  Some is even post illuminati.  Ritual (satanic) sexual themes also weren&#39;t added (injected into public paranoia) until about the 20th (19th) century and are of christian design and propagation.  Remember historically sex was viewed very differently.  I&#39;m not saying it didn&#39;t happen i&#39;m saying I was an honor in the OLD PRE CHRISTIAN pagan cultures to be sacrificed and so sexual torture was kinda pointless.  Not terrible satire but you could have gone older.  It would have been scarier.  Not to mention I drive by that spot on Ben white all the time. This was posted on the 22 of January (twitter) which is pppllllleeeeennnnntyy of time for your &quot;supernatural&quot; gov&#39;ners to &quot;destroy&quot; you.  Its already been up on prison planet (which automatically kills it for me) and beastiality is a bit of a christian construction as well.  (see the Greeks)  God I love history!  If anyone knows any better please feel free to chime in or correct me!
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lesser_Key_of_Solomon">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lesser_Key_of_Solomon</a> believe the key to understanding this guys ramblings.  Not terrible research on his part.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if this MonadMan actually wrote it, my honest guess is no due to his hard on for the FBI. I don&#39;t see your connection to him from his comment history. But, going on your theory check out what I found:
1) His first name is Zach and he has a wife named Tamarah: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17t64h/what_is_the_most_insignificant_amount_of_power/c88yz94">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17t64h/what_is_the_most_insignificant_amount_of_power/c88yz94</a></p>

<p>2) His last name is Smith: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/17u3th/will_smith_hungry_on_this_fine_cake_day/c88zewr">http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/17u3th/will_smith_hungry_on_this_fine_cake_day/c88zewr</a></p>

<p>So &quot;Zach Smith&quot; is MonadMan&#39;s name. I googled around and get this:
Zach Smith WORKS AT GIGANEWS:
