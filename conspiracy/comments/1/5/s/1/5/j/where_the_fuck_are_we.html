        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>as I sit here I struggle to understand where we are as a society. on one hand, the false consumerism has brainwashed me into believing that &#39;we&#39;ve never had it better,&#39; and on the other that this standard of living rests on the backs of what are essentially slave laborers in the colonies and tentacles of modern capitalism. is cronyism <em>really</em> capitalism though?</p>

<p>I feel the pain of all those suffering under the boot of our collective prison, and can&#39;t help but think that this is just the way things are, and that human nature dictates that this is the best we can come up with. as we entered the new year last night, I caught myself wondering why the word happy gets thrown (under the bus) in front of it. is it happy because we get some new shiny toys to distract us from the existential crisis I&#39;m positive we all face day in and day out? is it happy because as a culture we have to lull ourselves into submission and take what scraps we can get/are given? or is it &#39;happy&#39; because that is what the propaganda machine has told us to be..</p>

<p>sitting idly waiting for doom makes me feel like an outcast in a world that revolves around the carousel of happy feelings. depressed? prozac. anxious? take some xanax. it&#39;s the constant avoidance and distraction of reality that has been our downfall, and on the slope down I can&#39;t help but wonder what all these people are going to do when shit really goes down.</p>

<p>and there I reach another conflict: when is shit really going to go down? is it when confidence is lost in the dollar? is it when there isn&#39;t enough food or oil to meet demand, and things shift out of necessity rather than the implosion I feel in my soul to be inevitable? shouldn&#39;t more people have noticed by now that the house of cards on which we sit is certainly going to fold? and then I&#39;m reminded of how blind and ignorant people en masse truly are. the blatant racism, the classism, the fear of the unknown.</p>

<p>I feel mentally prepared, but so unsure of anything anymore. I try to keep in mind that what can be attributed to stupidity doesn&#39;t necessitate malice (Hanlon&#39;s Razor, for those interested), but with these earth shattering scandals breaking and receiving absolutely nothing in terms of media coverage (LIBOR to name one, though here I don&#39;t really feel I need to go into the details since I am among friends) can it really just be stupidity anymore?</p>

<p>I refuse to just accept that this is just the way shit is, and that the illusions we keep ourselves in are there for our own good. I guess in time we will see. thanks for reading my thoughts, if you got this far.</p>

<p>unfortunately, i believe the answers to these questions are all &#39;yes.&#39;  there is otherwise very little to be happy about as an american.  on a personal and spiritual front, sound morals, self-respect and respect and empathy for others are going out the window.  our families are falling apart due to substance abuse, infidelity and lazy parenting.  </p>

<p>on a financial front, the cost of pursuing a real dream as a business owner are astronomical with health care costs essentially forcing many intelligent people into wage slavery with benefits, and those who do work for wages find their hard work being taxed at every corner.  shit, you can&#39;t even sit still for 5 minutes in this bitch without having to pay someone for the right to exist!  i mean, why the fuck should i have to pay the city to own my own car or house if it&#39;s &quot;mine.&quot;  </p>

<p>we can&#39;t be happy here because the boot is on our skull.  the american dream = the biggest ponzi scheme of all time.  from municipality to state to feds to the central bank that&#39;s been draining the equity and wealth out of our fine land from its very inception.  it&#39;s hard to be happy in circumstances like these unless you ignore the harsh reality of life in america.</p>

<p>People have been saying the exact same thing for the past two hundred years.  I can make a good argument for America being at it&#39;s &quot;moral&quot; high point right now.  </p>

<p>I agree with you that property taxes on your primary residence are bullshit, but do you really not understand why you pay a car tax?  Would you rather pay a toll at every other corner?</p>
