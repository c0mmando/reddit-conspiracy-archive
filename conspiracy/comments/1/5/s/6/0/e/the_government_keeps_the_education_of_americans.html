    <div class="md"><p>Yeb that&#39;s one of the things I stressed out. Like all the teachings of the Holocaust bullshit. WTF there are other important things in history besides the death of alleged 6 million. Sorry but it was a waste of time. Everywhere you go there are things that remind you of the holocaust. The media and Hollywood are the biggest source. They&#39;re trying to engrave it your mind. All the Hitler shit so you sympathize with the culprits or so. They&#39;re obsessed with that man. Showing him as  the greatest evil. Look around everyone keeps using him and the Nazis as examples of evil even though there are worse people. We got to wake up people and stop eating what those global elites feed the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny, I thought about this the other day.  One prime example is American history; we are taught so many lies in the textbooks, i.e., Columbus being a hero, the Mayans being extinct, and we are taught to think so highly of our country/government so that we are to never question it.  This frightening trend in conjunction with the ever-increasing militarization of police around the country causes a great feeling of apprehension.  It is quite obvious what path we are headed on, everyone will either be too apathetic, too stupid, or too involved in their own lives to do anything to stop it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Social Studies Education Major preparing to student teach in a few weeks. I have been bothered by the way the state of Ohio continues to water down it&#39;s education standards for history, government and geography. I&#39;ll make a few bullet points to voice my main concerns:</p>

<p>1) Standardized testing creates a situation where an impossible range of information must be taught. Subjects cannot be delved into in depth, and what suffers most is the ability to teach students valuable CRITICAL THINKING and reflective inquiry skills needed to draw their own conclusions from data.</p>

<p>2) &#39;Applicable history&#39; (I consider WWI and onward to be the most important periods to study in order to understand or current political world) is often sacrificed to teach the explorers (falsely), a broad brush picture of colonialism and our revolutionary war and civil war. </p>

<p>3) Students graduate thinking America is a &#39;perfect&#39; country, when in fact there is much to improve on. </p>

<p>4) Students do not learn about the current political situation. In my own lesson planning, it is impossible to connect events such as media portrayal of communists in the Cold War to media portrayal of terrorists now simply because there isn&#39;t enough time to fit a lesson like that into my packed schedule. </p>

<p>5) My 2 history textbooks are both over 1,000 pages long and extremely heavy. How fun can it be to learn out of a tome like that.  For their length, they contain a shockingly sparse range of information on historical topics, offering only one viewpoint (the &#39;murica viewpoint as I like to call it)</p>

<p>I encourage students to use the miracle tool that is the internet to learn information on their own if they feel that class time cannot teach them. I say wikipedia away! </p>

<p>Note: To those who blame teachers for educational problems... go fuck yourself. It&#39;s war in the trenches every bell right now to try to get these kids to walk away with any valuable body of knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A very interesting perspective.  However, I must say I disagree with you about blaming teachers.  Of course I am not saying all teachers are bad (you seem like you&#39;re a good teacher), but there are bad teachers, as well as bad students.  Unfortunately in today&#39;s day and age, many kids no longer value education, I am somewhat guilty of this, since I really did not care much for learning in school growing up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many poor quality workers in every profession. I am by no means trying to say poor preforming teachers shouldn&#39;t be called out... they should. Many older teachers simply have out of date training, especially when it comes to technology and classroom management (Ex: I laugh at the time tested method of seating students alphabetically).</p>

<p>Rather than blaming the bad eggs who will be there anyways, we should focus on more broad brush problems of education such as the fundamental problem of property tax inequality, mandated curriculums and archaic tenure laws.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Up until age 18, Children are raised up in a society where their rights do not apply; School. Students are taught, that the teacher, or higher power, are always right. Growing up in younger years, it feels normal to obey commands from your teacher, but as you age, you grow used to this idea of &quot;Submitting to authority.&quot; Once you graduate, students will believe anything a higher power teaches them. Police officers and Government Officials gain this creditably and power through the micro environment that we call School. Schools can search, sieze, and detain whoever and whatever they want if it is on school grounds. The only place we are forced to go in our lives is school. We grow up in a society without rights, to make us submit to authority after we graduate.</p>

<p>tldr: School is a way for students to be raised in a society without rights, Dictated by Teachers, and will submit to authority with ease. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will tell you a secret: the government never wanted to educate Americans. For all intellectual needs, they would invite Europeans or other foreigns. In your moon example, perhaps you should be informed that the scientist responsible for the propulsion system was not American, but a Nazi German scientist, Wernher von Braun. The American planes were developed by Jews running away from Nazism, like Blasius. The American ironclads were engineered by french. And this still happens today: watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK0Y9j_CGgM">video</a> from a reputable theoretical physicist (btw Japanese) about the educational system in USA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that, it was called Operation Paperclip. But my point was to illustrate that USA is dependent on foreign nationals for its technological supremacy. Jews, Nazi, Japanese, Indians, doesn&#39;t matter. The &quot;true&quot; Americans, the Irish, puritan British, the colonialists, those are not the responsible for the technological advancement. They are used as soldiers and consumers, that is their role on the societal pyramid. The very few rich ones are the policy makers. The actual individuals responsible for the super duper American technological supremacy (and as consequence, economical and political), so much bragged by rednecks, are the foreign nationals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what happens when you leave basic education with private entities without adequate regulation, or you have dumbed down schools that do not stimulate critical thinking. What I find ironic are the British white supremacists complaining about inferior races plaguing their country. I guess they never went to Cambridge or Oxford, and witnessed the inferior races doing all the thinking that the white supremacists are incapable of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the initial assertion by the OP is a little over the top but you can&#39;t deny the all encompassing guidelines laid down by the Department of Education that permeates all levels of US public education.  In addition, any modern statistic will show that US education has declined in comparison to other nations over the past couple of decades.  Do I think the government is purposefully counter-educating? I don&#39;t have the evidence to conclude that one way or the other.  Do I think the government controls the content that is used in the public school system?  Absolutely.</p>

Read Savage Inequalities for a better understanding of this,  Kozlov (I think that&#39;s the author) does a better job at explaining the environmental factors than I could do </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is wikipedias global education rankings. Cuba sits ahead of us. I would also bet that the current unemployment problem in the u.s. is not just a result of the economy, but a result of our poor education system. I am a welder and I work in manufacturing, and we have trouble finding good employees. Many of our hires either have no education or experience, or they cant pass a piss test. We hire ten to fifteen new people a year and maybe one or two of those guys last more than three months.</p>

<p>Critical thinking used to be a subject taught up until decades ago (I have sourced this in a previous post), along with trivium, quadrivium methodologies, but this armed people with skills to analyze and call out false information - very dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you&#39;re saying OP, but I think the complexity of influence is going to be more wide ranging than just education.  For example, parental influence, not just in connection with education, but through means of provision.  I also would make note that popular culture in America, if anything is to be blamed, has a much more consequential affect on kids and there eagerness to learn than does the content they are given in schools.</p>

<p>The children now love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise. Children are now tyrants, not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers.</p>

<p>Just to be pedantic, it was actually from a play by Aristophanes which satirized Socrates.</p>
