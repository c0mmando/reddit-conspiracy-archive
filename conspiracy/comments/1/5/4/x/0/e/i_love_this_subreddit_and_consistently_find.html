To say all men are created equal is, at it&#39;s core, true because important contributions to our society can and have come from all walks of life but certain restrictions are important, no?  Just as a corporation cannot and should not have the same rights as an individual human being, so too should weapons whose sole purpose is to kill people as efficiently as possible be kept out of the hands of those not equipped (be it physically or mentally) to use them.</p>

I&#39;m all for the second ammendment and I hope that I haven&#39;t led you to believe otherwise.  What concerns me is that these severly dangerous weapons fall all too easily into untrained hands.  As I&#39;ve said in to another poster, I don&#39;t want weapons to be impossible to acquire just very difficult to so to ensure as much as possible that people who have these weapons know how to use them.</p>

<p>Such power has not been &quot;granted&quot;. The <strong>right</strong> was recognized as an inalienable human right and the 2nd amendment simply forbade the government from interfering with that right. I do agree that anyone in possession of any arms should take the responsibility themselves to be well-trained and to keep their arms out of the hands of those that aren&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Certainly you don&#39;t advocate the availability to arm civilians with a nuclear arsenal.</p>

<p>I advocate for the people to have any arms necessary to be able to throw off a tyrannical government. The &quot;nukes&quot; argument comes up frequently but I think it&#39;s ludicrous. How could the people possibly throw off a tyrannical government through the use of nuclear weapons without destroying a large portion of the general population in the process?</p>

The <strong>only</strong> thing that matters is that the US constitution created the US government and placed limitations on that government.

    <div class="md"><p>That is where I have to strongly disagree with you.  Do you drive? Did you go to public school?  Ever been inside a library?  The government is not the enemy.  It is up to us, the people, to keep our government in check but it&#39;s a mistake to look at all authority as an absolute evil.  Civilization is a pretty cool thing and if you like your computer, home, clothes, assuming you didn&#39;t manufacture all those things yourself some kind of government is helping you out and it&#39;s in your best interest to approach it with more than just outright contempt.  Don&#39;t believe everything they tell you, absolutely, but just as importantly don&#39;t just assume every single thing they do is out of some malicious addiction to control of the masses.</p>

Shall we talk about how the government refuses to hold LEOs accountable when they kill innocent people? How about Waco, Kent State, Ruby Ridge etc? SWAT teams at the wrong address? What about the US government invasions of sovereign countries and the millions of dead civilians? How about the nuclear bombing of civilian populations in Nagasaki and Hiroshima? Maybe the US&#39;s part in the Dresden holocaust? Shall we talk about the economy? How about government refusing to hold banksters accountable for their frauds and illegal foreclosures resulting in uncountable homeless people? Maybe the government passing off the power to print money to a privately held bank so they could deflate the value of currency by 95% over the past 100 years resulting in the continuous lowering of the standard of living? ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fucking with people&#39;s money is very different than fucking with a human life let alone many.  I imagine that it probably isn&#39;t very hard to acquire the ingredients needed to build a weapon capable of killing scores among scores of innocent people but I also imagine making it well is considerably more difficult. Buying a gun and shooting someone with it is very easy. Much easier than it should be.  By no means am I saying that owning a gun should be impossible. I simply believe that a gun is as lethal as any weapon because it is designed to kill with efficiency.  It doesn&#39;t take much skill to operate a gun, I know, I&#39;ve shot one before.  We should make sure that people know how to use them but for gods&#39; sakes is there any reason why anyone, a cop, a soldier, a civilian, a teacher, should be made capable of killing anyone let alone as many people as you can kill with an automatic weapon?</p>

<p>Our approach to guns should be no different than our approach to bombs.  What is a scenario that you would require the use of certain weaponry?  They do exist.  Do they exist often enough to require their mass production?  How is that mass production funded?  Is it possible to cut that funding so less weapons are available to fall into the hands of African warlords and Mexican drug cartels?  The CIA sells weapons but do they make them?  Where?  How?  Create a strictly regulated market for it.  Should people, all people, be allowed weapons to defend themselves?  Absolutely.  It&#39;s a fact of our nature that we tend to like them, but we are not taught how to use them and to use them properly.  A kid shouldn&#39;t learn how to shoot a machine gun practicing alone in a ditch.  He should be able to do it at a gun range when supervised by someone with knowledge of and experience with the weapon.</p>

<p>I believe society is very cavalier towards guns.  They are different than bats, knives, swords, arrows, etc.  They deserve to be taken seriously and I don&#39;t believe they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they messed with everyone&#39;s money and made a personal profit off of it...then had the government give them more money...that&#39;s messing with human life in my opinion.</p>

<p>ieds don&#39;t appear to be that difficult at all to make and how many people do they maim everyday?</p>

<p>it&#39;s not difficult to shoot a weapon...it is difficult to shoot accurately (source: i&#39;ve been shooting my entire life)</p>

<p>people are afraid of automatic weapons for some reason (when was the last automatic weapon used in a mass shooting btw?) and the truth is that accuracy goes out the window for a commoner shooting an automatic weapon. not to mention ammo is eaten up like crazy when on auto. ALSO ar15s are semi-automatic, not automatic. can you make them automatic? yes but you can also ruin a weapon tweaking with something like that.</p>

<p>an oppressive government is enough reason to allow citizens to keep their weapons. if you think the CIA operates under normal laws you need to do some research...the sell weapons all over the globe and fund uprisings. </p>

<p>i&#39;ve been taught how to properly use a weapon and i agree that it should be more well known.</p>

<p>again with the fear of machine guns, a kid is going to have horrible accuracy if he learns how to shoot one in a ditch. and where do you find a source saying that anyone learned to shoot a machine gun (fully automatic not semi-automatic) in a ditch?</p>

<p>you can&#39;t find many shooting ranges that allow you to even double tap a pistol, let alone allow you to fire a machine gun.</p>

<p>firearms are taken seriously. CT was the 5th strictest state on gun control in the US...how did that stop anything?</p>

<p>a deep seeded fear of our neighbors that makes us more likely to lash out</p>
</blockquote>

<p>what in the world does this even mean?</p>

<p>i believe it is sweden where every man is required to serve in the military and to also keep their issued rifles after their service and they have very little crime as a result. if a criminal has any fear his victim may have a weapon, they won&#39;t attack them, especially if the victim is trained on their weapon.</p>

<p>as another point, we as a country have been very lucky that there has not been an invasion on our soil. the issue with gun restrictions is that it would leave our nation&#39;s citizens defenseless if we were invaded. that and the possibility of a tyrannical government are reasons enough for me to encourage weapon education and freedom.</p>

<p>The only places that we ever hear about mass shootings taking place are in &quot;gun-free zones&quot;.</p>

<p>We also never hear about how <a href="http://www.ssristories.com/index.php">school shootings are associated with SSRIs</a>. Personally, I feel this is a much more important issue than guns.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/militia">Source</a></p>

<p>It is kinda hard to be ready for military service with just a 22. </p>

<p>I think no citizen should have an RPG but to have a gun with a high capacity magazine shouldn&#39;t be a big deal. I personally would be more worried about someone with a high powered elk rifle then someone with an AR-15. With an AR-15 they will more likely just spray until someone takes them down or they shoot them self. With a long range rifle they would have more time to react to problems since they have a lot of distance. </p>

<p>Side note, you could walk down to any garden store and buy fertilizer to use in a car bomb. No ID or anything, what&#39;s stopping someone from doing that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the second amendment was created to protect against tyranny, not for hunting or home invasion protection. In my opinion (as someone who&#39;s grown up in Texas with a father who was in the Marines before the first Gulf war and been around weapons my entire life) there is no rational behind gun control as far as safety for the general public. The politicians calling for stricter gun laws have nothing to fear because believe me they will be well protected during any civil unrest. </p>

<p>quoting my dad from earlier: &quot;of course they don&#39;t want anyone else to have a gun, i&#39;d love a law that said i was the only one to be armed too&quot; </p>

<p>the protection of the people against an oppressive government lies in its ability to arm itself against major infringements on liberties. </p>

<p>the other issue lies in the fact that bad people are going to do bad things, regardless of the law. every school zone is an anti-gun zone...when has that ever stopped a school shooter? all it does, to quote a fellow redditor&#39;s comment from the other day, is funnel children into areas where they cannot be protected against bad people. </p>

<p>as a conspiracy theorist, i would rather question my government&#39;s intentions in confiscating weapons to &quot;protect&quot; the populous before i mindlessly agreed that it is in my personal best interest to allow only the government to control weapons to whomever it saw fit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. So lets say to buy a gun you have to go through a psych test and a background check and wait a month. What stops people from stealing the gun like what just happened in atleast one of the shootings? All you would do is annoy law abiding citizens and give them more to bitch about. Instead of trying to take the tool away why not figure out why they wanted to kill people? Where they foreclosed on and lost their job as well? Are they on a SSRI which makes people more violent? People will find away to do something if they REALLY want to. Why not try and stop what ever is making them have the urge to hurt innocent people?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see your argument and agree that above all else, mental health should be made a much higher priority than it is in our society.  However, I think that an interesting comparison can be made between the Sandy Hook shootings and the slasher in China.  Say the shooter (assuming it was one shooter) came in armed but less so.  It&#39;s safe to assume the outcome wouldn&#39;t include that kind of body count.  I think that bad, or rather, sick people can be found almost everywhere but I&#39;d feel safer if serious fire power was harder to come by.</p>

If we lower the speed limit by say 5 to 10 MPH that would say way more lives then gun regulations but no one ever talks about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just speaking of living on the biological level, I can&#39;t see any way around it. As for the emotional aspects of our lives, which are often both complex and simple at the same time; yes, I think it defines how we relate to the universe that surrounds us. The relationships are economic in nature. Consider even life on a cellular level, consider the process of energy transfer and how matter is rearranged on a constant basis.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also why we value life so highly and hold it dear but unfortunately it is also why some spend the lives of others, and occasionally their own, like one would a currency.</p>

It&#39;s gotten to the point where it&#39;s hard to find something to take pride in in america.  The best form of gun control, in my opinion, aside from required self defense courses put on the same level as something like driver&#39;s ed, is to shatter this notion of how afraid we need to be and what we need in order to be safe.  Supply and demand, as a concept, is not an intrinsically bad thing, what makes it bad is when it&#39;s exploited for the economic and social betterment of those already in power.  The balance of our world is being thrown off and we must fix it by demanding the supply of less fear in our hearts, minds, and perhaps most importantly, in what we see and what we read.</p>

I wish we could get past the walls, that the &quot;powers that be&quot; separate us with.  But, until then... I&#39;d like to hang on to my guns.  Just in case there&#39;s another, sorry &quot;nut job&quot; out there who can&#39;t deal with any more bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I can appreciate your argument I feel it is a byproduct of the fear of our fellow man that we have been sold by the higher-ups.  &quot;Support the civilized man over the savage&quot;  &quot;Will we be next?&quot; or my personal favorite, being a New Yorker, &quot;Don&#39;t assume it was left by accident.&quot;  Weapons that serve no purpose but to kill and to kill human beings, not animals, should be very difficult to acquire, in my opinion.  Not impossible but difficult.  Look at our European brothers who while armed don&#39;t act out in nearly the same ways as we wonderful Americans.  I am of the opinion that this ideal world you speak of is much closer to the lie we&#39;ve been sold to keep us afraid.</p>

<p>This means the banning of semi-automatic firearms will be legally possible, if politically very difficult, so long as people are still allowed to own a firearm of some sort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think anyone I know of supports irresponsible and unsafe gun owners. If you take a look at the &quot;gun culture&quot; there is and always has been a high degree of emphasis placed on safety and proper use.</p>

<p>Having grown up in rural Kentucky and later Northern Florida, and gone hunting with friends and their parents when I was in my early teens; it was all handled very responsibly.</p>

<p>The idea of focusing on <em>just</em> the well regulated militia part is referenced in this Penn &amp; Teller video:</p>

<p>Regulations are problematic enough because they pretend that an outside party has a better idea than the primary actors in a particular human action. The conceit is that humans are flawed but the regulatory bodies are somehow pure of human failings.</p>

<p>Prohibition extends far beyond slippery slope regulations into an area that requires curtailing basic human rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why I would be okay with law enforcement or military being allowed to own and operate something like an AR-15 is that we should be able to safely assume that a person inn that position has had extensive training with that weapon and not just had it handed to them and told to have fun.  I&#39;m not calling for these weapons to be impossible to acquire, just very difficult to acquire so as to ensure as much as possible that the people who have them know how to use them.</p>

<p>the second amendment is not to allow us to have guns for hunting, or recreation, as some argue, or even for home invasion defense. but for a trained and coherent population to be able to defend themselves against a government that has turned against them. i do advocate for this ability, absolutely, but it comes with massive responsibility. it&#39;s this responsibility to me that needs to be discussed and developed. part of that responsibility includes taking all precautions to avoid having weapons fall into the wrong hands. we can only look to fast and furious to see that this is something even law enforcement fails to adequately support, despite their public opinions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, and ultimately, it is fundamental to consider that a socio-cultural reason is at the root of all of this. not one specific set of gun laws or another, or even one kind of gun or another. the event in china on the same day took place with a knife, something i regard as a sicker, more physically violent event than pulling a trigger. most incidents of domestic violence or aggravated assault occur with household objects, bats, ashtrays. </p>

<p>the natural limbic response of violence is something part of our deep history. the sheer lethality has increased, the argument can be made, by so-called assault weapons. but suppressing the number of tools available for such violence isn&#39;t going to help us reduce the effects violence has within our culture, and upon individuals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that restricting the availability of the most destructive tools does have an effect on the number of bodies buried because of these atrocities.  Of course one life lost is too many but cutting 12,000 in half? by a third? at all, while still tragic, must be considered an improvement of some kind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>then the argument should be if certain weapons are too dangerous for american citizens to have access to, they are probably equally dangerous for any civilian society to have. thus, general production of these weapons should cease. by doing so, perhaps civilian deaths in ongoing crises or military interventions would be cut in half, or a third. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t support greater regulatory establishment as an answer. it&#39;s a wasteful, bloated, and ineffective approach to a problem that philosophically begins with the production of these weapons, whatever the justification. and it does empower a margin; it&#39;s unavoidable.</p>

<p>with that said, i believe it is the responsibility of gun owners to be trained not only with the use of their guns, but with a comprehensive approach to ethics, including crisis management and the importance of stress management, the same type of stuff military training requires. i do not think this should be a federal program, but perhaps a mandate for the states of some nature.  and in such a climate, an effective deterrent for an unjust government demanded of citizens by the 2nd amendment could be effected, while a higher standard of training created. </p>

<p>but this approach would still leave illegitimate access to these weapons. any regulation will not prevent illegitimate access to anything. example = marijuana, drugs, &quot;copywritten material&quot;. </p>

<p>ultimately, how can i accept a government that deals in assault weapons as part of secretive foreign policy making a demand to effectively restrict them for americans? i just suspect their chosen solution when it arrives is going to be something less than effecting a more positive social environment.</p>

<p>i&#39;m pretty worried about our country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too am worried about our country, very worried.  You bring up a good point about the very manufacturing of the weapons brought into question but isn&#39;t that in and of itself a form of regulation?  What if our cops couldn&#39;t carry guns like in Britain?  Of course absolute prohibition never works for anything and our country has a deplorable history in terms of the sale and distribution of both weapons and drugs but my question is if careful steps are taken to truly end this problem, wouldn&#39;t stricter gun laws, for both the citizenry and the authorities, have to be a part of that?</p>

<p>an outright technological ban isn&#39;t the same thing as regulation of continued manufacture and trade of the item.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>that&#39;s just not the world i live in. i don&#39;t know about you. when ideal responsibilities are claimed to be undertaken by consistently corrupt officials, you can color me suspicious. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>wouldn&#39;t stricter gun laws</p>
</blockquote>

<p>no, i don&#39;t see this as truly, really viable. bureaucratic methodology is an american reactionary&#39;s easy solution. but the consequences of it are consistently far from ideal, and themselves later have to be dealt with, as in the case of Mexico. </p>

<p>*also, there is currently an assault weapon ban in Connecticut. no one seems to be talking about that. i rest my case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there truly were stricter gun laws, what happened in Mexico wouldn&#39;t be allowed to happen, would it?  I&#39;m calling for regulation across the board.  Of course I&#39;m not naive enough to think that something like that could happen over night but I do believe that we live in a society that is all too quick to support fear and violence and it must change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>guns were banned in mexico. the legislation removed weapons from the hands of civilians, as well as the ability to defend their families from the drug cartels, whose weapons are assault weapons of american provenience. bureaucratic methodology, legislation, always empowers a minority. in this case secretive american foreign policy was at fault as well. it is these exact types of factors the conversation in the mainstream omits of necessity. </p>

<p>i cringe when i hear people say that, &quot;calling for regulation across the board,&quot; no offense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. So lets say to buy a gun you have to go through a psych test and a background check and wait a month. What stops people from stealing the gun like what just happened in atleast one of the shootings? All you would do is annoy law abiding citizens and give them more to bitch about. Instead of trying to take the tool away why not figure out why they wanted to kill people? Where they foreclosed on and lost their job as well? Are they on a SSRI which makes people more violent? People will find away to do something if they REALLY want to. Why not try and stop what ever is making them have the urge to hurt innocent people?  </p>
