<p>If they did, that video is in the possession of the police. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with that either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Video of kid saying he saw someone in custody out front of the school on the ground. </p>

<p>There is a man mentioned in an article by the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-1215-newtown-school-shooting-20121215,0,973605.story">Los Angeles Times</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;Chris Manfredonia, whose 6-year-old daughter attends the school, was heading there Friday morning to help make gingerbread houses with first-graders when he heard popping sounds and smelled sulfur.</p>

<p>He ran around the school trying to reach his daughter and was <strong>briefly handcuffed by police</strong>. He later found his child, who had been locked in a small room with a teacher.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Video of someone being detained in the woods. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Audio of unusual police chatter. Have you even listened to the audio tapes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have.  Nothing there leads me to believe there was a second shooter.  </p>

<p>Do you really believe that the police talked about a second shooter on radio when they knew it could be recorded? Then they arrested the second gunman? Then they let him go?  What purpose would that have?</p>

<p>I have a business acquaintance whose wife is a K teacher in Newtown at the other elementary school (O&#39;Meadow) and she said there are still dozens of forensic experts and cops at Sandy Hook school going through everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but what gives you, or me for that matter, the right to view that videotape.   Unless either of us has expertise in forensics, releasing that video publically accomplishes nothing.</p>

<p>It took them years to release video footage from Columbine, and even then it was heavily edited.   As a parent of school age children, I would sue the crap out of the district if they released that video in any form.</p>

<p>As far as the media passing judgment, I don&#39;t agree.  While there are some opinion shows (O&#39;Reilly, Stewart, others) and a ton of blogs, the main media sources have mostly refrained from a ton of editorializing or sensationalizing.  </p>

<p>Do please explain then that if there&#39;s some covert clandestine operation at work here, why they hired such supposedly terrible actors.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hardly evidence. It&#39;s a small video clip taken pretty much out of context. Meanwhile, there&#39;s a giant mountain of evidence that all these people are real parents with real jobs and actual histories, who had real kids that went to a school in a real town. All of that actually exists.

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of things piss me off..unfortunately we are dealing with what I believe to be trolls on a daily basis. But it should be no reason to categorize people one way or another. So that we can agree on. But there&#39;s a lot of people who come in here and call people crazy. So my deal is I just try and stick to the issues and not attack people personally. Ill attack the issues ferociously but every once in a while I do break that code as I am still human.</p>
