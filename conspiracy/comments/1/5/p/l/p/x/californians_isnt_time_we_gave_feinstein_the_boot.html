<p>She is the worst of the worst and needs to GTFO!</p>

<p><a href="/r/OperationFeinstein">/r/OperationFeinstein</a></p>

<p>We need your support.  </p>

<p>Edit: If anyone willing has the capabilities of starting an online petition for her recall or any information on how this could be done besides an ehow.com article, please share. </p>

<p>There needs to be a serious uprising against her 20 year crippling dynasty. She is a treasonous leech on our political system. </p>

<p>Maybe there isnt a readily available candidate to take her place but I dont care, she needs to be made an example of what Americans will not put up with. She doesnt represent us, she votes purely on her own fucked up agenda. OUT!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things like FISA are made to look &quot;not that bad&quot; in the mainstream when in reality they&#39;re absolutely tyrannical.  This is done to quell dissent to such an extent that the charlatans in DC can vote for the measures and still be elected in the following term so that they can continue to pass these kinds of measures.  Any civilian who isn&#39;t already overcome by apathy and who actually looks into the issues driving things like FISA and what it means to the public IRL is against this kind of thing, but apathy and the lack of disclosure about what these things mean to them artificially deflates the amount of resistance to their passage.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been complaining about these things for years, and yet a big brother state is incrementally still being imposed from above.  If we can&#39;t make the politicians who are in office listen to us, we have to figure out how to replace those politicians with our own public servants.  We need to find people who are willing and able to seek candidacy, who are not entrenched in the two-party system, and who will lay out their policies before us, and help them campaign.  Money goes a long way--almost all of the way--but at least in small states grassroots activism may be able to overcome those forces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always voted against her, Boxer, Pelosi (when I lived in SF) and George Miller since I moved out to the east bay.   I&#39;m pretty much convinced that the system is so rigged towards the incumbent that we&#39;re not going to get any of these corrupt knuckleheads out short of death by extreme old age.    </p>

<p>I think the barest flicker of hope is the new open primaries.   This enabled us to get rid of Pete Stark (40+ years &quot;Serving&quot;).    </p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to see wet kiss news stories about her daughter (retired judge) that makes me think she&#39;s grooming her to take her place in the family business. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being a californian, I recommend you forget about us. Trust me, the people here could give two shits about anyone but themselves. </p>

<p>California, at least so-cal, has the most self-serving, self-absorbed, and materialistic perspective. I can&#39;t stand conversing with people here. What&#39;s considered conversation is blipping quotes back in forth with quirky little remarks about tiny details within the materialistic realm. It&#39;s So hip. </p>

<p>Also, politically, we are retarded. Like straight retarded. The past 30 years have proven this. Like complete retards, the minorities+hipsters will vote for those that screw them over. They&#39;re not educated enough to understand. It&#39;s not their fault, but it&#39;s their fault. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When she first ran for senate, she promised to support the Balanced Budget Amendment.  I actually voted for her.  </p>

<p>She immediately turned around and voted against the amendment, while Babs Boxer, her even more liberal cohort, horse traded one of the &quot;yes&quot; votes.  See, Boxer was up for re-election sooner and needed to appear to be on the side of fiscal responsibility.</p>

<p>As I recall, the amendment bill failed by one vote. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how they roll in politics.</p>

<p>Anyway, I decided then and there to oppose Feinstein forever after.  She has gone on to prove herself one of the most corrupt and self-enriching limousine liberal pigs at the trough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you mentally challenged? &quot;Maybe you should get the fuck out of the state.&quot; You should get the fuck out of the country. Just another programmed bot that doesn&#39;t know the first thing about The Constitution, The Bill of Rights or what this country was founded on. It is mind boggling to hear people like you talk about things that you have no idea about, to think that we have people like you voting is unnerving to say the least. Please for the sake of us all do some reading that doesn&#39;t come out of a magazine.</p>

<p>The Constitution is the supreme Law of the Land, and no law made by man or any law of any state that contradicts it controls over it.</p>

<p>The Colonies did not believe that this document was sufficient, they insisted in fact, that 10 Amendments be passed along with The Constitution or they would not ratify it. They did not believe that government would adhere to The Constitution, that the judiciary would not uphold it and that in fact government would immediately seek to undermine and destroy it.</p>

<p>The 10 Amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, were passed with The Constitution, becoming an inherent part thereof. </p>

<p>Any other law or regulation, no matter how proposed, no matter how passed, no matter if enforced or not, is facially void upon the very words in The Constitution itself.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t opinion. It is fact, and that this fact has been intentionally and wantonly disrespected and violated on a serial basis only turns each and every one of the legislators, law enforcement officials and executive members who have done so into factual criminals.</p>

<p>So says The Constitution itself.</p>

<p>The Constitution is America, you cannot &quot;erode&quot; it without destroying what America is, if you have a problem with it or The Bill of Rights, you have a problem with America. </p>

<p>When our elected officials act with blatant hypocrisy and defiance of our highest laws and of the ideals they set to enforce on the general public it is not narrow minded to label them as criminal, it is obvious fact. Apply critical thinking to the fact that the politicians who propose limiting our freedoms in response to fear and panic over tragic events have themselves done the exact things they publicly oppose.</p>
