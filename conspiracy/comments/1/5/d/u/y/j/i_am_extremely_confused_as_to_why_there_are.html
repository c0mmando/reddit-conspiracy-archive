        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With all the truth that you have learned about your government and world affairs, you still want them to take your guns? Are you fucking kidding me?! Yes, I know if the government wanted us dead we would have our work cut out for us against all the tanks, UAVs etc... but its better than rocks and molotovs. The point of the second amendment is to keep potential dictators in check. No country is immune from a dictatorship. Some may argue the United States already is. Goldman Sachs basically owns this country through infiltration of congress and the white house cabinet. You really want these fuckers telling you that youre too stupid to own a gun and you should just give it up? Fuck that! </p>

<p>Edit: There are no background checks for those who buy a gun illegally and its much easier than you would think. Havent done it or even wanted to but trust me, its easy as buying drugs. Gun laws only stop law abiders. Gun bans only disarm law abiders. </p>

<p>The answer is if you are caught offensively harming others with a firearm you get locked up until youre unable to fire one. No parole, no liberal judge sympathy, no second chances. You do <strong>not</strong> have the right to tell others how they should defend themselves against guns already in the hands of other people. Should we lift the ban on automatics? No, because they have never been widely available to citizens. &quot;Assault&quot; rifles are here by the millions and criminals will not be turning them in without a fight. Neither should we.</p>

<p>To those who will compare gun violence in other countries to the United States ask yourself this before you consider it a fair comparison:</p>

<p>Did that country have 3,000,000 guns in circulation before the ban? </p>

<p>Does that county nearly have the same problems with drug trafficking and share a border with a country (where guns are supposed to be banned) and is known for its violent drug cartels who arm criminals in said country? </p>

<p>Did it have a major gang problem before the ban? </p>

<p>Did it even really have a major gun violence problem before the ban? </p>

<p>Does it have a multi-cultural population with racial tensions? </p>

<p>A gun ban could feasibly work in some countries without public safety being risked. Hopefully your government stays relatively pleasant and doesnt fall under a dictatorship. If that happens youre all fucked from protecting yourselves.</p>

<p>The United States is full of socio-economic inequality which leads to violence. Disarming it citizens would not disarm its criminals. Most guns used to commit crimes are not legally obtained and no regard to the law is considered when using them which in turn makes it so that gun laws actually add the advantage to the criminal.</p>

The prevailing &quot;anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with me is a shill&quot; mentality in this subreddit is a large reason why I don&#39;t visit here often.

How arrogant and full yourself do you have to be to believe that the only reason why someone would have a different opinion that you is because they&#39;re being paid? Get over yourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The key is that many of our military members would have a problem with turning arms against their fellow citizens. Many would still follow orders, but we don&#39;t need to have nukes, predator drones, tanks, etc. People in the military may follow orders to a point, but they are first hand in touch with the failures of their government. This is partly why Ron Paul had such strong support from military. (I served 6 years myself)</p>

<p>Imagine how devastating it could be if the crew of one SSBN submarine, chose to stand against the tyranny. It&#39;s argued that the 6 of them the US has, are all tied for most powerful nuclear force on the planet. They can strike anywhere on the planet, then disappear in to the depths, nearly impossible to track without another sub. Submariners are a very tight knit community, good luck getting them to turn against each other. </p>

<p>I think this is in part how the minutemen managed to defeat the standing army of redcoats. The redcoats were only fighting to follow orders, the minutemen were fighting for their freedom. </p>

<p>What say you, Debbie Schultz?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I commend President Obama for recognizing following the Tuscon shooting that there are gaping holes in the current law that allowed people who would do others harm that shouldn’t have had guns or ammunition to be able to get it. Focusing on closing those loopholes…that’s what’s important.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s relevant because these armchair commandos are claiming to need weapons to defend against tyrannical government (essentially to fight and win in an armed rebellion). however their lack of physical fitness is only one of the many reasons such a claim is laughable in a modern context.</p>

<p>if you claim to need weapons to fight a war, you better be doing cardio and lifting too, otherwise your claim isn&#39;t believable. the vast majority of gun owners are not fit on par with even a regular infantry soldier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i never made any claim. what i pointed out is that there isn&#39;t any evidence to suggest that gun owners as a group are significantly more fit than the general US population (which is already known to be on the whole overweight). therefore the <strong>null</strong> hypothesis is that gun owners are similarly overweight. i&#39;m not saying they&#39;re more potbellied than other americans, just that we don&#39;t have evidence to suggest that they as a group take their physical fitness as seriously as they claim to take the role of firearms in the success of a violent uprising. hence my argument that we suffer constant gun violence to accommodate what amounts to a hobby.</p>

<p>No they should not be,  even if you want to make the case that Fraud and non-violent theft be punished by imprisonment (which I feel there are much more productive ways to handle those situations) I was more thinking about Drug Use, polical Speech (like the now 3 anarchists that are being held with out trial or charge for refusing the answer questions from a Grand Jury) and the 10000&#39;s of other offenses out there that have no victims even but that Statists like you support</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to feel the same way when I was younger but as I have gotten older and experienced a little more of life I now have a better understanding of evil.  It is a force that lives all around us and is in people that you would never suspect. It takes the form of madness, greed or negligence. No authority is immune to it so you should never expect anyone to protect you from it. It strikes randomly and at times when authority figures are not present to protect innocents. So how should we deal with evil then? You must allow citizens to have the unalienable right to protect themselves in whatever way they deem necessary.  (i.e.. if they require an assault rifle to scare a rioting crowd away from their shop, or a teacher with a pistol used to kill a murdering madman.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of placing keyboards into the hands of woefully misinformed people, but you don&#39;t see me rushing out to ban everyone else&#39;s keyboards. After all, that would infringe on their First Amendment rights.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that assault rifles aren&#39;t &quot;floating around&quot;. They&#39;re extremely heavily regulated, requiring about 6 months of paperwork with the ATF and <em>at least $10,000</em> to make the purchase. You should also be aware that when the AWB expired in 2004, there was no increase in crime. So if you really want to revoke the rights of your fellow Americans, you&#39;re going to have to try and repeal the Second Amendment. This would be a highly unfortunate course of action which would likely be interpreted as an assault on the freedom of the American people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t any of you wonder why gun rights are the only thing the government has touched in the past 11 years?</p>

<p>Freedom of speech, demolished</p>

<p>Privacy, ruined</p>

<p>Due process, abolished</p>

<p>But guns, the ONLY thing between us and the government, hasn&#39;t even been touched.</p>

<p>You know why? Because we BOUGHT guns, we paid money for them. You can take Americans freedoms but when you try to take their shiny little toys, well THEN you&#39;re a tyrant.</p>

<p>Oh and the multi-billion dollar in gun lobby money doesn&#39;t hurt, BUT HEY who gives a fuck about that right? I&#39;m sure gun companies are just here to defend &quot;ur freedumz&quot;</p>

<p>And by the way, before any of you say &quot;WELL THE&#39;YRE ABOUT TO BAN GUNS&quot;. They&#39;re going to ban ASSAULT WEAPONS, which were already banned for the past 10 years. </p>

<p>Nevermind the fact that over 90% of gun crimes are committed with handguns. The government won&#39;t even touch handguns, because that&#39;s how the gun companies make their money, lebowsky </p>

I found it weird when people voluntary gave in their guns.  They already have them, so why give them away?  I support coming up with a more comprehensive system to gun control that takes into account mental health, education, training, insurance, licensing, etc., not outright banning guns.  Being more careful about what&#39;s going on with our guns doesn&#39;t attack or threaten the second amendment, it just makes it more responsible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I support gun ownership, there&#39;s one fallacy I would like to address here.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t going to be a revolution.  The United States will <strong>NEVER</strong> develop an anti-government revolutionary movement of any dangerous proportions and the mere idea of an armed revolutionary force capable of fighting a sustained guerrilla war against the United States Military is nothing but a dangerous and foolish fantasy.</p>

<p>The truth is that every word I type is now entering a database and is scanned and tagged for key words, then tucked away in my personal file.  This is not because I am someone special or particularly dangerous, though awareness is its own little power and danger to the system.</p>

<p>Fact is - the FBI and other services are tracking OWS and every other subversive knitting club from here to Eugene, OR.  Is the NSA not tracking every email and every phone call?  None of this is fiction if the whistleblowers are to be believed.  Judging by the rate they&#39;re being bumped off or scape-goated, I&#39;d say the whistleblowers are on to something.  And that something is pretty much the nascent invention of real world Oceania - the electronic surveillance state.</p>

<p>All our base are belong to those assholes.  Think about it - heard of any major movement that hasn&#39;t been compromised or infiltrated by either CIA, FBI, or some other service?  Again, this isn&#39;t undercover information, this has all been in the press repeatedly.</p>

<p>So, if you are an AR-15 owner, and you have wistful thoughts late at night, drinking whiskey on the porch, about &quot;what it&#39;d be like&quot; going head to head against federal marshals, or a SWAT team, or Special Forces operators?</p>

<p>It will be like a blinding flash of light as you, your weapons, and your little prayer meeting all go to heaven on a laser-guided GBU-38 JDAM launched from a drone piloted by some kid drinking a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew 2,000 miles away.</p>

<p>add:dr; The power of civilian grade weapons as a means of domestic political resistance is greatly overstated.</p>

<p>Well, it only actually makes you dangerous if someone physically comes to your house to disarm you, and only to them.  That doesn&#39;t make you a general danger to other people.  And as an individual, your threat to the State is negligible. </p>

<p>However, if you stockpile weapons, begin training operations, and start printing literature or making Youtube videos about politics, you should expect the attention from the forces of control.</p>

<p>Do you really think that the men and women who fire missiles from these drones will think themselves to be anything less than patriots as they blow you and your friends to charred lumps of sizzling human coal?  Their egos will allow nothing less than to consider you evil and themselves to be the righteous cure.  These are the justifications we&#39;ve used for years now.</p>

<p>The powers that be don&#39;t seem to have much of a moral dilemma about anything - that was my point.  Police squads stomped those OWS kids in their own homes and it was barely reported.  Kicked the doors in, I didn&#39;t hear much of an uproar about it on this sub.</p>

<p>If the second amendment had any teeth in it today at all, local groups of citizens would have access to and hold the very same weapons that the most advanced parts of the military do. It&#39;s a freedom to arm ourselves...not specifically guns. It exists as it does today because of gun lobbyists (...surprise!) that love your money and prepper paranoia which adds some 5-20% GDP to a sagging US economy.</p>

<p>&quot;You do not have the right to tell others how they should defend themselves against guns already in the hands of other people.&quot;</p>

<p>We&#39;re already as citizens kept from arming ourselves how we want. How can you possibly use this as a point until we&#39;ve really committed ourselves to it and everyone is holding as many atomic bombs as they want in storage?</p>

<p>You&#39;re in essence telling the government &quot;don&#39;t take our peashooters&quot; when within 5-20 seconds and at the government&#39;s command your house could be bombed, you could be gunned, and for all practical purposes wiped from the map. How much 2nd amendment rights do you have to save you from this....really?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An average American is fifty times more likely to be murdered with a firearm that the average Brit. It goes without saying that the prevalence of firearms in the US (and their scarcity in the UK) is a major contributing factor to this statistical divergence. The &quot;obvious&quot; conclusion is that gun control legislation in the US could reduce the firearm homicide rate.</p>

<p>However, there are two factors which need to be addressed. The first is that gun control legislation and &quot;fewer guns&quot; are not the same thing. There are so many guns in private hands that banning them would cause huge problems. And criminalising previously legal gun owners is a dangerous step. I honestly doubt whether it is practical, and that the incredible homicide rate is the price you have to pay for this Constitutional right.</p>

<p>The other point is that the United States is rapidly turning into fascist plutocracy with corrupt paramilitarised police - a sort of Argentina max. If I was American, I would want a weapon. It would give me a sense of being a sovereign citizen, even though at a cerebral level I knew it was just an illusion. The statistics show that owning a gun makes you far more likely to be killed by a firearm (even excluding suicide). But who cares, you FEEL in control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is about FEEL.  Take a historical look at the time before firearms, and look at it from our(american though not all perspective).  Firearms are basically super crossbows, fast loading and easy to learn to use.  The states were basically brought about by an insurrection made successful by distance and guns.  America owes its existance to popular enough sentiment and the will to make it happen.  Not just the will but the ABILITY.  </p>

<p>Life is not safe, we are not immortal or invulnerable.  Some will accept the risks inherent with certain freedoms.  Gun ownership as a standard will have causualties, every individual will not always act within reason.  The question boils down to the needs of the many against the few. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Then stick in bird shot.  Remember your job is to push the intruders away.  You don&#39;t need buck shot unless you&#39;re trying to kill them.</p>

<p>6 inches gives you approximately 28.27 square inches of coverage with which to hit the intruder vs what, 1 with your sidearm?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>An average American is fifty times more likely to be murdered with a firearm</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sublimely chosen words. But you can&#39;t take credit for them. They are standard party line propaganda. You could have said &quot;An average American is fifty times more likely to be murdered&quot; but the deception would be far more obvious. People are murdered at roughly the same rate with or without guns. Murderers prefer guns to be sure. The lack of a gun does not change a murderer into an model citizen. Nor does ownership of a gun turn anyone into a murderer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t, as someone who has no emotional stake (or otherwise) in the outcome of the debate its clear that &quot;well regulated [trained/maintained] militia&quot; is the operative term.</p>

<p>This is all the more clear when you understand that the founding fathers feared the states having a unified standing army under the government&#39;s control; instead they favoured having regional militias.</p>

<p>However, America does have a standing army now and &quot;well regulated militias&quot; are a thing of the past, by and large.  The supreme court couldn&#39;t rule any other way otherwise they would render the 2nd amendment irrelevant, plus it has been interpreted this way for countless years now.</p>

<p>Ruling any other way would also mean disarming the population which, although its doable, would be a major pain in the arse (there&#39;s an abundance of guns in the US) and the reality is nobody in government cares enough about doing it anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My disagreement is only speculation, but yes, I would disagree. I imagine that while the country&#39;s founders knew the value of having an armed population by which threatening forces may be resisted, they also understood the need to have that armament regulated and conformed to a responsible standard, and the specification of the militia was how they chose to express that. Granted, I don&#39;t think any of our founding fathers had the ability to foresee their nation a few hundred years in the future when every man&#39;s neighbor is an occupying force and each civilian is irresponsible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly if you live in one of those countries you could maybe convince me that hey you know what you need this. But the US isn&#39;t any of those countries. If the US is so unstable that people feel the same need to arm them selves to the same degree as those countriest there is a much bigger issue there. The US is just as stable as my country (Canada for the record). And honestly I&#39;m not some anti gun nut I&#39;m fan of guns I&#39;m also a fan of gun safety though. In a situation where I&#39;m confronted by a gun be it from a criminal who knows what they&#39;re doing or some mad man shooter I&#39;d much rather be going up against someone with a limited number of rounds (ie in Canada those would be 5 for a long gun and 10 for a pistol). Don&#39;t get me wrong I think that some of the laws are a little over the top regarding minimum barrel length limiting what kinds of weapons you can have but I understand the reasoning for it. I&#39;m not saying outlaw guns what I&#39;m saying is realize that the average citizen doesn&#39;t need a rambo level armory. You want pistols that&#39;s fine you want long guns that&#39;s fine people on average don&#39;t need (and in my opinion shouldn&#39;t have) high cap fully automatic firearms and if you&#39;re adament that no people should be able to buy whatever they want you can&#39;t possibly be against stricter background checks for these people.</p>

<p>The likelihood of death by swimming pool (1 in 11,000) versus death by gun (1 in 1 million-plus) isn’t even close: Molly is roughly 100 times more likely to die in a swimming accident at Imani’s house than in gunplay at Amy’s.</p>
