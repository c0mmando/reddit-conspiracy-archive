    <div class="md"><p>The point is that the size of the plane isn&#39;t the determining factor here. The buildings were intact underneath the point of impact. Most of the fuel burned away from the explosion and even if it didn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t hot enough to cause steel and concrete to pulverize as the top of the tower fell vertically into it&#39;s path of most resistance. The law of conservation of momentum was defied on that day only. The top of the building fell as if there was nothing underneath to break the fall. There was something involved that assisted in the displacement of the mass underneath. Controlled explosions, directed energy weapons, whatever! Buildings just don&#39;t fall that way, plane or no plane. Not to mention all the firemen who witnessed secondary explosions in the lower floors, molten metal in the debris etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does size have to do with the ability to have automated controls? Besides auto-pilot technology is nothing new, the idea that such systems can be further refined in scope is a no-brainer.</p>

<p>I personally think we don&#39;t have to dwell on such details, I believe the priority should be to uncover the behind the scenes mechanisms that allowed the attacks to occur. Shedding light on the intersecting, overlapping and often conflicting policies and motivations of various organizations in and outside the government which resulted in the outcome of September 11th..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, that&#39;s a silly comparison, but it was addressed by the WTC architects as noted above, but the larger issue to me is the <strong>manner</strong> of the collapse.</p>

<p>For the first time in the recorded history of steel framed skyscrapers, a building <strong>totally collapsed</strong> due to fire. Not only just collapsed, but <strong>pancaked</strong> into its own footprint; and <em>not only one building but three</em> within the span of a few hours.</p>

<p>Curious, but ultimately irrelevant:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_767">Boeing 767-223ER</a>, which has a maximum take-off weight of 300,000 pounds, slightly less than the 330,000-pound maximum of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_707">Boeing 707</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe there were actual planes with passengers, there&#39;s some questionable doubts at the Pentagon, but nothing I find conclusive (the last I checked).</p>

<p>The OP&#39;s question is a leading one, because it presumes that people who doubt the official account:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>don&#39;t believe there were planes</p></li>
<li><p>don&#39;t believe there were passengers on the planes</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I think many of us are frustrated. The information is out there but also a huge amount of noise as well. Thinking people have to do their own thinking and that&#39;s not readily transmittable in a fast food delivery style when the subject matter is so massive. In the world of TLDR, it is very difficult to get people to process information; they often just grab the easiest or glittery tidbits and don&#39;t delve any further.</p>

<p>Having spent the first half of my adult life working for the government, the chaos and bureaucratic attributes that Susan Lindauer references all sound very familiar to me and thus rings true. But, obviously it&#39;s more than just that, she is an authentic documented person and a primary source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Philip Zelikow sent a bunch of remote controlled 767s with a trademark bulge along the left underside from a Florida AFB just weeks before the attacks.  You can clearly see this same bulge on the planes that struck the towers.  The second plane performed a horizontal correction that would be humanly impossible just before striking the south tower.  Also, a split second before impact you can see an orange dot on the tower, as though it were part of the guidance system.</p>
