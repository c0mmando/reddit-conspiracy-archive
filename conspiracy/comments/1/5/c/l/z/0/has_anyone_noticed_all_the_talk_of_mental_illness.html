    <div class="md"><p>They are doing several things with this, you are right about one.</p>

<p>1) Demonization of guns</p>

<p>2) Push for mental health screenings to identify those who don&#39;t &quot;fit in&quot;</p>

<p>3) Pushing for the &quot;outcasts&quot; of society to conform.  This is collectivism being rolled out in full force in schools.  The &quot;bullying&quot; problem lies not with the people who are doing the bullying, but with the people who are bullied.  They are the problem according to the news, by pointing out these &quot;bullied&quot; kids are more likely to be shooters.</p>

I agree that it&#39;s always some disaster that gets politicized and something happens as a result. 9/11, Kennedy&#39;s assassination, etc. Look to see kids even more medicated, as a result in the public school system. or even something more sinister as the foods being doped with something.
