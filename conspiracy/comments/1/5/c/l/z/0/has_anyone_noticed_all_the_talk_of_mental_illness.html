       I don't watch tv very often, but watched the news for about an hour at a hotel yesterday. A reoccurring topic was mental health problems with regards to the shootings of late. Seems like the stage could be being set for involuntary admittance to asylums for fill in the blank. Discuss.

       They are doing several things with this, you are right about one.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Demonization of guns
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Push for mental health screenings to identify those who don't "fit in"
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Pushing for the "outcasts" of society to conform.  This is collectivism being rolled out in full force in schools.  The "bullying" problem lies not with the people who are doing the bullying, but with the people who are bullied.  They are the problem according to the news, by pointing out these "bullied" kids are more likely to be shooters.

       Im not at all disagreeing with you. In fact I think my point goes right in line with what you're saying. The media is blaring ” mental health” as a cause. Im saying mental health is being set up to be abused as a means of silencing or disapearing people.

       I think the Mayans had many problems to worry about at the time. I agree that it's always some disaster that gets politicized and something happens as a result. 9/11, Kennedy's assassination, etc. Look to see kids even more medicated, as a result in the public school system. or even something more sinister as the foods being doped with something. We don't ever have to worry about a zombie invasion , many people already are and don't even know...

       Lets talk about Kool-Aid.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is actually so normal for most people to drink the kool-aid that they will argue with people who say there is something in the kool-aid. Normal, these days, is calling non-kool aid drinkers "insane".

       It is like a nationwide Stockholm Synrome AND patients running the asylum syndrome.

       Yeah I do believe it's a mental illness on rampant violence. However I don't believe the news is calling pressing people into asylums. IMO I do believe people should be educated on signs of instability and inherent violent actions rather than take away rights for guns from stable citizens. It doesn't mean throwing them away in a vault.

       So simple. Publish a mental health hotline number anyone can call when they see disturbing/dark behavior of a child as young as 5 or an adult. They ALWAYS show signs that those around them ALWAYS ignore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sure all americans know the number. 1-800-MENTAL5? You will even get some MOTHERS who will call for help.

       Who cares if they get real help. Lets just find them and get them to calm down so they don't harm others.

       I have noticed this spin.  It seems as if being a gamer and intellectual is being associated with plotting mass murder.  Meanwhile, Nancy Lanza is portrayed as the sane and saintly victim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports indcate, when Adam wanted to join the military, Nancy "squashed" the idea.  She repeatedly reminded him that he did not like to be touched, and if he were injured in the military, the medics would have to touch him.
      </p>
      <p>
       She sounds like a demon.  Why are we not looking into the demented mother?

1. Tell me how what she said was wrong.

       Apparently you, and other posters here, do not see a problem with a mother using abusive psychological manipulation to control her son.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alarming issue not that what she said was factually wrong.  The issue is that her approach is comparable to MK-ULTRA.  No good mother relates to her children as described.

       Maybe the guy really did have a legitimate problem with being touched to the point that it affected his ability to function in close settings like the military. And yeah, maybe she reminded him of that. I swear I don't see why that's a bad thing. It's like you're grasping at straws to demonize her (and me for not agreeing). If you want to make her out to be a bad person, please find more evidence.
