       Her lack of testimony and excuses to avoid testifying are very likely a part of a larger cover up. The CIA was up to some shady dealings in Bengahzi. Hilary was in some way aware of this or realized too late that her part in what happened could be used against her and the Obama admin. It is also common knowledge that the CIA has deep ties to Neo-Conservatives, Islamic Radicals, and the Republican party, and my guess is they don't want to reveal what the CIA was really up to in the region either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole media campaign was likely a ruse to coverup what was really happening while simultaneously using the event to smear the Obama admin. Not that there isn't enough blame to go around, but considering the conservative control of the CIA you have to wonder if the Obama admin was getting solid intel on the situation to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was known that Benghazi was/is a stronghold of radical Islam in Libya and that this area has produced many of the radical insurgents we have fought against in Iraq and which are now threatening to setup an Islamic dictatorship in Syria. The central Libyan government and Gaddafi were opposing these same radicals during the revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the reason why the west intervened in Libya was because Banghazi had been surrounded and was under threat by the coalition of Libyan armed forces. (It should be noted that both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International stated that the central government of Libya had used a great deal of restraint when dealing militarily with the Islamists.) The real question is what was Ambassador Stevens (a known CIA asset) doing in a hotbed of Islamic Jihadis?

       As a follow up to your post, claims have been made that stevens had been involved in supplying weapons as a go between to the aq islamists during the revolution, and still continues to ship out towards syria through those established channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the attack on benghazi, there was a military standown order issued to anybody in the region who could have helped. Apparently it was issued from high up, possibly even by the director himself. For a few weeks extra personnel where requested through multiple channels, through the libyan government and through military sources, nothing. The attack destroyed documentation of all sorts from both sites. I don't know of many terrorists who actively seek to destroy cia documents in the middle of a fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, here's a fox news source (lol) about the attack, it actually has a little bit of info on the operation that was going on.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       So they claimed it was a buyback program, yet i haven't seen ANY information about this yet from any other source, simply calling it a cia operation. Why would a militia destroy documentation of a buyback program. Right, to cover up the munitions and arms that where given to them in the first place.

       Thank you, this subreddit is going to shit because of people like this.  And people that try so hard to find a conspiracy when there isn't one.

       Well we wouldn't be able to even tentatively attempt determining if there may be a conspiracy if questions aren't asked and things brought to attention, now would we?
      </p>
      <p>
       A conspiracy forum does not go to shit because people post a lot of questions and suspicions, even if many think some are ridiculous. If anything it helps people become more objective and better at searching for reliable information.

       While asking questions is right and should be encouraged.. People don't tend to ask questions on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       .

       They immediately jump to evil conclusions and then then the top-upvoted comment is the one nearly everyone agrees on as practically truth.

       I don't know and I don't really care to find out because I find this topic uninteresting. I was just wanted to tell the above redditor that I think they should ask themselves the question you posed and find the answer before denouncing any topic's theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that when they do so, ignore it or make a comment stating they don't believe it and "here's why:". I believe that educates people.
