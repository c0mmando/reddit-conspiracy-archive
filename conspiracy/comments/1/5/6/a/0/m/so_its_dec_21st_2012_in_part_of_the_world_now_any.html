    <div class="md"><p>Not quite sure as I have not cared enough to look into it.<br/>
Just going into an aquarius age, from what I understand. Whether or not anything happens, I do not know.  Exiting the 13th baktun cycle and going to a new one.</p>

<p>Now, here is an interesting thought.  There is a case for stair step evolution. If stair step evolution is true, then maybe something interesting happens with our genetics. I think that the most likely outcome, as we would end up with 44 and 2, as opposed to 42 and 2.  Our ancestors were also shorter than us, and I wonder if they were 40 and 2, or malnutrition was limiting, which I think is odd because everything they ate would have been organic.  </p>

<p>Now if that does happen, I imagine we may gain new intelligence, senses, heights, sizes...</p>

<p>Maybe humans will have a better consciousness. as a result.  Especially if we could tap into each other&#39;s consciousness, or universal human truths.  Maybe like &quot;Oh, these really mean and fucked up people have been controlling humankind into an eternal fucked up state&quot; or &quot;We really need to stop fighting amongst each other or we will all die&quot;.  </p>

<p>I think the aquarius definition would be serendipity and surprise... That&#39;s what I am hoping for.</p>

<p>Also, this whole consciousness shift idea. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I wish that this was the actual case and we all had some amazing shift but..Idk, that seems like a farfetched fairytale. I mean, damn, consciousness is so complicated. There&#39;s so many factors from our subconscious that go into creating our conscious. Watch these videos about consciousness. They&#39;re long, but, given the subject, not even close to long enough. </p>

<p>The earth would have been more nutritionally dense as well a few hundred years back, maybe a few thousand.  As all the ecosystems would have still been intact.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have listened to <a href="http://youtu.be/yrBKm-MArGY">this whole thing</a> (2 hours of him explaining the &quot;evidence&quot; behind a polar shift, and the end of the world as a result), and the primary evidence that he presents for the &quot;end of the world&quot; theory, is that as we cross the galactic plane (the closest we get to the center of the galaxy), the gravitational pull and magnetic pull by the SMBH at the center of the galaxy will be so strong that it will move our magnetic poles, which will tilt the planet (with the new poles, say being at the equator) with it now spinning on the  new poles. Apparently there is about 40KM of water rising around the equators, so when the poles move to the equator (or wherever they go) you can expect that water to rush to the new equator. That is essentially the gist of the the &quot;legitimate&quot; evidence behind 2012 being the end of the world. I&#39;ve also watching/listened to many many documentaries regarding the consciousness shift. </p>

<p>In regards to the worlds end, I am confused as, if the SMBH is so strong (as I would assume it is), strong enough to screw up the magnetism of the earth, why would it not happen until we are right on top of it? Why not weeks, months, years before, or after? I mean it&#39;s every 13,000 years that we supposedly cross this area of the galaxy, so even 100 years before or after the closest time could be enough to do the damage, right? </p>

<p>Either way, he provides some serious evidence, the only issue of whether it is actually true or not. The way I see it, if he&#39;s right, there&#39;s really nothing we can do about it, as we&#39;re all gonna die. So it&#39;s better to just pick holes in his story and not believe it, I guess. There is really no preparation anyone can do, outside of huge underground facilities in the north pole (which still could end up being thousands of feet underwater), if it is true. And if it IS true, it&#39;s not going to happen on the 21st, that&#39;s just when we&#39;re closest. It could be years before or after. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yup.</p>

<p>The gravitational pull depends only on distance, not angle, so the SMBH shouldn&#39;t have any unusual effect. I just ran the numbers, and its pull on Earth is about 1 trillion times weaker than the Sun&#39;s... this is something that falls off slowly with distance (inverse square law), no sort of alignment could change it significantly.</p>

<p>As for magnetic effects, they&#39;re even weaker at this distance, and although they have some angle-dependence it isn&#39;t enough for there to be any measurable change in the completely negligible non-effects.</p>

One top of that, the Earth is moving away from the plane and won&#39;t pass through it again for millions of years. </p>

<p>As for the galactic equator, it&#39;s defined as the path of the Sun&#39;s orbit, which the Earth passes through twice a year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not quite sure as I have not cared enough to look into it.<br/>
Just going into an aquarius age, from what I understand. Whether or not anything happens, I do not know.  Exiting the 13th baktun cycle and going to a new one.</p>

<p>Now, here is an interesting thought.  There is a case for stair step evolution. If stair step evolution is true, then maybe something interesting happens with our genetics. I think that the most likely outcome, as we would end up with 44 and 2, as opposed to 42 and 2.  Our ancestors were also shorter than us, and I wonder if they were 40 and 2, or malnutrition was limiting, which I think is odd because everything they ate would have been organic.  </p>

<p>Now if that does happen, I imagine we may gain new intelligence, senses, heights, sizes...</p>

<p>Maybe humans will have a better consciousness. as a result.  Especially if we could tap into each other&#39;s consciousness, or universal human truths.  Maybe like &quot;Oh, these really mean and fucked up people have been controlling humankind into an eternal fucked up state&quot; or &quot;We really need to stop fighting amongst each other or we will all die&quot;.  </p>

<p>I think the aquarius definition would be serendipity and surprise... That&#39;s what I am hoping for.</p>
