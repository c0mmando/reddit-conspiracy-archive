       The night time video of a gun in the car is probably the same mix up of this operation as whoever was in charge of planting the correct ID at the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was such a horrific operation that those within it screwed it up purposefully to give the public a chance to recognize there is more to this story than you are being told.
      </p>
      <p>
       All day long there are reports of a rifle in the car, then the rifle was reported to have been used and a shotgun in the car, then the video of the shotgun found in the car is at night time, long after the original report.  Whoever was in charge of creating the ID of Adam Lanza put Ryan Lanza instead, and whoever was in charge of the information about the gun in the car released that info too early.

       What time was the first report about a rifle in the car? Because here on the east coast it has been getting dark pretty early. For example, today's sunset in Newtown CT was at 4:25 pm.

       Love it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In answer to your question, though, I would speculate that Lanza was supposed to take the rifle out of the car, but forgot, possibly on account of his being drugged out his skull (like James Holmes was). I am sure the police discovered the rifle in the back of his (mother's) car pretty quickly, and this news was leaked to the press.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inside the school, he may have had a moment of lucidity and realised his accompice(s) were conducting a mass murder, hence his pitiful pleading to be let into the one of classrooms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, would a killer say "Let me in, let me in"? Of course not. He realised he was about to get shot by the real killer(s) and was trying to ESCAPE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since all the kids were supposedly killed by an assault rifle, the lack of such a weapon inside the school was a tad problematic for the authorities. But since they had a (dead) culprit, they simply needed to amend the backstory about the rifle being left in the car to make his guilt "coherent". So they staged a second search of the car, this time revealing... a shotgun. Phew, now where's the next blatant discrepancy in the official story that needs fixing?
