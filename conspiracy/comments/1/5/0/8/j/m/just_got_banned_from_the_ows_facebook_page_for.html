       I never really gave them much credence anyway as a result of some of the dumb shit they post, but seriously what the fuck? Anyone have any similar experiences with them? I can't figure out if them and "The Other 98%" are just retarded or are disinfo.

       OWS is decentralized, it's a protest movement against the people in charge.  there were attempts to neuter it ideologically, but they did not start it...

       OWS isn't pushing materialism.  OWS is pushing back against the hoarders/ruling class, who have been dragging society through the sewer for a few thousand years for nobody's benefit but their own.  if anything, OWS is anti-materialist.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you want to criticize OWS, criticize them for how
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       of them want to go about pushing back (e.g. how some of them think we should push back through "government").  the movement itself doesn't have some huge deception behind it.

       i looked it up before i replied.  something about the avant garde vs. the status quo, where the avant garde is supposed to be the good one, and society changes because of the conflict between them.  and Marx came up with the idea, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       the big gap in interpretation about what  that avant garde
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       seemed to turn Marxism and all its derivatives  into a century of total warfare and anti-human horrors.  Stalinism, National Socialism, Maoism...don't you think so?   so you can see what i would want you to be clear about your meaning.

       Shills is making some great points here guys. Think about it. I was a huge OWS supporter. I was teargassed and i lost some hearing in my right ear from a flashbang grenade in Oakland. But what came out of that movement? Before OWS, The u.s. public assumed  that they still had the right to assemble, the right to free speech. Now it seems that everyone has accepted you're are going to get your head stomped in if you take to the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a lot of coverage in the MSM of a few incidents of police brutality, and of course, almost no police were punished. People thought that it was a good thing that the police brutality was being exposed. But all this exposure did was show the american public that they are going to get fucked up if they protest.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire movement was a way to advance police powers, demonize "dissenters", create "free speech zones", demoralize and scare the public away from organized protest, and catalog thousands of "potential terrorists" with cameras and arrests.

       THIS. I was involved in a lot of organizing in the very early days of OWS. I handed out a lot of literature about our financial system, specifically the federal reserve, and personally noted that it was nice to see a large group of libertarians organizing. As time went on it became a disorganized group of extreme leftist people who wouldn't even listen to anything that differed from views expressed on the daily show. (a show which i do find amusing, if however obviously liberal it is) my point is that when it began there was an open forum of ideas and discussion. as it became increasingly obvious that there were literal disinformation / authority figures penetrating groups, things rapidly went south. i since have no affiliation as OWS is truly dead, all that remains is what corporations want to remain.

       Possibly your question was deemed so idiotic as to not merit an answer?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you introduced the sort of gun control the UK has, to the US (ie no handguns, no assault rifles) then Lanza's mother, as a law-abiding citizen, would not have owned any weapons for Lanza to kill with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me spell it out. He wouldn't have had access to a gun, which would have prevented the shooting. Is that really so difficult to understand?

       Criminals will get guns even if they are illegal, but that's not the point. The question was specifically about the recent shootings, none of which were carried out by "criminals".
      </p>
      <p>
       How would a law-abiding, middle-class reclusive nerd like Adam Lanza (or James Holmes) get hold of handguns and an assault rifle if they were not legally available? His mother wouldn't have owned any, after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a Brit, I honestly have no clue how I would go about getting an assault rifle. I am sure it would be possible, but sourcing one would fraught with risk. I'd be at risk of approaching the wrong people and getting reported to the police - guaranteed prison term.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also be exposing myself to serious criminals, a section of society I am not exactly familiar with. Even if they were willing to provide me with a weapon, I am guessing it would involve a cash payment of 5-10x the US retail value of such a weapon.

       People don't sell assault rifles on shop corners in the UK!
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of a reclusive nerd like Adam Lanza venturing into the criminal underworld, here, to source such a weapon is absolutely laughable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if he found gangster-central, nobody would sell someone like him a weapon because they would be justifiably concerned that a) he wanted it to shoot kids, and b) that the weapon would be traced back to them.

       He could have made a homemade bomb, used a car or a million other things to kill. You don't ban everything, you can't protect everyone with laws. If anything have armed guards at all schools or let the teachers carry which is what Texas is doing. Also he didn't use an assault weapon. And I have a right to protect myself!

       Is it ironic that the British are telling us that we should disarm ourselves?  It feels ironic, but maybe it's just funny.

       Criminals will get guns even if they are illegal, but that's not the point. The question was specifically about the recent shootings, none of which were carried out by "criminals".
      </p>

       How would a law-abiding, middle-class reclusive nerd like Adam Lanza (or James Holmes) get hold of handguns and an assault rifle if they were not legally available? His mother wouldn't have owned any, after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a Brit, I honestly have no clue how I would go about getting an assault rifle. I am sure it would be possible, but sourcing one would fraught with risk. I'd be at risk of approaching the wrong people and getting reported to the police - guaranteed prison term.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also be exposing myself to serious criminals, a section of society I am not exactly familiar with. Even if they were willing to provide me with a weapon, I am guessing it would involve a cash payment of 5-10x the US retail value of such a weapon.
