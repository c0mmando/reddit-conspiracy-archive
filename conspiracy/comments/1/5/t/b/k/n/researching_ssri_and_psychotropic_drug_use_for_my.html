Millions of Americans take SSRIs and other brain-changing chemicals, but very few of those go on to commit mass murder.

    <div class="md"><p>Your conclusion that Americans are 9 times more likely to be mentally ill than the rest of the world does not follow from your quote.  Your quote only refers to a particular type of medication for a particular mental illness.  It also does not describe the number of pills produced.  For example, if there were 10 pills produced in the world every year, and Americans consumed  and produced 9, would Americans be 9 times more likely to be mentally ill?</p>

<p>It sounds as though you have low <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_inhibition">Latent Inhibition</a> and a fundamental inability to handle the increased information flow (if you subscribe to that theory).  This can be indicative of either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.  I have a feeling that you may, in fact, be manic.</p>

<p>Further evidence of mania can be seen in your original post, which appears to have been typed quickly and contains numerous spelling errors.  The original article is a hodge-podge of links that you&#39;ve likely spent hours analyzing and drawing (false) correlations between respective points.  It&#39;s poor formatting suggests an ego-centric state;  Here are a bunch of links! Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve found!  I must go back to research -- you sort it out.</p>

<p>Edit: I should mention that the second and third paragraphs are primarily a social commentary on how ridiculous our diagnostic system is with respect to mental illnesses.  However, I would argue that mental illnesses are extremely difficult to categorize and diagnose.  We do the best we can.</p>

<p>What I am saying is that Americans are NOT 9 times more crazy, but that the psychotropic (brain changing, lifetime changing) drugs are proscribed to us 9 times more.</p>

<p>Which MAKES us crazy.</p>

<p>Which makes the children diagnosed with ADHD (not all of them, but perhaps the clear majority) victims of quackery.</p>

<p>Quackery.</p>

<p>Not a science at all.</p>

<p><strong>I also like how you proclaimed me an insane individual, from the data available - my posting here.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I posted a collection of data which you dismiss out of hand because it conflicts with your irrational beliefs.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Which, in effect, means that you insane.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Please go check yourself as you may be a danger to yourself and/or others - at the very least, SSRI prescription is in order.</strong></p>

<p>I realize that you made this comment as a remark on how the quackery called psychiatry works - but I flipped it to show that almost ANYONE can quickly make a diagnosis.</p>

<p>It scares me that these &quot;experts&quot; proscribe brain changing drugs, which affect a person his/her whole life, with no science at all behind it.</p>

<p>Just quackery.</p>

<p>Pseudo science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your quote only refers to ADHD medication.  That is but one category of psychiatric medication.  Therefore we cannot extrapolate to other categories of mental illnesses or drugs.  Also, the claim that there is no science behind those drugs is laughable.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If two things seem to be correlated, it could be that one of them is causing the other, or it could be that both of them are caused by some third thing.</p>

<p>In this case, it seems much more reasonable to think that the two things you&#39;re excited about - SSRI&#39;s and mass murder - are both caused by mental illness.</p>

<p>I find it entirely unsurprising that people who ended up doing horrible and irrational things have a history of contact with mental health practitioners - and that those mental health practitioners tried various approaches to treating them for their mental illness, including prescription drugs. </p>

<p>Also, mixing up depression, schizoaffective or personality disorders, and ADHD (and the various treatments proposed for them) makes your basic idea effectively incomprehensible. It&#39;s like saying that people die from cancer and heart disease and auto accidents, so it&#39;s important to quit smoking because that will prevent auto accidents, since all death is basically the same. </p>

<p>There may be some truth in there somewhere, but you&#39;re not going to find it if you won&#39;t slow down and think carefully and pay attention. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personal story:</p>

<p>A co-worker in a past job has a brother.  The brother was diagnosed with something or other, and the doctor(s?) prescribed brain changing drugs.</p>

<p>The co-worker did not want to talk in specifics, but during one phone call the drama that played out was this - the doctor lowered the prescription of whatever he was taking, and the guy called the co-worker and told that he will kill himself.</p>

<p>The effect of taking away this drug was almost instantenous and the result horrifying.</p>

<p>These are brain changing chemicals, which change brain patterns, behaviour and inhibitions, and have a tremendous effect on a person.</p>

<p>The effect of changing the dosage is usually horrible.</p>

<p>Like I said, I refuse to believe that Americans are 9 times more crazy than the rest of the world.</p>

<p>I believe that the drugs are making the people WORSE off, not better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Posted this on Facebook awhile back. Based on really crude data (there were only 5 data points I could find..) there is a statistical correlation between the increases of rampage shootings and SSRIs. Correlation =/= causation, however someone who can obtain better data should REALLY LOOK INTO THIS RELATIONSHIP. There might be something here. I had a .962279 correlation and a perfect correlation is 1.0. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Time for statistics! A perfect correlation between two sets of data is 1.0. When I ran an analysis on the number of SSRIs prescribed for the datapoints I could find, I had a .962279 correlation. I acknowledge there are big flaws in the data I obtained, but I couldn&#39;t really find better and it&#39;s a good starting point. I&#39;m sure someone here can find more definitive numbers on SSRI prescriptions in the US and do it better than me. I&#39;m just a starting point ;) Here&#39;s a graph of the percentage of Americans on SSRIs (in red) vs. the number of rampage killings per 100 million Americans since the 1900&#39;s. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/FenSn.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/FenSn.jpg</a>  It&#39;s pretty crude, but I think it illustrates my point well. I had no idea what to expect when I ran these numbers, but after plotting out the data points it seemed like there was a damn close relationship. When you are trying to find the cause of the shooting, you have to ask &quot;What factor(s) have changed in the past 30 years that might correlate with the increase of shootings?&quot; To find the visible increase in school shootings, I used the following graph: Not many exist, so I took the first I could find.
<a href="http://socialevolutionforum.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rampages1.gif?w=594">http://socialevolutionforum.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rampages1.gif?w=594</a> [RES ignored duplicate image]
I read somewhere that 90% of shooters are on SSRIs, so I figured that was a good place to start. Therefore... being the nerd I am.. I compiled some data on the percent of Americans on SSRIs and the number of mass shootings. Unfortunately, the drug companies/mental health industry in the US keeps this data pretty hushed up - probably partly due to privacy laws and to save their own asses in lawsuits (Hard to correlate the cause of something, such as increases in suicide rates, when there&#39;s no data on the total number of people taking it.) I was able to find really good numbers from the UK, and maybe I&#39;ll run those numbers with the same school shooting graph later. I&#39;d guess that the pattern of subscription of SSRIs in the UK is close to the US, but who knows. However, I was able to find a few data points that seemed relatively reliable. (If you can find better data on this, feel free to try. I&#39;ll run the correlation with the said data points and see if it&#39;s as strong.)
The first set of data on SSRIs is from the CDC&#39;s website, PG 62: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus10.pdf">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus10.pdf</a> It only provides 2 points of data: in the period around 1985-1990 2.4 of Americans were on SSRIs. Around 2005-2008 it increased to 11.4%. The second data point I got was oddly from... Fox News, but it was based on a study sourced elsewhere so I am pretty certain it&#39;s not false data. &quot;About 6 percent of people were prescribed an antidepressant in 1996 — 13 million people. This rose to more than 10 percent or 27 million people by 2005, the researchers found.&quot; I found one other datapoint on another website, but don&#39;t recall where. In 2000, 6.9% were on SSRIs.
I crudely overlayed the data from the SSRI on the graph of school shootings (They used similar scales, so it was easy). I used the following numbers. The first column is year, second is school shootings per 100 million, third is percent on SSRIs. 1990 3.1 2.4 1996 5 5.2 2000 5 6.9 2005 6 10 2010 7.5 11.4
As stated, I got a .9672279 correlation - which is pretty damn strong. Of course, you can further ask &quot;Why are more Americans on SSRIs?&quot; and that may be the answer as to why there are more shootings. However, if you look at gun ownership in America - that&#39;s actually been on the decline. Therefore, I don&#39;t believe it has a single thing to do with guns.. <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/guns.png">http://themonkeycage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/guns.png</a>  Sure, that&#39;s the tool used - but are we to blame the invention of the saw for deforestation or do we blame the increase in the demand of wood due to human behavior? The fact Democrats (the party I &quot;side&quot; with) are using this to push gun control is exploitative, incorrect, and a distraction IMO. It&#39;s the same thing that Republicans did with Benghazi. Adam Lanza was only 20 and therefore WAS subject to gun control - he couldn&#39;t legally purchase firearms, but still got a hold of them. Further gun control wont do shit.
Another theory I&#39;ve seen floating around is based on the unemployment rate in males. <a href="http://socialevolutionforum.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/unemployment.png?w=594&amp;amp;h=419">http://socialevolutionforum.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/unemployment.png?w=594&amp;amp;h=419</a>  That seems to be pretty closely related, too.</p>

<p>Amphetamine = Speed</p>

<p><em>Amphetamine is frequently mentioned in the work of American journalist Hunter S. Thompson. Speed not only appears among the inventory of drugs Thompson consumed for what could broadly be defined as recreational purposes but also receives frequent, explicit mention as an essential component of his writing toolkit</em></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine</a></p>

<p><em>Methylphenidate (MPH) is an</em>  <strong>amphetamine-like</strong>  <em>prescription stimulant commonly used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children and adults. It is also one of the primary drugs used to treat symptoms of traumatic brain injury and the daytime drowsiness symptoms of narcolepsy and chronic fatigue syndrome. Brand names of drugs that contain methylphenidate include</em>  <strong>Ritalin® (Ritalina®, Rilatine®), Attenta®, Concerta® (a timed-release capsule), Metadate®, Methylin® and Rubifen®.</strong>  <em>Focalin® is a preparation containing only dextro-methylphenidate, rather than the usual racemic dextro- and laevo-methylphenidate mixture of other formulations.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you&#39;re referring to hunter s thompson as an example of speed done right, that&#39;s debatable as he had the good fortune to have a robust intellect and a passion for what he did. and being just crazy enough to thrive on the outside. living like hunter without having a driving purpose or will is likely to result in complete insanity. plus he offed himself so there&#39;s that.....</p>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<p>Hence, the fact that America uses 90 percent of world&#39;s Ritalin is alarming.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>True... but ALL school shooters were on psychotropic pills.  All of them.</p>

<p>And of course, next up is the famous cop-out - &quot;Correlation does not equal causation!&quot;.</p>
