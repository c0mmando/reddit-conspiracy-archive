       I'm looking for unbiased (not a conspiracy site), reputable, and legitimate sources on what shooters took SSRI anti-depressents. I think it would be very interesting to look at the number of murders/massacres that may be connected to these drugs.

       I have just stopped taking my SSRI's after a year on them. I started getting very irritable on them and I would snap like never before. I was always an easy going person until I started on ssri's. They can, and do, make people more violent and emotionally unstable. I am proof as is the hundreds of online posts I read of people having the same symptoms. The withdraws are so bad that a lot of people continue use just because they cant handle the withdraw effects. It took me 2 months to ween off of them.

       SSRI's are the kings choice for becoming cold and angry. I replaced lithium with cannabis and amphetamines (non-methylated amphetamine) and my emotions are slowly returning but now bolstered with a burning desire to help free everyone from chemical slavery pushed on us by self righteous psychiatric voodoo devils.

       Lithium replaced with cannabis and amp ironic right? Better than biting the barrel

       No shit people on antidepressants are going to do more of this, they are on antidepressants because they're depressed and have psychological problems. Just like people on antidepressants have a higher rate of suicide. Causation =/= correlation

       Very good that you stopped them; proud of you!
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing they don't tell you about SSRI/SSNRI drugs is the
       <em>
        discontinuation syndrome
       </em>
       --another word for
       <em>
        withdrawal
       </em>
       . This can be FAR worse than the drugs themselves. I went through it...off of paroxetine (Paxil) and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. It is VERY true that lots of people continue to take these drugs (and pump money into Big Pharma's pockets) because the withdrawals are just too terrifying to go through.
      </p>
      <p>
       SSRIs (used concomitally with benzodiazepines) are indeed a method of control at a very insidious level. I don't think anyone counted on the suicidal ideation they would cause...but when it was discovered it was covered up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Friends, this lady is absolutely correct: stay away from these drugs if at all possible

       No doubt they help people, but look at the cost.

      <p>
       Imipramine-based TCAs have been shown time and again to be far more effacious than SSRI/SSNRI meds and have a far lower danger profile.

       So why are they not used? Money. Most of these drugs are off-patent and do nothing for Big Pharma's bottom line.

       Those Anti-psychotics are products of the Gov controlled Pharma companies who only care about profits. Id you want a true anti-depressant, leave the city and go live in the country.

       you deserve an upvote - the countryside is better for the soul but if you want a true antidepressant, eliminate one percent of the bullshit which is constantly being forced upon you and smoke a joint :) Just one thing, the government doesnt control the pharma companies, the pharma companies control government! There are more pharaceutical lobbyists in washington than there are congressmen (citation needed I know, google it i guess :p) lobbying is a big business but when that fails, other, more expensive forms of control are brought into effect.

       Indeed, like how Hollywood and the RIAA is trying to lobby for copyright and piracy. It's sad, those people are psychopath with no soul. One day they will get what they deserve. I'm afraid when the dollar collapses (which is inevitable) and the congress cuts ppl's pensions and welfare. People with mental illness will lose their prescriptions and there really will be hell I don't understand why we allow a small group of people to control our lives. We need an American spring like Al-Gore suggested.

       I think we need a rational debate on this, and reddit is not delivering. Over 100 million people worldwide take anti-depressants on a regular basis, and SSRI's are almost certainly the most common type prescribed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now remind me, how many mass shootings are people looking to pin on SSRIs - ten? Which means the other 99.99999% (yes - 5 places of decimals) are NOT shooting up kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who has taken several types of SSRIs for many years (and has not developed the overwhelming desire to go on a shooting spree) I am very aware of the side-effects that can occur with these drugs (erectile dysfunction, apathy, withdrawal dizzyness etc) but they do what they are supposed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti-pyschotics are a slightly different kettle of fish. However, when a diagnosed psychotic does something crazy that gets in the papers, the rush to blame the drug they were taking and ignoring the fact they were suffering from a psychosis is not very helpful.

       Everyone is different. I was on SSRI's and it made me so numb to life... I was already an angry child, which is why they put me on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       My side-effects were much different than yours. So while you are right in your subjective case, I'm not sure you can speak for all people on SSRI's.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are trying to say mass shooting are the only thing that can happen on SSRI's.. it's not. Part of that national debate we need has to consider the amount of suicides, domestic violence issues, fights and murders happen from people on them.

       The problem is that people who are not depressed and who don't have anger management issues are not prescribed SSRIs, so we don't have much of a control group.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that people who are depressed are more likely to self-harm than other people, and those with anger-management issues are more likely become violent - and this is before they are prescribed SSRIs!
      </p>
      <p>
       It is difficult to demonstrate that SSRIs are more to blame than the underlying psychiatric condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need more information about these drugs, and it needs to come from independent medical laboratories and NOT from the pharma companies themselves because they only release research which suits their commercial interests.

       That's not a problem at all. People are prescribed many other

        violent inducing drugs
       </a>
       other than SSRI's.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you can look at the people who are depressed and/or have anger management issues that have never taken SSRI's. This is what we compare, since not everyone prescribed with SSRI's has taken them. People who are not on medications are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       more likely to harm other people. I need your source to confirm that, please.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is difficult to demonstrate that SSRI's are to blame, I agree. But it is something that needs to be considered, studied, researched, analyzed, investigated, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm completely with you that we need more info on the drugs, including what you and I have to say. Our experiences on them are extremely valuable, which is why we are passionate about making these arguments. While the SSRI's may or may not be the underlying cause of these tragedies, we'll never know if the pharmaceutical industry is in control.

       It's not the so much the fact that SSRI/SSNRI drugs have a pretty good safety profile; its more the fact that the great percentage of "spree shooters" are, coincidentally, under their influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at it this way; even though--say Valerian root--has a proven safety record what do you think would happen if more that a few spree shooters were found to be taking it in the days prior to their rampages?

      <p>
       You guessed it; instantaneous fucking banning and criminalization.

       All because it, proportionally, makes pharmaceutical companies zero money. True.

       What you are saying is true, but it doesn't negate the equation that most spree shooters have mental health issues, and the most commonly prescribed drugs for mental health issues are SSRIs. It would be surprising if a crazed shooter DIDN'T have a some history of taking SSRIs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't people considering the fact that perhaps SSRIs are often ineffective in managing mental health problems, rather than they make mental health conditions worse?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I don't have any agenda here. I just happen to think that on balance, SSRIs have almost certainly caused more lives to be saved than lost (through suicide and rampage killings). But I will change my mind if the data supports it - I am very amenable to evidence.

       Listen, I used to be in the pharma biz and I KNOW that you have a point--certainly SSRIs have saved far more lives than they have taken. My issue is with doctors writing for them like they're harmless. In fact, to most doctors they ARE harmless...many MDs are simply unaware of the risks when prescribing them. Its sad but very true.

       Agreed 100%. SSRIs are not a panacea. I am just suspicious when people try to link SSRIs to mass shootings, when the real impact of SSRIs is much more pervasive, insidious and much less discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Huxley's Brave New World, the populace were given a drug called soma to make them docile and compliant. There is a real parallel between that and the effect of SSRIs in the populations of the developed world. Yet some people want to detract attention from that with flashy red herrings about crazy shooters.
