It makes me sound like a &quot;nut&quot; who whips up these things for fun. People put all &quot;Conspiracy theorists&quot; in the same basket like we&#39;re all loonies. When someone evens mentions &quot;Conspiracy theorist&quot;, automatically most people think of you as a complete nutter.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen journalists ruined because they investigated a suspicious case(Such as Sandy Hook) and because they dug too deep and asked some intense questions they get branded a &quot;Conspiracy theorist&quot; which wrecks their career.</p>

<p>Anyone else find this problem?? What the hell do I call myself?? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calling anyone a nut just serves no positive purpose. Some people are more influenced by what they <em>want</em> to be true, and some others require too little evidence to believe something. They aren&#39;t crazy or stupid, they are just people. Both show the same signs of religious people, yet atheists are seen by the world as moralless satan worshipping heathens simply for thinking critically about religion. We (&quot;Conspiracy theorists&quot;) are called nuts and cooks and loonies for thinking critically about the rest of the world. Some of us get confused by what we want to believe (I have a friend who is a devout christian but into conspiracies and molds the 2 together, believing that Israel is the holy land and the victim in the middle east, along with other things, because if he didn&#39;t that would mess up his understanding of his religion), and others who believe everything they hear but just get their info from indie news (or they lose their ability to think critically after one too many conspiracies coming true or something). </p>

<p>Thinking you&#39;re better than anyone else has never positively benefitted humanity, and I don&#39;t foresee it starting any time soon. Instead of believing some one else is crazy or stupid, why not ask them why they believe what they believe. You&#39;d be surprised how much understanding both parties can receive from a mutually respectable dialogue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your definition of crazy and what evidence do you have to support that any of the things you have deemed crazy are in fact not based in evidence? And even <em>If</em> something here, or anywhere else, is not based in evidence, why does that make it crazy? And, why can&#39;t that same logic be applied to the billions of religious people around the world? If you&#39;re going to call someone crazy for believing in one &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; which stretches the evidence to come to a conclusion, shouldn&#39;t the people who run their lives on a multi-thousand year old book and believing something with almost zero credible evidence (and in many cases despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary) be institutionalized? Or do you think that it&#39;s okay to govern your life based on faith but for someone who governs their life fairly rationally but believes something that is not accepted by most, <em>then</em> they are crazy? If so, why? Please note, that I am going off your logic here. I don&#39;t believe that religious people are &quot;crazy&quot;, at least not abnormally; I think every last human on the earth is &quot;crazy&quot; to some extent. My issue arises in that you put others into the category of &quot;crazy&quot; but not yourself, and that you may call less-crazy things crazy but believe more-crazy things to be okay. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree with that.</p>

<p>However, if the the term conspiracy theorist is synonymous to critical thinking is synonymous to free thinking is synonymous to considering each piece of evidence with a degree of skepticism and integrity, then the types of people you are describing do not fit into my definition of a conspiracy theorist... then again, it <em>is</em> just a label.

    <div class="md"><p>The guy in 9/11 in Plane Sight talks about this term. It is used over and over again to assert that the conspiracy remains theory rather than factual. The label you deserve then depends I the information you present. If you are careful to include only verifiable info then the term theorist is less appropriate. But basically, just explain that it may be a theory but so is evolution. There is proof. It is just an uphill battle against dumbed down rhetoric for the masses. Ones that piss me off in particular are liberal / conservative labels. One holds onto these labels and thus is grouped into some stereotypes that curb rational discourse. </p>

<p>I need to point out something here.</p>

<p>The &quot;theorist&quot; part of &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is meant in the <em>colloquial</em> or every day sense of the word, not the <em>scientific</em> one. You aren&#39;t scientists.</p>

<p>Implying that the evidential backing for a 9/11 &quot;inside job&quot; is on an equal footing with the Theory of Evolution is just wholly inaccurate by any sense of proportional viewpoint. Sorry, but that&#39;s just how it is.</p>

<p>When the info is there to prove something beyond hypothesis then it is fact. Thus, if we ever speculate about 9/11 we are theorizing. The problem is that to mix fact with hypothesis is still somewhat theorizing, albeit a more likely true than not. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like that label because of the presumptions that go along with it then call yourself a historian and add some historical context.</p>

<p>Fortunately, with age sometimes comes wisdom. The end result of some of that wisdom would be to disconnect other people&#39;s labels with your own insight of yourself. And then pick and choose how you &quot;allow&quot; others to label you, in your estimation. And for your own peace of mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a person who randomed on by this subreddit, I&#39;ll leave my opinion in a good-natured fashion. I use the name &quot;Conspiracy Theorist&quot; because that&#39;s what many whom I&#39;ve talked to about &#39;marginal ideas&#39; (for lack of a more PC term) have been just that: theorists. </p>

<p>Many of the ideas you all espouse don&#39;t have wide-spread acceptance not (only) because the media doesn&#39;t portray it but because these are ideas that are connected by such disparate, unconnected, assumed, and made through Post Hoc arguments. You can call all the &#39;evidence&#39; dug up here or there in support of your ideas but the essence of logical reasoning is not that you draw conclusions from evidence but that evidence reveals the truth of the matter.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not a troll, just a guy with an outside perspective letting you know what we think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Conspiracy theories&quot; are not so &quot;feeble&quot; when governments around the world, and throughout history, have, provably, conducted false-flag operations towards achieving certain political and social objectives. What is &quot;feeble&quot; are the &quot;minds&quot; of those with such blind loyalty and faith in a government to not even question &quot;official&quot; stories, nor critically think for themselves, deferring their &quot;judgement&quot; to whatever propaganda the mass media is purveying. </p>

<p>Yes it should be changed to freetheorist</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;Conspiracy analyst&#39; 
I think this is the best alternative yet. &#39;Freethinker&#39; or &#39;Free-theorist&#39; seem a bit too broad and hippie flavored to be relevant. Although, i would predict any new phrase coined would just be pigeonholed in the same manner. </p>

<p>The problem with the term &#39;Conspiracy Theory&#39; is that it is grossly misunderstood by too many people. As the guy at the beginning of 9/11 in Plane Sight points out with his little word association exercise, &#39;conspiracy&#39; is automatically assumed with &#39;theory&#39; attached to it, as if the two words are synonymous.  </p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists, freethinkers, and truth seekers alike.., I&#39;m afraid the &#39;nutty&#39; stigma will remain as long as selectively ignorant people are the majority. Unless you enjoy wasting time and frustrating yourself, the only thing you can do is shrug them off and wait for them to come around on their own. That&#39;s not to say one shouldn&#39;t attempt to plant some seeds... </p>
