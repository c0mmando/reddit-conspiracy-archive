        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I contend that Julian Assange might be the victim of a character assassination campaign.  She is adamant that he is a dangerous rapist at large.  It&#39;s hard to have a conversation about these things, when I don&#39;t want to step all over her toes and come off like i&#39;m defending a known &quot;rapist&quot;.</p>

<p>Last conversation we had I told her about Bradley Manning and how he was the supposed informant for Wikileaks.  I told her about solitary confignment and warned her about the other dangerous and torturous methods the United States can apparently use against its enemies.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to make her understand how dangerous the United States can be...  CORRECT ME WHERE I&#39;M WRONG:</p>

<p>It&#39;s against the law for members of the UK to extradite a person to a country where they might be physically harmed or subjected to the death  penalty?</p>

<p>Julian Assange is not accused of rape in Sweden?</p>

<p>The United States has engaged in outright indiscriminate murder and torture against the people who it perceives are its enemies?</p>

<p>If the United States gets its hands on Julian Assange, he&#39;s in deep shit.  Would Sweden hand him over?  Is my defense of Assange justified?</p>

<p>And what about the actual intel that was leaked?  War crimes exposed for everyone to see... No wonder why there was a character assassination on Assange.  We&#39;re not supposed to be able to see real war reports.  CNN and FOX have that covered, thank you.</p>

<p>Anyway, apparently I&#39;m stuck in a position now where I&#39;ve gotta defend Assange on his rape allegations.  I don&#39;t want to defend him, because he strikes me wrong in some kind of primal nature... But I don&#39;t want anybody to be tortured or abused for these terribly inane &quot;wars&quot; we&#39;re supposedly fighting.</p>

<p>You recall the propaganda from Assange&#39;s defence team. There is no crime called &quot;Surprise sex&quot; in Sweden, and the rape accusation is about Julian Assange penetrating a woman while she was asleep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Manning is a whistle blower, Assange is a journalist. It is shameful that so many lemmings fail to see the US propaganda against these two truth bearers. Both serve such a vital role in steering humanity&#39;s GPS.</p>

<p>Manning, unfortunately, will not catch a break, but it is the price heros and game changers take. Assange should be insulated from any American bullying by the global community. I doubt humanity will muster the gonads to stand up for journalism&#39;s vital role in society. Voltaire has a quote about who is fair game for critique and who is not.</p>

<p>PS:  Assange contends he had consensual sex with the two women who are his accusers. </p>

<p>A government that does this can do anything: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States</a></p>

<p>Give this to her, you will no longer have any debate about how government can be dangerous or &quot;evil&quot;. Remember this article is for what happened INSIDE United States. It does not cover what happens in satellite states, like Pakistan, Iraq, Guatemala...</p>

<p>EDIT: Here are two small piece of what the article has to offer:</p>

<p>On the so sacred babies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1953, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) ran several studies on the health effects of radioactive iodine in newborns and pregnant women at the University of Iowa. In one study, researchers gave pregnant women from 100 to 200 microcuries (3.7 to 7.4 MBq) of iodine-131, in order to study the women&#39;s aborted embryos in an attempt to discover at what stage, and to what extent, radioactive iodine crosses the placental barrier. In another study, they gave 25 newborn babies (who were under 36 hours old and weighed from 5.5 to 8.5 pounds (2.5 to 3.9 kg)) iodine-131, either by oral administration or through an injection, so that they could measure the amount of iodine in their thyroid glands.[54]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the so sacred defenders of freedom:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From 1963 to 1969 as part of Project Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHAD), the U.S. Army performed tests which involved spraying several U.S. ships with various biological and chemical warfare agents, while thousands of U.S. military personnel were aboard the ships. The personnel were not notified of the tests, and were not given any protective clothing. Chemicals tested on the U.S. military personnel included the nerve gases VX and Sarin, toxic chemicals such as zinc cadmium sulfide and sulfur dioxide, and a variety of biological agents.[157]</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The rape accusation is about penetrating a woman while she was asleep. That&#39;s basically sex without consent, which is what rape is. Mind you, it would be sex without consent if wearing a condom was a condition attached to the consent too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They call it surprise sex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only if by &quot;they&quot;, you mean Assange&#39;s defence team. There is no crime by that name in Sweden. In fact, &quot;surprise sex&quot; is a euphemism for rape.</p>

<p>All this information is publicly available, and has been for ages, if you actually want to learn something. I gather you don&#39;t though.</p>

<p>BTW, there is no need to free Assange from Ecuador&#39;s embassy. He&#39;s there of his own free will.</p>

<p>No, if anything he&#39;s besieged. Fact remains though, that he&#39;s there voluntarily, so he does not need to be freed. The alternative to staying there would be to do the right thing and defend himself in a court (if it gets to that), so I&#39;m not holding my breath.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why not? Correa loves sticking it to the US, and the general population don&#39;t like them either, so I&#39;d say there&#39;s solid political reasons to do it.</p>

<p>Granted, I&#39;m no specialist in Ecuador&#39;s internal politics, but all I sad was that to me it seems like there&#39;s a good reason for doing it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I know this. I also know that about 40% of their exports are to the US because I did the numbers. This does not, however, prevent the general population (which is much larger then 100,000) from seemingly being very anti-American.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I was thinking the government/judiciary, which they seem to dislike, and which would be responsible for any extradition of Assange.</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t both be true?  It seems to me that he is but an actor in a play.  Also that he resembles Zbignniew Brzezinski, and not only slightly.  Is he his son?</p>

<p>Because the word &quot;rapist&quot; implies the sex was nonconsensual</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which according to the accusation it was. Or can sleeping people give consent now?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and afaik, there has never been a charge of nonconsensual sex. Rather, a charge of not having worn a condom during mutually consensual sex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, the accusation you&#39;re describing is one of the two sexual assault accusations, not the one classified as rape. Secondly, it&#39;s still sex without consent if the conditions for the consent are not fulfilled. Thirdly, he is not charged for anything, and will never be in the English sense of the word. There are, apparently, different legal systems out there that does things differently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s subjective.   to some people he&#39;s deemed a rapist for having sex unprotected without consent of his partner - and of course he is being demonized.</p>

<p>the Brzezinski observation is simply that, an observation.  You didn&#39;t have to draw any conclusions from it, but you did.  I find that revealing.</p>
