    <div class="md"><p>I agree. But the term drugs is used too loosely. Everyone says, &#39;<strong>Don&#39;t do drugs!</strong>&#39; yet everyone goes to their local drug store to pick up medications.</p>

<p>Pharmaceuticals have been a major backlash in our country.. causing not only the outbreak of cancers, but <a href="http://www.schizophrenia.com/szfacts.htm">schizophrenia</a> as well. Granted, this is my opinion, but if you look at cancer before pharmaceuticals, then you&#39;d see a huge rise. People have always used natural drugs.. they have been around for thousands of years... nature isn&#39;t the problem.. man trying to outsmart nature is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh indeed. I&#39;d hate to sound as if my answer was the only answer. Your point is strong and I hear it well. When I think of pharms that do the most damage, I think of the ones that alter the mind. When I think of cancers, and the ones that come to mind when I talk about this, is the ones that are rare and uncommon.</p>

<p>Again, not saying that I&#39;m right, but have you considered that using humans as guinea pigs can have potential side effects?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you need to read up more on what it takes to become a certified for human use drug before you make the guinea pig comment.  It averages like $4 billion in testing costs.  Thats why none of the big pharm companies will release unpatientable stuff.  Because they would start out $4 billion in the whole after testing and then their competitor could release it for much cheaper since it doesn&#39;t need to recover that expense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understand the point I&#39;m making. I know tests are done on medicines before they become legal, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying. But the research is done over a ten year time period, not hundreds or thousands of years. Once the medicines past the initial tests, it&#39;s not like they continue to test them in a lab, they are released to the masses at that point.. we then become part of that hundred year research.</p>

<p>Do you know any pharmaceuticals out there that say, &#39;Zero side effects?&#39; Even with all the research or whatever is considered &#39;certified&#39; it&#39;s all based on a very short time span of knowledge of altering the natural chemical states in our bodies. Some of those side effects can be very long term and go unnoticed for quite some time. I&#39;m just saying, if you do enough research on the amount of money a single medicine can make, the testing costs don&#39;t mean a single thing. All that is going to encourage is people entering the pharmaceutical industry for the wrong reasons. I&#39;m not saying drugs are bad.. I&#39;m saying that people are not educated about what they put in their bodies. People don&#39;t question their doctors when they are prescribed medicines, they just take the medicine or give them to their children.</p>

<p>Individuals are the ones committing crimes, not the gun culture or NRA or our government. So why not do more studies on what is making those individuals do these things? Should medicine and medical histories not be part of the discussion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you want all medicines to undergo hundreds of years of testing before they go public?  You seriously don&#39;t want any medicine do you?</p>

<p>I get what you&#39;re saying I just think you&#39;re point is stupid and unworkable.  Tell all those sick people that we have the meds we just have to wait another 90 years for the trials to complete.</p>

<p>If it has nothing to do with the gun culture than why aren&#39;t the problems the same in other countries without a gun culture like the US?  That is the one major difference between the US and most western first world countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have to be so dramatic? I&#39;m not saying that I don&#39;t want any medicines.. just like I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t want any guns.</p>

<p>There is a middle ground that you fail to recognize, not all things have to be one extreme or the other. Sick people is one thing and medicines that have been recognized as beneficial should be used. My point is directed at pharmaceuticals that change the way people think. Chemicals that alter brain chemistry and have been known to have very powerful negative side effects. Yes.. I think someone with depression, anxiety, etc should battle it naturally instead of popping a pill that messes with brain chemistry. Much more research should be done on brain chemical altering medicines.</p>

<p>Why is it a joke that anti-depressants can cause a side effect of suicide? Sounds pretty harsh, right? Is something not being recognized or being talked about when a medication being used to treat one thing has the very same side effect? The point I was making is that medical history should coincide with guns, possibly.</p>

<p>For instance, if buying a gun released your medical history to local police departments, do you think we could recognize people who might be more of a danger? Do you think it might deter someone who is on anxiety, anti-depressants, etc from purchasing a gun if it released that information?</p>

<p>Every single one of these mass shootings was from someone on medications altering their brains. Please... I&#39;m not trying to argue with you, I&#39;m trying to make you think a little.

<p>I don&#39;t know why you are fighting this so much, but it could be a good thing. Maybe we should be asking what medicines did the professionals prescribe?</p>

<p>Here are the <a href="http://ejfi.org/PDF/Top10_violence-inducing_drugs.pdf">Violent-Inducing drugs</a> that are known.</p>

<p>So, do you really not think medicines are a problem? Should we move on and just make more strict gun laws?</p>

<p>No I don&#39;t.  I think misuse of medicines by patients including going off meds when you shouldn&#39;t(which is a huge one for people with BPD).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen nighthawk1961. This is not the time for unfounded conspiracy theories. The problem we face right now is that the government is trying to take away our gun rights and the media is pushing their agenda for them.

    <div class="md"><p>Nighthawk1961 has an opinion and so do you. If you both were to logically talk about the problem, you&#39;d have a lot more here than two people bitching back and forth.</p>

<p>How about a logical discussion?</p>

<p>You are right about gun studies, it&#39;s something that should be focused on, but nighthawk1961 is also right about drugs. Pharmaceuticals have impacted our country hard! We have more schizophrenia in america than anywhere else. Can you say that Adam Lanza was schizo? Probably if on his xanga page he says he&#39;s bi-polar. Would the media be able to look at his medical history and see what drugs he&#39;s been on? Can they use that to form a study to find out if certain chemicals actually make certain people go crazy? Sure.</p>

<p>You are both right.. there is no wrongs and if people would quit being on the defensive all the time and force some intelligent dialogue down eachothers throats, then maybe we&#39;d make some progress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree that pharmaceuticals are a huge problem, no argument there. My problem is when people say they don&#39;t care about an important issue, and choose to focus on stuff that really doesn&#39;t have much evidence backing it....like that the government is responsible for sandy. Right now the issue at hand is guns, pharmaceuticals and what effect they had on Adam may come into play here as well, but the important thing right now is demonstrating that less guns does not equal less crime. There is no evidence for that. </p>

<p>I know I need to be more patient and less cynical, but it&#39;s tough. I should try to explain my position further and in more detail. I hate to say this but I feel like I&#39;ve been debating shills all day on this topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, I feel the same way. I think the shills have made us turn against eachother.. that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying we need to collaborate.</p>

<p>If we can analyze both arguments and find out how they connect, then it&#39;s reasonable to say that they are linked. I don&#39;t have a gun or like guns, so that&#39;s why I don&#39;t think I should talk much about the issue. Why the fuck should I have any say in guns, if I don&#39;t know much about the issue.</p>

<p>The issue I do know about is pharms. They prescribed them to me when I was a kid and I lost all feeling and felt like a suicidal teen. I got off them when I lost a family member and had no sadness. As life moves on without them, I am much more stable without them. Had I had a gun when I was on anti-depressants, then who knows if I would have killed myself.</p>

<p>Different people have different rationales and that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to say. Gun owners need to look at the pharm statistics and see what has happened in regards to violence and in regards to anti-depressants, anti-anxiety and any medication that alters the brain.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t own any guns either, but I feel like I can recognize when the government is cracking down on our rights, and I feel like that&#39;s what is being attempted. And if successful we really won&#39;t have the means of defending ourselves should they become overbearingly tyrannical </p>

<p>All we really need to know is: 1) the burden of proof lies on the one who&#39;s making the claims that more guns equals more homicide. There is no solid evidence backing this claim. and 2) the second amendment states: A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.</p>

<p>A militia as defined by 1770&#39;s dictionary exists separate from the state. In order for a militia to be regulated enough to maintain the security of a free state, the militia must have access to tools as close to equal magnitude as the opposition. </p>

<p>As for the pharmaceutical problem, I too was prescribed pharms from adderall to depakote to klonopin to wellbutrin -- and I stopped for the same reason. They may indeed cause some people to go insane...we don&#39;t really know for sure. Definitely worth looking into. I fucking hate big pharma. I would speculate that messing with brain chemicals for long periods of time can&#39;t be healthy. The thing is, everyone reacts differently and pharms really help some people. Some people are so handicapped that they can&#39;t function without them. If anything, I would say pharms are more of an issue than guns, but that&#39;s not what is in the spotlight right now.</p>

<p>USA own most of the world patents (intellectual property) 
even if the shit is made in China, they pay you to use the technology</p>

<p>Also USA export a lot of culture, food, weapons, wood, stone, iron, fertilizers and is a big money lender ( most of the oil trade is made in US dollars, we can easyly figure out that the Irakis have to buy US Dollars in order to use their own oil. There is also tourism who is a big money maker. Even, myself, like to go spend some hard earned money in US territory. </p>

<p>Also there is a international scam about war on drugs who bring a lot of money. It goes like this: </p>

<p>First some country make some drugs and sells it in the street of America. The money go abroad right? After a while USA use international pressure to urge the drug production country to get into the war on drug.  Good news is USA already have lots of technological solution to help the war on drug: weapons, intel, private groups, etc.
Then the money come back to US because all the drug are delt in US money so are the weapons....</p>

<p>If the person wasn&#39;t committing murder to start with then how it is done is of no consequence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it does matter.  Look at that guy that shot up that car full of kids the other week because they were playing music too loud.  Do you honestly believe he would have went over there with a knife and tried to stab them?  No, the gun gave him the power to exert himself and he did.  </p>

<p>So the culture built around guns is more blood thirsty and prone to shooting?  And thats not the guns fault?  People in all those countries I mentioned have guns and in Canada at least a lot of them.  It&#39;s the type of guns they have and the ability to access them that matters.</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying you need to defend your gun heavy culture while at the same time saying it&#39;s that same culture that causes the problems.  Also it&#39;s not the drugs that are the problem as much as you want to believe they are.  It&#39;s usually people going off their meds.  Go downtown and walk around a less good area.  Half the homeless people will have a mental condition and you can see the full effect of it due to their inability to get meds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what it is for most people with guns for &quot;self-defence&quot; or offence.  And that is why they are so much more likely to commit serious acts of violence with them and that is why it IS the guns fault these things happen.  It is also the persons fault don&#39;t get me wrong but the gun has some blame as an enabler.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A gun is a force multiplier of a huge degree.  A hammer isn&#39;t. And that is why they aren&#39;t comparable as weapons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because Canadians don&#39;t have the &quot;shoot first and ask questions later&quot; mentality. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it&#39;s much harder to get small arms in Canada, law requires them to be better secured in homes(fewer thefts).</p>

<p>The mentality comes from the belief that you need the hardware to defend yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the period between 1850 - 1910 (&quot;Old West&quot;) everybody had a gun. How many people were shot and killed in any one year in any town ? 5. Just 5</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What town are you talking about exactly?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because people of today are blood thirsty violent creatures who think a gun in hand gives you the world by the balls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re contradicting yourself here.  It&#39;s not the gun but the access to the gun thats the problem?  Thats exactly what I&#39;m saying.  Guns give people that mentality and that is why they are a problem and need to be heavily regulated.</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying the exact same thing I am only your solution is to do nothing.  Mine is to remove the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which of these drugs do you think being wrongly prescribed would make you more mentally instable?  Do you have anything to back that up with besides your claims and the claims of people that aren&#39;t in the medical field?  Almost all of the drugs prescribed for these types of mental issues are mood stabilizers. </p>

<p>But thats exactly what you did above when you blindly accepted one blogs assertion that the police want to arrest anyone who questions the story.</p>
