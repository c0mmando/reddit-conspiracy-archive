    <div class="md"><p>I found <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/christian-identity/the-christian-identity-movement">this paper on the Christian Identity movement</a>, essentially they hold a view that they are at war with Jews and non-whites:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus Identity racial doctrine, positing Adam as the progenitor only of whites, was linked to the anti-Semitic two-seedline theology. Together, they envisioned an apocalyptic struggle between whites on one side and, on the other, Jews together with their nonwhite allies. The end-time struggle was thus in the broadest sense associated with a racial millennium, for Identity’s perfect future would be a world free of Jews with nonwhites in perpetual subordination and servitude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder why <em>Jews For The Preservation of Firearms Ownership</em> haven&#39;t been fighting to get their views into the recent media frenzy on this topic?</p>

<p>You would at least think they would be all over CNN&#39;s Piers Morgan for calling for the U.S. Government to actually confiscate American&#39;s guns. Yet they have been completely silent on the topic.</p>

<p>I wonder why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NRA is a useful tool giving gun owners the illusion of being a fierce defender of the 2nd Amendment.</p>

<p>The JPFO doesn&#39;t equivocate and is at odds with the Zionists and not as well funded or as well known as the NRA. </p>

<p>So, in short, the very articulate JPFO is shut out but not being attacked publicly because Zionists have made &quot;Jew&quot; out to be a shield against criticism in most of the mainstream media.</p>

<p>Take the ADL:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The JPFO has been highly critical of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). In pamphlets such &quot;Why Does the ADL Support Nazi-Based Laws?&quot; and &quot;JPFO Facts vs. ADL Lies,&quot; the JPFO has accused the ADL of undermining the welfare of the Jewish people.</p>

<p>In response, Abraham Foxman, National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, wrote about the JPFO, &quot;Anti-Semitism has a long and painful history, and the linkage to gun control is a tactic by Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership to manipulate the fear of anti-Semitism toward their own end... It is a campaign that has been viewed with concern by many in the Jewish community.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>...manipulate the fear of anti-Semitism toward their own end.</em> That is so very ironic coming from the ADL.</p>
