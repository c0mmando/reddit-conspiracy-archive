       As many of you may know our president has Cancer. Like a half a year ago he speak to the people in order to make public he's condition. He start receiving treatment in Cuba for a long time. Before the presidential elections that occur in October 7th, the government leaders made us to believe that he was all cure. Just after he won the elections, he said that he wasn't cure at all and need some new treatment in Cuba (By the way, we NEVER have seen or hear an accurate medical report from one of the doctors leading the treatment). He leave the country around mid November to receive a new treatment, before he leave he said that "If anything goes wrong and he died or something like that, he announced the Vice-president Nicolas Maduro as the successor of the Bolivarian Revolution, and asked for the people to vote for him in a coming elections". Since that time we haven't seen him or hear him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every two or one time per week the vice-president read a very small speech regarding Chavez condition at the moment, again no medical report or something like that, just words like "he's ok, he's stable, he can speak and bla bla bla". At this point everything is so wrong, the Venezuelan people deserves to  every detail of the condition of the president of the republic, I mean he's the fucking president.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing went worse when the information was diminishing or just start to get very rare and weird, a couple times Maduro and few government ministers, said things like "Chavez is walking, and jogging" (wtf dude he just got a fucking surgery) and then some free lance journalist like
       <a href="http://runrun.es">
        Nelson Bocaranda
       </a>
       started leaking medical information about Chavez condition (they've done this for a very long time with different topics, and for some reason they were always right, I mean this guys have some good sources), this leaked medical information had some details about Chavez condition including that he was very very bad at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for making this thing short, right now we don't know anything. There's a lot of rumors that Chavez is dead or he's dying. All the public parties and holiday feast to celebrate the new years eve yesterday got cancelled, even those parties organized by oppositions mayors an governors. Government leaders only say things like "He's ok, don't believe in rumors", but again no medical reports or at least a pictures or something like that. The only information that we receive is from the journalists I mention before, and we don't know if we should believe it or not, there is a lot of rumors going on right know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now comes the best part of all, Maduro was elected as a possible successor leader because his close connection with the Cuban leaders. So right now Venezuela is being controlled directly from Cuba, they said what the Venezuelan people should know and what we shouldn't and soon if Chavez dies, the control is gonna be worse!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR: Our president could be dead right now and we don't know. We're being ruled directly from Cuba.
       </strong>

       No evidence, but it all seems off to me. It wouldn't surprise me if it was one of those programs the government has to sway opinions in forums and such. It falls into our government's stance on Venezuela and Cuba and how they are dictatorships and whatnot.

       If I understand correctly Chavez is quite popular in Venezuela, even so much as he does right by the country and he's pretty beloved by his people. Maybe, just maybe, it's not a conspiracy but instead the Government doesn't want to induce panic. I feel it's the same thing about Hillary, a lot of people in America really like her, especially New Yorkers, they want her to run in 2016, but despite privacy policies hospitals have people tend to panic when they hear of people they support, love, etc could die, or got hurt, and so on. JFK, MLK, when Reagan got shot, the ex pope, MJ's death, Tupac's death, Biggie's death, Billy Mayes even, everyone kinda panicked over it. Because the people loved them. It's not unlikely for a Government to not give many details about these things when it can cause panic, panic is never good despite if the people deserve to know (which I agree with, they should know.) Also, maybe they don't want to say he's dying, or that he's dead until they know for sure. Some cancer patients after receiving treatment can recover quickly and start doing normal things, even if the cancer is still there, they won't get weak and frail from it until it's like a month or so before their predicted time of death. I know this from experiencing this, a couple of people in my family including a few of my mom's friends all have had cancer. Chances are you aren't being controlled by Cuba, but by the Vice President who is receiving orders from Chavez in Cuba. I don't know why everything has to be a cover up, not everything is a conspiracy.

       Ok you're right in one thing, he's very popular. But man, he's the president, we just elected once again, our constitution said that clearly that in case of absence there's a lot of protocols that right now are being omitted.
      </p>
      <p>
       About the Cuba control thing, ok dude I live here, in our hospitals we have Cuban medics, our armies generals are talking with Cuban accent , many of our state building have Castros pictures, Cuban flags, Martis pictures and of course Ches pictures when sometimes they omitted a Miranda picture or simply a Miranda flag. I know that not everything is a conspiracy but something is really fucked up here. Why they don't just say the truth if he's dying there's 8 million people that voted for him that deserves to know, and 6.5 million that voted against him, of course me including, that deserves to know.

       And finally American middle class white people being victims? Didn't get that. I'm not an American middle class white people, and I've 2 dead cousin by thugs (who are free in the streets), a uncle in jail (Used to work in PDVSA) for crimes that he didn't committed and I've being victims of robbery 3 times in 2012.

       American middle class are the true victims because they're the ones that don't see what's going on. While the rich know everything, and are basically behind it all through corporate funds and politics, and the poor don't care enough to know or follow. The American middle class are the only ones who can revolt and stop the international abuse the superpower which is the United States has been taking advantage of. My government wants to take down your leader at the expense of the middle class American tax dollar. It's just not defined down to just white people, every race that's within the American middle class are victims to the American war machine because our money funds the tyranny and we're all forced to do so. Right now my girlfriend is working to pay taxes which are going to the military to pay for bombs being dropped on Pakistani children by drones and she doesn't even know it, the American middle class are just victims of something more twisted and psychological compared to the rest of the world who are victims of physical oppression. Exactly why I resort to selling weed, I don't pay taxes so none of my money gets dirty with the blood of the citizens who happen to live in the Third world countries America is currently exploiting for natural resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back on topic now:
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like your country honors Castro as a revolutionary leader who resisted American control seeing how your government is Anti American. Your government possibly could look into Cuba's for political insight, if I understand correctly Cuba and your country are very close allies. And why don't they just tell the truth about him dying? Maybe they don't know for sure if he is or not, and like I said they don't want to release that until they know for sure, so to reduce panic they instead tell everyone they're fine. It's different in Hillary's case, because she actually is fine. Sometimes details don't really matter, like what kinda treatment he went through exactly, every aspect of his recovery process, there is a thing called patient confidentiality and it applies to everyone political leader, celebrity, even the average citizen or criminal (at least until after the criminal's recovery) is entitled to this and it's a universal unwritten law that all doctors follow through out the world. I think it's safe to say when it comes to your leader's medical controversy there isn't some sort of brilliant elaborate conspiracy going on behind it.

       Sometime I got the feeling that some Americans (and many people from the first world) see Cuba as a role model to fight the American control and stuff, but you lacked to see the real problems that the Cubans and now the Venezuelan people have. Yes we have a democratic system but right know is very very very damaged, we just abandon the DDHH Organization, there is a lot of political prisoners, that are in jail just for not be with the revolution. Dude not everything is black and white, just because somebody stand against the American control doesn't make him a hero.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm against the American control, in fact we lived in the past years before Chavez, the American and British companies doing what ever they wanted with our oil, and the Venezuelan presidents just shot the mouth out, but now we exchange it for a Cuban control instead?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust me it is not only country honors, it goes so much beyond that. And if by close allies you mean we give them almost free oil so they can re-sell it to the Chinese to a much high price, and we don't get anything of it, then yes we're political allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as you said before, in your country the rich know everything, the poor just don't care, and the middle class is the one paying the price, well is the same thing here, the rich know everything but they're very secure as long they don't get in Chavez way, so they don't even care, the poor people they don't know anything and don't care of anything as long there's food in the table (and they're sadly the 60% of the Venezuelan population), and the middle class they know whats going on and they care about it, in fact almost 90% of the middle class is oppositions votes.

       I don't think a lot of people in America really think about Cuba or Venezuela. We got way more problems than what Cuba or Venezuela does. I believe most people here know that things aren't right in either country. I definitely know that things are not right in either country. If Cuba is such a great place, then why do people each and every year risk their lives sometimes with their children on poorly made rafts in order to reach America? Something ain't right there and things are definitely not right in America especially after all of this fiscal cliff nonsense.

First of all let us be clear about this question, we are not talking here about people who are persecuted because of their political views, but about politicians who broke the law and are either in jail or (the majority of them) have fled the country to escape justice.

       Judge Afiuni released Cedeno on conditional bail--and thus able to flee the country, which he did--in an unannounced hearing of which state prosecutors were neither notified or invited to attend. While the President should not have commented on this case, he was right to point out that Afiuni violated juridical practices and helped a criminal banker become a fugitive from justice.

        Now comes the best part of all, Maduro was elected as a possible successor leader because his close connection with the Cuban leaders.

       Your country is

        not being controlled from or by Cuba

       . Your country is under the jurisdiction of your federal government. if Chavez dies, Maduro will apparently become your new president. Maduro works for your country, not Cuba. Alliances and freetrade with another nation is one thing, usurping complete control is a whole other game.

       The fact that Chavez is a good president or not is not the topic in discussion here, even tough I'm not a "Chavista", I do recognize Chavez work, but we can talk that in other time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, if Chavez dies, we have elections, and Maduro will be PSUV (Venezuelan Unified Socialist Party) candidate (I don't know who'll be the oppositions candidate, but I guess he's going to lose any way), that's what I meant of successor, we're not DPRK. And by the way, Maduro is by far the least charismatic person in the government, is not the famous one, he never won a election to a public office. On the other hand we've Cabello, once governor of Miranda state, actual president of the Congress, a military comrade of Chavez when he made the coups back in 92, but it is public his rejection to the Cuban system, so no a candidate.

       Because of all the Venezuelans I've spoken, to, only those well off who make a lot of money have anything bad to say about Chavez.

      <p>
       I am sure that Cuba does not run your country. Your country is its own country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as I am sure that France does not run Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you haven't provided evidence to support your idea. The only thing you've provided is a
       <em>
        claim
       </em>
       that you are Venezuelan. You basically claim that Cuba is running your country because your countries leader is in Cuba getting healthcare and your countries vice-minister has "close ties" to Cuba.

      <p>
       Canada has close ties to Cuba too. We communicate with them diplomatically on a regular basis, we have friends there, and we openly vacation there. We have open trade with Cuba as well, allowing private businesses to trade back and forth between our countries. Cuban cigars are a big hit in Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Cuba does not run Canada just because of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I seriously doubt Cuba is actually running your country in any direct fashion. And if they did walk in one day and decide to take over, I'm pretty sure your military would not take kindly to that, neither would your people.

       Yes I do vacation in FL because part of my family emigrate there, but I didn't and I wont, and if I want to see their faces I've to go there, because they can't enter to Vzla. I live here in Caracas. I've 25 years old, and a acceptable work as software developer, thanks to my dad that pay half of my university and I manage to paid the other half. I don't think US is the greatest country. The other part of my family came from left thinking (two uncles where exiled by the AD governments, for fighting against neon-liberals laws), the first time y voted, y voted for Chavez, just like much of my family and friends. As I said before, Just because someone fight the American control, it is not a Hero. I know that not all the cuban things or sinister, In fact I do admire some of the Ches, Camilo and Marti work and the way of thinking, but what I can really stand is what happening right know, as I said before Cuban flags in our government buildings, we're giving away to them free oil and receiving just the thanks. It's very not cool from you dude to said the thing you said about somebody you don't even know.

       Are there any Venezuelan doctors out of work today? If not, then yes, there was a deficit of medical care where the poor needed it most.

       We agree that all doctors are busy in Venezuela today.

       So if there was no deficit before 10,000 Cuban doctors arrived, you must be claiming that 10,000 Venezuelan doctors have left the country.

       I cannot believe you said that! Just because you (someone from the middle class) never had any trouble finding a doctor when you needed one doesn't mean there weren't other people (with less resources)--millions of them--who didn't have access to quality medical care!

       We have free higher education, but also payed education. For example in Caracas there is 5 big and important universities (when I say important, I mean with high academic rating), two of them are free and the rest payed. In my case only one of the free offers my degree and for a few personals reason I didn't went there. But the payed education isn't that expensive like some first world countries. In my case, my university offered me a few helps and scholarships to pay. It really isn't a big deal like the student debt in US and stuff like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       About the academic difference between the payed and the free, there's not that much, some degrees are better in the payed ones some are better in the free ones. Some free universities sucks, some payed universities sucks, is very relative.

       Yes I'm a part of the middle class. Just like 90% of the opposition votes, and that's simply because we know we deserve better. But as I said before this is not the topic in discussion here, if you want we can do it elsewhere.

       And as for the sources, everything is based on the things we live here day by day and things we know for the few free-lances journalist how remain separates from the government, many of them are just a bunch of stupid liars, but other have been giving away some serious and accurate information. If you want it to believe me or not, is your problem, I wont care anyway.

      <p>
       The constitution clearly distinguishes between 'temporary' and 'permanent' absences, and says that it is up to the National Assembly to decides which is the case with President Chavez.
      </p>
      <p>
       If 'temporary', presidential powers may be transferred to VP for up to 90 days (but renewable by NA). If it is deemed a 'permanent' absence, then a new presidential election will be called.

       It doesn't seem strange to me that the NA would wait to see the outcome of Chavez's surgery.

       No, the oil is that cheaper because the government covers the expenses, you can say is subsidized by the government. When we pay for oil, we only pay the transportation and the service to the pumping stations.

       I recall that when President Reagan was shot we were told it was minor and the Vice President did not take over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much later we found out how serious Reagan's wound really was.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it comes out of the mouth of the President's press secretary then it either spin or an outright lie.

      <p>
       Latin American Leaders with Cancer in the past few years:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Brazil's Ex-President: Luiz Inacio "Lula" da Silva
       </li>
       <li>
        Brazil's Ex-Vice President: José Alencar (Deceased)
       </li>
       <li>
        Brazil's President: Dilma Rousseff
       </li>
       <li>
        Argentina's President: Cristina Kirchner
       </li>
       <li>
        Paraguay's President: Fernando Lugo
       </li>
       <li>
        Venezuela's President: Hugo Chavez
       </li>
       <li>
        Colombia's Ex-President: Álvaro Uribe (I'm not sure if it was confirmed to be skin cancer)
       </li>
       <li>
        Colombia's President: Juan Manuel Santos
       </li>
       <li>
        Cuba's Ex-President: Fidel Castro (Not confirmed, but probably had)
       </li>
       <li>
        Peru's Ex-President: Alberto Fujimori
       </li>
      </ul>

       There are probably more that I can't remember right now.
