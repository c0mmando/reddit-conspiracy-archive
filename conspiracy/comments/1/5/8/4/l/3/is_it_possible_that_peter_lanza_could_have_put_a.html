        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In 2010, Nancy Lanza was to receive $240,000 for the year. In 2011, alimony increased to $265,000, followed by $289,800 in 2012. By 2015, the amount was to be $298,800. From 2016 to 2023, it was to be adjusted annually for cost of living, then it was to be modified after Peter Lanza retired.</p>

<p>In 2009, Nancy Lanza reported no income, while Peter Lanza reported $8,556 a week, or $444,912 gross annual income.</p>

<p>444,912</p>

<p>5% CT Tax
35% Federal Income Tax
5.85 Medicare SS</p>

<p>45.85% tax</p>

Paid 203992.15 in taxes</p>

<p>So, literally every dime he made went to his ex wife?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this clear. Peter Lanza ordered a hit on his ex-wife in order to get out of paying her alimony. But he also ordered a hit on the local elementary school as a means of justifying gun control? Does that mean Peter Lanza is secretly working for the government?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I think it&#39;s more sinister like..</p>

<p>He could have been tied to the Libor case somehow, and as a bribe, they promised to make the alimony payments disappear, but the only way to do that is if she&#39;s dead. </p>

<p>Hence the reason she had purchased guns maybe, to protect herself? I&#39;m going with the angle that Nancy and Adam had a very close relationship and she fought hard to keep adam. Why would she fight for custody in the divorce if she was intimidated by him?? If Nancy was afraid of Adam, why wouldn&#39;t she have just let Peter take him?</p>

<p>I also asked how child support is taken out on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1585fc/child_support_paying_parents_of_reddit_do_you_pay/">askreddit</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s not a deductible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No apology is necessary. It&#39;s simply a bit of advice. If you back up your premise with easily verifiable facts, then it&#39;s that much easier to move forward with a strong argument, instead of spending time answering questions like &quot;Where did these numbers come from?&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The link mentioned (<a href="http://w116fan.xanga.com/profile/">http://w116fan.xanga.com/profile/</a>) has a number of unreported facts worth reading: About five years ago, when he was arrested as a threat, stemming from having a knife at school, pills, and having notebooks with writing about another school shooting! Also, his father declaring that he was going upstairs to shoot the _______. The father complaining about not getting his bonus, which was 1/3 of their income; In addition, the father complaining about the cost of food. Mind you, they were wealthy (I would like to know more about the company situation and his finances after the scandal). I was most bothered by the sealing of his arrest record, diversionary sentence and how his mother would call to get him out of therapy. I mean, how can the father issue a statement that he is &quot;shocked&quot; when he was predicting his five years ago? Why are the Newtown families not privy to the preventable, predictable nature of this tragedy. To me, this smacks of privileged people who were able to circumvent the justice system with a good attorney. This needs to come out. Also, the financial pressures that are brought up above are detailed here with the father yelling at the mother that she doesn&#39;t bring in a paycheck (during the marriage). Is his new wife working? I mean, his wife was home with a troubled kid that she knew couldn&#39;t be left alone, from what the babysitter said, she told him not to leave him alone to use the bathroom. </p>

<p>Also, what about all the journal entries where he said he got angry and scared a girl he was seeing. Or when a girl would drop out of school or treatment without saying goodbye and he had given her his number in a book. There were so many people who died young (suicide? murder?), threw up in a car with him (poison? Is that why you could not turn your back on him?), disappeared without a word -- I think there may have been threats at least to some of these people and they dropped out to get away from him. I wonder if there were more signs/crimes than what is being reported as a &quot;kid with no record.&quot; If he admits being diagnosed as bi-polar, why is the media still saying he has a type of autism? The mediator for the divorce totally whitewashed this, saying &quot;[the parents] both said what can we do for him?/ he can&#39;t be alone/ he has Asperger&quot;. Another serious downplaying of the threatening, violent behavior that could have been stopped long before losing these children and teachers died. Why not let the police to the jobs they are there to do and stop excusing the issues and manipulating the system and issuing statements that you are &quot;shocked&quot; when an honest appraisal would be &quot;we didn&#39;t know what to do with him and we wanted him to have a college education and normal future without a record&quot;? You can&#39;t have it both ways. Either let him get treatment for years of inpatient intervention or take responsibility that you denied the problem was real and ran away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anyone is interested in gaining some insight into Adam Lanza&#39;s upbringing, please visit w116fan on Xanga.  Under his pseudonym Ryan Lanser, he writes personal anguished accounts of dealing with the school programs, his parental relationships and his continued deep despair regarding being alone and misunderstood by the world.  His dreams of being emancipated from his parents are obvious, as well as his quest for some meaning in his reality.  In the website godlike productions, someone from Norway recommended this site.  Because of the time stamps on all weblog entries, I believe his personal testimonials to be legitimate.  Please read them before the government shuts this access down.</p>
