       Different Researcher/Whistleblower like Fritz Springmeier,Bill Schnoebelen,William Cooper,"Svali" (Whistleblower Name) etc
are confirming that the "Illuminati" exist and controls the secret societys and goverment.

       The original Illuminati was the

       founded by Adam Weishaupt.

      <p>
       I don't think so.

      <p>
       Its clear that the CIA is more powerful than the President in charge but the CIA isn't the "the root of all evil" where the decisions are made.

       You should probably spend some time with friends and loved ones(that aren't involved in the crime committed, of course) or at least find some one to talk to at a mental health facility if things get too rough. If money is a problem, check to see if any offer free crisis counseling or offer a sliding payment scale.

       As far as I know, none of the prayers are to a king. They're not to M-L-C-H. They are to yod-hay-vav-hay. Or YHVH. He is never just addressed as just king. That immediate fact proves you're just trying to spread disinformation and promote further racism. 
Also, there is Kabbalah. It could be possible that's what you mean. Kabbalah is Jewish mysticism and is a direct violation of Torah. I assure you, any magic or satanic rituals are that and not accepted by the main group of Jewish believers.

       <em>
        The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (or, more commonly, the Golden Dawn) was a magical order active in Great Britain during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which practiced theurgy and spiritual development. It has been one of the largest single influences on 20th-century Western occultism.

       Deep within your crapshoot of insanity, I found a coherent statement whose factual inaccuracy I could demonstrate clearly.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        However, Jewish prayers are dedicated to both god and Satan.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Your lack of understanding of the context of the Old Testament names reveals that you're, to use a technical term, "totally full of shit."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The word "King" is often used in place of "God" in the Torah. However, the torah has no vowels.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       True.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The word for "King" is M-E-L-E-C-H.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       True.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The word for "Satan" is M-O-L-O-C-H.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       FALSE.  Moloch is not "Satan", but an ancient
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch">
        Ammonite God
       </a>
       derived from the same root as "Melech" (king).  You only associate him with Satan because some time during the 500-100s B.C. Gods other than Yahweh became associated with demons and Satan in Jewish (and later Christian) demonology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moloch IS, however, an enemy God, one to whom Mosaic law (the Torah) forbids sacrifice.  Jews do NOT pray to "God and Satan", nor do they even pray to "Melech and Moloch".  It's JUST Melech, and MLCH (as you transliterate from Hebrew) is understood UNIVERSALLY to be ONLY Melech, not Moloch.  Your interpretation is based on taking what's actually known, and throwing in a nice healthy dose of bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, in the Old Testament, "Satan" exists as a job title, not a person ("Ha-Satan", generally translated as "the Opposer" or "the Accuser").  Furthermore, this figure appears in the book of Job, not as a source of evil, but as someone who is SIMPLY DOING HIS JOB by questioning Yahweh.  If you had actually studied this subject - something I've done pretty recently, and in depth - you'd know this stuff, instead of pulling shit out of your ass based on misconceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in the Gospels, when Jesus says "get out of my way, Satan", he is referring to Peter not as a devil, but as a literal Adversary, or "one who bars the way".
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the torah, we pray to "M-L-C-H."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Correct.  Which is pronounced "Melech."  Which means King.  It does NOT refer to the Ammonite God who is derived from the same root word.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So while MANY Jews do NOT worship the devil.... Many DO
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There
       <strong>
        is no devil
       </strong>
       in the Torah, or any other part of the Old Testament.  Ha-Satan is NOT the devil, this is an association that doesn't really appear until early medieval Christianity.  Ha-Satan is most certainly an angel, and there is no indication that he's a fallen one, rather than an angel of good standing with Yahweh, just doing the job assigned to him.  If you're thinking to yourself "but at the end of the book of Job, God casts Satan down from Heaven", you're thinking of a folktale that has replaced the actual story in peoples' minds.  In the ACTUAL Book of Job, there is no evidence of any punishment for Satan...which is consistent with the interpretation of him as a character who is NOT an "enemy of God".
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't even bother to respond to the rest of your post, because it's just a massive clusterfuck.  At least

       <p>
        <strong>
         Ripper Crew
        </strong>
        or Chicago Rippers was a satanic cult and organized crime group composed of Robin Gecht (who once worked for the serial killer John Wayne Gacy) and three associates (Edward Spreitzer with brothers Andrew and Thomas Kokoraleis).[1] They were suspected in the disappearances of 18 women in Chicago, Illinois in 1981 and '82. Gecht and his gang allegedly drove around in a van looking for prostitutes to sacrifice in Gecht's apartment. They claimed to have removed one breast from each victim and eaten it as Gecht read passages of The Satanic Bible. It has also been said that they, after severing the breast, took turns raping the open wound. They then proceeded to each masturbate into the flesh of the breast, chop it into pieces, and devour it.
       </p>
       <p>
        These men were arrested in 1982 for the stabbing of a teenaged prostitute.[2] Although Gecht's associates and other witnesses implicated him in some of the deaths, investigators never had enough evidence to charge him with murder. Gecht is serving 120 years in Menard Correctional Center for mutilating and raping an 18-year-old prostitute.[2]

      <p>
       Many young people would call the books of the Bible and the Torah "fiction" as well and yet many good Jews and Christians live their lives by those writings. Do you think the Torah or the Gospels are also fiction? What's your point exactly?

       No, the author admits it's fiction dumbmass:

       <p>
        Gilmore lists a number of people who influenced LaVey's writings: Ayn Rand, Friedrich Nietzsche, H. L. Mencken, the members of the carnival with whom LaVey had supposedly worked in his youth, P. T. Barnum, Mark Twain, John Milton, and Lord Byron.[24]
       </p>
       <p>
        LaVey's estranged daughter Zeena Schreck, in an exposé about both her father's religion and past, attributes the birth of The Satanic Bible to a suggestion by Peter Mayer, a publisher for Avon.[18] According to Schreck, Mayer proposed that LaVey author a Satanic bible to draw from the popularity of 1968 horror film Rosemary's Baby, which had caused a recent rise in public interest in both Satanism and the occult.[25] Schreck states that, aided by Diane Hegarty, LaVey compiled a number of writings he had already been distributing: an introduction to Satanism, a number of short essays, a guide to ritual magic, and articles he had previously published in The Cloven Hoof, a Church of Satan newsletter.[26][18]
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Either to meet length requirements set by the publisher[16] or out of agreement with the ideas,[24] LaVey and Hegarty plagiarized writings by other authors. These included a social Darwinist book published in 1890 entitled Might is Right, as well as Dee's Enochian keys from Aleister Crowley's The Equinox, modified to replace references to Christianity with those to Satan.
        </strong>
        [27] Some accuse LaVey of
        <strong>
         paraphrasing the Nine Satanic Statements from Rand's Atlas Shrugged without acknowledgement, though others maintain that LaVey simply was drawing inspiration from the novel
        </strong>
        .[28][29]
        <strong>
         LaVey later affirmed the connection with Rand's ideas by stating that LaVeyan Satanism was "just Ayn Rand's philosophy, with ceremony and ritual added"
        </strong>
        .

       That's not a satanic cult, that's three crazy guys, a van, and a need to kill prostitutes. This does not prove that Satanic cults sacrificing children or abusing children is something that exists.

       That's completely different from the statement you made.  You wrote a post about Jewish Satanism, and that's just not a thing in the Old Testament whatsoever.  These aren't nuances, they're the entire argument.

       There's no reason to believe any of this.  You've provided zero proof, and when anyone doubts you, you play the "I was abused, pity me" card.  I don't.  I think you're here to push an agenda of anti-semitic hatred, despite your supposed adherence to Luke-style "Love they neighbor" aphorisms.  If not for your comment about "all pigs being Jews", I might have even bought it.

       As a native american, we tend to attract people...especially Satan worshippers. We had to call the cops a few times..because we did not want to be associated with these creepos. If I were to put a paranormal twist on this..then watch out...were stronger than all of that voodoo bunk.

       Satan, or "Ha-Satan" in the Old Testament, means "The Adversary", or "The Accuser".  It's a job title, not a name, given to one of the Angels who appears most prominently in the book of Job.  There is no indication that this is a fallen angel, no solid reason to associate this unnamed individual with "Lucifer", and no reason to believe it refers to a so-called "devil".  Near as can be told, in the book of Job, "Satan" is more or less just doing his job - and contrary to what you may have heard (since I know the version I'd been told before READING the actual book of Job myself), there is no evidence of Yahweh punishing Ha-Satan or casting him out of heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, AllenLibman is full of shit, has no idea what "Satan" is in Jewish text, and is completely ignorant of the context of the Old Testament.

       I have a friend, who in 10th grade got in an argument with his mother and she broke down and told him that for 20 years leading up to his birth, she was a witch, belonging to a coven. Once she was pregnant she got out, and divorced the man who impregnated her. All of my friends and I thought it was weird, his mom was always super drugged out on benzos and shit to keep her calm, and his dad, at the time, was like 80 years old. Very strange when none of our parents in middle school were too far over 50. Anyways, this charming, successful intellectual wooed her into carrying a baby, and that baby, my friend, was being born for the coven. She told him the day he was born, there were 20 or so professionals (doctors, lawyers etc) all waiting eagerly to "see the baby," which is when her protective instincts kicked in and she decided to leave. They used to take part in animal sacrifice, ritualistic group sex and other crazy shit, but my friend saw none of it. One day, after he found this all out, we went into his mom's dresser and found a cloak, and a ceremonial dagger from "the good ole days." Had what appeared to possibly be a blood stain on it. Another friend of mine who I told this story to one day was floored because his first girlfriend in high school told him all the same shit, except she endured SRA and was extremely fucked up from it. She also showed him the cloaks and daggers her parents had hidden in their closet, and would say things like "you don't know what they do to me. They're not what they appear to be." Crazy shit.

       There are clearly shills in this thread doing damage control. Stop getting all caught up the technicalities of what is satan. Does it matter? If these people are participating in occult rituals, can't we just say it's in the name of evil? They are purposely participating in these rituals to harvest power, a rush,  and because they're convinced it works. Can't we just say there is in fact a large group of globalist fucks who participate in this shit? Clearly, if these rituals exist, they may have been dug up, and rediscovered by the Golden Dawn, but in reality these rituals and rites stem from the Ancient Middle East; exactly why we shouldn't get too caught up in a debate over the technical names of deities. These are evil worshipping fucks, and THIS IS NOT EXCLUSIVE TO Judaism. The catholic church is riddled with abuse which we know of from the recent media exposure it's gotten in the last 20 years. But dudes, this shit is pervasive through all the mind-prison religions. The people who inflict religious orthodoxy on the population are the ones doing this. Check out the wikipedia page on Grimoires.

       I thought this stood out.
"The ancient Jewish people were also often viewed as being knowledgeable in magic, which according to legend they had learned from Moses, who himself had learned it in Egypt. Indeed, amongst many ancient writers, Moses himself was seen as an Egyptian rather than a Jew, and two manuscripts likely dating to the 4th century, both of which purport to be the legendary eighth Book of Moses (the first five being the initial books in the Biblical Old Testament), present him as a polytheist who explained how to conjure gods and subdue demons.[7] Meanwhile there is definite evidence of grimoires being used by certain, particularly Gnostic sects of early Christianity; in the Book of Enoch found within the Dead Sea Scrolls for instance, there is various information on astrology and the angels. In possible connection with the Book of Enoch, the idea of Enoch and his great-grandson Noah having some involvement with books of magic given to them by angels continued in various forms through to the mediaeval period.[8]"

       We should probably stop referring to this rites and rituals as satanism, satanic in nature. It's DEMONOLOGY. Satanism is misleading, it keeps people in their reality tunnel only thinking about the things they already know, and think it has something to do with that Gimmick known as La Vey Satanism, or think it is directly tied to the christian bible, so all the atheists hop on the "i don't believe in that" train. But really, we're talking demonology here, and I think arguing over which deity it is is just the shill-fest.

       In your opinion is there any connection between the elite blood suckers - sandy hook shooting - the rites of saturnalia as an ode to Satan himself?

       This has become a theory of mine as well. The Jewish, talmudic god, to me, appears to be some sort of gnostic demon. He demands worship and unbridled devotion of all kinds. Most Jews probably have no idea what they're actually worshipping, and wind up providing this evil energy with all sorts of prayer for it to feed off of. The same goes for Catholics, except Catholics are even more in the dark. Moden monotheistic mind-prisons are founded in believing in a spiteful, hateful god who likes to inflict his wrath upon us. The Jews' name for it is Yahweh. Is there any etymological similarity between Yahweh and the gnostic demi-urge they referred to as yaldabaoth? Anyway, it clearly seems to me that an ancient strain of Semitic demonology has permeated through the ages and quite very possibly got out of hand around the time of Salem witch trials. Seriously check out some of the paintings by Goya from the turn of the 18-19th century. Witches Sabbath in particular. I think it says a million words about this mystery practice of demonology by so called Religious folk.

       Many young people would call the books of the Bible and the Torah "fiction" as well and yet many good Jews and Christians live their lives by those writings. Do you think the Torah or the Gospels are also fiction? What's your point exactly?

       No, the author admits it's fiction dumbmass:

        Gilmore lists a number of people who influenced LaVey's writings: Ayn Rand, Friedrich Nietzsche, H. L. Mencken, the members of the carnival with whom LaVey had supposedly worked in his youth, P. T. Barnum, Mark Twain, John Milton, and Lord Byron.[24]
       </p>
       <p>
        LaVey's estranged daughter Zeena Schreck, in an exposé about both her father's religion and past, attributes the birth of The Satanic Bible to a suggestion by Peter Mayer, a publisher for Avon.[18] According to Schreck, Mayer proposed that LaVey author a Satanic bible to draw from the popularity of 1968 horror film Rosemary's Baby, which had caused a recent rise in public interest in both Satanism and the occult.[25] Schreck states that, aided by Diane Hegarty, LaVey compiled a number of writings he had already been distributing: an introduction to Satanism, a number of short essays, a guide to ritual magic, and articles he had previously published in The Cloven Hoof, a Church of Satan newsletter.[26][18]
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Either to meet length requirements set by the publisher[16] or out of agreement with the ideas,[24] LaVey and Hegarty plagiarized writings by other authors. These included a social Darwinist book published in 1890 entitled Might is Right, as well as Dee's Enochian keys from Aleister Crowley's The Equinox, modified to replace references to Christianity with those to Satan.
        </strong>
        [27] Some accuse LaVey of
        <strong>
         paraphrasing the Nine Satanic Statements from Rand's Atlas Shrugged without acknowledgement, though others maintain that LaVey simply was drawing inspiration from the novel
        </strong>
        .[28][29]
        <strong>
         LaVey later affirmed the connection with Rand's ideas by stating that LaVeyan Satanism was "just Ayn Rand's philosophy, with ceremony and ritual added"
        </strong>
        .

       So hey look, the Satanic Bible is just Ayn Rand, re-written with ceremonies. Amazing you,
