        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>OK, so I have to share this, as it seems <em>just</em> enuff of a thing to actually be plausible. I have worked for Uncle Sam in various ways for a high # of years, and have made some good friends. One of these friends. who has asked to remain Anon. says he was running a loader, on a AF base, and it was used to load the smaller Shuttle, the non-piloted one. He stated that &quot;The loader failed&quot; (the hydraulics of the arm failed) and he was asked to fix it. He goes and gets a tool kit, he shows back up, TWO cops (SP&#39;s) are circling the loader.</p>

<p>He approaches. &quot;Halt&quot;. He badges past them, and he sets to work. He goes to shift the load to get the other end free to check the lines and one of the SP&#39;s says &quot; Don&#39;t touch the crate&quot;. It&#39;s a wooden crate about 2 foot by 3 foot and about 1 1/2 feet high. My friend says &quot;I need to get this up and over a little to check the hose and to bleed the system&quot;. Second SP calls it in and a third guy shows upâ€¦</p>

<p>Now there is a whispered conversation, SP asks my friend for his ID card AND his &quot;Line Badge&quot;. He hands it over, 5 minutes go by, the third guy comes back and asks my friend what he needs. He tells him &quot;the crate moved&quot;. Third guy says &quot;Can&#39;t, too heavy&quot;. Now it&#39;s too small to be a bomb, or even a stack of warheads, which is what a loader is for, so the third guy gets a call and walks back and hands my friend his ID and Badge. &quot;OK, you&#39;ve been cleared&quot;. He then turns to the SP&#39;s and says &quot;Unload the gold bars, fix the loader, load &#39;em back up, and <em>get this done</em>&quot;.</p>

<p>Now why are they loading up Gold bars to be shot into space ???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully comprehend that there is much we don&#39;t know and I am very open-minded and awake when it comes to plausible alternatives to mainstream thought. This, however is not plausible to me. </p>

<p>Sending gold to space to be pulverized and used to line the atmosphere of a hidden mystery planet so it&#39;s inhabitants can survive? This is not theory, it&#39;s science fiction. Being open to other realities also involves realizing when you&#39;re being had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh shit! The Bain Space Bank, Mitt&#39;s cashing in and headed to Kolob! If that mega job creator goes to his heaven planet early there will be an adverse effect on our economy, there will be at least ten thousand Chinese workers out of a job and one elderly Mexican lady known simply as &quot;the help&quot;. Those jobs bringing hundreds of dollars to these economies annually. The effect will be an astronomical lowering of the poverty level across the world. I just pray to Elohim, the engineer fueling that ship takes in consideration that those gold bars have been salted with tungsten mysteriously while inside the vaults of the federal reserve. The added thrust to weight ratio would send that craft on a long cold oval shaped orbit around the entire solar system then back into sun which causes a reaction the gold lowers the suns temperature enough that the earth will cool at the rate of global warming and everything is fucking awesome. African children obtain a western diabetes rate, Canadians stop apologizing, and Omari finally gets his motion  censor machine gun turrets mounted on the gates of the wall reddit built the orphans, but they ain&#39;t fucking needed no more. The end</p>

<p>Edit: sadly and mysteriously for reasons unknown, the ethnically diverse and very popular sub on reddit known lovingly as r/conspiratard suddenly fell silent as every single member fell victim to spontaneous human combustion. There mass funeral was yesterday they were survived by 43 grandmothers, one ferret, and ten cousin wife&#39;s. when interviewed Buzz Lightyear simply said &quot;empty basements, empty basements everywhere.&quot;</p>
