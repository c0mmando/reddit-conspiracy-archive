       I'd like to hear what r/conspiracy thinks would happen if all of the American governments lies were revealed?  What would happen if some great truth unraveled it all over the course of twenty four hours, if 9/11 and Sandy Hook etc were exposed?
      </p>
      <p>
       For the critics, humour me with this.  I want to here thoughts about what would happen to society if their government was exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This interests me greatly, as it should everybody.  Would society respond, and how?  Whats a likely outcome?  Would the government retaliate?  How would the world respond?  Give me a timeline if you've got one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I have a theory?  Not really actually... a part of me would like to see the events unfold peacefully and justice be brought about swiftly, but I just don't know how that would work in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit; Type-o. Thanks EliteSpud

       If all the lies were released, lets say with a full log of footnotes, videos and other absolute evidence... it would be a huge cultural shock that few would be able to get their head around and others would go ape-shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would have several camps:
      </p>
      <p>
       1: The deniers and Stockholm Syndrome people. They just would not believe it, or make up lies as to how it was "good for all" They would defend the current power structure to their dying end.
      </p>
      <p>
       2: The Anarchists. I see them out burning every single government and corporate "object" to the ground. Expect mass riots in large centres.
      </p>
      <p>
       3: The New Movement (Good). I have to call them that for lack of another word. Since the Government would be invalid and illegal they would be people trying to salvage what they could of a broken system. Think like welfare workers who are still trying to get food stamps to poor, ex-police trying to patrol again etc... it would be small groups at the local level trying to maintain services and the general good of the people on a local and perhaps state level.
      </p>
      <p>
       4: The New Movement (bad). These would be the people far enough from the shit that would try to hold onto and keep power for themselves. They would be something like upper level government workers who know the system and are trying to gain as much power from it by basically selling their superiors down the river. But they still are only interested in their own powers for control. Think ex-senators, retired Generals etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       This would actually be the end of a lot of things. There would be separate groups vying for power, trying to get to the top etc... I suppose if one was to really read up on what happened after the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror you would have a clearer understanding of what would probably play out.

       Nice analogy bro. Lets remember the need for commerce and meeting basic needs will be the power that rules the strongest. Peace will be the biggest motivator for order and we are less likely to fall into a cleptocracy when you have an armed population. New technologies will be emerging as true freedom of information emerges. All of the paradigms will be shifting for everyone. The road will be bumpy for awhile.

       Surely not?  Their government is finally ousted for great misdeeds... they wouldn't just ignore it.

       There'd be changes, surely?  something to prevent it happening again at best?

       Even when the government gets caught lying or doing bent shit, the media fluffs it over. Weren't they just caught selling guns to Mexican gangs?! Wasnt the CIA caught selling drugs in the Iran contra affair? 
Didnt bush change the law so Rumsfeld or Cheney (can't remember now) could stay in charge of the company that made billions of the wars these fucks manufactured?
They don't even want to know that's the thing. They are in their bubble, they're happy. Change doesn't come. Sam Cooke was wrong. Day they find out Cheney,bush and the other twatbags did 911, theyll spin it, that was then this is now. They'd lose evidence, they would delay trial, until they were all dead. Then say it was a disgrace and nothing like that will happen again. But it will. It's how it works. It's the American teaching of democracy. Unfortunately the uk has followed suit. Our overseas activities are equally as bad. When they found out Murdoch had essentially been spinning all the press about the previous fuck up government and eradicating bad press, still no one gave a shit. It's mental. What do these arseholes actually have to do to make them wake up?!

       Okay.  Let me rephrase my question?
      </p>
      <p>
       What would happen if the governments lies were revealed - without the complicity of the mass media?  In that, the lie exposed was so great the government loses its control over the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm really chasing an answer to is how everything and everyone would respond to an undeniable truth that their government was a ruthless system of lies and manipulator of fact.  Would this encourage society to be less dependent on a governing body and more willing to question information presented as fact?  Beyond the initial response, would this great truth make society a better place?

       Ive said it before and Ill say it again! Material desires have the youth and everyone else locked into Stockholm syndrome. no one cause but a few. The masses are more concerned with their favorite TV show or what new shitty over priced product apple is releasing. People love their captors in this country and it is sad.

       Possibly the most profound, yet depressing, answer so far.  Depressing because I think you're right.  Judging by the responses so far most of r/conspiracy agrees.  Depressing/frustrating.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... we're up against a problem the resists a solution?  No fixing this?  There has to be some positive outlook in this for at least r/conspiracy users, otherwise what's your motivation?  There needs to be a goal in this for each of us, and I'd expect (hope) its a similar goal right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually have very little idea on how to correct the current thinking in society, nor do I have even a half thought out idea on preventing it from repeating in human history.  Maybe, the answer is out of just reach right now.

       Would there be a contingency plan for the government?  Like a "Government 2.0 - now with extra truth" already in waiting?

       While I understand there would be a great deal of apathy in the population, I'm sure somebody would not let this slip by unnoticed and unpunished?

       Unfortunately and I hate to admit it. The majority of the population needs it. They were manipulated by religion, that got boring in our consumer society, so only the truly dull/ignorant still partake (ill await the down votes for that,lol) and now government manipulate them. The truth of how the governments of the world view us as mere collateral and slaves is too much for them. The truth would not set them free, it would blow their tiny ignorant minds and open the floodgates for chaos and anarchy.

       Well thank you. I really don't see an end though. The education system in America and the uk is being deliberately dumbed down. So as the generations evolve they will question less and less.  The most obvious example that we are mere slaves to the government is the banking crisis. The banks lobbied(bribed) the governments to be de regulated 
, lost all their money on stupid complicated greedy trading, then told the governments to make the people to pay it off. These banks pay as little tax as possible so why do it? Because the government is owned by the banks. Who owns the banks? A small number of elitist families. Proof if ever you needed it we do not live in a democracy nor even a fair society. Our great grandchildren will be paying back debt that none of us ran up.

       Im sure that the minion of the elite have quite a bit on one another and the house of cards is growing shakier as we speak. The unraveling will happen fast due to the "changing of sides" in order to save ones own ass. though i dont know when or how this event will come about due to the strangle hold the elite have on the MSM. So it is likely that it will start through some form of critical mass from the internet.

       In all, society will be in shock and dismay. Those of us crazy conspiracy theorists will be sought after by the public in order to help them come to an understanding, though be aware, these people will be MAD, and the anger may be taken out on the messengers.

       Ideally the top execs and colluders would be arrested, indicted for treason, brought into a court of law and probably executed. Maybe rot in federal prison for the rest of their lives if we don't want to be animals about it.

       Point is this shit needs to come out at some point and it will happen all at once. The age we live is ruled by the Internet, so if one thing leaks it's leaked around the globe within 24 hours.

       Well a truly open system of governance would be the solution. Where federal employees work for us, everything they do is openly cataloged and archived on the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should be able to log into the White House website and see specifically where each piece of the budget is being spent. Down to the very last cent. Also what their plans are, why are these people meeting in private? we fucking hire them to work for us. we should know everything they're trying to do at this point going forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the solution - a real truly open system of governance. Not this baloney "open transparent" shit that barry bounel has been preaching for 2 terms now.

       YES!  Finally, an answer!  Thank you.

      <p>
       I like this answer.  How would "non-compliance" from our government be dealt with?  Would the government be stripped of its link to the military and/or police?  How does the media fair from its actions of the past?  What would happen to systems like the financial market and educations system fair also?

       I still feel we need to deal with non-compliance in the same fashion. Higher execs in the media, education, and definitely within high-finance need to be executed. Liars will never change. We cannot trust a single word they say, so what value do they offer society at this point? Why should we(taxpayers) feed them and house them in a prison? Murder them and let that be their punishment for everything that has been done.

       they would be released to threads like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       so that no one would take them seriously. And then they would have a Cointelpro to make sure that anyone who gained traction with the story could easily be discredited, its SOP as far as i have seen over the last 2 decades.  But recently, any dissenting opinion has looked like it is being out right deleted from the Zeitgeist by the mainstream gatekeepers.  I wonder if it is the decision of Facebook to start to delete ghandi quotes, or if it is a task being delegated to them by a higher power.  I can't imagine any government official having any power over a multibillion dollar corp, however, I can imagine a banking tycoon telling Ol Zuck to get with the program or they will bankrupt them.  hey thats just my take on it though.

       If all the lies were thrust into the light, the darkness would only be inches from showing the faces of those responsible, those who hold the guilt, who are responsible. I could only hope that we would attempt to redeem ourselves by cleaning the ranks, and starting fresh. I think this world needs a brighter future, one that isn't a fucking rat race of distractions, lies, pollution, corruption, disparity and apathy. We need a world where people on one side of the world actually give a fuck about the people on the other side, because go fucking figure, We're all the same species, on the same rock, in the same pond. To think differently is to only begin down the path of extinction.

       There would be a revolution that would start during the announcement of the truths, and promptly end with the start of daily primetime reality TV or Sports programming that evening. During the revolution Ad revenue will soar and sales of alcohol and comfort processed foods would sky-rocket, monetarily wealthy people and companies will make a quick load of money and dump losing investments on the middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following day Republicans and Democrats would claim the best moments for their own, and blame the other party for whatever faults don't wrench their cog. The government will use the unrest to justify more domestic drones, and now that everyone knows the lies and reacted, they will be easier to lie to in the near future.

       It exists because we seek the truth for ourselves. That's it.  I'm not here because I am trying to spread the word or free humanity.  In fact I believe that if humanity doesn't have a major population drop within the next 2 centuries, we will starve out the planet and kill everything.  The only hope we have is to be eradicated. So then /r/ conspiracy is here to let seekers of truth to come look here to search and debate in quest for it

       Not starve as in food, but starve the planet of its resources and other animals. Humanity has this strange notion that we can kill and deforest and drill to our hearts content and that since we are the most intelligent on this planet we have the right to destroy it. We don't. It doesn't matter what direction we grow anything if there are too many people and no resources to support them.

       I don't understand how a person can be determined to expose lies yet not have considered the outcomes of achieving their goal?

       Possibly the most profound, yet depressing, answer so far.  Depressing because I think you're right.  Judging by the responses so far most of r/conspiracy agrees.  Depressing/frustrating.

       So... we're up against a problem the resists a solution?  No fixing this?  There has to be some positive outlook in this for at least r/conspiracy users, otherwise what's your motivation?  There needs to be a goal in this for each of us, and I'd expect (hope) its a similar goal right?

       I actually have very little idea on how to correct the current thinking in society, nor do I have even a half thought out idea on preventing it from repeating in human history.  Maybe, the answer is out of just reach right now.
