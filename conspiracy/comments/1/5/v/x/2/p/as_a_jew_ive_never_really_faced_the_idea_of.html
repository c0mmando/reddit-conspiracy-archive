<p>So, I googled it and found an interesting explanation of where it originated <a href="http://www.holocaust-history.org/denial/abc-clio/">from</a>.. Perhaps the reason no one ever took up David Irving&#39;s $1000.</p>

<p>I learned that Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion was a plagiarism of Maurice Joly&#39;s Dialogue aux Enfers entre Montesquieu et Machiavel. Which makes me wonder who he was and what his motives were.. What did he write against Napoleon that was so bad?</p>

<p>I should note that David Irving did go to court against Dr. Deborah Lipstadt and got <a href="http://www.hdot.org/en/trial">pwned</a>, they released raw documents of the lawsuit.</p>

<p>According to all the information presented online :  &#39;Holocaust Denial&#39; in it of itself is a conspiracy to create a conspiracy. </p>

<p><em>I do not consider Holocaust Denial &#39;hate speech&#39; it should be discussed in open format, under the guidelines of freedom of speech.</em></p>

Interestingly, if you look at the number of Jews working in the Okrana, it is highly unlikely that if the Okrana did produce the modern Protocols, it could have been done without passing through at LEAST one pair of Jewish hands and eyes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But to compare like that is shifting the goal post at the very least. No one in a civilized mind is denying the existence of those empires - the majority of your comment was petty and childish on that ground. The problem is not that white people are shittier than thou - to perpetuate that in that context is tragic, as the level of degradation is dispersed among all of mankind. The real divide is between sociopathic, partially psychotic, and sometimes outright evil rulers and their goons - and people who do not want to subjugate and enslave their fellow humans - <strong>and the enlightened are well aware that those qualities span sex, genetics, and nationality.</strong> With that being said, all tyrants merit acknowledgement in the toilet bowl of humanity, but saying something like &quot;There are no Jews on any dollar bill, just white people&quot;, is fucking retarded, fallacious, and probably inflammatory to someone, though not me (hence my &quot;lolwat&quot; reaction), but worst of all, it&#39;s dismissive and subversive.</p>

<p>The real irony here is that I&#39;m seeing, with a razor blade, through ethnicity and skin color - you&#39;re not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then at what point in the faithfully abiding of a teaching does a phenomenon spread from &quot;falsehood&quot; to &quot;truth&quot;?</p>

<p>The answer is presumably &quot;At NO point&quot; right?  In other words, it doesn&#39;t matter if someone says and writes about and teaches the wrong thing for a millennium and even gets an entire population of beings to follow it accordingly.  If it&#39;s wrong, it&#39;s wrong.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter that practically EVERY human being on the planet thought the Earth was flat for quite a while.  It wasn&#39;t.  It was spherical, and literally EVERYONE thinking it was flat didn&#39;t make it LESS spherical one whit.  Right?</p>

<p>The interesting thing about what seems to be the validity of this statement above is that it still doesn&#39;t effect the practical application of possible erroneous teachings based upon such falsehoods.</p>

<p>That is to say that who cares, for example, if the Bible is 100% wrong and erred when millions upon millions swear by it and abide by its teachings?  Who cares that many aspects of many different scientific theories are incorrect and flawed when an entire people are living their lives in accord with its teachings?</p>

<p>And similarly, who actually cares that The Protocols might actually be a false document when the fact is that there are a group of people in Zionists whose actions seem to mirror pretty accurately the very teachings that are found in its pages?</p>

<p>Perhaps, then, the debate should really have NEVER EVER been an &quot;is it a forgery or is it not a forgery?&quot; debate.  That, as it turns out, is a bit of a useless, red herring type of fallacy.  The real issue and debate is - whether true or false - is the document and its dictates being followed to a tee by those that it is said to have been written for?</p>

<p>The unfortunate problem here is that a look at history and what has been going on in the world for an untold number of decades now shows that the answer to this question resoundingly screams &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>The same can be said of the Bible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  This is 100% true, and it is the very reason why I chose it as one of the examples which I referenced.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fault lies not with the document, but with the interpretation of the document and with the people who use the document for their own purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, while I think there is <em>some</em> validity in this statement, there are, of course, documents that are actually MUCH more unambiguous than others.  While I think that a good argument can be made that there is indeed both much, much good AND much bad and ignorance in the bible - and this, I imagine, is one of the things that leads so many to misinterpret it so egregiously and do such horrible and barbaric things in its name - I&#39;m not so very sure that the same level of ambiguity can be placed upon The Protocols.  That particular book seems to be pretty unambiguously in favor of one people ruling over everyone and everything else at almost any expense whatsoever.  I don&#39;t purport to be a scholar in the particulars of The Protocols, but I don&#39;t believe that there is any area that advocates any type of philosophy that can be looked upon as being GOOD for anyone <em>other</em> than Jews and Zionists.  If I am mistaken, and there are indeed various sections in The Protocols that <em>do</em> actually advocate a philosophy whereby other races can greatly benefit as well, then please point them out.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no advocate or scholar of the Christian bible, but, objectively speaking, I know that there <em>are</em> indeed general enough dictates in it which can be pretty unanimously applied to all types of peoples.  Such, it seems, can in no way be said about The Protocols, as it is meant for ONE people and ONE people only at the exclusion and expense of all others.</p>

<p>Therefore, while I, again, agree that it is <em>how</em> people interpret certain things that causes the most good or bad - and not necessarily the thing that&#39;s being interpreted in and of itself - I am at present <em>not</em> in agreement that any real parallel can be made between The Protocols and The Bible, as, while both are certainly responsible for much harm, <em>one</em> of the documents (The Christian Bible) has also actually been responsible for at least <em>some</em> decent amount of good on the planet, while the other document (The Protocols), I would say has definitely NOT in any way been responsible for much of anything other than the perpetuation of a racist, domineering ideology.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>This all boils down to people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I would say that it all boils down to people in one sense, but in another possibly even MORE important sense, it boils down to those books and documents written by some people that a LOT of other people might follow pretty strictly and dutifully.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like I said before it is the people who interpret the documents that matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is correct...but what OTHER possible way are certain documents to be interpreted other than a negative one?  I mean if a document says &quot;kill people wearing blue shirts&quot; and you have a devoted follower of that document, then - while you can certainly blame the follower for killing someone wearing a blue shirt - it doesn&#39;t seem that it would be too correct to say that the follower&#39;s actions exist <em>independent</em> of the document&#39;s imploring suggestions and demands.  It would seem that the document does bear a certain level of responsibility in the perpetuation of the followers&#39; actions, no?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Protocols of Zion is just a document (and a bullshit one at that). But it is the people, in power, who use that document for their own Political purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with everything you just said here, but it would seem that, independent of whether The Protocols are &quot;bullshit&quot; or not, the fact that they seem to be so steadfastly followed by so many <em>very</em> powerful people means that the document itself - <em>regardless</em> of its truth or falsity - should be absolutely considered with as much weight, severity, and import where it relates to world matters as any document that actually IS 100% real and factual.</p>

<p>In other words, the document might be fake, but the <em>followers</em> of that document, what they&#39;re doing in its name, and the effects that they have upon the world are VERY much real.  The document should, therefore, be looked upon with a great deal of seriousness and should <em>not</em> be disregarded offhand as so many would want others to do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, they are targeting Jews. That is not the fault of the common people who are &quot;Jewish&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It isn&#39;t?  I&#39;m not saying it is the fault of the Jewish people, of course, but this statement here on your part it seems would depend upon who in fact were the authors of the document, where they came from, and just who they were representing and writing the document <em>for</em>.</p>

<p>I think a big issue regarding Jews, Zionism, and The Protocols has to do with acceptance and complicity.  This is to say that while I know for a fact that not <em>every</em> Jew is a Zionist, there are many that, while they don&#39;t out and out say they are Zionists, directly benefit from Zionist oppression by simple virtue of their background.</p>

<p>If I didn&#39;t steal the car, but 1) I <em>know</em> it&#39;s stolen, and 2) still drive it on a daily or even weekly basis, then it would seem that I am very much complicit in the crime of its theft, no?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is the fault of the rulers who are using the &quot;Jewish&quot; people for an excuse to further political empire building.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would seem so.  I would not disagree with this.  However, I am not sure that the common people are doing as much as they can to NOT allow themselves to be represented by Zionism.  I mean, is EVERY Jew that has settled in Palestine a Zionist?  And if you or anyone were to say no, then it would seem that this would be quite problematic, because this then means that this is an example of the &quot;common Jew&quot; directly reaping the benefits of an evil, oppressive Zionist regime...as such, what then is the difference between the Jew that is a Zionist and the Jew the <em>isn&#39;t</em> a Zionist, but that still reaps the rewards of a destructive ideology that no one else BUT the Jew can benefit from?</p>

<p>These are very real questions that cannot be easily skirted or tossed aside by simply denying the import of The Protocols.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bible is a good document, in and of itself. But if it is used badly, and it has been, then it is people that are culpable, not the document.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that The Bible is a document that has both good <em>and</em> bad in it, and there are certain areas of it that one would be hard pressed to NOT interpret in a very critical manner.  It seems that there are sections of The Bible that would force even the most well intentioned follower to possibly commit quite questionable - and even criminal - acts.</p>

<p>What I mean to say here is that I don&#39;t think that it is ONLY the interpretation of the individual that should be solely faulted where it regards the prescriptions of certain documents because the prescriptions of certain texts are, again, sometimes quite unambiguous in what they say to do if you are indeed a follower.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is people who are intent on evil things who are using devices like the the &quot;Protocols&quot; for their own evil purposes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes sir.  I would agree with this entirely.  Here&#39;s my question, however:  Is it possible for someone who is <em>NOT</em> evil to follow and use the suggestions of The Protocols?  I wonder, and it seems that the answer would be no, correct?  As such, it would further seem that the suggestions contained within The Protocols - regardless of whether the person reading them is good or bad - are themselves less than positive, wouldn&#39;t you say?  This would be something that exists somewhat independently of how the text could be interpreted, as it seems the text can be interpreted in a way that is nothing if not racist, genocidal, and destructive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THE FACTS!! COME QUICK</p>

<p>1) No single piece of documentary evidence exists for the exterminationist theory. For example the &quot;Hitler Diaries&quot; were proven to be false </p>

<p>Evans, Richard J. (2001). Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial. New York: Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-02152-2. (page 17)</p>

<p>2) Many extermination claims that were once widely accepted have been quietly dropped in recent years. No serious historian now supports the once supposedly proven story of &quot;extermination camps&quot; in the territory of the old German Reich. This is such common knowledge to those that know even a little about the holocaust there is no need to provide a citation.</p>

<p>3) The supposed gas chamber at Auschwitz had glass windows and a wooden door. Look at some pictures for yourself.</p>

<p>4) Eyewitnesses have stated that hundreds of people were cremated at Auschwitz then piled onto elevators up to the crematorium every 15 minutes. Just think about the act of gassing, how dangerous it would be to walk in there and shift bodies.</p>

<p>5) It&#39;s all based on wild and sometimes impossible &quot;Eye Witness Testimony&quot;, if there were roughly about 100k survivors... where are they all? Why is it that its always the same few people?</p>

<p>6) Why does Spielberg feel the need to make films like &quot;The Last Days&quot; just chock full of untruths <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/spielbergshoax/">https://sites.google.com/site/spielbergshoax/</a></p>

<p>and many many more</p>

<p>people like to say its the most documented provable event in history, or near enough... they&#39;re actually confused by the fact that it has been brow-beaten into them, pretty much just through emotional blackmail, from about as early as they were able to read</p>

<p>this, and the fact that you can go to jail for doing chemical reports on the soil and coming up negative, should be proof enough for anyone with the tiniest bit of curiosity and intellectual honesty</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is about the Capitalizing on a tragedy, yes. It is also about how the Jewish plight has become our defining moment. Everything, involving Jews must also involve the holocaust. Jews live in a constant state of being reminded of the Holocaust. We are instructed to support Israel and remember that Israel will prevent another Holocaust. Everything that Israel and Zionists do today comes from a &quot;Don&#39;t preach to us&quot; attitude. They say to the world: &quot;nobody can tell us what to do, considering how you all supported the holocaust&quot;. Finklestein mentioned how interesting it is that the number of survivors is higher today than it was in 1945! Why? because the definition changed, of the word survivor. To start an industry you need people willing to buy into it. If 100,000 people actually survived a &quot;Death Camp&quot; and the rest were forced into &quot;labor camps&quot;, you need to call everyone a death camp survivor so more people can buy in. So the industry can keep growing and they&#39;d have people to keep the industry going long after. </p>

<p>Look at how Israel goes out of it&#39;s way to &quot;compensate&quot; holocaust survivors (Material Claims Against Germany), yet survivors in Israel are treated miserably. In Israel it started a whole controversy at one time, because non-Jewish Russians who live in Israel were claiming holocaust benefits. Israeli flipped out saying they had no right. Just because they lived through the war, they weren&#39;t &quot;survivors&quot;</p>

<p>Zionist-Jews were the only ones to benefit from the holocaust, the only group allowed to fly their flag during the holocaust, and </p>

<p>People didnt fund the holocaust, people funded Hitler, then he turned out to be a homicidal maniac, by then it was too late.</p>

<p>The original number, back in the 50&#39;s was 2 million total, including the nameless.  Then magically it changed to 6 million over time.</p>

<p>Prior to Second World War there were 3,500,000 Jews in Polish Second Republic, about 10% of the population, living predominantly in the cities. Between the 1939 invasion of Poland, and the end of World War II, over 90% of Polish Jewry perished.</p>

<p>Of Poland&#39;s prewar Jewish population of 3,500,000, only about 50,000-120,000 would survive the war</p>

<p>For example, DNA testing only today shows that Hitler&#39;s skull wasn&#39;t actually his skull, so it wasn&#39;t him who committed suicide.  Things like that, that point to things not being the way we are meant to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the words of David Cole:</p>

<p>On the issue of the Holocaust -- and perhaps uniquely on this issue --- we are told: &quot;Close the books, there will be no more learning, no more discussion, no more questions. Not only will no questions be tolerated, but anyone who dares to ask such questions will be slandered and viciously attacked.&quot;</p>

<p>Now as someone who believes that part of being human is to learn something new everyday, I respond: &quot;How dare you tell me there will be no more learning?&quot; The establishment that maintains the Holocaust story on life support admits that there is no direct proof of homicidal gassings. No order, no document, no pictures, only &quot;eyewitnesses.&quot;</p>

<p>And what of these eyewitnesses? The Holocaust lobby insists that this is convincing evidence. But what kind of evidence is this? In some European countries, a person who denies the gas chambers can be jailed, fined, or physically attacked. He might lose his job, his standing in the community, maybe even his life. Something similar has happened in Canada. In the United States, he might be attacked and vilified. And if he says that he comes by his knowledge from first-hand experience -- in other words from helping to run the camps during the war years -- then he might easily find himself deported to Israel or eastern Europe, where he might be sentenced to death or at least stripped of his US citizenship and denied due process.</p>

<p>In other words, we only hear of eyewitnesses from one side because witnesses from the other side have been strong-armed into silence. This is governmental coercion of the worst kind, and on a worldwide scale no less. One kind of eyewitness is encouraged, the other is warned that his words might lead to deportation, imprisonment, loss of livelihood, property, and even life. Some great victory for the Holocaust lobby: The game has been fixed!</p>

<p>Let people speak! If only no one else, I demand this for my own sake. I want to know what happened during World War Two, and yet how can I if those who might have firsthand knowledge are told : &quot;Speak only the official line, or suffer the consequences.&quot; I insist on my human right to learn.</p>

<p>There are those who say, &quot;Okay, so maybe the Holocaust is a bit exaggerated, but do we really want to destabilize society by openly talking about all this, possibly encouraging hostility against Jews?&quot; This raises an important philosophical question: Do you believe mankind to be so inherently cruel and stupid that people must be lied to in order to make them behave? If so, then the lies you tell them are only a small bandage to cover up a much greater evil: Lack of confidence in mankind&#39;s ability to handle the truth. And if you truly believe that people cannot handle the truth, but instead need a &quot;Big Brother&quot; to handle it for them, then surely democracy is the most dangerous thing on earth.</p>

<p>Of course, I understand that people can be cruel and stupid, but I also believe in the human ability to learn, and to grow with each new piece of knowledge. Rather than censor information that we subjectively perceive to be &quot;dangerous,&quot; we should teach our children to think critically, to remain open-minded, and to look for truth rather than cling to emotionally appealing falsehoods.</p>

<p>And that is just about all we can do: teach our children and hope for the best, realizing that people cannot be programmed like robots. Eighty years of failed Communism should have taught us that. To use the power of the state to force men to be what the state defines as &quot;good&quot; creates a world far more hellish than the one that is supposedly being prevented. I would rather live in a world where people are free to be cruel and stupid than one in which &quot;goodness&quot; is enforced at gun point.</p>

<p>Keep in mind also that truth, objective truth, does not need threats and intimidation to prevail. We Holocaust Revisionists are often likened to those who said that the earth was flat. But just the reverse is true: It is the other side that acts like a Holy Inquisition, institutionalizing one viewpoint and punishing heretics. Remember: We only accepted that the earth is round after the debate was opened. And since then, the round-earth adherents have not needed false news laws, hate crimes laws, and libel or slander laws to protect the truthfulness of their view. Likewise, all we ask is that the Holocaust story either stand or fall according to the evidence -- or lack of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.. Okay.. I&#39;m gonna put on my thinking cap.. </p>

<p>For a stint in college I created a fake online profile, and infiltrated the inner depths of a website that antifa call Spermfront. Meanwhile the fact that they called themselves &quot;revisionists&quot; most of the time, they only called themselves &quot;revisionists&quot; because it was the Politically Correct version of &quot;Holocaust Denier.&quot; But the fact still remains that you can call it whatever you want, it&#39;s still the same exact thing. </p>

<p>&quot;White Nationalism&quot; is just a fancy front for White Pride World Wide, just because you call it the Politically Correct way, doesn&#39;t change jack shit. These people were proudly racist, and went all out on making sure that other whites just like them thought the same way.  </p>

<p>Hence the reason for RAC music, to brainwash their followers, almost none of those people online couldn&#39;t think for themselves and just repeated useless facts that someone else had already said, nor did they consider thinking outside of the box.. </p>

<p>&#39;Cole became a victim of the JDL. Was physically beaten. Had his life threatened on the Internet by the Jewish Defense League&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;A young Jewish holocaust denier, posing as a believer, puts some hard questions to the senior curator of the Auschwitz State Museum. After making this video, a &quot;hit&quot; was put out on Cole, and a reward for information on his whereabouts was issued by Irv Rubin (who years later, was arrested by the FBI for planning to kill a Lebanese-American Congressman.) Fearing assassination, Cole went into hiding. He never surfaced again publicly.&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;On January 22, 1992, revisionist activist David Cole was attacked by JDL thugs at a meeting held at the University of California at Los Angeles. Before the meeting began, JDL leader Rubin first tried to push the youthful Cole down a flight of stairs. JDL hoodlums also harassed and pushed around meeting organizer Robert Morrissey. After the meeting commenced, JDL punks tried to shout down the speakers, and then threw food at Cole. Finally, a JDL thug assaulted Cole -- who is Jewish -- hitting him in the face and bloodying his nose.&#39;</p>

<p>Because the camps were completely destroyed by the allies, including the gas chambers at Birkenau, Dachau and other death camps. (strangely, though, not the main Auschwitz camp. Auschwitz was series of camps, the largest being a &quot;holding&quot; and work camp. They sent the infirm and undesireable to the neighboring Birkenau.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>False. The Red Cross one time published an <em>estimate</em> as to how many <em>German</em> Jews died in the camps, and came up with around 300,000. This did not include Polish, Russian and Hungarian Jews who made up the majority of the camp residents. Nor did it include deaths from massacres like Baba Yar preceding the concentration camps or deaths during transport.</p>

<p>While I have no love for the so-called &quot;Holocaust Industry&quot; and agree with Finkelstein on the principle, the money and fame making part of it has been hugely exaggerated and used as ammo for right wing Neo Nazi groups.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Sorry about your grandpop, but don&#39;t you think he would be a <em>little</em> insulted to see you using his name to push a Holocaust Denial agenda? What you say that your grandfather went through seems to change and get more like a David Irving short story every time you comment about the Holocaust, so excuse me if I&#39;m skeptical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the true accounts of victims--many of which saw many many dead from German cruelty and more from typhus but none from gas. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are, quite literally, thousands of written and spoken accounts of survivors from all different sources with different (or no) agendas. Most of them talk about gas chambers in death camps, death squads and mass deaths due to intentional mistreatment. To call <em>all</em> of them false is simply idiotic. No two ways about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To deny that it happened would be ludicrous. To accept blindly that it happened as history said it did would be equally ridiculous. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody&#39;s accepting blindly. Those that accept what history said happened accept it because there are hundreds of thousands of different sources that said it happened. Those that <em>don&#39;t</em> accept what happened are just blind to reality and too biased in their opinions to understand that a few minor inconsistencies do not mean that the entire thing is a falsehood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know but you gotta hope that some jew will figure out their interests are  in getting rid of so called &#39; anti-semitism&#39; in anyone who is not semitic by respecting them as people and not branding them as &#39;anti-semitic&#39; even though they are not semitic.  Why would anyone not semitic want to be anti-semitic - only redeemed by semites?</p>

<p>Only semites should indeed be anti-semitic...but people might be considered anti-american (for example) and that could be pursued.</p>

<p>So basically, since people can find articles that refer to &quot;six million Jews&quot; ergo the number was made up? IIRC, there were around 10 million European Jews before WWII, so it would not surprise me to find that when referring to a large percentage of them, the number &quot;six million&quot; occasionally pops up. Also, I see nothing about &quot;biblical prophecies&quot; so I&#39;m lead to conclude that it&#39;s just another piece of nonsensical fiction invented by the Holocaust Denial Industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well clearly nobody <em>made up</em> the article here (and there are lots lots more that use 6 million).  This is an historical document.  The important thing about it is the hysteria of its religious imagery.  The Holocaust versus Holohoax cannot seriously be discussed without reference to this hysteria</p>

<p>Crucifixion of the Jews? </p>

<p>Bigoted lust for Jewish blood?</p>

<p>becomes a religion at whose altar men of every race can worship and women of every creed can kneel... ?</p>

<p>Are you fucking with me?!</p>

<p>At the death of Christianity in the twentieth century?</p>

<p>Are you fucking with me?!</p>

<p>No more inquisition.  Just prison now.</p>

<p>Are you fucking with me?!</p>

<p>Send for social services for the children and the police for the imprisonable!</p>

<p>Are you fucking with me?!</p>

<p>Edit:  Again - Jesus as God out, Jews as Gods in.  This is the world of the holohoax.  And if Christianity - Judaism was bad this is going to be a fucking nightmare!  Has been a fucking nightmare for the hundreds of thousands of children dead in the middle east and the millions of angry people disenfranchised in the west who won&#39;t settle for  spazzy fundamentalist christianities runaway atheist brats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My brain moron.  Not TV.  Psudo religion is materialistic and will attribute to Jesus&#39; physical people Jesus&#39; attributes i.e. Gods. Who live their lives and die at the end of it while stile being &#39;Gods&#39;.  It didn&#39;t stop anyone treating Jesus as a God.  And it is how Anti-Semitism works for those who are not semite.  They are only redeemable by Semites as their mummies were by Jesus.  Whoever said <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> were atheists anyway.

    <div class="md"><p>So in short absolutely no factual evidence; just your own inane and rambling delusions. Calling atheism a pseudo religion would be like calling bald a hair colour. I have yet to see anyone attribute the attributes of Jesus to any Jew aside from Jesus himself. The Jews are not the children of god anymore than Christians or Muslims are as there is no god. Also a more apt term to describe atheism would be metaphysical naturalism.And a group that actively says their is no god is much more atheistic than a group that is unsure of the existence of  god(s).</p>

<p>This going off on anything anti-religious is bullshit if you watch them closely.  They get off on being more and more Anti-Semitic than Christians and hate muslims but that&#39;s about it.  99% of it.  It is in the nature of being and nothingness that nothingness should be more and more nothingness so they can be all the more only redeemable by being.

<p>This is just an osmosis developed view but off the top of my head remember the original Christians thought of Christ as a normal man.  And a Jewish one at that.  So the Zionist fundamentalist Christians children will regress to that state easily enough.  Inevitably enough.  The certainty that such materialism alone gives them will entail that it is the Jewishness of Christ itself that is all that matters.  Even while they are not themselves Jewish. </p>

<p>Remember women didn&#39;t have souls until quite late in the day.  Fundamentalist Christianities materialistic atheists are like women who do not think women should have the vote. </p>

<p>I could put this better but you get the idea.  You have to stop thinking that what they say is true is something they expect everyone to accept.  Just the opposite.  Peoples agreeing with them is only important if there are people who don&#39;t that they can mediate for.  The definition of a cult.</p>

<p>Atheists are full of shit. Christianities atheists are full of shit. </p>

<p>What do you mean &quot;original&quot; Christians? You mean the Gnostics? they weren&#39;t technically, the &quot;original&quot; there were a lot of different sects going around at the time. Think about phylogeny, there&#39;s not one &quot;original&quot; human, there were a lot of different types of human in roughly the same time frame, geologically speaking. The not one original sect, like there&#39;s not one original human. </p>

<p>The Original Christians were Jews not Gnostics</p>

<p>Also, osmosis is the diffusion of water, through a semi-permeable membrane. maybe you should grab a dictionary before you go using words willy nilly. BTW, semipermeable means that some things can go through, and some things can&#39;t.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Learning through osmosis” is an analogy for natural, organic and  indirect way of learning. To learn through osmosis means to learn by immersion an exposure. For example, children learn their family’s native language through osmosis.</p>

<p>So if you want your child to learn something, immerse them as much as possible in whatever it is as a way of learning seamlessly. Learning a language is a prime example of this, however it can apply to anything, through a gradual, unconscious process.  i.e.  I am not obsessively researching this stuff.</p>

<p>Wait, how does thinking christ was just human equate to materialism. I don&#39;t follow.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s like saying Einstein&#39;s physics were just Jewish.</p>

<p>Also, Judaism =/= Zionism, Judaism is a religion, Zionism is a political movement. &quot; </p>

<p>All Judaism is Zionism.  This time next year in Jerusalem.  This judaism = / = Zionism is utter bullcrap.  I support Zionism as much as Judaism.  There just isn&#39;t one form of Zionism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking as a materialist, i place no importance on the Jewishness of Christ. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well Jesus was a Jew regardless of what you think but I too don&#39;t go overboard on that as Christ.  It is like the nazis describing Einsteins theories as Jew science cause he was Jewish.  It doesn&#39;t matter that he was Jewish his science is science is science.  I am not to sure many fundamentalist christianities materialistic atheists are of the same opinion.  I suspect that they, like the Nazis, think of it as Jew science. And Christ as Jew truth.</p>

There are things that once you accept, you can begin comprehending things better, and be more cogent in your argumentation. I agree with you that the government has gone too far in certain aspects of the war on terror, but it&#39;s not unprecedented. During WWII and the Great Depression, there were some things about the government that tended on the unfortunate, but we&#39;re still prosperous, we&#39;re still free, we&#39;re still evolving, and we&#39;re still learning.

<p>What has any of this straw man garbage have to do with anything?  You have bimbo catchphrases aplenty and an ability to deny what you have already accepted.  Climate change?  Coulter? 9/11?  What is this shit?  This is an illiterate  circle jerker talking to a mirror!</p>

<p>The simplest way of putting it is as I have put it and can be bothered putting it to an illiterrate MSM bimbo:</p>

<p><strong>Fundamentalist Christianities materialistic atheists are like like women who don&#39;t want women to vote.  Their atheism is insincere.

<li>Elie Wiesel has told us for over 50 years that he was tattooed at Auschwitz in 1944, and that his tattoo number is A7713. He has repeatedly said that he still has this original tattoo on his arm. Just last March in Dayton, Ohio, Elie met with the press, high school and college students, and 2300 members of the local community. As reported in the Dayton Daily News , one student asked Wiesel if he still has his concentration camp number and if it serves as a reminder of those terrible experiences. &quot;I don’t need that to remember, I think about my past every day,&quot; he responded. &quot;But I still have it on my arm – A7713. At that time, we were numbers. No names, no identity.&quot; </li>

<p>Here&#39;s an interview with Dr. Franciszek Piper, Director of the Auschwitz State Museum. The interviewer is Jewish, so you know there&#39;s no racial bias influencing his opinions.</p>

<p>It was featured on the Phil Donahue and Montel Williams TV shows. He completely debunks the Auschwitz &quot;gas chambers&quot;. Which honestly isn&#39;t hard to do because the closer you look at the official version of events the more obvious this becomes.</p>

<p>I believe that people were gassed at some point in time, just not with HCl. Fluoride would be the perfect agent (its a chief component of all nerve gasses) and wouldn&#39;t leave the traces who&#39;s absence holocaust deniers use to further their agenda.</p>

<p>Were not Hollerith tabulators used by the camps? Even if so this type of record keeping could hardly be called &quot;electronic&quot; because, I&#39;m guessing, output to paper would have happened somewhere down the line. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion or The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion</p>

<p><em>The Protocols is a fabricated document purporting to be factual. It was originally produced in Russia between 1897 and 1903, possibly by Pyotr Ivanovich Rachkovsky, head of the Paris office of the Russian Secret Police, and unknown others</em></p>

<p><em>Pyotr Ivanovich Rachkovsky (Russian: Пётр Иванович Рачковский; 1853–1910) was chief of Okhrana, the secret service in Imperial Russia. He was based in Paris from March 1885 to November 1902.</em></p>

<p><em>After the assassination of Alexander II of Russia in 1881, the government moved against various revolutionary factions operating in emigration or hiding out in Russia. Rachkovsky&#39;s principal mission was to compromise Russia&#39;s growing revolutionary movement.</em></p>

<p><em>Rachkovsky started as a possibly sincere, possibly duplicitous mover in St. Petersburg’s radical underground in the late 1870s, after having been dismissed (for leniency toward political exiles) from a job as a prosecutor for the czar’s government. He ended up running the show for the Okhrana, the Russian secret police, in Paris, where so many radicals considered dangerous to the czarist regime had immigrated. From 1885 until 1902, Rachkovsky was responsible for keeping anarchists under surveillance and on the run—and also, in many cases, financed and supplied with ideas. . . . “[P]rominent among his early initiatives were provocations designed to lure credulous émigrés into the most heinous crimes of which they may never have otherwise conceived.” Rachkovsky’s aim was to entrap his targets into committing acts that would help ensure that his job seemed of vital importance to the czar. This guaranteed him a solid berth in Paris that was lucrative both in salary and prestige [and] in opportunities for corrupt under-the-radar dealings with a French government doing heavy business with Russia.&quot;[1]</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that anyone who feels that hundreds of thousands of people all conspired and lied about a huge event in their lives needs to start thinking about what rational, unbiased thought actually is.</p>

<p>I fully support the idea that anyone can discuss Holocaust denial in whatever public forum they please. It&#39;s simple freedom of speech, and also serves to let us understand who these people actually are. In 99% of all cases, they turn out to be Neo-Nazis, Hitler apologists, KKK members and other sorts. It&#39;s a simple fiction, and if these people want to keep peddling it, against all rational thought and contrary evidence, they should be more than welcome too and ridiculed for doing so.</p>

<p>FYI: People <em>did</em> take up the &quot;Holocaust proof prize money&quot;. It was just never awarded and the denial industry ignored all comments.</p>

I pointed out that there are hundreds of thousands of different sources, from survivor biographies to servicemen diaries to Nazi confessions, that all say pretty much the same thing. You don&#39;t have to accept everything about what they are all saying, but if you want to be intellectually honest, you <em>must</em> accept the similarities between the sources as historical fact. In order to refute what those sources are saying, you will need to refute each one individually. Or even refute a large percentage of them, showing that they are probably unreliable. The fact remains that no ones ever done this, so what these sources say stand as accepted historical fact to all but the most intentionally ignorant and blind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a question I&#39;ve wanted to ask an open-minded Jew for a while - what do you make of the fact that the word &quot;Holocaust&quot; is from Judaism and means &quot;burnt offering,&quot; which was a ritual sacrifice performed as part of the Jewish Religion.  In other words, Jewish people <em>chose</em> to refer to the genocide of their people using a word which denotes ritual sacrifice in their own language?  That&#39;s a very strange choice isn&#39;t it?  I mean, it seems to imply that the Germans were engaged in a ritual sacrifice of the Jews (which is to say the Germans were performing a Holy rite).  It seems to me the last thing I would want to do is attribute to my butchers a holy significance from my own religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno, why did the German&#39;s refer to the Holocaust in German as  Endloesung der Judenfrage meaning &quot;Final Solution.&quot; </p>

<p>Why did Christians at the <a href="http://www.smabears.org/">Baptist</a> school I attended in High School call me a Kike? Short for Kikel in Yiddish meaning circle referring to the circular shape of a Kippah? Why not call me something offensive in your own language?</p>

<p>Why are Baptists sooo into religious cleansing? Baptists did start the Jews for Jesus movement.  </p>

<p>Holocaust as far as I know was initially a Greek word, Jews adopted it for sacrificial offerings on the Altar. Why it&#39;s still used today I&#39;m unsure (it&#39;s actually pretty creepy). Jews refer to the Holocaust as &quot;HaShoah&quot; meaning calamity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not.</p>

<p>The Septuagint Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible refers to a &quot;Korban Olah&quot; as a &quot;Holocustus&quot; in comparison to a similar type of Greek ritual sacrifice. In every subsequent translation it&#39;s referred to as a &quot;burnt offering&quot;. I have never once in the years studying these topics heard of a &quot;Korban Olah&quot; being called a &quot;Holocaust&quot;. </p>

<p>The term &quot;holocaust&quot; to describe a massacre was in common use in the English language for hundreds of years. It only became known as &quot;The Holocaust&quot; sometime in the 70s.</p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that the term &quot;Holocaust&quot; to describe the attempted extermination of Jews, Gypsies, gays and others in Europe was an invention of Americans. Secular Jews called it &quot;The Shoah&quot; and religious Jews called it &quot;The European Destruction&quot; or &quot;Churban Europa&quot;. </p>

<p>So Jews didn&#39;t &quot;choose&quot; to call the genocide &quot;The Holocaust&quot; as most Jews used other terms to refer to it and it makes no sense why they would use an obscure Greek translation of a minor ancient ritual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It <em>does</em> refer to a ritual sacrifice, but it&#39;s a very obscure term that&#39;s almost entirely unused. In fact, outside of Greek bibles, I would venture to say that it&#39;s <em>never</em> used. I&#39;ve heard of a &quot;Korban Olah&quot; before and seen it referenced countless times and seen countless translations that refer to it as a &quot;burnt offering&quot;. Before you linked to this Wikipedia page I have never seen or heard of it being called a &quot;holocaust&quot;. Probably because I can&#39;t read Greek.</p>

<p>So you want to know &quot;what an open minded person makes of it&quot;? I would have to say that an &quot;open minded person&quot; (which I deem myself to be) sees people drawing conclusions and making connections where there aren&#39;t any.</p>

<p>How can you say there is &quot;no connection&quot; when there quite clearly is - this is an undeniable fact.  I will grant you that the usage <em>may</em> have more to do with popular usage having nothing to do with the original meaning, but for you to say there is &quot;no connection&quot; is beyond absurd.  You will notice that my original post was a question - not a statement. That means I was seeking information - not merely attempting to impart it.  Specifically I am trying to wrap my head around why this word which refers to Jews being burned in ovens apparently has its roots in the original meaning of the word which is &quot;Burnt Sacrifice&quot;, which was a Jewish sacrificial religious practice - you are claiming that is just some kind of huge coincidence, and I am not buying that unless you can demonstrate it.  In the meantime I must remain open to the possibility that this word was specifically chosen by people that knew its original meaning.    </p>

<p>The term was pretty much popularized in 1970, a full 25 years after the war, by a TV movie called &quot;The Holocaust&quot;. The movie took its name from the slang word meaning, according to the OED, &quot;a large massacre of people&quot;.

<p>Really?  You can&#39;t see the significance between the fact that the definition of &quot;Holocaust&quot; is &quot;burnt offering&quot; which refers to a religious ritual sacrifice in which the animal is completely burned, and the genocide of jews in which they were burned in ovens.  Its pretty god damn weird to refer to your people&#39;s own genocide with a term of ritual sacrifice don&#39;t you think.  Am I really to believe that when they started referring to the genocide there wasn&#39;t a single Jewish scholar that was like &quot;Hm, maybe Holocaust isn&#39;t the best choice of words here.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering that it was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_%28TV_miniseries%29">freaking</a> 1970s <em>movie producer</em> who popularized the term, no I don&#39;t think any Jewish scholar had a &quot;choice&quot; in what word to use.</p>

<p>Besides, like I said, it&#39;s an obscure ancient Greek word that was occasionally applied to Jewish rituals. It&#39;s common usage by the 19th and 20th century, though, was &quot;a large slaughter of people.&quot; Heck, the Greek word wasn&#39;t even in English! It was in freaking Greek! So no, the likelihood of anyone knowing the alternate meaning in 1978 is slim to none.</p>

<p>Nobody had Wikipedia in the 70s, so I doubt many people even knew about its original meaning when it became popular.</p>

<p>So no. The fact that it had some other meaning 2000 years ago in Greece is completely insignificant. It&#39;s a curiosity at best. Seriously, where do you even dredge these things up from? What Stormfront affiliate alleged that &quot;Hey guys! Did you know that there is an ancient Jewish ritual offering that translated to Ancient Greek is holocaustos? That must mean that the Jews started the Holocaust themselves as a way to sacrifice their own kind for personal gain!&quot;</p>

<p>I simply have difficulty following the chain of logic (or lack there of) that lead to this idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are an imbecile.  None of what you are saying changes the fact that the term refers to ritual animal sacrifice.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, how would a Rabbi have known this? And more importantly, how would <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Berger_%28producer%29">Buzz Berger</a>, the man who is credited with popularized the phrase, have known this? As you can see from BibleGateway.com it&#39;s not at all a common word to use for burnt offerings. You would need a classics professor to tell you this and I doubt that NBC consulted many classics professionals when doing a series on the 20th century. It&#39;s not used in the Hebrew Bible, the Talmud, the Mishnah nor any English translations thereof, nor any place I could find except the original Greek Septuagint. So it&#39;s not a common Jewish term at all and very obscure outside of classical intellectual circles. The fact that it was <em>once</em> used <em>in a foreign ancient and dead language</em> to describe animal sacrifices means absolutely nothing more than a simple curiosity.</p>

<p>Besides, you still haven&#39;t explained yourself. Even if everything you said was true, let&#39;s say. That in Judaism the word &quot;holocaust&quot; is used to describe &quot;burnt offerings&quot;, and that the word was in use by all Jews immediately following 1945. So what? What does it mean that this word was then used to describe the destruction of European Jewry?</p>

<p>FYI: The literal meaning of the word is &quot;large destructive fire&quot; and has always been used as such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s original meaning is actually a <em>Greek</em> sacrifice, as you can read on the Wikipedia page you linked to. Its usage to refer to a type of <em>Jewish</em> sacrifice is very archaic and not well known at all.</p>

<p>The technical definition of the word is akin to &quot;conflagration&quot;. Wikipedia specifically states that the term wasn&#39;t even in use to refer to Hitlers actions until the 70s and was previously defined by OED as &quot;Large massacre of people&quot;, so it&#39;s kind of the perfect word to use. I&#39;m not sure why you keep harping on it&#39;s usage as a Greek translation of the Hebrew &quot;Korban Olah&quot;, as it&#39;s completely non relevant as it&#39;s not the original meaning of the word, the accepted meaning of the word in the 1940s nor the accepted meaning of the word today. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what there is to wrap ones head around as I simply do not see any connection</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The part of the argument for denial that always gets me angry is the argument on the number of people that were systematically rounded up based on their race and exterminated either with gas chambers trucks or just flat out worked to death. </p>

<p>You fail to realize when you make this argument that you are essentially saying &quot;Nazis rounded up and murdered only 300,000 or so people..I have these Red Cross documents so that makes it ok&quot;</p>

<p>The populating of Boston proper is roughly 600,000 people. If someone rounded up say...300,000 people based on say...those who had at least one Italian ancestor worked them to death,shot entire villages and gas and cremate some then.. its ok as long as they did not do it to the 4 million people in the greater Boston area? </p>

<p>Fucking insane and childish argument if you ask me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many think that WWII was a mistake?   70-100 Million deaths being a common estimate of casualties.  The Nazis wish for the Jews deportation being blocked by the allies and the possibility of diplomatic aid for other eastern europeans being blocked by the war too.  The Nazis even wanted, OK not very trustworthy, an alliance with the poles at first!  The &#39;what if&#39;  possibilities involved in 100 million deaths deserve <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and it is not conspiritard  of it to consider these matters.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it is a rehash from memory of a &#39;what if&#39; idea I had in another thread.  It was about how great it was to fight some noble wars like WWII.  My counter arguement was ..why?  what did it accomplish really?  How. in. the. name. of. fuck. can. you. possibly. have done. any. worse. than. 100 million. people. dead?  Almost anything might have been better.  Might have saved millions of Jews.  And millions of eastern europeans.  Even stalin had a nervous breakdown of disbelief that things had actually gotten that bad.  It was, in a strange way, one of his most redeeming moments.  Like he knew what it meant was coming.</p>

<p>And the allies did fuck all for four years anyway so what the hell difference would it have made?  They were in practice just striking a pose that watched over millions of deaths.</p>

<p>Edit:  Remember the allies had spent years building Hitler up so he and the commies would destroy each other and they would then come in and wipe out the shattered remnants of both.  What would be the point of having done that if there was no confrontation.  There had to be one and it needed a trigger.  Winding up the Poles with false bravado and reassurance was essential to that end.  How the hell could they have helped the Poles in the short term?  The needed a red line from the Poles to the Nazis if all their efforts were not going to have been in vain!  They cast them to their own delusional bravado like kittens in a sack into a river.  It was essential that they did this to trigger the end game.  They might very well have been helping the Nazis with France so they wouldn&#39;t have to join the French in France and do a repeat of WWI.  This is pure speculation of course but if you think about it what else could they have done based on their preceding activities?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A) People were convinced that the Jews killed Jesus, the random Christian European farmer or villager would probably have been infuriated with the mear site of a Jew, imagine how he must have felt when the Jew came to collect taxes.</p>

<p>B) Many monarchs, princes, and lords borrowed and owed money to Jews, why should they pay the Jews back if they can just expell the Jews and erase their debt that way? Look up how the Spanish got the weapons they needed to drive the Moors out of Spain. Hint: Shortly before the Spanish Inquisition.</p>

<p>C) As instructed in the Talmud, literacy became a religious mandate for the Jews, literacy makes a person smarter, smarter people make more money, and have more influence even while being persecuted and/or treated unfairly than their mostly illiterate therefore stupid counterparts. This lead to people being wary of Jewish power, this resulted in, u guessed it, more expulsions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends. Various European and near eastern tribes were always at each other&#39;s throats, so it&#39;s hard to distinguish early spats with the jews from normal neighborly infighting in those regions. </p>

<p>However we do know that around the 11th century Europeans started to develop a kind of genocidal bloodlust based almost entirely on religious hatred. In addition to attacking jews they also went after the muslims, and eventually they started attacking each other because one side didn&#39;t like the way the other side prayed to Jesus. These were large scale affairs fought by professional or semi-professional armies that hadn&#39;t even existed in Europe since the collapse of the western Roman empire.</p>

<p>Sure it is. The &quot;harm&quot; attributed to jews is just a bunch of silly old canards invented by religious bigots in christian Europe, and carried on today by innumerates who don&#39;t understand the time value of money. Pre-christian Romans actually respected and admired jews, much like asian buddhists and Indian hindus do today.</p>

<p>Most of the European hatred against jews was based on religious bigotry, not anything that jews actually did. Europeans were insanely religious until about 150 years ago. They fought a ridiculous number of wars over stupid religious bickering.</p>

<p>The same reason why the native american Indians ended up in reservation.</p>

<p><em>There are about 310 Indian reservations in the United States, meaning not all of the country&#39;s 550-plus recognized tribes have a reservation—some tribes have more than one reservation, some share reservations, while others have none.</em></p>

<p>Elie Wiesel Cons The World <a href="http://vimeo.com/43374624">http://vimeo.com/43374624</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Elie Wiesel has told us for over 50 years that he was tattooed at Auschwitz in 1944, and that his tattoo number is A7713. He has repeatedly said that he still has this original tattoo on his arm. Just last March in Dayton, Ohio, Elie met with the press, high school and college students, and 2300 members of the local community. As reported in the Dayton Daily News , one student asked Wiesel if he still has his concentration camp number and if it serves as a reminder of those terrible experiences. &quot;I don’t need that to remember, I think about my past every day,&quot; he responded. &quot;But I still have it on my arm – A7713. At that time, we were numbers. No names, no identity.&quot; </li>

<p>Here&#39;s an interview with Dr. Franciszek Piper, Director of the Auschwitz State Museum. The interviewer is Jewish, so you know there&#39;s no racial bias influencing his opinions.</p>

<p>It was featured on the Phil Donahue and Montel Williams TV shows. He completely debunks the Auschwitz &quot;gas chambers&quot;. Which honestly isn&#39;t hard to do because the closer you look at the official version of events the more obvious this becomes.</p>

<p>Auschwitz was repeatedly visited by Red Cross inspection teams who were allowed to speak to prisoner representatives alone, in order to hear first-hand of any mistreatment, chicanery, interruption of mail and parcel delivery, health concerns, food and ration matters etc.</p>
