    <div class="md"><p>There are a number of errors here. One is that you think the people who believe in the nutbag theories are simply more &#39;open minded&#39;. Which makes no logical sense, I can use Russels Teapot for this, and I hardly think anyone intelligent is going to believe in that assertion and be labelled &#39;open minded&#39;, instead perhaps just call them gullible.</p>

<p>Second is that you think I don&#39;t investigate and take seriously the theories that I laugh at. Which is simply ad hominem. Any attack on me personally since you know basically nothing about me and my understanding and investigative habits, is simply not an argument at all.</p>

<p>Anyway, the vast majority of the &#39;theories&#39; that I laugh at here at ones with absolutely no evidence anyway. They are ones that say &quot;hey look... this is something that COULD have happened!&quot; That&#39;s nothing, its word vomit, its not to be taken seriously by anyone who honestly wants to have intelligent discussion on a topic. &quot;Hey this COULD have happened&quot; is the equivalent of absolutely no critical thinking, and an imagination with plausibility being the factor without interest into probability, likelihood, occams razor, and a plethora of other common sense features.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really know. I think kids died, people died, we don&#39;t know the truth entirely though. I find the official story to be manipulated. I think the entire libor connection is laughable, I think the idea that nothing happened and all the people are actors is lunacy.</p>

<p>There is a lot to answer for and it probably has to do more with our lack of proper care for mentally unstable people and the gross over use of anti depression Meds, than anything else. The failure of an unbiased media, the failure of mental healthcare, and the manipulation of such unavoidable events being used by the government as tools to further their agenda are far more believable, and logical, and plausible, than everyone is actors and the entire town of medical, fire, municipal, and police are all being kept quiet in a conspiracy that would contain dozens if not hundreds of necessary accomplices, or people being complicite due to seeing too much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh cool, cause a question directed at me through replying directly to me, and yet another direct response to me are definitely not intended for me.</p>

<p>I just made a post about this like 2 minutes ago actually. </p>

<p>Someone who is going to post things and resent them being questioned, or people who post postulation and then when asked or responded to they merely go to the &quot;Go look and research it yourself&quot;. </p>

<p>I cannot say truly if you know what you are talking about. I can promise you that the vast majority of people you would claim to be attempting to enlighten or awaken... They will just say &quot;hah look at that guy he made a claim and them copped out totally when asked about it&quot;</p>

<p>This whole &quot;Go research it yourself&quot; fad, and the whole posting things and then &quot;come up with whatever you think it means&quot; is simply garbage.</p>

<p>It boils down to, if you think you are awakened, and are against all of these horrible and shitty and evil people who are committing conspiracy against people all the time.</p>

<p>If you believe that, and then you are not honestly trying to help people find the facts, or lead them in the right direction. If you simply blather out totally inane and useless words like &quot;You can discern of them ...&quot; blah blah blah...How are you not an accomplice in this then?</p>

<p>It&#39;s garbage, pure and simple. Even if you do know what you are talking about, using garbage like that will never ever bring any respect or serious care for what you have to say.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve used both of those now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would you like me to go through your posting history and point out the <em>many</em> times that you made it clear that you&#39;re a white supremacist? It wouldn&#39;t be hard. Going though less than a week of your posts, I found:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An example of how American television is being used to commit a slow genocide against the white race. Sure, they&#39;re talking about Africa in the article, but do you really think it hasn&#39;t occurred to any clever Jewish eugenicists to do the same thing in America, targeting white Christians? Do you really think it didn&#39;t occur to them fifty years ago? Do you think these kinds of population reduction messages aren&#39;t in American television every day?</p>

<p>The blacks will give up their guns. The Asians will give up their guns. The Latinos will give up their guns. They all feed from the liberal Democrat buffet. They are accustomed to doing what they are told to get the gravy. But the whites won&#39;t give up their guns. Nor will the Jews. The whites, because they are stubborn, and the Jews, because they are running things and don&#39;t need to.</p>

<p>David Duke is one of the few people making a clear statement of the threat to Western civilization, and to the white race, by Zionism, and by Jewish social engineering and propaganda. Let those who have ears, hear, and those who have eyes, see. As for the rest, what do they matter? They are zombies.</p>

<p>The biggest first-world problem is the slow genocide that is being committed against the white race. Whites are being taught through the media to hate themselves, their history, and their culture, not to marry, to abort their babies, have children later in life, and to have fewer children.
Meanwhile, the sperm count of white males in many Western countries, including the United States, has dropped by over a third due to chemicals in the food, water and air.
White countries are being flooded with non-white immigrants, who are also being taught to hate whites and white culture by their schools and their media. Whites are trained from birth to intermarry and interbreed with non-whites, and to prefer a non-white mate to a white mate. Black women are trained to seek out white husbands. The net result is racial genocide against whites. That&#39;s the biggest first-world problem.</p>

<p>It&#39;s <em>really</em> obvious that you&#39;re a white supremacist. Anyone with a brain could see that.</p>
