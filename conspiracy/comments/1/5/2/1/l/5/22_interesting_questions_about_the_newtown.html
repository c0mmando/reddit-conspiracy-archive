       22 Interesting Questions about the Newtown Shootings
      </p>
      <p>
       1) According to the official story, Adam Lanza was found with his
older brother's ID, and it was not stolen. However, older brother Ryan - who officials say is very cooperative - claims
not to have seen his brother since 2010. Where would Adam get this ID?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Why does the use of his brother's ID not qualify as theft?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) According to the official story, Adam Lanza was wearing a black outfit with a mask and bulletproof vest. Why would he wear a bulletproof vest if he planned to kill himself?
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The medical examiner asserts that all wounds were caused by a rifle or other long weapon, and police/FBI say that the school was littered with .223 (rifle) casings. But Adam Lanza was found dead in the school with only handguns - a rifle was found in the trunk of his car. If he did not fire the rifle that left casings on the ground, who did?
      </p>
      <p>
       5) The local hospital went into lockdown and cleared four trauma rooms, but received only three patients, two of them dead children (according to the official story) and one mildly wounded adult.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) Why were there persistent reports that Mrs. Lanza was a kindergarten teacher, and that she died at the school, when the new official story is that she was not connected to the school and was killed at home?
      </p>
      <p>
       7) What happened to the woodsman in a black jacket and camo pants who was arrested and handcuffed outside the school as he shouted to parents, "It wasn't me!"
      </p>
      <p>
       8 ) What happened to the dark van/SUV that the police surrounded in the parking lot, or the maroon sedan with a blown-out back window they were on the lookout for?
      </p>
      <p>
       9) The official story is that Nancy Lanza was a gun collector who obeyed the law. But since 20-year-olds are not permitted to buy guns or ammo or carry guns in Connecticut, why would she give her "autistic" son access to both guns and ammo?
      </p>
      <p>
       10) Why were parents told on Friday that "if you haven't been reunited with your child by now it's already over"? Does anyone imagine that real parents of real children would simply say, "Okay, the show's over, let's go home now"?
      </p>
      <p>
       11) Would real parents of real children really be satisfied with pictures of their children? Wouldn't they demand to see their children one last time firsthand?
      </p>
      <p>
       12) Why did police say on Friday that they were going to leave the children's bodies rotting in the school until Sunday, then Saturday morning announce that they had spirited those bodies away in the middle of the night?
      </p>
      <p>
       13) A child asserts that he/she heard someone say, "Put your hands up," followed by the reply, "Don't shoot." This indicates that the police took a suspect into custody inside the school. But if that was Adam Lanza, how did he kill himself after that point?
      </p>
      <p>
       14) Another child asserts that he/she saw a man pinned down to the ground with handcuffs on. Again, this indicates that the police took a suspect into custody. If that was Adam Lanza, how did he then kill himself? If it wasn't Adam Lanza, who was it?
      </p>
      <p>
       15) When Ryan Lanza was falsely identified as the shooter, who deleted his Facebook profile and created many others in his name?
      </p>
      <p>
       16) Why won't police tell us where they found the Henry repeating rifle, the Enfield rifle, and the shotgun?
      </p>
      <p>
       17) Did the school have one or more security cameras? What do they show?
      </p>
      <p>
       18) Why did a police officer specifically mention, on radio, that "they're coming at me through this wood," followed by a fellow officer saying, "This is it"?
      </p>
      <p>
       19) One officer in the school said, "We've got one suspect down." Who was that? Down in this situation generally means in custody (on the ground and cuffed), not dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       20) Why did police assign an individual state trooper to every grieving family, whether the family wants such "protection" or not?
      </p>
      <p>
       21) Why are Adam's brother Ryan Lanza and his roommates in custody?
      </p>
      <p>
       22) What does it mean that Nancy Lanza's brother is Kingston Police Officer James Champion, who lives next door to the former Lanza home?
      </p>
      <p>

        EDIT: I JUST WANTED TO ADD: I personally did not come up with these questions. This is something a friend of mine posted on his facebook and I thought he was making a good point. Also, I am unaware if this was one of those massive re-post, hence the apology in the title. Thanks for all your opinions!

       On a side note, I would like to add it was pretty unbelievable how all the news, media, was reporting incorrect information. Like, the mother had no association with the school, she was not a teacher, etc. etc. Everything about this event is and was just disgusting!

       Absolutely. The whole situation is sickening. I didn't get to see the mistakes in the media live, but I've heard a lot about the problems in the reporting. It's all suspicious, and those questions should be a really good starting point for anyone concerned about what really happened. It's important that we try to not make any unjustifiable claims or assumptions, and just simply try to find answers to such questions. Thanks for posting your questions!

       It's not really that unbelievable. The media are just as eager as the rest of us to find out what happened in a situation like this, and in their haste to be the first to disseminate information they aren't able to stop and check all the facts amongst the sheer chaos of a mass shooting like this. Conflicting reports and ultimately inaccurate information are to be taken as a given (hence why some of the less sensationalist news agencies usually add a disclaimer such as "early reports suggest" or "this has not been confirmed").

       I like how the most rational response here got downvoted. Typical conspiracy nuts, only allowing information that confirms the stupid ideas in their heads. They'll never know the truth, because they only look for confirmation, not information. Oh well, at least we can amuse ourselves by watching the crazies twitch.

       My friend from highschool told me. That doesn't confirm it 100% in any way but his sister was in class with Adam Lanza since the 6th grade. He also told me that Adam didn't attend the last part of his senior year at the highschool either, which several news agencies have already confirmed. Ill be visiting him and speaking with his sister in mid January. All my interviews will be filmed.

       Does anyone have proof of these 3 statements? If so then parents in Newtown are unlike parents anywhere else in the world.  Is there a link for the fact that parents never saw their kids again, only got a goddamn picture of the kid?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        10) Why were parents told on Friday that "if you haven't been reunited with your child by now it's already over"? Does anyone imagine that real parents of real children would simply say, "Okay, the show's over, let's go home now"?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        No, real parents do not behave that way.  "We don't know if Susie is alive or dead so let's just head home for dinner..."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        11) Would real parents of real children really be satisfied with pictures of their children? Wouldn't they demand to see their children one last time firsthand?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real parents would not. And why should they?  Even mutilated soldiers from Iraq are sent home to their families.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        12) Why did police say on Friday that they were going to leave the children's bodies rotting in the school until Sunday, then Saturday morning announce that they had spirited those bodies away in the middle of the night?

       I can answer all your questions just by telling you that you are retarded, however that won't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) How is this pertinent to a conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) It does. He's dead though so you can't really try him for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Wrong. He was not wearing a bulletproof vest. That was initial media hype. He was wearing a dark fishing vest with lots of pockets.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) There was a rifle. The police recovered a black Bushmaster XM-15 at the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Okay? What's your point?
      </p>
      <p>
       6) Media hype and sensationalism. Just like they thought that the shooter at first was a parent of one of the kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       7) I have not seen any reports of this. [citation needed]
      </p>
      <p>
       8) Van got caught. Unrelated to the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       9) She didn't give him access.
      </p>
      <p>
       10) Completely irrelevant. To anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       11) Actually, no. Contrary to what you may believe, parents are not all about seeing the shredded bodies of their children.
      </p>
      <p>
       12) You are misinformed. The bodies were removed as soon as the scene was declared safe. All bodies were at local hospitals on the first night. Nothing was "whisked away"
      </p>
      <p>
       13) Again, wrong. Adam Lanza said put your hands up. The "dont shoot" was a child or a woman, followed by gunshots.
      </p>
      <p>
       14) Let's believe the child and not the local police and first responders, all of whom must clearly be in on the conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       15) No one deleted his facebook. It stayed up and he tried to defend himself on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       16) They found the shotgun in the trunk of Adam's car. The Enfield and the Henry were in his mother's gun safe. None of those guns are of the caliber used in the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       17) Why would they release that to you? Or anyone really? Do we really want MSNBC circlejerking while showing children dying?
      </p>
      <p>
       18) Police said a lot during the first few minutes. Just listen to their radio recordings. No one had any clue what was going on anywhere. Complete chaos. For all they knew, it could have been aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       19) Yes, he said we have a suspect down when they found the body of Lanza. At that time they still thought there might be other shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       20) Because the media are predators. Did you see how they were hounding kids for interviews like vultures? The last thing that a family of a toddler who was just killed needs is a shitfuck journalist in their face.
      </p>
      <p>
       21) Ryan, nor his roommates are in custody. Questioned and released.
      </p>
      <p>
       22) It means nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your friend is a fucking idiot. Tell him I said so.

       It seems like that thread is just a bunch of people bashing the OP. A big deal was made about how the first question refers to there not being any evidence of dead children. Whether you (generally speaking) like it or not, I believe this to be a valid question. Even after OKC we saw the bodies of the victims, including children.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is craving to see pictures of dead children as much as they are craving for some concrete evidence. Obviously the MSM can't be trusted with providing that, as we already know in this subreddit. Too bad there's no such thing as real journalism anymore.....

       Very different situations. In one the building was literally blown apart there was active attempts being made to rescue victims trapped under rubble, etc.. With the building torn open you will of course see the human remains. In this case though the shooting occurred in a closed building. You wouldn't want your kids dead body printed on newspapers and in magazines would you? They're being discreet because its the right thing to do.

       Exactly. The entire thing could've been orchestrated for all I know. I don't know any of the people involved. I bet a pretty large majority don't know the people involved either, whether it be victims or law enforcement or medical staff, etc.

       It is a logical possibility but the sheer resources needed to orchestrate such an event would be colossal. It would be a logistical nightmare. Compare that possibility with the possibility that it
       <em>
        wasn't

       orchestrated and was simply a nutter with a gun - Occam's razor - and which seems more probable?

       If you don't trust what comes from 'mainstream media', what do you trust as a source? What will help make you conclude what actually happened (with respect to the "I'm not saying it was...I don't know yet" part)?

       At this point, I probably won't completely trust anything, unless it can be 100% proven to be legitimate. For instance, if video evidence is produced, I'd be more inclined to believe that, as long as it hasn't been manipulated in any way or censored or anything like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for this case, there isn't much that can change. It's already been however many days. Anything that comes out is questionable. Had there been independent journalists involved from Hour Zero, that'd be something.

       While it does seem that something fishy is going on with the whole situation, I'm certain that the parents were not involved in any sort of conspiracy. My good friend was born and raised in Newtown, his entire family went through its fantastic school system and he personally knew many of the families that lost loved ones during this tragedy. They are real people experiencing a horrible tragedy. I got to visit there last August and from what I could tell it was a very small community that would of never ever expected this to happen. I'm going to get the chance to go back and visit in mid January and if anyone is interested in having their questions answered by people who knew Adam Lanza through school, or have questions for students that may have been inside the school during the shooting, PM them to me.  I will be filming any interviews I give and if you want your question to be answered please make it respectful.  Talking about these sorts of things is never easy for anyone.

      <p>
       1) According to the official story, Adam Lanza was found with his older brother's ID, and it was not stolen. However, older brother Ryan - who officials say is very cooperative - claims not to have seen his brother since 2010. Where would Adam get this ID?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        It is likely he had his ID for a while. There are reports that he was trying to buy a weapon at a Dicks sporting goods and was turned away. Because he was not old enough to buy a weapon at his age I suspect this was why he had the ID.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Why does the use of his brother's ID not qualify as theft?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        It does.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       3) According to the official story, Adam Lanza was wearing a black outfit with a mask and bulletproof vest. Why would he wear a bulletproof vest if he planned to kill himself?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why would he kill a bunch of kids? This is trying to get inside someones head. He likely wanted to end it on his own terms.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The medical examiner asserts that all wounds were caused by a rifle or other long weapon, and police/FBI say that the school was littered with .223 (rifle) casings. But Adam Lanza was found dead in the school with only handguns - a rifle was found in the trunk of his car. If he did not fire the rifle that left casings on the ground, who did?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The rifle was the murder weapon on all of the vitims in the school. Apparently he turned the handgun on himself probably a lot easier than trying to blow your brains out with a bushmaster.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       5) The local hospital went into lockdown and cleared four trauma rooms, but received only three patients, two of them dead children (according to the official story) and one mildly wounded adult.
      </p>
      <p>
       *
       <em>
        Sadly I think they expected it was going to be a much busier day at that ER. *
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       6) Why were there persistent reports that Mrs. Lanza was a kindergarten teacher, and that she died at the school, when the new official story is that she was not connected to the school and was killed at home?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        No idea. Likely the fog of war effect. Information can sometimes get screwed up.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       7) What happened to the woodsman in a black jacket and camo pants who was arrested and handcuffed outside the school as he shouted to parents, "It wasn't me!"
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I have seen people say it was ﻿ a degenerate who was arrested for stealing copper from a construction site earlier this year.
Likely he was in the woods and was arrested.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       8 ) What happened to the dark van/SUV that the police surrounded in the parking lot, or the maroon sedan with a blown-out back window they were on the lookout for?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        From what I can tell there was only a red or maroon van with its back window blown out. It was surrounded at a gas station. Reports say they took the driver into custody after they reported them disposing of something in a bin. Probably just a parent or something.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       9) The official story is that Nancy Lanza was a gun collector who obeyed the law. But since 20-year-olds are not permitted to buy guns or ammo or carry guns in Connecticut, why would she give her "autistic" son access to both guns and ammo?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Good question.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       10) Why were parents told on Friday that "if you haven't been reunited with your child by now it's already over"? Does anyone imagine that real parents of real children would simply say, "Okay, the show's over, let's go home now"?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This is kind of revolting for you to start implicating their parents in this. Sorry.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       11) Would real parents of real children really be satisfied with pictures of their children? Wouldn't they demand to see their children one last time firsthand?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Some yes some no. Not your kid. Leave the parents out of this.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       12) Why did police say on Friday that they were going to leave the children's bodies rotting in the school until Sunday, then Saturday morning announce that they had spirited those bodies away in the middle of the night?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        They didn't spirit them away. The coroners were processing all night and most of the next day. Sad really.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       13) A child asserts that he/she heard someone say, "Put your hands up," followed by the reply, "Don't shoot." This indicates that the police took a suspect into custody inside the school. But if that was Adam Lanza, how did he kill himself after that point?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This is already addressed.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       14) Another child asserts that he/she saw a man pinned down to the ground with handcuffs on. Again, this indicates that the police took a suspect into custody. If that was Adam Lanza, how did he then kill himself? If it wasn't Adam Lanza, who was it?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Again this is probably the degenerate .
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       15) When Ryan Lanza was falsely identified as the shooter, who deleted his Facebook profile and created many others in his name?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Facebook suspended the account along with an unrelated Adam Lanza a while later. Assholes made the fakes.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       16) Why won't police tell us where they found the Henry repeating rifle, the Enfield rifle, and the shotgun?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I heard them say that they found those at the Lanza home.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       17) Did the school have one or more security cameras? What do they show?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Probably horrible shit.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       18) Why did a police officer specifically mention, on radio, that "they're coming at me through this wood," followed by a fellow officer saying, "This is it"?
      </p>
      <p>
       ** I heard "Coming through on the left!" **
      </p>
      <p>
       19) One officer in the school said, "We've got one suspect down." Who was that? Down in this situation generally means in custody (on the ground and cuffed), not dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Down means dead.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       20) Why did police assign an individual state trooper to every grieving family, whether the family wants such "protection" or not?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Do you have reports someone did not want this?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       21) Why are Adam's brother Ryan Lanza and his roommates in custody?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        They aren't
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       22) What does it mean that Nancy Lanza's brother is Kingston Police Officer James Champion, who lives next door to the former Lanza home?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        She lives next to her brother.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I took out the degenerates name. I have zero proof of this. We all know that someone was taken into custody in the woods. The question is do we have any evidence he did anything wrong? No.

       I live near at least two schools.  If there was an incident at one of them involving police, I'd probably go outside and see what is up.  Usually around home, I wear my 20+ year old camo BDUs and one of my hoodies because my house is also a farm, and these are my "beater" clothes and I don't care much if they get dirty.  Now if I saw police coming at me while looking at what was going on, and they started rushing towards me, I'd assume that they were chasing someone towards me, and I'd be trying to get out of their way, which they might interpret as me "fleeing".  However, if they said "you in the hoodie stop and put your hands up", I'd stop and wouldn't be upset if they took me into custody, because nowadays walking around is suspicious as we're all lazy.

       No one can say right now.From what I have heard (which isn't a lot) it was a drifter that was arrested in that area for stealing copper. It is pretty easy to imagine someone of that type not wanting to stick around after hearing gunshots in a school and the whole CT state police dept showing up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't seen any reports of him running into the woods. For all  we know he was in the woods when the shooting started. It really is just speculation. It will be released at some point who this person was. We can see if it makes sense then.

       Why...yes. Yes, I expect that from a source that touts themselves as reputable. You know how you do that? Don't fling any report you can possibly get around, and don't broadcast 24/7 and give the whole thing its own theme song. Sure it's way more "boring" that way, but it's how you get accurate information. This is fucking journalism 101.
