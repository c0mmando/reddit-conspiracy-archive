       It's geared specifically towards Occupy, but he speaks well about the general state of things in our society. I've only seen one of his films, but I highly recommend PsyWar (

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's not belief.  Belief is the word that is used for a scenario the validity regarding which one has no external validation or evidence for.  Quite the contrary, there is not only much evidence pointing to a source of nefarious power on this planet, but - irrespective of the particular source of this nefarious power - the fact of the matter is that the final recommendation given by the link itself (and pretty much the very point being made in the entire post) is to simply be a good person that works for the benefit of others, that tries to be a beacon of constructive aid on the planet, and that does not allow themselves to get negatively swept away by much evil, or positively swept away by much good.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not something to be "believed" or "not believed".  This is a reality of existence that has proven over and over and over again its benefit and worth for the growth and development of a being.

       <p>
        I think it just aims to justify the role the elites play in this world, as though they are these alien super entities helping humanity in their spiritual evolution. Strikes me as a red herring.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then you simply did not understand the information clearly.  That's okay, as I understand the it is quite voluminous - much is being said in it - and it
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       give the impression that the little you personally got out of it is all that's being said.  This is only the case if one does not bother to look at the information with sufficient discernment, however, as the last thing that the data is actually saying or even implying - according to many of the things that the author himself said with regard to the absolutely vast karmic consequences that will result from what is happening on this planet - is that the horrendous actions being committed by TPTB should be forgiven, excused, or looked at in a more positive light.  He is actually saying nothing of the sort whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, in part, gives a bit more weight to the validity of the information contained.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you don't consider terms like, "The Great Harvest", creepy, than I don't know what to tell you.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I guess you won't know what to tell me then, because I tend to be the type that works at looking past the superficial, surface level of things - both in words and in people.  Those who do this tend to have a better understanding of information they come across, as opposed to simply being "creeped out" by it.

       lol.  Okay.  So let me get this argument you just made straight.  Your conclusion is "Enlightened my ass".  Your premise is "He refers to himself as part of a group soul known as Lucifer".  Okay, so the reason you have indubitably concluded that he is ignorant is because he says he's part of a group soul known as Lucifer?
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay.  Here's a little newsflash help for you:  That's
       <em>
        really

       bad logic on your part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way…you know what?  I didn't even bother reading the rest of what you wrote.  Sorry that you possibly just wasted the past hour or whatever of your life typing out something that I decided not to read.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is that you apparently have your perspective on the information…and okay.  I'm not going to bother actually debating you or anyone on whether it has merit or not.  If it doesn't to you, then okay.

       I'm not here to "prove I'm right".  That's an ego trip thing most people allow themselves to be caught up and consumed by.  I've done it often enough in this life, so I'm not trying to extricate myself from it, but - that being said - I'm certainly not interested in any of it here and now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I provided information that I think is worthwhile to whoever might be interested in it.  Some will understand and appreciate it.  Some (like you), won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't imagine everyone will like, understand, or agree with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one does understand it, then great.  I hope they get even more out of it than I have.  If someone doesn't and thinks is bunk, then that's okay too.

       Either way, people are going to do with it what they will.  I didn't offer it only so people could agree with it.

      <p>
       Your general energy is so dark and vile, however, that I actually can't be bothered reading anything more that your first typed line (first two sentences).
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you don't mind continuing to waste your time typing out things that aren't actually getting read by the person you're directing them to, because that's exactly what continues happening.  If you're interested in having what you write actually read, then perhaps try being a bit more of a decent human being here.  Otherwise, you're - again - simply wasting your time and your responses because they're actually not getting read.
