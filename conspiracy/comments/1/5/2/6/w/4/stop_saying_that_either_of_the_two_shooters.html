       There is NO proof of these claims! The original claim that James Holmes's father was going to testify about the LIBOR fraud was made by Sorcha Faal who is a well known disinfo provocateur. If it is true, prove it, and not with an article from examiner.com.  There are many, many questions to be raised about the "shooters," but you people pushing this unsubstantiated LIBOR bullshit are making the entire skeptic community look stupid so please, shut your mouth.

       No, but I just haven't seen a confirmation that proves otherwise. The scheduled Senate testimony for instance, and something that would be tie in with the current LIBOR coverage.

       It's not that it's not possible, it's just that (speaking for myself) I haven't been nudged over into the
       <em>
        convinced
       </em>
       side of the scale because the support for the theory is really really weak.

       Can't we just contact Congress and ask them about the case, and who is testifying?  Or is that confidential (highly doubt it)....

       Reporters got it directly from contacts at Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson's office and the official witness list, which was later amended by mutual agreement after Holmes' tragedy.  This was well-known around Washington.  But not everything is on the Internet.

       I think it would be incredible if this turns out to be verified. If the primary source material isn't on the internet though, and we just have to trust various bloggers and talking heads that it's really there.... I'm not buying that.

       As I said, not everything that occurs in the complex circles in Washington gets committed to blogs,  websites, or databases in Reddit-quotable form.  Many people understand that this is not the same as published scientific papers, but something delicate at times.  Political organizations are dynamic, fluid, shifty, and subject to pressures that affect actions. I read about it from people I trust and who are not grandstanders. Madsen is one.  Obviously, the immense implications of the LIBOR actions mean pressure certainly was in play.

       Where did Madsen write this? I just did a search on Wayne Madsen and Robert Holmes, and the only thing I could find that Madsen wrote about him was this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        According to his LinkedIn profile, James Holmes's father, Dr. Robert Holmes, who received a PhD in Statistics in 1981 from the University of California at Berkeley, worked for San Diego-based HNC Software, Inc. from 2000 to 2002. HNC, known as a "neural network" company, and DARPA, beginning in 1998, have worked on developing "cortronic neural networks," which would allow machines to interpret aural and visual stimuli to think like humans. The cortronic concept was developed by HNC Software's chief scientist and co-founder, Robert Hecht-Nielsen. HNC merged with the Minneapolis-based Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO), a computer analysis and decision-making company. Robert Holmes continues to work at FICO.

       Madsen has a paid subscriber section. I repeat for the third time that not everything is posted (openly) on the Internet for everybody to read. You can't Google closed parts of websites just as you cannot Google private data within government networks, such as the files on the Senate Banking Committee's intranet.

       Any truth to the rumor that Oregon mall shooter, Jacob Tyler Roberts' father was also set to testify before Congress regarding LIBOR?  Andrew Roberts was a janitor at a local Clackamas HSBC branch, and he was going to testify regarding shredded LIBOR documents.

       Non the less, if the two fathers have nothing to do Libor, both shooting occurred on the days that major info about the Libor fraud dropped. That in itself is pretty crazy.

       The scandle hit right before the CO shooting and was gaining ground around the same time. The day the CT shooting happened was the same day the court transcripts were released. Showing that rather then criminal suit the banks were taking a fine and  helping investigators.

       Yea your right but there has almost been a media black out. What I was getting at is that if enough people saw the libor scandle and started  a situations that occurred at the right time to take every single persons attention from the Libor and HSBC scandle. Then we all may just break out of our Stockholm Syndrome.

         Robert Holmes
        </strong>
        , the lead scientist for the credit score company FICO. Both men were to testify before the US Sentate in the ongoing LIBOR scandal. The London Interbank Offered Rate, known as Libor, is the average interest rate at which banks can borrow from each other. 16 international banks have been implicated in this ongoing scandal, accused of rigging contracts worth trillions of dollars. HSBC has already been fined $1.9 billion and three of their low level traders arrested.

       Examiner articles citing conspiracy sites don't count as sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the snopes article discredits the theory completely, as it correctly notes that neither man was scheduled to testify in front of Congress and neither GE nor FICO were directly connected to LIBOR or the hearings about it.

       If trying to stomp out a story that's false, always put the rebuttal or refute information, as in link. Otherwise you will usually get tuned out by many here.

       Yea your right but there has almost been a media black out. What I was getting at is that if enough people saw the libor scandle and started  a situations that occurred at the right time to take every single persons attention from the Libor and HSBC scandle. Then we all may just break out of our Stockholm Syndrome.
