The original claim that James Holmes&#39;s father was going to testify about the LIBOR fraud was made by Sorcha Faal who is a well known disinfo provocateur. If it is true, prove it, and not with an article from examiner.com.  There are many, many questions to be raised about the &quot;shooters,&quot; but you people pushing this unsubstantiated LIBOR bullshit are making the entire skeptic community look stupid so please, shut your mouth.</p>

Many people understand that this is not the same as published scientific papers, but something delicate at times.  Political organizations are dynamic, fluid, shifty, and subject to pressures that affect actions. I read about it from people I trust and who are not grandstanders. Madsen is one.  Obviously, the immense implications of the LIBOR actions mean pressure certainly was in play.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to his LinkedIn profile, James Holmes&#39;s father, Dr. Robert Holmes, who received a PhD in Statistics in 1981 from the University of California at Berkeley, worked for San Diego-based HNC Software, Inc. from 2000 to 2002. HNC, known as a &quot;neural network&quot; company, and DARPA, beginning in 1998, have worked on developing &quot;cortronic neural networks,&quot; which would allow machines to interpret aural and visual stimuli to think like humans. The cortronic concept was developed by HNC Software&#39;s chief scientist and co-founder, Robert Hecht-Nielsen. HNC merged with the Minneapolis-based Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO), a computer analysis and decision-making company. Robert Holmes continues to work at FICO.</p>

<p><del>Connection, being two fathers of two shooters involved with upcoming Senate hearing concerning Libor.</del></p>

<p><del>&gt;The father of Newtown Connecticut school shooter Adam Lanza is <strong>Peter Lanza</strong> who is a VP and Tax Director at GE Financial. The father of Aurora Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes is <strong>Robert Holmes</strong>, the lead scientist for the credit score company FICO. Both men were to testify before the US Sentate in the ongoing LIBOR scandal. The London Interbank Offered Rate, known as Libor, is the average interest rate at which banks can borrow from each other. 16 international banks have been implicated in this ongoing scandal, accused of rigging contracts worth trillions of dollars. HSBC has already been fined $1.9 billion and three of their low level traders arrested.</del></p>
