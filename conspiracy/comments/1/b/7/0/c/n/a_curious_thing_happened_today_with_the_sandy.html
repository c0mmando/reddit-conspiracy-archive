       I get onto Drudge today and this headline caught my eye.
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RvEGIBz.jpg">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So as I am reading the story, sure enough the story said they found a loaded 12 gauge shotgun in the glove box. Now anyone who knows anything about firearms can draw their own conclusions, well because its ridiculous. Evidently the person writing the story doesn't know squat about them, and bought it hook line and sinker. So I click back from the story, got up to get a friend to show him. Well I come back, and now this is the front page of Drudge
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/76XPlvy.jpg">
        http://i.imgur.com/76XPlvy.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's gone so I go to my browser history and go back to the AP page, and its changed to this...

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is still absurd. Again anyone who knows about firearms is not going to buy this. I have looked, and looked for the cached page of the AP story, but all I come up with is 404 error.. It may not be much, but just enough to call bullshit.....
      </p>
      <p>
       What prompted the headlines today I guess is the release of the search warrant on Adam Lanza's house after the shooting...
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Here is a picture of my shotgun. It is a Remington 870. Which is smaller (18" barrel) compared to the one the police found.

       I only show this as a comparison, and how absurd it would be to say it was in a glove box or have a 35 round magazine...

       Someone else just pointed out to me that there IS a CZ-83 firearm.  With the terrible typos in these warrants, that could be all there is to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also listed Nancy Lanza's birthday as 9/6/30 in a couple of places, which would have made her 82.  The black Honda serial number was conflicting in places, too.  Really sloppy work.

       Even the smallest shotguns you can buy are around 16 inches overall.  A sawn off double barrel would be at least that long.  But there aren't any 35 or 70 round shotgun magazines, and they definitely would not fit in a gun that fits in a glove compartment.

       Interesting how this works:
      </p>
      <p>
       One guy with the Associated Press writes a super sloppy article, most likely in an alcohol-induced stupor, every other reporter says "great, now I don't have to do the work", the story is picked up by every major newspaper in the country and now there actually
       <strong>
        was
       </strong>
       a shotgun and two 35 round (?) magazines in the
       <strong>
        glove compartment
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you call that into question, you are a "conspiracy theorist". Later, when they change the facts of the narrative, if you still use the first article as reference, you are now once again a "conspiracy theorist". The only way to avoid the label, is to keep up with the ever-changing (and ever-conflicting) facts from the six major news outlets.

       The Associated Press (AP) is a US government disinformation portal, masquerading as a news agency.

       Most of the blatant lies that were published on the day of the Sandy Hook event (ie Ryan Lanza was the killer, Nancy was a Sandy Hook teacher, Peter Lanza was murdered etc) came from AP.

       I do not believe it was "sloppy" nor "alcohol-induced". This was either the reporter not know what he/she was talking about, and reporting on what they were told &amp; read. Or it was a reporter simply following orders...

       When one's only job is to report facts, how does one fuck that up so badly? There isn't even such a thing as a 35 round shotgun magazine, much less how would that all fit in the glove compartment? I think the disregard for being professional and ethical, especially with so much at stake, is both pathetic and disgusting at the same time. If you are alright with the bs they are feeding you, suit yourself.

       For one lets see you fit a 12 gauge shotgun into a glove box? Two. shotguns do not use magazines...
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I can only think of one shotgun that does use a magazine, however it was not the one "found"...

       I am claiming something is not right. Can you fit a shotgun into a glove compartment?. Does your shotgun (If you have one, which seems not likely) have a magazine?... Yes they are being spoon fed.. Really you cannot see?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: A magazine that fits 35 rounds no less.

       Could it be... A typo or error??? The police have said that they found the shotgun in the trunk. This has even known since the press conference a few days after the shooting. See Wikipedia sources 19 and 21 for sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       What evidence do you have that this is anything other than a typo?

       Simple the way it was worded, and then what it was changed too.. Shotguns are not magazine fed. Also I am about to post a picture of my personal shotgun, so people can make reference to it fitting in a glove box. Also it fits with all the firearm information that we have not been able to a get a straight answer about since the beginning...

       Um... we have had a straight answer from the beginning. We know exactly what guns were found on the shooter's person, and what was in his car. This article clearly had a typo, replacing "shotgun round" with "shotguns".

       No we have not had a straight answer since the beginning.. Shotguns? Of that who article that is all you took away from it? Pretty obvious you do not have a clue about firearms, or you would know shotguns are NOT magazine fed, nor would they EVER fit into a glove box...

       The shotgun that was in his trunk as this video shows it to be a pump action one, hence no magazine..

       And they are being spoonfed erroneous information why, exactly? Is this one of those things where the criminal secretly longs to be caught, so they purposely sabotage their crime?

       Why would The Conspirators give this reporter information they knew to be false and they knew would be easily seen as false?

       That my friend is the $64,000 question. Maybe they assumed most people wouldn't catch it, which seems to be the case. Then again maybe its deliberate, maybe they hope to spread more "conspiracy theories" to label those of us that pay attention....

       What gives me pause is the absurd notion that they really think we are this stupid.. Oh and I know the answer to that question, the trouble is most people refuse to believe it. Instead its easier for them to believe a shotgun fit into a glove box..
