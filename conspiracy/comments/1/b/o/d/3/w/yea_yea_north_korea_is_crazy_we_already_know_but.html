       We're hearing a lot about North Korea because they're TELLING us a lot about NK.
      </p>

       This isn't TMZ. The average citizen doesn't know whats going on over there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to keep this short, but just remember that while most Americans would more readily support a defensive military role, don't be fooled into a false sense of security with the information you obtain  about military action to any degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       While its easy to be cynical, we have to remember that there are interests that will always be at stake but that shouldn't cloud your judgement of what is or is not a just action.

       NK came into the forefront during the Zionist-led Bush Jr. administration. NK is an enemy of Israel, ergo the propaganda.

       I agree with you for the most part. In that we should take everything we see on the news/internet with a grain of salt. NK isn't the only country that constantly feeds its people propaganda.
However, I think most people around here already know that... or they wouldn't be here.

       Here is a map that shows where all the NK fear porn is being targeted. The propaganda operation is pretty clear when viewed in relation to geography.

        It’s being reported across the globe that “North Korea” made these statements in a recent official release via state media Korean Central News Agency :
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         “From this time on, the North-South relations will be entering the state of war and all issues raised between the North and the South will be handled accordingly,”Ria Novoski
        </p>
        <p>
         “Now that the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK have entered into an actual military action, the inter-Korean relations have naturally entered the state of war,” Huffington Post
        </p>
        <p>
         “From this time on, the North-South relations will be entering the state of war and all issues raised between the North and the South will be handled accordingly,”Reuters via Prison Planet
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        As you can see, this rhetoric spans quite a wide political divide from the fake alternative left to the equally fake alternative right and very thing in between. CNN, Fox, NBC News all of them are reporting this crucial development as fact.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trouble is, it may be another lie. It’s hard to say because no one links to the actual original source of this statement. Also important to note, which is not being covered by most outlets, the statement is NOT from the usual official offices of the North Korean government but rather from “the government, political parties and organizations of the DPRK” and what that means is, it’s not so much a declaration of war as it is a statement to show  the unified resolve of the North Korean people against the aggressive stance and provocations undertaken by the South Koreans and their masters, the United States.

       North Korea is not known for its subtlety. The statement was posted publicly on North Korea's state-run KCNA website, on March 30, and it's very easy to find. I'm tired of pointing this out. Rather than just doing 4 minutes of reading, everyone complains that they've never seen the source and so it must be an American conspiracy.

       In all honestly I haven't heard much about the situation on any major news network. From what I've seen it has been briefly mentioned with no opinion attached to it. That actually scares me more than it being a major news topic.

       I'm not trolling, I haven't watched much tv in the last week but when I've flipped on the network news channels the last few days it's just been the usual mindless celebrity chatter and extreme right and extreme left point views. My own frame of reference on the matter is skewed so I shouldn't have commented on the matter without doing more research on the topic. My apologies.

       I used to be SUPER anti-MIC...but then you remember there is a much more nuanced argument there, a lot of other nations depend on us for things we don't even think about. I mean has anyone ever wondered why nations that used to rule the seas no longer have to?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, think of the state and security of shipping lanes without concerted efforts from the US Navy for instance. Thats a MASSIVE undertaking in terms of infrastructure and shouldn't be taken lightly.

      <p>
       Without the MIC a lot of people would be unemployed.

       I understand that there is a large misuse of their lobbying to get inflated contracts and abuse the tradition of their existence, but theres more to it than just "dropping bombs"

       The charter of every Corporation that has ever existed has put ease of profit ahead of everything else. That's one of two reasons for a Corporation to even exist in the first place.

       I'm curious as to what reasons corporations exist then. Or why you believe they exist.

       Because it removes legal responsibility of the individual for business decisions. This was further solidified by Citizens United, finally closing the gap to make Corporations as an entity shoulder 100% the responsibilities of those officers who operate under it's name.

        It’s being reported across the globe that “North Korea” made these statements in a recent official release via state media Korean Central News Agency :
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         “From this time on, the North-South relations will be entering the state of war and all issues raised between the North and the South will be handled accordingly,”Ria Novoski
        </p>
        <p>
         “Now that the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK have entered into an actual military action, the inter-Korean relations have naturally entered the state of war,” Huffington Post
        </p>
        <p>
         “From this time on, the North-South relations will be entering the state of war and all issues raised between the North and the South will be handled accordingly,”Reuters via Prison Planet
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        As you can see, this rhetoric spans quite a wide political divide from the fake alternative left to the equally fake alternative right and very thing in between. CNN, Fox, NBC News all of them are reporting this crucial development as fact.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trouble is, it may be another lie. It’s hard to say because no one links to the actual original source of this statement. Also important to note, which is not being covered by most outlets, the statement is NOT from the usual official offices of the North Korean government but rather from “the government, political parties and organizations of the DPRK” and what that means is, it’s not so much a declaration of war as it is a statement to show  the unified resolve of the North Korean people against the aggressive stance and provocations undertaken by the South Koreans and their masters, the United States.
