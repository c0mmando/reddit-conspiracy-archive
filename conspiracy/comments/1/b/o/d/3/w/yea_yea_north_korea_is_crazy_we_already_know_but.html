<p>We&#39;re hearing a lot about North Korea because they&#39;re TELLING us a lot about NK.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t TMZ. The average citizen doesn&#39;t know whats going on over there. </p>

<p>I just want to keep this short, but just remember that while most Americans would more readily support a defensive military role, don&#39;t be fooled into a false sense of security with the information you obtain  about military action to any degree. </p>

<p>While its easy to be cynical, we have to remember that there are interests that will always be at stake but that shouldn&#39;t cloud your judgement of what is or is not a just action. </p>

<p>Just be on your toes. </p>

However, I think most people around here already know that... or they wouldn&#39;t be here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be SUPER anti-MIC...but then you remember there is a much more nuanced argument there, a lot of other nations depend on us for things we don&#39;t even think about. I mean has anyone ever wondered why nations that used to rule the seas no longer have to? </p>

<p>I mean, think of the state and security of shipping lanes without concerted efforts from the US Navy for instance. Thats a MASSIVE undertaking in terms of infrastructure and shouldn&#39;t be taken lightly. </p>

<p>Without the MIC a lot of people would be unemployed.</p>

<p>I understand that there is a large misuse of their lobbying to get inflated contracts and abuse the tradition of their existence, but theres more to it than just &quot;dropping bombs&quot;</p>
