       I'm not exactly sure how well known this subreddit is, but when we hit a topic that may bring some truth do you think they're checking in? Maybe they want to switch some stories/things around to derail us from the truth? What do yo guys think?

       Yes, their trolls, shills, and disinfo agents are here all the time.  But it doesn't matter.  We are still winning, and this subreddit is growing at about 200 people a day.  That scares the hell out of them.

       this is actually a very effective "plausible deniability" tactic.  Like lets say some rather embarrassing information came out. One of the easiest ways to make that information doubtful to the public is have an agent release it and then turn into a nut job.  Like lets say a set of documents had been compromised that exposed a mistake that killed thousands of people and had been covered up.  Just have a guy start revealing all that information, make a semi name for himself, then have him start selling miracle cures for SARS and the healing power of hexagonal water. Then you can say any information that he presented is associated with being a nut job, bring into doubt the accuracy of that information for most casual observers.

       Reminds me of all the propaganda placement junk they do now. Seen that one show with Gary Sinese? Some college professor was molesting kids or something. When investigating him, they found out he was like, anti-water fluoridation or something. Upon learning this, Gary Sinise's character literally stops, gasps and goes "How un-American!" Like water fluoridation is the epitome of what it means to be an American or something.

       That what disinfo is for. And if a movement becomes too much of a threat, they simply infiltrate and repurpose it, slander it on the msm, etc (as was done with the Tea Party). Thats why we need to wake more people up before any change is going to happen.

       I can attest to the fact that that my HIV related posts have garnered US Government (Los Alamos Laboratory scientist) and pharmaceutical (A few people from Merck showed up to call me names) responses before, not on reddit that I am aware, but on Coursera. The Government scientist and I had a pretty lengthy private email conversation about HIV science, and it was somewhat productive... but I felt that he was being somewhat disingenuous to me and attempting to misrepresent specific fraud investigations as well as scientific papers that pointed to a "punctuated cause" of the initial AIDS outbreak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other people that go delving into the HIV industry have encountered these same set of people as well.  I'm not sure how organized their monitoring of forums is on certain topics but it appears to exist to some degree... within a few days 'they' (coursera allows for anonymous posts, so im not sure who it was exactly) had cross connected all my accounts across Reddit, Coursera, and the Questioning AIDS forums (which isn't really that difficult, it wasn't something I was trying to hide...). They additionally had honeypotted my IP address to determine my general location of residence (I stupidly clicked a link the anonymous user provided, and someone told someone where I was located, a piece of information I have been quite careful about not providing). The professor of the class nicely published my real name to the entire class after she hastily banned me (we have since made up realized it was a big misunderstanding and we're cool now).
      </p>
      <p>
       I do know that there is a man by the name of Seth Kalichman over at UConn that claims to have "infiltrated denialist groups" through forums and multiple "shadow puppet" accounts. This is the same guy the Gates Foundation has paid 100k to, to handle anti vaccine monitoring in various forums. Is reddit on his radar? I have no idea.

       Scientists and people who work in the pharmaceutical industry don't live in some alternate world. They're just people. Considering HIV/AIDs is one of the few things we can be sure is real and not a conspiracy, I'm sure they're passionate enough to argue against reality denialists when they come across them.

       Yes. Look at any 9/11 post. You will see that the number of downvotes on a given post are disproportionate to the opinion that is presented here

       this is actually a very effective "plausible deniability" tactic.  Like lets say some rather embarrassing information came out. One of the easiest ways to make that information doubtful to the public is have an agent release it and then turn into a nut job.  Like lets say a set of documents had been compromised that exposed a mistake that killed thousands of people and had been covered up.  Just have a guy start revealing all that information, make a semi name for himself, then have him start selling miracle cures for SARS and the healing power of hexagonal water. Then you can say any information that he presented is associated with being a nut job, bring into doubt the accuracy of that information for most casual observers.

       No, he's saying that they own that label and we want it. tttt0tttt is a 9/11 truther, too, IIRC. He's saying it's a more general label that we should all be able to use.
