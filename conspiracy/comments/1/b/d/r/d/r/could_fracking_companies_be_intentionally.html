<p>Likewise, I have not done much research on this particular topic but I would be heavily stunned if food control wasn&#39;t a priority of the NWO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh yes, of course.</p>

<p>&quot;In 1974, the idea of using food as a weapon was introduced in a 200-page report by politician Henry Kissinger. The report, entitled National Security Study Memorandum 200: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests, stated that food aid would be withheld from developing countries in need until they submitted to birth control policies that would effectively sterilize large numbers of the population to curb growth.&quot;</p>

<p>Kissinger got his idea from predecessors.</p>

<p>Even the Romans used to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salting_the_earth"><strong>spread salt on the fields</strong></a> of those they conquered to cause food dependence and/or mass-starvation.</p>

<p>Not to defend Kissinger of course, who is the modern-day incarnation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himmler">Himmler</a>.</p>

<p>In modern times, the most famous &quot;test case&quot; of water privatization occurred in 2000 in Bolivia.  The Bechtel Corporation privatized Bolivia&#39;s water.  Citizens were forbidden from collecting rainwater.</p>

<p>Arrests resulted, and then protests with 121 injured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39; think they intentionally pollute underground water. Surfactants, acid and friction reducers are added to get a little extra performance, but I don&#39;t think they are absolutely needed. </p>

<p>I drove truck for Halliburton in the oil patch and ran with a fracking crew for 2 years. I have been on over a hundred of frack jobs. <strong>Fracking is largely mechanical</strong>. Huge 12 cylinder diesel engines, two to a pump truck, pressure up on the line to burst apart the underground formation. When the strata split, water and sand are pumped in to keep the layers apart and make it easy for the oil to flow.</p>

<p><strong>If just clean water and sand are used, I don&#39;t see why that would cause pollution</strong>. </p>

<p>There are different kinds of frack jobs. They can go down hole with LN2 (liquid nitrogen heated up) or CO2. Sometimes they will dump a couple thousand gallons of acid to &quot;eat&quot; on the formation for a while and then get after it with pressurized water.</p>

<p>I am not a geologist or an oil field engineer, so I could be wrong. But I think if they were wiling to accept some limitations on what got accomplished, they could get most of the jobs done cleanly by using only clean materials. LN2, by itself is clean. our air is 78% nitrogen.</p>

<p>tl;dr </p>

<p>I think fracking can work and be done cleanly if only clean stuff is pumped down hole. They add nasty stuff to get a little extra performance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Friction reducers are absolutely necessary. The proppant goes in as a sand/gel combination because water itself cannot carry the sand. The proppant is hydraulically pushed into the fractures and allows no conduit for which the oil to flow through. It is through the use of friction reducers that this gel/sand combination becomes less viscous allowing for the back flow of oil. It would not be possible to pump sand down the tubes with just water as the difference in densities would not allow it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Geologist OK here. It&#39;s the disposal wells causing all of the issues with communicating with aquifers to earthquakes. If you frack below 5000&#39; TVD there is nothing to worry about. They want people to keep saying that its fracking doing the polluting, as long as you don&#39;t know what the real problem is, nothing will ever be done about it. Focus on the real problem shit gets fixed. </p>

We don&#39;t even need disposal wells they make reverse osmosis machines that are portable but a little more expensive. That water could go right back into the water supply completely clean of pollution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I believe in many conspiracies I do not believe this to be true at least from my own experience. I&#39;ve been employed at an oil/gas company for 6 months now and the first 3 I spent primarily focused on hydraulic fracturing. The engineers design and implement the hydraulic fractures and the on-site companies carry it out. Not once in the process would the &quot;destroying ground water&quot; be on purpose, and even then it is highly unlikely that it even occurs as the oil recovery begins at over 2 miles under the ground. That is well below the water table.</p>
