       has become almost a abandoned place with regards to moderator activity, this needs addressing so tonight supercede and uncencorship were removed from moderator duty. Inactive mods are of no use to the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it stands this subreddit has a serious lack of moderator collaboration and vision, we need new blood. Me and Sarah_Connor cannot move
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       forward alone.

       I would once again offer my services.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what I'll do,
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         I will moderate this subreddit without consideration of my own personal views and in accordance with the stated rules and regulations as listed on the side bar.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I will encourage well reasoned debate whilst discouraging emotional arguments and personal attacks.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I will moderate demonstrably satirical postings to mitigate sliding. (Onion pieces etc)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I will work with the existing mods to recreate the pre 40k + subscriber atmosphere we once enjoyed here. (Its nice having so many subscribers, but we need less fighting/arguing)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Regardless of if you believe in a specific conspiracy or not, we should be able to have civil debates about these subjects without being called racist, antisemitic, stupid, or any sort of derogatory label.

       To be completely honest with you i want to remove the automoderator, not uncensorship. I realized what i had done this morning. Timezone difference didn't do me any favors last night. (another reason we need new blood)

       He made quite a few aesthetic changes as mod. Generally put quite a bit off effort into modding here. He got some shit for that. There was some drama with him and another mod too. I actually like to think he didn't suicide though.  A user claiming to be his SO made a post advising of the suicide.

       Bans should be handled carefully and with transparency.  If someone deserves to be banned it should be easy for the mods to present their case for banning.
      </p>
      <p>
       People might not agree on whether or not bans are effective but when presented with examples of repeated violations of the sub rules by certain members it would at least be clear to the community why the mods feel a ban is in order.

       It wasn't meant to be.  I was agreeing with your proposal and trying (unsuccessfully) to outline a method of banning that would be less objectionable for the people who don't think banning should be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some will still complain that the mods ban anyone at all but the community would be aware of the situation, the rules that were broken and would see that you intend to deal with bans in a way that respects the rules and reflects the communities best interests.
      </p>

       Sorry that it came out as an argument or complaint, as I absolutely agree with you.

       This sub has been using the 'not banning for any reason' method for awhile now and the result is drastically reduced participation and arguments instead of conversation.

       Bans shouldn't be used, period.  They are a lazy solution that does not solve (and often worsens) an underlying problem.

       Only after answering my (thrice asked) question first:
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you hope to accomplish through account bans on a website with free registry?
      </p>
      <p>
       Combined with your three strikes rule you are practically setting up a challenge/achievement list and increasing a trolls enjoyment with well defined goals.

       It's seemingly self destructive if you roll over dead and let habitual cross posters to r/conspiratard comment in here. I'm not saying it will stop the down vote brigades, there's no question it would slow it to a crawl. I stopped commenting about a month ago and started up again a few days ago, I've noticed a huge drop in trolls, they could be loosing interest the ones that are left are angry children. They are fewer but more annoying. It would be great to put that nail in the coffin. This is the perfect time for new active meat. IMO they can waterboard them and have sex with their mothers then delete them and I'd be happy. Do your worst, and good luck to all who apply!

       I've heard before that humor was a sign of intelligence, and after reading through two pages of your comments, my only thought was "this guy would starve a zombie". Of course in your case its not true, I could see the lightbulb there. However I have cotton mouth, yes very dry indeed. No offense intended, just making jokes. I do agree though there are guys in here that are like a swinging meat pendulum over a tiger cage. The problem I have when I see them being berated, is I always jump in and act a little crazy, get them thinking I'm an easier target. That's when I break out my 8th debating skills and pounce. I'm not sure I'm helping them much by my example though.

       What about people who rewrite history to deliberately make events seem less sympathetic to people of your background? What if their plan is to restore the credibility of ideas that history as we know it inherently revokes? These are ideas that, when believed to their logical end, discredits anything great that you may ever do or achieve. They put a limitation on who you are, destroy faith in your character simply because of where your family came from and may end up threatening the lives or you or your descendants?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you say to such people who assign guilt and innocence collectively to ethnic groups based on Youtube videos? Just: "I disagree with you?" These people are insidious problems for civilization itself, which is why history has taught us to call them out and marginalize them.

       Weedtastic seems a solid choice.  He/she runs a very linear subreddit and have shown a solid level of dedication there, while still being a consistent submitter and commenter here. Their work on
       <a href="/r/conspiracydocumentary">
        /r/conspiracydocumentary
       </a>
       would also translate quite well in restarting the video of the week, which could go a long way toward establishing a better sense of community here.
      </p>
      <p>
       What this sub needs from the moderators is attendance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Weedtastic has proven to be an active participant here for a long time and generally seems quite willing to encourage others to form their own opinions.  I feel that these two qualities are badly needed in this sub and should be strongly considered when choosing the next mod.

       It depends on the subject and whether what's being discussed is an actual conspiracy theory or just holocaust deniers ranting about the zionist NWO.  For example there are
       <a href="http://en.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1bi7g9/jew_settlers_in_west_bank_attack_palestinian/">
        at least 2 posts on the front page
       </a>
       , at the time of this comment, that are not conspiracy theories; they are people squealing about Jews.  If people want to hate Jews that's entirely up to them, but "I hate Jews" is not a conspiracy theory and this subreddit
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       needs to stop behaving like it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I post in both subs because I actually enjoy conspiracy theories, I'm sometimes antagonistic because I don't enjoy white supremacism (I have other hobbies) so I keep my more extreme ridicule of certain members of this subreddit confined to
       <a href="/r/Conspiratard">
        /r/Conspiratard
       </a>
       so as
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to derail "discussion" on this subreddit.

       This is a terrible idea, prone to be gamed by trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could maybe work if the current mods set up a selfsubmission and posted comments with the usernames of the candidates, one per comment. But then we don't count the votes, we count the number of replies to each candidate. This way we can see whether the repliers are trolls or not. Of course, some dedicated trolls have accounts that look legit, but most don't, most are morons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think this community election idea is shit though.

       Thank you for removing supercede.  I got a very unsatisfying response from him/her when I reported an obvious shill.  The response was essentially that there is nothing that can be done, if we ban them they just create new user names and go back to their old tricks.

       I'm not claiming to be stupid but one thing I've learned in life from running my own business is that people specialize their knowledge.  If I wasn't able to concede inferiority to key employees who I hired specifically because of their specialized knowledge, I would have forced some really big mistakes to happen.

       Agreed. Their comprehension of the organized subterfuge by international Jewry also allows them to intuit the truth of conspiracy theories before any actual evidence is required. This is an extremely useful skill and one that any

       I would volunteer to be a mod. I've been on this subreddit for a number of years (under this account and my older account: sumdog). I've submitted a number of posts and comments. I'll have to admit I often look to this subreddit after a major news event to get a true alternative look at it.

       I would like to be a mod but its not going to happen - because Ive pissed off too many people. Just be sure to please ban blogspam, this place is completely overrun. You can just flat out ban a few domains and it would greatly help.

       Also ban outright racist bullshit.

       I'd humbly offer my services to the team. I am the creator and moderator of a small subreddit;
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/blackinamerica/">
        r/blackinamerica
       </a>
       , as well as the somewhat larger
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/blackculture/">
        r/blackculture
       </a>
       , So i already have a good deal of moderating experience. Additionally, given that this forum is known all over reddit for having a large crossover with the hate reddits (r/niggers, r/whiterights ect) it might not hurt to add some color to the moderator staff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also a Muslim, so depending on who you ask I am either part of an enormous 1500 year old conspiracy to take away America's freedom or the victim of a massive global conspiracy to turn the world into a giant oil field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirdly, I have been a longtime subscriber and poster to r/conspiracy and consider the place one of my favorite places on the web. I would be fully dedicated to making reddit hold r/conspiracy in the same high regard as I hold it in, and in making sure the most thought-provoking and well-sourced theories and news get attention not just here but around the entire reddit community. I hope you consider me for the position.

       It bothers me how most of the people electing themselves as candidates have an axe to grind, particularly wishing to ban those they see as a detriment to the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a different take on things, and while I know nothing about moderation (and don't think I would care for behaving professionally), I would love to have input on some factors I think are important.

       <strong>
        <em>
         BANS:
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, I don't think anyone should be banned under any circumstances (excluding submission spamming in which new account creation/timers would reduce load).  It simply is not an effective way with dealing with a problem:  You take an identified troll and force him to come up with an as-yet unknown identity to rebirth the cycle all over again.   Most trolls soft-ban themselves in time through their behaviour anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you are banning is a
       <strong>
        <em>
         username
        </em>
       </strong>
       not an idea and not an ideology, and certainly not a mode of behaviour which feeds on negative reactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings me to my next point; banning a troll sends a very clear message:
       <strong>
        you are succeeding!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <h2>
       We should not encourage them with such ineffective measures that are quickly circumventable for free.
      </h2>
      <p>
       But who
       <strong>
        isn't
       </strong>
       circumventing these bans?  Actual users who may have become passionate about something they don't fully understand in a world they find threatening.  People who, while possibly disagreeable and abrasive, actually want to learn, to teach, and to improve their world, but were banished from our sub for actions we couldn't perceive from their perspective.

      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        No Group hate. [Extending racism to be less racist.  We don't group hate because it is illogical indulgence of our own ignorance.]
       </li>
       <li>
        No blog spam/malicious web sites.
       </li>
       <li>
        <del>
         No abusive/threatening language.
        </del>
        [Unproductive to enforce, the community is not forced to read abuse, nor is the community forced to be emotionally impacted by abuse.  ]
       </li>
       <li>
        <del>
         No stalking.
        </del>
        [100% unenforceable]
       </li>
       <li>
        <del>
         No caps lock.
        </del>
        [This is a stylistic choice, and doesn't make important information any less important]
       </li>
       <li>
        <del>
         Any and all bans are made by moderator consensus.
        </del>
        [This is not even a rule, it is just info]
       </li>
       <li>
        NO Facebook links. [The best rule change since I found this sub.  Totally willing to expand it to twitter et al, but they never really became a problem]
       </li>
       <li>
        NO image submissions [This is an expansion of the no memes rule leaving no reasonable doubt to the legitimacy of your post, I will expand on this at the end of my post.
       </li>
       <li>
        Cross posting any links to
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        posts or specific comments from other subs is subject to a ban, depending on the context. [Sort of an awkward catch-all I am hesitant to remove)
       </li>
       <li>
        Any posts in the form of a personal attack will be removed. [Modified to extend coverage.  This rule was not about protection, it was about presentation.]
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       New rules (to keep that "10 commandment" feel):
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        No Satire. [prevents Onion articles and starwars conspiracy type nonsense.]
       </li>
       <li>
        No advertisements. [Prevents things like today's toilet-stool advertisement.  If an advertisement is the only source for that information you can find, perhaps the advertiser is lying] (I know how to paleo-poop, find a better source)
       </li>
       <li>
        Stay on the topic of conspiracies. [Essentially a deflection for removing obvious troll/spam.  This is generally done by the community but could explain a mods actions should an inappropriate post become popular (which has happened quite a bit)]
       </li>
       <li>
        No inquisitive titles. [Mostly just trying to hit the 10 here, but I think this rule could improve post quality.  First it removes the ability to sensationalize a boring subject ("Does this document prove Obama's clone was harvested by pod people?" turns out, no.) Second it avoids meek posters seeking others to fill in their opinions for them (What does /r/ conspiracy think...?) and
        <strong>
         <em>
          encourages assertions, which facilitate discussions whether they are right or wrong.
         </em>
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Now, these would be rules for
       <strong>
        <em>
         POSTING
        </em>
       </strong>
       here, all comments sections should (imo) be without rules.  Seriously no rules: racism, personal attacks, blog spam, the works.  The rules don't mean anything without a community to back them up.  Show your support for the improvements these posting rules can make by casting your vote against rulebreaking behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does someone provide a persuasive point, but couple it with an unwarranted personal attack?  Don't let this be an acceptable part of your community, demand improvement of yourself and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who will not curb their behaviour to broaden their audience show their true colors: being disruptive is more important than spreading truth.  Banning someone for this would be counter productive, as we can better understand the motivations of vetted users.
      </p>
      <p>
       This lightens mod-load for having to deal with problems as well as lets an outsider see that there ARE troublemakers here, and they are not well received by the general community.

       What would this change?  Well it would mean I would have had the
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/top/?sort=top&amp;amp;t=month">
        top five posts this month
       </a>
       removed in there infancy.  How is that fair? Well...
      </p>
      <p>
       Four out of five
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       have been removed under current rules, but weren't.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/19xci4/maddow_ama/">
         One
        </a>
        of those four was made on quickmeme and was a circumvention of rule nine to begin with.
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1azmnl/noam_chomsky_points_out_an_interesting_side/">
         One
        </a>
        of those four was a quote on non-facts which sparked non-discussion.
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1b9rba/this_is_no_conspiracy/">
         One
        </a>
        of those four makes bold claims in the image, but the poster meekly  acknowledges "I admit that these figures may not be %100 percent [sic] accurate."
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1bbfa7/wtf_are_you_thinking_america_xpost_from_rwtf/">
         One
        </a>
        of those four is against rule nine, but that rule seems intentionally loose on the wording.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       However, all four of them have a couple things in common (besides breaking both sets of rules): The image adds nothing to the text, and the submission coming in image form,
       <strong>
        if true, would have a non-image source.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Moving on to fifth place for the past month we have
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1a36yz/picture_of_the_idf_pointing_guns_laughing_and/">
        this image
       </a>
       with the title "Picture of the IDF pointing guns, laughing and taunting a blindfolded and bleeding palestinian girl. Disgusting...." which we are to (and apparently, the bulk of the sub did) take OP's word for, being unsourced, contextless material.
      </p>
      <p>
       This being one of the most popular posts in the sub in the past month is quite sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would this change?  For one thing, you could still share all the images you wanted to share before, just not
       <strong>
        <em>
         as a link submission
        </em>
       </strong>
       .
That means you could still have funny memes or informative infographics within comments under a post, the intention is not to censor you.
      </p>
      <p>
       An acceptable submission of a meme would involve a selfpost with the link contained within a description of why you think it is pertinent to this sub and why members here should be interested in its message.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Selfpost Title:  Alex Jones' Motives
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Hey guys I just found
         <a href="http://i.imgur.com/guRUtBO.jpg">
          this image
         </a>
         and it reminded me of this subs love/hate relationship with Alex Jones.  Do you guys think Alex is controlled opposition, or just an over-the-top salesman?
        </p>
        <p>
         Edit: omg! frontpage!  Edit2: downvotes?? :c
        </p>
       </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In this way you can still share the image, but
       <strong>
        <em>
         not for karma and not without caring enough about the subject
        </em>
       </strong>
       to articulate why I should care about it.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         TL;DR:
        </em>
       </strong>
       If I was a mod, all I would do is remove image posts.

       Good post but my I point out that
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No stalking. [100% unenforceable]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I've seen modders ban users for stalking.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        NO Facebook links. [The best rule change since I found this sub. Totally willing to expand it to twitter et al, but they never really became a problem]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If post is meant to be a meme, then yes, but if it's something posted in their page that draws attention to possible conspiracies, then why not, the same to twitter posts, or even 4chan. Remember that IDF Facebook posting a picture of a Palestinian child on his crosshair, this is both a perfect example of the power of pictures and facebook sort of posts.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        NO image submissions [This is an expansion of the no memes rule leaving no reasonable doubt to the legitimacy of your post, I will expand on this at the end of my post.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again agreed if it's a meme, any opinions, quotes can easily be posted as self "text" post (though many refuse to post it as such for the karma BS), but a noticeable image might still revelant.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Cross posting any links to
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        [1] posts or specific comments from other subs is subject to a ban, depending on the context. [Sort of an awkward catch-all I am hesitant to remove)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again why ?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No Satire. [prevents Onion articles and starwars conspiracy type nonsense.]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Personally I still hold true that through the satire, the Onion seems more factual than major news outlets, specially as a critique.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Again good post, you've got what it takes to become a modder !

       That doesn't stop stalking, it changes the username of the stalker.  I would liken it to being stalked in real life, and responding by changing your stalkers telephone number.

       Because someones facebook wall is not exactly a credible source.  It DID draw your attention, go research it and if it is true, post some sources to the sub.  We don't need facebook hearsay or "wisdom" here.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        Noticeable images can be contained within a self post.

      <p>
       The difference is people will get tired of "here is a picture" self posts and they will be downvoted on sight, then people will have to start contributing selfposts with
       <strong>
        <em>
         content.

       There is no compelling reason to have, or remove, this rule.

      <p>
       Fine, that is how satire works.  Go find a non-satire source discussing what they are satirizing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would rather my rules be considered for merit and enforced by someone else.  Once again though, I would be more than happy to remove image submissions all day.  Not really interested in the rest of the gig.

       Why can't future mods be entitled to their opinions, isn't this the essence of conspiracy theories, to think out of mainstream society.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as they don't troll or threat other users, and have shown to repsect other's opinion in a meaningful way, I don't see any problems with their opinions interfering with their mod-work.

       I'd offer, but my banhammer would never stop swinging and I don't have time for that right now.  I have learned little patience around the (r/)Conspiratards.  They are so fucking obvious with their tactics, it's just pathetic.  Considering how often they follow me around on Reddit, it sure would feel good to moderate here, though.  :D

       Banning is a poor (and lazy) solution to problems.

      <p>
       Every troll you ban can make another account.

       Every non-troll you ban in the crossfire is a potential ally lost.

       A three strike rule for a troll is more like congratulating them for being a good troll, then giving them the ban is a grand slam.

       Conspiracy sites die because of over moderation left or right, dem or rep and then they into a circle where everyone agrees with everyone else. That defeats the purpose of having an alternative to MSM. If people want that they might as well watch FOX or MSNBC stick their fingers in their ears and go lalalalalalala.

       And if it isn't moderated correctly the content is shifted and diluted overtly and covertly. We need someone that is here daily that has posted good material and does not have any intentions other than keeping this place ship shape. I also think that the new person should not be able to wield too much power or be able to keep mod ship indefinitely incase they don't have the best intentions for this place. Do not accept any offers from strangers or new accounts.

       That is why conspiracy sites are tricky I mean the content ranges from Chemtrails to UFOs and everything in between. Just because you and I might not agree with a post or think its crazy does not it is to the reader or the OP. There are plenty of things I do not agree with so I just dont open that post.

       No, I mean the very obvious attempts at trolling. The problem is that some more of the far out conspiracies are used to promote a view which some people will see as a way to ridicule the rest of the sub-Reddit. Trolls post a bullshit thread, populate it and have infighting between themselves and real posters and then post it elsewhere on this site (

       And if it isn't moderated correctly the content is shifted and diluted overtly and covertly. We need someone that is here daily that has posted good material and does not have any intentions other than keeping this place ship shape.

Do not accept any offers from strangers or new accounts.
