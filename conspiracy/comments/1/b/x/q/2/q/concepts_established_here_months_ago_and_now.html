       It's pretty sad when you're on the front page and see information that was circulated here about 5-6 months ago.

      <p>
       What's taking so long?
      </p>
      <p>
       And what's make others think we are "crazy" conspiracists when many things we talk about end up becoming popularized months later.

       I think part of the lag is the adoption of some stories by the aging dinosaur media outlets.  Thankfully there are so many alternative voices for news sources, and when one reports on a legitimate story the other alternative voices fall in line.  At a certain point the main stream news outlets have no choice but to report on it to maintain some sort of legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, alternative news outlets are rarely accepted on those news outlets.  If you look through such submissions, usually the top comment is something to the effect  of "Can we get another source than___ " or "Do you really trust _____ ."  Those people are probably just shills.

       Yep, anyone who's ever remotely skeptical or weary of unestablished blogs as bastions of truth must be getting paid to do so. It's not like there could be anything wrong with sources who don't have to back anything up.

       Not having anything to back up a claim is one thing which both main stream and alternative news are guilty of from time-to-time.  The point of this post is the speed at which these stories are more widely accepting assuming they have something to back it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternative news sources can run circles around mainstream organization because they don't have to deal with internal bureaucracies and special interests (i.e. Microsoft-NBC-Universal-Comcast-GE).

       dude, go fuck yourself. Seek truth or just decide mystically what you believe, but if someone leads you to truth don't fuck with it. You don't deserve to be hand fed facts. You haven't earned it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seek truth, it is a beautiful thing, or eat that blue pill and believe whatever mainline view you subscribe to. But for fucks sake don't cop out on doing research. Anyone who really wants to know reality is required to read and study primary text otherwise your are just a slave to interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       quit fucking with yourself and everbody else and do some research.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will give you $100 USD if you can prove you read "The Creature from Jekyll Island." That is a fucking promise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read that shit I will pay you $100 dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only catch is if you feel morally that you learned more than $100 worth of knowledge, Otherwise, claim your prize
      </p>
      <p>
       If you prove your comprehension and I do not pay, please shame me and embarrass me off of reddit and end this account, so help me God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please though, no summaries, ethically actually read every chapter and tell me you did more than spark notes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will pay or strike me dead.

       ? I never said one was natural and one not. Contrails comprised of water vapor are obviously unnatural--to the extent that they are being expelled from a manmade machine. Then again--man is part of nature, is he not? (or she for that matter)...but I digress.

       It's very telling to me that you basically admit here that they are two different things. One made of water vapor and one made of...what? That's the question. You can see these trails do not diffuse at the rate water vapor should. So what is your hypothesis?

       If every conspiracy theory, no matter how wild, gets promoted to the front page, then eventually you are going to come across some legitimate conspiracies which will eventually make it to the real world later, when they are substantiated with solid evidence.  If you believe in conspiracy theories in general, this will confirm your belief, regardless of how many are dismissed or forgotten.  This is called "Confirmation Bias".
      </p>
      <p>
       A Conspiracy Theorist finds the real world scary.  They feel more comfortable convincing themselves that they "know" a false truth than accepting that they don't understand powers greater than themselves.  While it may seem counter-intuitive, it is easier and more comforting to believe that two iconic New York skyscrapers were brought down by the powerful US Government than by some Pakistani rednecks with box cutters.  On top of that, being "in the know" means you are smarter than the masses who have been deceived by conspirators, and you are therefore prepared and safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe that something happens randomly and as a result of a chaotic world, then you have to accept that you are vulnerable.  If you believe that bad things happen because extremely bad and powerful people execute elaborate collaborations to orchestrate them, then you are under the radar and invisible to the bad guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or sometimes, paranoia.

       "chemtrail" paranoia?
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, get your head outta your ass. It's not paranoia. Just take a look at the ice caps.

       "The utterly bizarre assertion that Sandy Hook was entirely invented with fake children and actor families"
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you seen anyone cheerful after their children were murdered? Not to mention, no footage of the shooting. We saw Columbine. Something about this Sandyhook story is bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The recently-popular, completely baseless belief that the twin towers were not brought down because fucking planes crashed into them, but because spooky, unspecified "directed energy weapons" were used to atomize their structure"
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk what that belief is, but the whole 9/11 story in itself is fishy. There's too many coincidences that occurred that day for it be completely random acts of terrorism. Like, the SEC files of the world trade, the insurance on the world trade, the files of the pentagon wing, dick cheney owning halliburton and making billions off the war initiated by 9/11. That's just for starters...You can get more info on coincidences behind 9/11 through your own research.

       "The belief, in the face of all medical evidence to the contrary, that vaccines cause autism / homosexuality or are otherwise harmful, perhaps deliberately so, even to the extent of possibly being completely ineffectual"
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, I understand that vaccines have saved mankind from diseases such as polio, small pox, or tb. It's evident. 
However, this was before kids were getting 26 shots or more. I mean damn. Enough is enough. Half those shots are unnecessary and will have to taken again a year or two later.
      </p>

       "The belief that sinister symbols are deliberately inserted into children's cartoons in some attempt to somehow indoctrinate or expose the youth to these undue influences"
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk about them being in there for any specific reason, but those symbols are there. just sayin. do you need an eye check?

      <p>
       "The ever-popular Jew-hating holocaust denial (which is totally not born of Nazi sympathy guys, I'm just asking questions alright) and the Israel idée fixe that leads members to constantly post stories about Israel doing bad shit, apropos of nothing, to a sub that is otherwise supposed to be about conspiracies."
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no clue here. I don't bother with shit like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You only have one argument against conspiracists. And I feel like there's a separation between the conspiracists that buy into the holocaust denial and the one's that think rationally. It's about the same line that separates the alien believers from the non-alien believers. Of course, this is a generalization. As is this whole convo.

       Well, from what I've read, the chemtrails help accelerate the trapping of heat in the atmosphere by increasing the amount of methane.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, we have a huge, unusual break up of the ice sheet in the arctic. Like right now. And continuing.

       edit: Also, while chemtrails do also cool down certain areas due to their increase in rain, they are still increasing the greenhouse gas effect and are therefore counter productive.

       Patronising people who don't necessarily have the same knowledge on a certain subject as you do, is never a good way to get people to listen to what you have to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, actually, common sense would dictate that the melting ice-caps may have something to do with standard global warming, whether it be natural or due to the increased pollution of an industrialised world. Not to mention neither article connected the breakup of ice-caps to chemtrails.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've done 2 + X = melting ice-caps, therefore X = chemtrails.

       Oh shit, you really don't know. I was serious when I said that. I guess many people don't look up and think about the sky. Not trying to be a dick. I thought the news covered the ice melting.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's no standard global warming. Humans have had minimal effects on the climate change. The methane doesn't help, but it's just a solar shutdown going on.

       Nope haha, sorry, i honestly don't have the first clue about chemtrails theories, i was just surprised that you could make such a big jump from ice-caps melting = chemtrails.

       What slightly makes me wonder, and take this with a pinch of salt, is that a new ice age (for example) would very much sort out one of the other pressing problems this world has: overpopulation. It very much ties into energy demands etc. Interesting thought, if nothing else.

       True, overpopulation is big in many countries, but it isn't the exact problem around the global. Because in Japan there's underpopulation. I think more countries need to consider the social factors that drive population and control those factors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, in India, gender preference is a factor that is increasing their population. And in Africa, you have unwanted fertility and replacement effect as the main reason for overpopulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's mostly population density that's our main problem. Which kinda sucks, cause it could've been altered for the better if past generations would've put their minds in front of their wallets. But that's life.

       Despite the importance of vaccinations there are still risks, which should be considered.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         An increased risk of narcolepsy was found following vaccination with Pandemrix
        </strong>
        , a monovalent 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine that was used in several European countries during the H1N1 influenza pandemic. Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder caused by the brain’s inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/h1n1_narcolepsy_pandemrix.html">

       </a>
       | cdc.gov
      </p>
      <p>
       So vaccination for the treatment of
       <em>
        mild
       </em>
       illnesses like influenza, the risks far surpasses the benefits, while for more serious like meningitis or polio it is still a no-brainer.

       Worldviews seen in
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       are aligned to Mainstream Media and the overall establishment's propaganda machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       One excellent example is the
       <strong>
        Arab Springs
       </strong>
       . While here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       we were lambasting it as part of the West's and its allies agenda of controlling the Middle East, MSM was heralding it as
       <em>
        freedom fighters
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        pro-democracy grassroot movement
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now MSM position on the Arab Springs has changed, from full out support to apprehension. Still, most journalists, don't go as far as pointing out the true culprits, but their apprehension and even disgust is more than apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know in what state Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and soon Syria are all in.

       On
       <strong>
        Vaccination
       </strong>
       (as much as I consider it essential in the prevention of dangerous diseases like mengitis and polio), our apprehension of it has been justified by the latest findings:
      </p>

       Unfortunately most of what is posted here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       are hard facts and freely available information that many simply either ignore its importance and impact or are just unaware drowned in a sea of 24/7 useless information: Operation Gladio, MK ULtra, Liason Financial Markets and Drug Trade, Financial Manipulations, Media Manipulation, etc...
