       I can recommend Poland for EU Shengen Area.  Its not in the Eurozone.  I really like Poland more and more because it has experienced Soviet Union Light and the people there have a lot of depth.  Great fucking meat, hot chicks, lots of English speaking hot chicks who are hot and speak English.  It doesn't have the Euro yet and the people are very industrious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The city of Lviv (Lvov), Ukraine is very interesting but corrupt in ways but may not be noticeable depending on what you do.  The nice thing about this city is that you can stay there and see the EU from just outside of the window.  If you specifically use the Polish border near Lviv you can do a border run taking only about 4-5 hours and you can stay an additional 90 days.  I did this many times.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you like Hungary then you can use the Croatian border to do runs and I hear that it is possible to do this forever.  Budapest is amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The break away republic Transdnistria in Moldova is actually a very very interesting place and property is very cheap there.  The prices are crazy low and the women are out of control hot and people are pretty damn nice (except when hungover during the holidays when in my opinion they are terrible).  It gets way too homely there probably 3-4 months of the year.  You can buy a real small apartment there for $20-25k and you will completely own it with no property tax just required central utility costs which are real reasonable.  Not for everyone but I am seriously considering buying a property there if I have an extra wad of cash.  Its strange there in that there are statues of Lenin in the center but it is more capitalistic in nature than America is now.  Also I recommend this to further understand where America is going.  These people in Trandsnistria are special because they survived communism and they survived the post-Soviet looting.  Tiraspol is a special place for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bulgaria is in the EU but not Shengen and it has fantastic drinkable water and probably the best beaches in on the Black Sea with a very diverse European mix.  Border runs are trivially easy here as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't recommend anything on the Mediterranean because I think that all aspects of the society there are currently overvalued.  I'm searched for high value, something different, something somewhat resistant to globalized crap.  I think that you can find what you are looking for in ex-Soviet or ex-Warsaw Pact countries.  The value is just great there.

       I think it's less about freedom and more about the EU having full control over the economic state of your area, and in effect, control over their people. Can't the EU can decide to bankrupt any country in its domain, except Germany and perhaps France?

       Why would they bankrupt a country which is directly linked with their economy,politics,policies and would have to pay to keep a bankrupt country going?

      <p>
       They have control of the currency we use not our economic policies themselves.

       Countries in the EU are under enormous pressure to move to the Euro.  The countries in the South that got in early on the euro were in the trade and monetary union and they were encouraged to borrow enormous amounts of money.  For whatever reason the countries making stuff (Germany) were happy to pretend like the somehow it was working out.  Now in these trashed economies they are going to be in a situation where foreigners are looking to carve up the national assets and treasures.  Cash restrictions are being imposed, etc.  There was too much investment in real estate.... well where the fuck did all of that money come from?  Its piece of shit currencies like the euro and the dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Germans are not willing to print any more money openly to debase the currency and to keep it alive in the face of immense financial fuckery so what is going on at this moment is the Federal Reserve is fabricating magic dollars and giving it to Spanish and Italian banks so that they can sell these dollars to buy euros.  Its doomed and so is the dollar.  One fucked failing international reserve currency proping up a fiat currency based on an affiliation of disintersted and disparate tribes is no special win ticket.  The Fed is doing this to prop up the entire current financial order and because it already has too much exposure to those countries, so naturally exposing itself more will help, for a while.

       to enter the euro and I hope to hell that they don't.  I hope that they drag there feet for as long as possible until the shit hits the fan and then they will be like no fucking way.  I look forward to paying in Zlotys when I return.

       You act as if Germany just let it happen. Many of these countries lied etc about the situation in their country(eg Greece).
 Poland like many other countries under the treaty have to join the euro by a set date. They agreed to it. It make things worse if 10+ countries were at different stages of integration.

       Germans were not trying to see.  I believe that due to the intensity of the Germans and their idealism they will once again be center stage to immense suffering.  I'm sure you've heard of the German takeover.  So there you have more and more people are perceiving them to be the enemy.  Now once again Germany will be in a position to unify Europe.  They are still on that trip.  Did you know?  From what I gather the manifest dream is to organize Europe and to make it strong.  I think that the Germans and the people in the far West will fail because they will underestimate the differences of the extremely tribal people of Europe.  Its already completely failed for some.
      </p>

       So I was in Bucharest recently and many of the streets are not marked, even one block off from the subway.  I ended up walking in circles for 45 minutes to find my hostel and ended up paying a taxi back where I started from an outrageous sum for the distance.  I hear that many of the cities in the North West of Romania have consistent street signs from Austrian-Hungarian times.  It hit me that even today the people of Bucharest can't get their shit together enough to roll out street signs in a methodical way.  Fucking hell there are differences.  I had a sudden revelatation at that moment that the euro would fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than simple luck I don't see how Romania is fit to be in the EU with the monetary union.  I think its nuts.  I'm guessing that the EU wanted to secure its flank so they let it in but outside of Shengen.
      </p>
      <p>
       [edit] I think that the strength of Europe is that there are so many different cultures with their own ideas.  This creates massive chaos on one hand but on the other it allows European culture as a whole to keep moving forward when a few crazy tribes get out of hand.  The languages buffer against craziness and dysfunction.  Perhaps gold or some form of cryptographic currency would work out very well.  I seriously fucking intensely doubt that Greece would have been lent or given as much money as it was if that "currency" was gold.  No way in hell.  The only reason that shit went on is because it is all funny money anyways.  With some hard currency a network of trade based upon trust, value and rule of law could be established that would not need to be administered by self-titled "Europeans" such as the Germans and North Western Europeans.
      </p>
      <p>
       [edit] Just remembering about gold and Germany again.  A huge amount of German gold is stored in New York.  Zerohedge exposed the fact that JP Morgan has an underground tunnel from their facility to the Federal Reserve storage vault.  Germans want their gold back now and they are to receive a portion of it in super tiny shipments spanning out numerous years.  That is a joke.  That is like saying that the US government will balance in budget in 2020.  Germans are not going to get their gold.  The shit is gone.  The big banks have been shorting gold and selling on the lows for years now.  They have leased the gold out and its gone.  This is why China is happy at the moment because immense amounts of gold are being transferred to them at a suppressed price.  Meanwhile Germans are just beginning to awake from their guilt ridden slumber to come to grips with this.  One thing to realize is that Europeans and Americans don't want to admit that their metal holdings are depleted because this would break the relatively nice status quo and Chinese don't want to make big news about it because they are slurping up every bar of gold that they can get their hands on.  The Euro is "the inflexibility of the gold standard without the gold".

       And seriously. Stop trying to escape the corruption. If you want to actually accomplish anything, make a stand and fight for what you believe in instead of trying to escape it.

       Venezuela, Ecuador, Brazil, Argentina. South America is where the real change is happening, not Europe. Europe might have universal healthcare and such but they're still imperialists like the U.S; including your precious Sweden.

      <p>
       Definitely not Chile. Chile is SO fucked. Divorce was only legalized there several years ago and it is illegal to get an abortion, even if you were raped.

       Which is the most secular from those, Argentina?  Is the economy picking up in those countries now that they detached from the IMF?  I think Brazil's economy is growing fast, but still sounds like a dangerous place.

       From what I understand you should skip Argentina right up and go Chile or Uruguay.  Argentina has habitual almost yearly massive currency devaluations.

       Also if you are a strong freedom loving capitalistic idealist than heavily socialist countries might rub you the wrong way even if the quality of life is pretty decent.

       Argentina is the most secular, and probably the best choice. And albeit countries like Brazil ad Venezuela have high murder rates, they are only high relative to other countries. It is still very unlikely that you'll be murdered in either country (there are about 40,000 murders per year in Brazil, but that's out of a country with a population of +200 million people). Being robbed on the street is what you'll have to look out for, but as long as you don't carry a lot of money with you or wear extravagant clothing then you're fine.

       Uh... As a Brazilian I can tell that the government in here is
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       corrupt, it is considered its "natural state". Also, it is not exactly stable, we had six different types of government over less than 200 years of independence. Finally, for some reason our diplomat corps has a tendency of being a bunch of UN ass-lickers.

       Germans were not trying to see.  I believe that due to the intensity of the Germans and their idealism they will once again be center stage to immense suffering.  I'm sure you've heard of the German takeover.  So there you have more and more people are perceiving them to be the enemy.  Now once again Germany will be in a position to unify Europe.  They are still on that trip.  Did you know?  From what I gather the manifest dream is to organize Europe and to make it strong.  I think that the Germans and the people in the far West will fail because they will underestimate the differences of the extremely tribal people of Europe.  Its already completely failed for some.
      </p>

       So I was in Bucharest recently and many of the streets are not marked, even one block off from the subway.  I ended up walking in circles for 45 minutes to find my hostel and ended up paying a taxi back where I started from an outrageous sum for the distance.  I hear that many of the cities in the North West of Romania have consistent street signs from Austrian-Hungarian times.  It hit me that even today the people of Bucharest can't get their shit together enough to roll out street signs in a methodical way.  Fucking hell there are differences.  I had a sudden revelatation at that moment that the euro would fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than simple luck I don't see how Romania is fit to be in the EU with the monetary union.  I think its nuts.  I'm guessing that the EU wanted to secure its flank so they let it in but outside of Shengen.
      </p>
      <p>
       [edit] I think that the strength of Europe is that there are so many different cultures with their own ideas.  This creates massive chaos on one hand but on the other it allows European culture as a whole to keep moving forward when a few crazy tribes get out of hand.  The languages buffer against craziness and dysfunction.  Perhaps gold or some form of cryptographic currency would work out very well.  I seriously fucking intensely doubt that Greece would have been lent or given as much money as it was if that "currency" was gold.  No way in hell.  The only reason that shit went on is because it is all funny money anyways.  With some hard currency a network of trade based upon trust, value and rule of law could be established that would not need to be administered by self-titled "Europeans" such as the Germans and North Western Europeans.
      </p>
      <p>
       [edit] Just remembering about gold and Germany again.  A huge amount of German gold is stored in New York.  Zerohedge exposed the fact that JP Morgan has an underground tunnel from their facility to the Federal Reserve storage vault.  Germans want their gold back now and they are to receive a portion of it in super tiny shipments spanning out numerous years.  That is a joke.  That is like saying that the US government will balance in budget in 2020.  Germans are not going to get their gold.  The shit is gone.  The big banks have been shorting gold and selling on the lows for years now.  They have leased the gold out and its gone.  This is why China is happy at the moment because immense amounts of gold are being transferred to them at a suppressed price.  Meanwhile Germans are just beginning to awake from their guilt ridden slumber to come to grips with this.  One thing to realize is that Europeans and Americans don't want to admit that their metal holdings are depleted because this would break the relatively nice status quo and Chinese don't want to make big news about it because they are slurping up every bar of gold that they can get their hands on.  The Euro is "the inflexibility of the gold standard without the gold".
