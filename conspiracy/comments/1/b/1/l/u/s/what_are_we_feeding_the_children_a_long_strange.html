<hr/>

<p>Now that the appropriate credits have been established, on with the meat of it.</p>

<hr/>

<p>We have heard about <em>Operation Mockingbird</em> </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird</a></p>

<p>And we know from that operation that Warner Brothers was instrumental. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll get right back to Warner Bros, but if you aren&#39;t already familiar with it read up on it as a primer before moving forward within this post.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When I was in 6th grade I had a very special nemesis, its name was <em>Channel One</em>.  Channel one was, as many of you know, a satellite broadcast program that was pumped into public schools and shown to grades 6-12.  I absolutely loathed this 15 minute long program from day one.  There were several reasons for my hatred of channel one.  My 6th grade mind really hated the opening theme which was a fallout 3 looking static image of the channel one logo along with an audio clip of a guitar being plucked from string 6 to string 1 without anyone holding a chord.  I knew how to play guitar already and this open fret sound was really psychologically annoying to me.</p>

<p>The teachers in &quot;home room&quot; were apparently instructed to ensure that we watched this program as several of my friends and I were assigned to after school detention for talking or being off task during the 15 minutes of hell.</p>

<p>Channel One is owned and operated by <em>Alloy marketing</em> which specialised in marketing to teens.  Alloy inc is owned by (drum roll) Warner Brothers...</p>

<p>Warner brothers is on record working with the CIA for propaganda purposes.</p>

<p>Anderson Cooper has worked for the CIA, channel one, ABC, CNN. Yet he doesn&#39;t even have a journalistic degree.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Cooper">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Cooper</a></p>

<p>So Channel One boasts about its amazing ratings and viewership, which is forced upon our kids.  It airs for 15 minutes a day 5 days a week to a captive audience and apparently, now days, has a website where it takes political pols of children who aren&#39;t even old enough to vote.  I looked at their website and found it pretty disturbing.  Especially the comments section, there was a lot of circle jerking and &quot;I love you so much&quot; star worship going on.</p>

<p><strong>So what exactly are we feeding our children?</strong></p>

<p>We wouldn&#39;t approve of 15 minutes from Vatican City every day in public schools would we?</p>

<p>Some marketing firm in Chicago is supposedly trustworthy enough to be allowed to propagandize at our kids?  Who are these people and how did they &quot;get in&quot;? Why is precious time in our suffering education system being handed over to a marketing firm from Chicago?</p>

<p>Maybe Channel One is just another tentacle of mockingbird that is conveniently out of sight for most of us.  Its scary to me that some marketing firm is running the show because I feel like they are trying to sell something.  </p>

<p>It makes me wonder how far reaching mockingbird is.  Alex Jones, Anderson Cooper, Channel One, Anonymous?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oddly enough I went to a Catholic school, and we still had Channel 1 piped into the homerooms in the mornings. </p>

<p>You mention: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We wouldn&#39;t approve of 15 minutes from Vatican City every day in public schools would we?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting that we&#39;ve somehow clearly established the catholic church, the one with the core teachings wich include serving the poor, not fucking for fun, respecting life, and treating your neighbor how you would be treated, as the standard for what is NOT allowed in a school. </p>

<p>As someone who ran as far away from church as my legs could go after I left 14 years of Catholic education, I look now at Channel 1, and worse, Channels 2-2987 on cable, and think if there is a &quot;Satan&quot; he surely is entertained. </p>

<p>Even the solitary intro notes are a main aspect of Pavlovian programming. </p>

<p>If you want to see more of where I&#39;m coming from, don&#39;t worry, you don&#39;t need 14 years of Catholic school, just watch &quot;Century of Self&quot; on youtube.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think this way. But after some major mistakes, lifestyle adjustments, and having kids of my own, I think religion should be understood and not feared. If a religion promotes goodwill, doing the right thing for the right reason, and we run from it, what do we run to? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t speak on the actions of the people in a religion or any specific set of doctrines. People will always show their evil abilities. But me, myself, where do I run if I run from goodwill. </p>

<p>So we tell our children that religion can&#39;t be in a school, because it&#39;s not what we believe, and then let some satanic themed materialistic sex cult grace our televisions and in turn, our children, day and night. </p>

<p>What does this do to our kids? </p>

<p>I&#39;d like my kids to know all about all the religions, and why they developed the teachings they did. What makes a good man? What is the right thing? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve found the right thing, is not what is on TV, it&#39;s not the latest toy or the coolest clothes. I had to buy the coolest clothes and toys to figure that out, I had to fuck around with women, do drugs, wallow in misery, run around proclaiming my Atheism to the world, until one day, I... I guess I grew up. </p>

<p>Now my goal is to live by example, ask tough questions, and grow in my ability to love others, no matter what. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When Channel One extended it&#39;s influence into our local school districts it was heralded as a way to provide a free TV and free coaxial cabling for every classroom in the district. Teachers no longer had to reserve an AV cart or TV and roll it into the classroom before class and there were no more shortages of AV equipment. </p>

<p>As for the programming, from what I can tell it is an avenue to sell acne cream and candy bars. With so much propaganda out there on many media outlets I can&#39;t help but think that same nonsense would creep into Channel One programming.</p>

<p>I think its very active today.</p>

<p>Most of them probably know what they are doing.</p>

<p>You can see the Agenda shining trough.</p>

<p>Anderson Cooper: was &quot;debunking&quot; Sandy Hook &quot;Conspiracy Theories&quot;.</p>

<p>Michael Moore: is &quot;the liberal&quot; pushing gun control (while having armed bodyguards) and communism, won&#39;t touch Bilderberg.</p>

<p>Piers Morgan: pushing gun control, sandy hook.</p>

<p>Bill O Reilly: War monger,9/11.</p>

<p>Glenn Beck is telling never the full story and is the &quot;mainstream&quot;  conspiracy theorist. </p>

<p>Anonymous is loose collective so there are hackers,serious activsists,12 year old kiddies and goverment agents all in one.</p>

<p>I know some here disagree but Alex Jones is one of the researcher/media who is real.</p>

<p>I researched him quit a bit and are a regular listener.
If you actual research his work you see, he has never compromised his message of liberty and isn&#39;t funded by big money like all of above.</p>

<p>There are of course other great &quot;alternative&quot; researcher/media like Luke Rudkowski (WeAreChange),Max Keiser,Jim Marrs,Press for Truth,Fritz Springmeier,Jim Tucker,David Icke,Alan Watt and a whole lot others.</p>

<p>Now look at the people looking to destroy public school systems and replace them with electronic lessons (which they will use to control the flow of information and &quot;who gets what&quot; in terms of Education) Chief among them is Fox news owner Rupert Murdoch.</p>

<p>Your tie into operation mockingbird is interesting. But they are in the process of leaving the covert for the overt. No longer satisfied to inadvertently control people with their CIA Operations they will resort to more open &amp; direct methods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Off topic, but, did you know that open EADGBE is technically a chord?</p>

<p>On topic, I don&#39;t think Channel One has as big an influence that you think. If it&#39;s anything like it was in the mid 90&#39;s, they had a big swingandamiss on it. Everyone hated it and no one paid any attention to it while it blared in the background. Most of the time the teacher turned it off.</p>

<p>My next question is this: <em>Is</em> it really that big of a deal now? I mean, are they <em>forced</em> to watch or otherwise get in trouble? </p>

<p>BTW, nice post. It&#39;s nice to see someone thinking critically for a change. Kudos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t know it was technically a chord, if it is its a hideous chord.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard from my nephews that some teachers enforce it and others don&#39;t.  It depends on the teacher.  I imagine it depends on the teacher&#39;s political affiliation since the content seems to have a leftward slant.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think its literally &quot;mind control&quot; or anything that big in scope, I think its just another layer of group think enforcement that we all deal with every day.  Only these minds are still developing and very impressionable.</p>

<p>My fascination with it is how it is run, by a marketing firm that specialized in teens (what are they selling?) And it being a possible mouthpiece for CIA propaganda.  It all seems very well thought out.  I would actually be less worried if it wasn&#39;t managed by scientific marketing experts and was student managed by the journalism club.  </p>

<p>It all ties back into big money and big media, literally warner brothers.</p>

<p>Man selling school tv: Hey! You guys want Channel One?</p>

<p>School official: How much?</p>

<p>MSSTV: Free. Equipment is paid for by advertising.</p>

<p>SO: So basically you want to put tv&#39;s in every class and have us make the kids watch every day while you pelt your captive audience with ads?</p>

<p>MSSTV: Don&#39;t think about that! Think about the free programming! Polls! Current events! </p>

<p>SO: Seems legit......</p>

<p>Laugh all you want, that&#39;s the gist of it all! LOL!</p>

<p>Yep, it&#39;s a chord. Shitty as it sounds. I don&#39;t know of any real guitarist using it other than Kurt Cobain, not that he was a great guitarist, just famous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was much more to the anderson cooper analysis than that ONE POINT.</p>

<p>Thanks for the down vote though.  I appreciate your act of mini-censorship.</p>

<p>My point is, who oversees this crap our children are forced to watch?  The department of education? The local school boards?  The minister of propaganda?  Who?</p>

<p>And the rest of your post is so incomprehensible, it&#39;s the only thing I really understood. And the implication is quite offensive to Anderson, who worked hard for his position at CNN. </p>

<p>My post might not be perfectly formatted but it is far from &quot;incomprehensible&quot;.</p>

<p>And who cares if my post is offensive to Anderson Cooper? </p>

<p>I concede that you might not be the down votes since something strange is going on with the votes on this post.  But that doesn&#39;t really matter anyway, I was just being a smart ass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After doing a bit of research, I have to say I agree. </p>

<p>Man selling school tv: Hey! You guys want Channel One?</p>

<p>School official: How much?</p>

<p>MSSTV: Free. Equipment is paid for by advertising.</p>

<p>SO: So basically you want to put tv&#39;s in every class and have us make the kids watch every day while you pelt your captive audience with ads?</p>

<p>MSSTV: Don&#39;t think about that! Think about the free programming! Polls! Current events! </p>

<p>SO: Seems legit......</p>

<p>Laugh all you want, that&#39;s the gist of it all! LOL!</p>

<p>Yep, it&#39;s a chord. Shitty as it sounds. I don&#39;t know of any real guitarist using it other than Kurt Cobain, not that he was a great guitarist, just famous.</p>
