        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>(I created a similar thread yesterday but deleted it due to a bad title)</p>

<p>I think this is important to discuss. People in the last thread stated that it&#39;s the absolute opposite of what this global power group would want - but how can we be sure? </p>

<p>What if some disaster would happen to the Bitcoin system and it would need to be reformed for &quot;the safety of the currency&quot;?  (we&#39;ve heard that one being used before) Perhaps it&#39;s disguised as something decentralized and positive to make it possible for this power group to make the <em>initial hard step</em> to a digital currency, which needs the support of the people.</p>

<p>How do we know it will stay non-centralized and non-controlled later on? It&#39;s already dependent on the internet.</p>

<p>They are smart and usually disguise their plans wisely to gain big support for it. We need to be careful in what we support and think wisely of where this digital currency could lead.</p>

<p>With the Cyprus ATM opening as well, I think it makes it a very relevant topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More importantly look at the choice of source code control. Using <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">GitHub</a> means that every contribution is publicly tracked. Also, git ensures that the source can&#39;t be arbitrarily modified in transit - doing so would invalidate the hashes that make up the history (and it is transmitted over HTTPS). </p>

<p>You may consider that your compiler has been compromised so that although clean source goes in, corrupted executable code comes out. That&#39;s OK, you can check your output files and even reverse engineer them since that&#39;s allowed in the non-existent license.</p>

<p>You may decide that you don&#39;t trust anything that comes out of that team at all. That&#39;s OK, you can use the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_rules">Protocol Rules</a> to make your own implementation. So long as you follow the same rules as everyone else then your transactions will be accepted on to the network along with everybody else&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It should be noted that git itself is open source. In fact the languages it is written in are open source too. If you run git and bitcoin under linux then there is nothing that you can&#39;t inspect and audit for yourself.</p>

<p>C is a language that all of the above use primarily. A fun fact about it is that the compiler gcc is also written in C. To make a new version of gcc it must compile itself. So its C all the way down, and you get the initial one by a process known as bootstrapping.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said, that everyone has to know everything about the network. This is the definition of centralization. Not geographically, but methodically. The effect is that it can&#39;t scale up and it is prone to disruption. </p>

<p>If you have a centralized tracker, but hold it private between or within a student body, nobody from the outside can disrupt it. Or a disruption in another student dorm does not harm your operation. If you know a way to disrupt a technique so that everybody can&#39;t use it, it is central or centralized.</p>

<p>It is also possible to make a generator that makes &quot;random&quot; numbers that are pre-determined. As long as the pre-determined list is never exposed, they are &quot;random.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those &quot;random&quot; pre-determined numbers will only be good until the next block is created, after which they are completely useless. That&#39;s the whole point. That&#39;s how bitcoin mining works in the first place.</p>

<p>I think I just realized what you are thinking. You are thinking that bitcoins are created by finding hashes that correspond to a specific coin. This is completely wrong.</p>

<p>The hashes generated by miners are for creating blocks of transactions. There is no unique identifier for a specific coin, it&#39;s just a balance on a specific account - a counter, nothing more.</p>

<p>The coins miners receive are a reward for generating a new valid page of transactions (block) in the transaction book (blockchain).</p>

<p>If you look at any specific block, you will see that the first transaction in the block is new coins generated - the reward (25BTC + sum of transaction fees). Note how they don&#39;t have an originating address.</p>

<p>Here is the freshest current block as an example: <a href="https://blockchain.info/block-index/368594/0000000000000056e0a2526984973e42abf2025a730e92f74c370cf04519fe70">https://blockchain.info/block-index/368594/0000000000000056e0a2526984973e42abf2025a730e92f74c370cf04519fe70</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>How in the world would you control potential hash generation?  If you try to control it, someone else just gets the block before you do, and all your work means nothing.  If you somehow control counts, that just means you&#39;re going to wind up in an orphaned chain and anything you do no longer affects the proper Bitcoin network.  What ctzl fails to mention is that it isn&#39;t really the clients that give the block the OK - it&#39;s the miners, when they find new blocks based on the old block&#39;s hash.  And that takes raw processing power.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like trying to poison a torrent by providing a bad file.  You might affect some people who are trying to download, but all you&#39;ll do is inconvenience them for a bit and waste your bandwidth.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Also, the very reason SHA256 is used is because it <em>isn&#39;t</em> predictable.  Not yet, at least; if someone finds a hole, Bitcoin will probably move to a new hash method.  There will almost certainly be a panic sell and the price will plummet... but that&#39;s for another discussion.</p>

<p>Why? Because they don&#39;t know what the &quot;answer&quot; is among the potentials created by hashing and nonce, which are under the domain of the miners random number generation. That is my only point. Controlling that among the miners would allow you to complete answers before their required hashes exist...because you know what they will become.</p>

<p>Sha-256 has already been found to not be perfect. Why is there a sha-512? It&#39;s hard to move an entire distributed implementation to a newer hash function, and by hard, I mean time consuming.</p>

<p>SHA-512 is just a 64-bit version of SHA-256.  There is no flaw as of yet discovered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to control all of them, though that would be the perfect scenario. The key is making a list of the end result by forcing what random numbers are plugged in. With those, the CPU intensive calculations, no longer are &quot;intensive.&quot; When they aren&#39;t you can beat all the other miners to the punch. Sure it&#39;s not &quot;technically&quot; valid, but as long as the hashes check out and the miners agree that the log is valid (why wouldn&#39;t it be) then all is well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, let me see if I can explain a bit.</p>

<p>Every time a block hits the network, everyone&#39;s starting point changes.  The starting point is <em>non-predictable</em>.  Even though it is falling within a narrow band of the total possible hashes, that&#39;s still a range of one to <em>one sexdecillion</em>.  (That&#39;s 10<sup>54</sup> ).  If you calculated a bunch of hashes based off of one of those numbers, picked at random, the odds of that hash being found <em>before the heat death of the universe</em> are ridiculously small.</p>

<p>If you started trying to manipulate the blockchain by using hashes that didn&#39;t fit the range, <em>every single non-corrupted bitcoin node</em> is going to reject your blocks.  You would cause a hard fork.  Essentially at that point you would have two different Bitcoin networks - the one that you weren&#39;t manipulating, that all the big exchanges and online wallets were running on, and your own Bitcoin that accepted bad blocks.  You would no longer be able to affect Bitcoin as a whole.</p>

<p>Even if you had a bajillion Bitcoin nodes that were all trying to broadcast your bogus blocks, you still would get nowhere.  Bad blocks are rejected, no matter how many nodes send them.  It&#39;s very easy for Bitcoin clients to determine what a bad block is and what a good block is; that&#39;s one of the major strengths of its design.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no doubt everything can be co-opted (see Anonymous group and LulzSec).</p>

<p>The point is that Bitcoin, <em>by design</em>, is a voluntary currency issued and administered in a distributed way without a central authority.</p>

<p>No one can implant you an RFID chip if you don&#39;t want because Bitcoin.</p>

<p>So although it doesn&#39;t make much sense because of its distributed architecture and all the overhead with mining (transaction processing and issuance in the hands of the users), yes maybe the establishment could &quot;adopt&quot; Bitcoin.</p>

<p>But guess what? Bitcoin is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_Open_Source_Software">free open source software</a>. It&#39;s easy to &quot;fork&quot; into a new underground Bitcoin2 system that will be in control of users again, so there&#39;ll always be ways to opt out. The cat is out of the bag, the pandora&#39;s box of crypto-currency is open.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Internet was designed back then by the military to be distributed enough to withstand nuclear attacks. It&#39;s the best they could come up with back at the time.  </p>

<p>Despite founded by the military, apparently the internet can also be used for positive things, like spreading information. Probably that wasn&#39;t planned. Without it, people would still be much more asleep and much more unaware of the scam of the FED and private banking. If you&#39;re against the internet, then what are you doing here?  </p>

<p>Same with currency. Bitcoin was not planned. That currency goes digital is <em>unavoidable</em>. It&#39;s just technological progress. The dollar <em>is</em> already digital. The prophecies have <em>already</em> become true. Don&#39;t stay in dreamland. There&#39;s no reason to invent a new currency unit like Bitcoin to chip everyone, they can use dollars as well. Bitcoin is a counter-movement to this, the idea has been around in cryptographical hacker, activism and anarchism subculture for quite a while already for exactly those reasons. Just read about the roots! Bitcoin is the currency of resistance!  </p>

<p>The internet has some weak (central) spots yes, but Bitcoin may well enable and incentivize further development of mesh networks.</p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about the future and not the past, about a scenario where we don&#39;t destroy ourselves. Of course, if we bomb ourselves back to the stone age, then we&#39;ll have other problems. Similarly, for the future, I&#39;m not saying that Bitcoin will stay around forever in the current form. It&#39;s just a project. It may bring us into an age of post-scarcity where money becomes largely superfluous anyway. No one knows what the year 3000 will look like. But we should take control of our fate, and not condemn technologies like Bitcoin as evil witch craft, without evaluating its properties with scrutiny and judging it by those alone without superstition. Only this is the path that can bring us into a better future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So does your credit card and anything you buy online.  A microchip just seems superfluous at this point.  No need to use force on the populous when there are more efficient means available.</p>

<p>Outright slavery doesn&#39;t work.  Slaves see whats going on, they know who to kill, they revolt, so on.  It&#39;s also more expensive to keep slaves, you have to provide everything for them.</p>

<p>But now, thanks to the brilliant social engineers of today, we have a much more advanced and sophisticated system in place.  Make the slave not only work for you, but actually pay you to survive.  This is great because the slave believes he has freedom of choice, he is given a nice allowance of sorts that he can use as he sees fit.  And if he isn&#39;t able to survive, then it&#39;s his fault and he will believe that to be so.</p>

<p>Want to track the slave?  No need for invasive and forceful injection of microchips as if he were a farm animal.  Give them a &quot;smart phone&quot;, let them play with the new cool toys, let them have technology and feel as though they understand it and are the ones using it instead of being used by it.  GPS, keylogging, microphones and cameras in everyone&#39;s lives and in everyone&#39;s homes.  </p>

<p>Facebook, Twitter, hardly a need to spy at all when the people are just giving it all up.</p>

<p>On March 18, 2011, von NotHaus was pronounced guilty of &quot;making, possessing, and selling his own currency&quot;.</p>

<p>Until July 2009, the Liberty Dollar was distributed by Liberty Services (formerly known as &quot;National Organization for the Repeal of the Federal Reserve and the Internal Revenue Code&quot; (NORFED), based in Evansville, Indiana. It was created by Bernard von NotHaus, the co-founder of the Royal Hawaiian Mint Company.[3] In May 2009, von NotHaus and others were charged with federal crimes in connection with the Liberty Dollar and, on July 31, 2009, von NotHaus announced that he had closed the Liberty Dollar operation, pending resolution of the criminal charges.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> don&#39;t give your private key to the bank and you&#39;re still alright.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what ? you do know that only 7% of the dollars in circulation are printed and the rest is on a screen ? virtual money. You live in it.</p>

<p>Bitcoin have mathematical properties that mean there can only be 21 millions and at the moment we should just below 11 millions in circulation via mining.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like gold in some ways but better in others. You are right it is not physical, just like patents, copyrights, IP in general in some ways.</p>

<p>Thing is nobody can create btc at wish other than within the limits and by a specified process called mining. They can&#39;t be copied, because the network detects and stops double spends and they can&#39;t be used anywhere else because they are only valid withing the bitcoin network guaranteed by cryptography.</p>

<p>Yeah...</p>

<p>You&#39;re completely missing my point anyway. I don&#39;t need to understand the inner workings of the bitcoin system, just the same as nobody needs to understand the inner workings of the dollar to understand that piece of paper with &#39;20&#39; written on it, isn&#39;t worth $20. I understand Bitcoin in the sense that you can use them to buy things, and therefore it has value while people believe it has value, but that&#39;s the same as every other currency.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s advantages, but people talk about it like it&#39;s some sort of long term solution to the financial system.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>While you make some good points, understanding the bitcoin system is important to understand why bitcoin actually has &quot;gold like&quot; properties. The math behind it ensures that a bitcoin cannot be copied or counterfeited like another digital number. If someone claims to be able to make up bitcoin outside of the mining process, they are similar to people who claim to be able to transmute gold from lead. If you had unlimited energy you could probably do it. Just like if you had unlimited energy and computing power, you could fake bitcoins.</p>

<p>If you have a trusted friend with a math background you could consult with them and have them explain the inner workings of it.</p>

<p>The only motive for warning you that it is a scam is simply that (I hope) fewer people get scammed.  I have nothing to gain or lose either way, my audience does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider the possibility that you may not know more than me. 
I have read extensively around the topic and am well aware of the risks,  benefits and technology involved in Bitcoins. </p>

<p>I am not trying to convince anyone to buy Bitcoins, there are over 5000 people waiting for their accounts to be verified at MtGox, we certainly don&#39;t need more people jumping in to make profits... the price is rising too rapidly in my opinion anyway. </p>

<p>If you cant see the huge potential of a friction-less global, decentralized currency / payment system that makes transferring value as easy as sending an email that&#39;s cool... don&#39;t get involved.
Bitcoin is cheaper than any current solution (PayPal, VISA etc). Your account cant be frozen by any entity (Such as accounts in Cyprus!). I see it as a truly game changing technology.
It&#39;s also open source and fully transparent, so if you have the technical ability by all means examine the protocol. </p>

<p>Claiming it is a scam without any argument is ridiculous. Your argument seems to be &#39;I just know its a scam&#39;. Seriously? State your reasoning!
I find it insulting to my intelligence that you think I am a sucker... I am a professional accountant! I know the risks and certainly wouldn&#39;t suggest anyone gets involved without extensive research to make their own informed decisions. 
If I had listened to you &#39;warners&#39; a year ago I would have missed the boat completely. Its still not even reached the &#39;early adopter&#39; phase! So either state your &#39;inside knowledge&#39; that it is a scam or be quiet. 
You are saving nobody, and time might prove you to be an idiot. 
Many people thought the Internet was a scam and thought digitized music would never replace physical music mediums. Look how ridiculous they look now. 
The only scam is FIAT currency, our Governments print Billions each year devaluing our savings... the internet has found a superior solution!</p>

<p>So, please... (with less arrogance) tell me why you believe it is a scam?
If your reasoning is the early adopters set to profit that is invalid. Were the early investors in Apple stock scammers? How about the first people to find Gold? </p>

<p>OK what is your point?, in 2030 and beyond small fees may be mandatory? That&#39;s no issue for myself, I willingly pay small fees now. I would even mine just to help the network. Still way cheaper than bank / Paypal costs. </p>

<p>??? You DONT KNOW.</p>

<p>PayPal and Visa know exactly who you are and who you are sending money too. Bitcoin is between two parties only. A 3rd party would have to associate you with an address (hard). 
You can also use a different address for every transaction, and there are already anonymity &#39;tumbler&#39; services to make tracking impossible. </p>

<p><strong>Source</strong> for this (less than 4 years old)?</p>

<p>The major drive for researching quantum computing is because we can&#39;t physically  make processors any smaller, having reached construction on the atomic scale (we can still make them cheaper in time).  Certainly we can make larger processors, but the additional costs (storage, cooling, maintenance) need to be factored in.</p>

<p>LOL, if you hold money in your bank due to inflation it is worth less each year. Thanks to our Governments printing machines.

<p>Well, that&#39;s no fun then. We ARE on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> aren&#39;t we? :)</p>

<p>On another point the 51% attack can be mitigated by implementing into the code the requirement of the attacker to also control 51% of the bitcoins, something i read about not long ago(on phone will try find later)</p>

<p>Hmm. That does sound interesting. Would be interested if you had a reference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoins aren&#39;t pretending to be dollars.  The comparison to Liberty Dollars is not applicable.  It&#39;s a commodity.</p>

<p>It will be very difficult for banks to crush Bitcoins; legislation will simply cause it to become encrypted traffic.  DoS attacks will become filtered.  51% attacks, same.  As long as there is interest in Bitcoin, it will survive; the only attack that could realistically work is making it unappealing to everyday users.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>like gt7 said read up a bit. look up the definition of scam, understand what scams are and then understand what bitcoin is. when the block rewards are no longer profitable(which I am not sure if they will ever be, because as the reward halves and the influx of coins become more scarce so will the value of the coins increase. you may only get 12.5 coins next halve but each coin will be worth way more.) then the transaction fees will take over and be main income. and for the moment transaction fees are negligible sure, but the fees will go up and a balance will be found. Transaction fees too high? if that happens then they will increase the amount of transactions per block so the amount of fees per transaction can remain low they just process more at a time to makeup for it. The system is pretty fluid and can change based solely on demand of its users. for better or worse its a majority rules type deal.</p>

<p>Also bitcoin is sort of anonymous. you can be anonymous, but it takes great effort. but really a person with unlimited time and funds can always trace and work the system to find the information they seek. the only thing about encryption or being as anonymous as you can is to make the search prohibitively expensive to the point where most just leave the trail alone. Dont you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So does your credit card and anything you buy online.  A microchip just seems superfluous at this point.  No need to use force on the populous when there are more efficient means available.</p>

<p>Outright slavery doesn&#39;t work.  Slaves see whats going on, they know who to kill, they revolt, so on.  It&#39;s also more expensive to keep slaves, you have to provide everything for them.</p>

<p>But now, thanks to the brilliant social engineers of today, we have a much more advanced and sophisticated system in place.  Make the slave not only work for you, but actually pay you to survive.  This is great because the slave believes he has freedom of choice, he is given a nice allowance of sorts that he can use as he sees fit.  And if he isn&#39;t able to survive, then it&#39;s his fault and he will believe that to be so.</p>

<p>Want to track the slave?  No need for invasive and forceful injection of microchips as if he were a farm animal.  Give them a &quot;smart phone&quot;, let them play with the new cool toys, let them have technology and feel as though they understand it and are the ones using it instead of being used by it.  GPS, keylogging, microphones and cameras in everyone&#39;s lives and in everyone&#39;s homes.  </p>

<p>Facebook, Twitter, hardly a need to spy at all when the people are just giving it all up.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a beautiful mixture of Orwell and Huxley.  The keepers of men advance with the times.</p>

<p>tl;dr you <em>can&#39;t</em> predict what would be a valid value for the next block because it depends on all the previous blocks (and transactions inside them) combined</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How in the world would you control potential hash generation?  If you try to control it, someone else just gets the block before you do, and all your work means nothing.  If you somehow control counts, that just means you&#39;re going to wind up in an orphaned chain and anything you do no longer affects the proper Bitcoin network.  What ctzl fails to mention is that it isn&#39;t really the clients that give the block the OK - it&#39;s the miners, when they find new blocks based on the old block&#39;s hash.  And that takes raw processing power.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like trying to poison a torrent by providing a bad file.  You might affect some people who are trying to download, but all you&#39;ll do is inconvenience them for a bit and waste your bandwidth.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Also, the very reason SHA256 is used is because it <em>isn&#39;t</em> predictable.  Not yet, at least; if someone finds a hole, Bitcoin will probably move to a new hash method.  There will almost certainly be a panic sell and the price will plummet... but that&#39;s for another discussion.</p>

<p>The problem stems from &quot;polluting the namespace&quot;. If the MPAA tries to pollute the swapping of film X, then either there is a new torrent, or, much more likely, every peer just ignores/bans/permabans them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nightweb looks like just another implementation of i2p for android, nothing more.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t &quot;pollute the namespace&quot; in Bitcoin because every peer you are connected to will not pass the garbage on to other peers because every peer verifies the validity of a transaction presented to it. This is not a concern.</p>
