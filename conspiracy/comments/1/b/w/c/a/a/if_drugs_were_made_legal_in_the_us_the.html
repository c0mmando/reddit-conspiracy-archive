The guest said that if drugs were made legal, the international banking system would collapse. Levine agreed wholeheartedly, and thanked the guest profusely for saying it. </p>

<p>The theory is that banks have so little actual liquidity, that they depend on drug money to stay afloat. The US government (via the CIA etc.) is actively involved in this scam.</p>

<p>Since that time, I have noticed a few mainstream news reports here and there, and I think it is worth putting the links together in one post, as they make the ex-DEA agent&#39;s claim pretty compelling (all links are from mainstream sources). </p>

<p>Pulitzer-Prize-Winning Journalist, Gary Webb, miraculously managed to commit suicide by shooting himself in the head... twice... in 2004.
Webb broke the story that the CIA was allowing the Nicaraguan Contra rebels to run drugs into LA in the &#39;80s. His investigative series came out in 1996 (just eight years before his death), and was one of the biggest news stories of its time. Ever since, it has been a matter of great controversy and an internal investigation supported much of Webb&#39;s claims.

Just because one conspiracy or even a group of conspiracies are exposed, people will still be dumb. It would take thirty years of an improved educational system, including critical thinking, before the masses would begin to catch on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you plan to teach critical thinking? You can explain to them what it is, but every person has to learn the process for themselves. As a matter of fact this fucked up world of backstabbings coverups and denial is probably one of the best environments for learning critical thinking by comparing actual facts to official stories. </p>

<p>Investment in education is obviously a good idea but it&#39;s not going to help people catch on to anything. Dropouts are gonna drop out regardless of how much we invest in education. Those that would benefit would go to college where you learn to specialize, pretty much the opposite of staying open minded. </p>

<p>Drugs on the other hand let you see alerts perceptions which does open your mind </p>

    <div class="md"><p>DUDE!</p>

<p>Most area colleges offer a course in critical thinking. Why don&#39;t you go take one?</p>

<p>Investing in the education of our youth is the smartest thing we can do. These are the people who are our future. College should be free. We should offer free courses to adults so people can continue to educate themselves over the whole of their lives.</p>

<p>I am not sure what you are trying to say with the last line, but I am guessing the weed just kicked in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alter* perception that was the auto correct kicking in not the weed. I don&#39;t even smoke weed because I get anxious but it is beneficial to some personality types. </p>

<p>I&#39;m agreeing 100%  that education would be the greatest investment in our future but you and I both know our government isn&#39;t competent enough to recognize and act on that point so really it&#39;s a moot point. I&#39;m pretty sure the entire right is anti education because people learning is killing their base. Can&#39;t really expect more from people who call facts biased and deny global warming though I guess. </p>

<p>But yeah college should be free. And it shouldn&#39;t be the basically just career field requirement it is now, people should learn to better themselves and expand their understanding. With how much robots increase productivity were going to need to employ like half the world in research to keep people employed and useful, encouraging learning as an end instead of a means to an end would only play into that </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not like the DEA employs that many people. Or even all the private prisons in the US. You are at most looking at around 100,000 people. That does not have that big an effect on our economy overall. 
But if you look at the number of people globally employed by the illegal distribution of drugs, and the amount of cash involved, now we are talking about some big numbers. Marijuana is a multibillion dollar industry, right now. One can only imagine how big it would become if legalized. This is the piece that the people forget. When we legalize we are going to make a ton of money. Also, the police and correction officer lobbies are against legalization, simply because it would reduce arrests and lockups. That is some terrible stuff right there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Legalization would effect almost every aspect of our society. Besides the unbelievable amount of money and tax revenue it would generate, there are many industrial applications that could create whole new areas of commerce. There is no question it would have an effect on almost everyone in our society. The reasons against legalization are purely political and having almost nothing to do with the drugs themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Banks get a big boner for huge influxes of liquidity. Drugs are really expensive because of the black market, and Wall Street likes it a lot when people at the very top of the drug supply chain deposit all that big, phat liquidity. They go out seeking that kind of stuff. Now legalize drugs. Suddenly, anyone can produce them and the price falls to one percent of what it previously was. Those people are not part of a network, and they may deposit that 1% of the previous liquidity, but it will be in thousands of different places from under the mattress to the credit union to paying cash for a new tattoo.

    <div class="md"><p>I think that this comment on the original story said it all. I fixed it a bit:</p>

<p>The revival of opium harvesting (banned by the Taliban) was one of the two reasons for which the occupation of Afghanistan was planned by the Zionist elites in US government in December 2001. The other reason was to bring Caspian Sea crude oil to a Haifa refinery via a pipeline up to Pakistan’s port Gwader through Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Most of drug trafficking is controlled by Russian Jews and Israel has been known as a haven for such criminals. Even the Israeli government ministers have been involved in this lucrative trade. Captain Gonen Segev, the former minister of Energy and Infrastructure (1995) in Yitzhak Robin’s cabinet and member of Israeli Knesset – was arrested in April 2004 for smuggling of thousands of Ecstasy tablets from Amsterdam to Israel.</p>

<p>Kyrgyzstan’s billionaire Jew, Alexander Machkevitch, is a close friend of country’s dictator Nursultan Nazarbyev and member of many Jewish lobby groups working for Israel’s interests in Central Asia and Africa. He owns the lion-share of oil industry in the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too bad we need another technology like the internet that provides information that is accurate to everyone in an instant and cannot be manipulated to fit someone&#39;s agenda.  A true Hivemind, and then we will finally have peace and justice in the world... Google Glass maybe the start of this tech..  lol, if aliens are monitoring us as an experiment they have to be upset how greedy most of us are when it comes to controlling how others live their lives.  Maybe its time for the next version of humans to try and make it to the next level of civilization. If they wouldnt have built us to be slaves it may have been a  better  result.  I still say Mushrooms are the key to healing the world.  Especially people in power should be force to take multiple heroic doses  and then explain to us what they have learned from their experience before starting their office.</p>
