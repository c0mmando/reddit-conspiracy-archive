       Now before some of you go off on me (there's always something) I'm not saying I believe this as fact, but I'm quite sure of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, this whole Gay rights thing is being done to make it look like we're getting more rights and headed in the right direction. Of course gay rights... something that doesn't actually harm the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       That way when someone goes and cries how we are losing our rights, other people will say "What are you talking about you fucking idiot? Gay marriage was just legalized. That's a huge step in the right direction." And indeed, it is a step in the right direction. But unfortunatley Gay marriage doesn't really help people stop a tyranical government. Much the same as how legalizing Marijuana doesn't really give the government less power (but then again people are still being treated as criminals for it even where it is legal).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all just another illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if everyone put some kind of picture on facebook advertising the right to bear arms. Would it do anything? No! Because it's not in the agenda.

Then I turn on CNN and its nonstop coverage of some people standing around talking about gay marriage. Its just something we are supposed to waste our time arguing about.....

      </p>
      <p>
       What are you talking about?  Legalization will change EVERYTHING.  For one, it's going to dramatically reduce the prison population.  Two, it's going to bring about the industrialization of hemp, which is far more beneficial to society than the drug itself.  Three, it will lead to a shift in our social consciousness, where those who now find it acceptable by the government will be willing to give it a try...only to find out the government was bullshitting them this entire time.  Four, hopefully this would lead to the decriminalization of all drugs, which would reduce addiction to other drugs, and crime.

       it is used to destroy family. Family is smallest unit for humans to coexist. And slaves do not have family's. In history it was encouraged for slaves to have as many offspring's as possible. Because, they were human resources. You could sell them and make profit..and if you destroy family people have no where to go for comfort (support).. except to TPTB. It is easier to control people if they do not have family's

       How would a gay couple adopting a child and loving that child be destroying family?

       It might be changing the definition of what
       <em>
        you
       </em>

       first, there is more pedophiles in homosexual males then in heterosexual males
      </p>
      <p>
       Link to research:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1556756">
        http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1556756
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Using phallometric test sensitivities to calculate the proportion of true pedophiles among various groups of sex offenders against children, and taking into consideration previously reported mean numbers of victims per offender group, the ratio of heterosexual to homosexual pedophiles was calculated to be approximately 11:1.
       </em>
       <strong>
        This suggests that the resulting proportion of true pedophiles among persons with a homosexual erotic development is greater than that in persons who develop heterosexually.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This does not mean that all homosexuals are pedophiles but does mean that pedophiles are more common between homosexuals. It should be considered when child adoption is in question. I think we can agree on that ?
      </p>
      <p>
       second, I did not say that adoption of a child would destroy a family. I was saying that trading with children is same as trading with slaves and I did give example of trading with children like this
      </p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is definition of family
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        A group consisting of parents and children living together in a household.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       it is not my definition it is historical definition of organisational unit of human species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans started to develop in family's that were creating tribes. It is first type of human development as you can read here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        A tribe is viewed, historically or developmentally, as a social group existing before the development of, or outside of, states.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       States started to remove tribal way of life and start to create "modern society's". States are slave owners and they want to destroy family which is last thing that has survived from tribal society. When you destroy family you are letting state to control every aspect of human life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is explained why are people slaves in modern society:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        All states started issuing serial-numbered, certificated "warehouse receipts" for births and marriages in order to pledge the people as collateral against those loans and municipal bonds taken out with the Federal Reserve's banks.

       We are more or less cattle that is traded on stock market. And when you can buy child than that child becomes a commodity. Like a slave..
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an example how it was done in history of U.S. of A
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Children of slave mothers always became slaves themselves.

       I think gays should be allowed to marry but i am hesitant about adoption rights (also youth rights)

       I don't think they are going to "raise little gays" but the pedophilia thing is rather terriffying.

      <p>
       In general, I don't think ANYONE should be allowed to legally marry or legally adopt.   These are personal relationships, not legal contracts!

       If you actually believe that NO ONE, hetero or not should be allowed to get married or adopt, I can respect that point of view.  I don't agree with it, but it's not discriminatory.

       "Legally" is the key word here.  If you want to go to your place of worship or a nice park or a family members property and perform a ritual and say you are married, knock yourself out.

       No, because we don't have to run our society like a third grader with a Mad-Libs book.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wills don't have a blank with "spouse" written under it, you can will property to people you never met if you wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Benefit sharing shouldn't be restrained to marriage.  If I work a good job with benefits, why I am being punished for being single?  Why can't I extend my benefits to my unemployed brother?  To my retired father?
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting rid of marriage would be a boon.  You instead could essentially cover your blood children +1, exactly as you do now but with more options and less government bureaucracy.

        One's personal beliefs do not interfere with the pursuit of truth;

       I've got better things to do with my day than sit around and try to prove you wrong.  Your stance is about limiting the rights of adults, because of their sexual orientation.  Aka discrimination.  So just own up to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You argue that we must protect children, by denying them a home?  By your definition, two parents and a child, a gay couple (2 parents) and a child, that's a family.  And Elton Johns child, yeah, I'm sure that child is suffering, living a life so  full of wealth and opportunity, that the rest of us can only dream of having it so good.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the comparison between mixed race marriage and gay marriage is the perfect analogy.  It's people using their own fear and hatred to justify the restriction of rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, anytime someone uses the "think of the children" argument, it instantly sets off my bullshit detector.  You're using an appeal to peoples emotions, to hide your motive, which is discrimination.  It's the same failed argument in the war on drugs.  People that use that argument don't care about kids, they're just pushing an unpopular agenda, and they know it.

       Just because your opinion doesn't like his facts doesn't mean his facts are wrong.

       I think gays should be allowed to marry but i am hesitant about adoption rights (also youth rights)
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think they are going to "raise little gays" but the pedophilia thing is rather terriffying.

       What's to stop a couple of chummy future child-rapists  from gaming this system and destroying a child?
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, I don't think ANYONE should be allowed to legally marry or legally adopt.   These are personal relationships, not legal contracts!

       Now, on the personal side..you are pushing "gay propaganda". You did not read or check my sources. You should do that to be intellectually honest
      </p>
      <p>
       Intellectual honesty is an applied method of problem solving in academia, characterized by an unbiased, honest attitude, which can be demonstrated in a number of different ways, including but not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        One's personal beliefs do not interfere with the pursuit of truth;
       </li>
       <li>
        Relevant facts and information are not purposefully omitted even when such things may contradict one's hypothesis;
       </li>
       <li>
        Facts are presented in an unbiased manner, and not twisted to give misleading impressions or to support one view over another;
       </li>
       <li>
        References, or earlier work, are acknowledged where possible, and plagiarism is avoided.
       </li>
      </ul>

       If you actually believe that NO ONE, hetero or not should be allowed to get married or adopt, I can respect that point of view.  I don't agree with it, but it's not discriminatory.

      <p>
       I'll leave it at that.
