<p>Maybe it&#39;s because thats not the fashionable thing to be educated about. Maybe it&#39;s because thats not what the mainstream media covers. Maybe its because you are only pissed about what the government wants you to be pissed about. Maybe politicians could give a fuck less who gets married, and is loving how ignorant you are.  Maybe gay rights is analogous to the toys I give small children so they leave me alone while I get to work.  Maybe, you&#39;re the child and need to set the toy down and start reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I don&#39;t think so.  It is an important thing that will impact the future of American society, something that determines whether we lean a bit more towards human rights, personal liberty and more away from religious flolloping influencing things it has no right to influence in a country that isn&#39;t a theocracy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s something that, in the long run, will have an impact on our country that ranks up there with emancipation, women&#39;s suffrage, the civil rights movement and the end of segregation, and so on, because it&#39;s a step towards unmarginalizing an entire group of people.</p>

<p>Is there other really important shit happening?  Sure.  But gay marriage gets most of the general attention because it pushes buttons for people in one way or another.  Maybe if Monsanto was run by gays or Muslims people would be more interested. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am gay and you cannot be more on the money.  It is a wedge issue that affect a small segment of the population in a time of considerable stress on the poor, minorities and the disappearing middle class.  Many gays do not believe they need to marry in a church to feel equal and refuse to play macho wars to feel like men.  Let us not forget that the gay wedge issue is indirectly responsible for energizing the fundamentalist Christan base and the election of Bush.  It is also used by Zionists to justify the occupation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider the gender imbalance in China... Now, where do the Chinese look for popular culture and fashion? Therein lies your answer, my friend... an acceptable lifestyle for the hundreds of millions of Chinese men who will never mathematically have an opposite sex life partner. 20 extra men for every 100 women born in 2008? In a nation of 1.5 billion? That&#39;s a lot of potentially unattached and unhappy men on the road to unrest... No question it is a huge risk to the global status quo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has nothing to do with American politics or the granting of rights, although those are convenient side effects. The real question is how are hundreds of millions of surplus Chinese men going to feel they have led a fulfilling family life and existence when mathematically they will never have an opposite sex life partner?  It&#39;s all about offering acceptable alternatives to look forward to, because no matter where they are located, a few hundred million single and unhappy men is a huge potential threat to global stability. That is the real driving force behind the quickening of the gay marriage issue, to have a western and palatable alternative for those who would otherwise have no choice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the point of these issues, whether they be abortion or marriage equality, is to divide us, the american people, into two groups, whether you are for or against the issue at hand. remember, united we stand divided we fall. we are constantly divided into two groups, one major example would be democrats and republicans, while in reality we are all americans, we are supposedly are free people. if we were really free people we wouldnt have a debate over marriage equality. IMO its a distraction used to separate and divide
 us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re on the mark. I have gay family members, and they deserve the right to be married. In reality, gay marriage is such a non-issue.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I tried to point this out before. I think that gay rights is an important issue, but I&#39;m pretty sure American society is at the point where the majority is either in favor of or apathetic about gay rights. The only reason for politicians to delay this inevitable change is because they want to keep discussion limited to the social issue, not the economic issues. In my opinion, while, sure, there are lots of politicians who get benefits from companies for enacting certain policies, the main reason for their avoidance of economic discussion is because they have no idea how to fix or change the situation. The economy is a complex system that doesn&#39;t respond linearly to your actions and because of that, politicians don&#39;t know what to say. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone can come up with a ceremony get together and declare themselves married, but the gay rights movement is concerned with marriage law, about what rights and privileges and responsibilities married couples get in their interactions under the law of the state- a legal contract totally seperate from the spiritual one(though they share the same name, involve the same intentions). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would make sense if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_and_responsibilities_of_marriages_in_the_United_States">Marriage law</a> focused on something more than a partnership&#39;s interactions with government. Think of marriage like corporate law or the Family Law as far as legal guardianship is concerned, it&#39;s the voluntary merging of property and indentity for purposes of law, not the &quot;personal affairs&quot; side of marriage.</p>

<p>The big problem is that laws baring same-sex marriage see no seperation between the legal partnership of marriage and the spiritual union of marriage, that you can&#39;t have one without the other. Of course they&#39;re closely related and come down to a moral issue, so emotional arguments are most definitely applenty.  But the point stands the government by law only gets involved in marraige for issues that relate directly to relate to the law, which to me is justified considering law comes from the government. </p>

<p>Marriage as property rights, joint legal status(for bankruptcy, child care, visitation, and power of atterny),  inheritence, etc- the things that involve the legal authority of government- is much different from a &quot;personal contract&quot; such as a cell phone plan or buying a pre-owned car. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying that thousands of lawmakers and members of the media have conspired to create an issue no one actually cares about - in other words, all those homosexuals and their loved ones <em>wouldn&#39;t actually care about the issue</em> if they weren&#39;t manipulated into caring about it - with the purpose of distracting you from other issues? All those politicians debating the issue and so on are really just doing it to keep a distracting debate alive, and not because they actually believe one way or another?</p>

<p>Did I correctly sum up your theory?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its a few of what you mentioned, but mainly a distraction from the norm. The norm being that all the world is indebted to nothing and no-one in particular, yet governments are taking their lively-hood to pay for it.</p>

<p>Distractions from the fact that more US soldiers are now dying from suicide than have died in the last decade of &lt;illegal&gt; war in the middle east.</p>

<p>Distractions from the fact that corporations in America are seriously running the show - from lobbying to include a Monsanto Protection Act in a government funding bill, to passing laws that retroactively protect our leaders from retribution when we all get smart and want to go after them.</p>

<p>Distraction from the fact that banks are defrauding the public out of their property with high fines and illegal procedures to foreclose (re: robo-signing). </p>

<p>Distractions from the fact that you can go to jail for longer than a rapist (in some areas) if you possess marijuana. </p>

<p>Distractions from the fact that marriage really is only a contract to the state in which you are obligated to pay different taxes. </p>

<p>Distractions from the fact states are passing laws that literally contradict the Constitution, allowing the discrimination of a person based on religious and sexual preference.</p>

<p>The list can keep going....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to make sure no one thinks I am saying homosexuals equal treatment is a trivial issue. That is not what I am saying. 
What I am saying is that it is trivial to our government, and they are simply USING this social issue as a distraction and to further pit two sides of America against each other, while they steal our money hand over fist with little to no coverage or concern from the general public. </p>

<p>It is sad but, I think they actually want the gay community to kick up dust and it is in fact benefitting them greatly to have this issue be so derisive. It gives more distinction between the two wings of the same plane. It furthers the illusion of our two party system, and it keeps our minds occupied on something they could care less about while they rape the world of resources. Very sad state of affairs indeed</p>

<p>It&#39;s marginalization via social conditioning. United, we stand, divided, we fall. It&#39;s about keeping people divided by wedge issues that are pretty much a product of liberalized academic politics.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, I am highly liberal, but not corporate liberal. </p>

<p>It&#39;s done for several reasons, but mostly profit.</p>

<p>THERE IS NO LEFT OR RIGHT!</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with bi-partisan ideologies. It&#39;s about rich people making money by using various social issues to divide the public, cause infighting, and rule by controlling the media &amp; masses as a result.</p>

<p>Only 3.5% of the population is gay. It&#39;s a very small demographic with extremely high visibility perpetuated by both sides of the media. It&#39;s also an issue that is used to push a wedge between progressive liberals against old conservatives.</p>

<p>The media is using it as a distraction. They profit off it being a heavily talked about and people clicking new links and getting riled up and driving the wedge deeper.</p>

<p>It could be solved really easily, but it&#39;s not because then people might start looking at other things like corporate and bank bailouts, the massive spending towards making the US a police state working for corporate big spenders.</p>

<p>Who you sleep with is your business. Who you marry, as long as it&#39;s consentual, is no one else&#39;s business but yours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we have the right wing Christians on one side and the left wing Liberals on the other.</p>

<p>All these people are fucking all of us around with their pushy rules but mostly, they&#39;re keeping us trapped in the middle and pushing us back and forth with their bullying via media punditry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, gay marriage will overshadow anything about Monsanto. Cause everyone is worried that those fags and dykes marrying eachother will really mess things up, more so than the chemically treated and modified food that you are stuffing down your gullet.

To try and venture outside that spectrum is dealt with name calling, insults, and in general a smear against reputation.</p>
