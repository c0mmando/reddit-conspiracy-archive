<p>The app name was &quot;Κατάλογος Μεταλλαγμένων Προϊόντων&quot;. The weird part is that while all greek sites state that the list was released by Greenpeace (as it has happened in previous years), Greenpeace does not admit to releasing the list for the year 2013.</p>

<p>Bananas have been selective bred and artificially selected for a lot longer than the 90s. You&#39;re taking a very narrow view and definition of GMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was quoting the first sentence in your link. Perhaps you should reread your own evidence? Since bananas have been around a lot longer than the 90s, as you say, it is impossible for them to be considered GMO unless otherwise genetically modified since then.</p>

<p>Excerpt:</p>

<p>The first Genetically Modified (GM) crops were introduced onto the market in the midnineties.
Since then, quick but uneven developments have occurred from one continent or
group of countries to another. This report analysis the extent of and the main reasons for
these fast and uneven developments, with special emphasis on underlying economic issues
which are of direct interest for the agri-food sector. A review of the available literature
helped to answer three main questions:
(1) How fast and to what extent have sowings of GM crops developed? Which crops
are concerned?
(2) Which economic reasons explain the rapid adoption of GM crops by farmers?
(3) Which are the consequences of citizen/consumer reactions and food suppliers&#39;
initiatives?
The analysis follows the path of the food chain, from the supply side up to final demand
(see figure). This approach takes into account the chronology of developments regarding
agri-biotechnology, but it also allows for analysing driving forces and interactions between
the main stakeholders all along the food chain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, it&#39;s obvious that I was referring to bananas being GMO in the broad sense, as per the definition I provided. The excerpt you quoted is pertaining to GMOs in the modern sense of gene splicing and biotechnology. Yes, the technology for <em>directly</em> manipulating genomes has only been around for a couple decades. But the link also discusses how selective breeding can also be considered GM, which is the approach I was taking.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fully aware of the difference between selective breeding and genomic manipulation. The debate here, it seems, is regarding classification and terminology. My argument isn&#39;t that selective breeding is the same as genetic modification, it&#39;s that it&#39;s a type of GM in a broad sense, which is supported by the definition I gave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will save you from having this pointless discussion in the future. When people talk about gmo food, they aren&#39;t talking about the &quot;broad&quot; sense of the definition unless otherwise stated. They are talking about gene guns shooting genes with antibiotic resistance markers into plants that have been around since the 1990s as per your citation. </p>
