       its not schizophrenia.... its a very real experience. artists have written/sang about this since the dawn of time. The classic Faust tale is about a down and out artist selling his soul to Mephistopheles who appears to him.  The movie the Devil's Advocate is about it. Its all over various songs.  What he is experiencing happens.

       Not everyone that has a religious experience, or talks to a higher power is schizophrenic.  This is a new phenomenon, where anything outside of the reality that has been described in the DSM-5 must be caused by a mental illness.  I assure you I have none, the illness is in how our society deals with things it does not understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psychiatry has become the
       <strong>
        reality police
       </strong>
       , and you are an unwitting executioner of
       <em>
        the
       </em>

       I do not believe that you are correct in your statement.  From what I have read, there are very few functioning schizophrenics who have active delusions that last for years on end, without interrupting their lives.  Further, there is simply no way that "new information" could be presented from the inner recesses of ones mind.  While you may hear of, or treat some with mental illness who have paranoid delusions, I cannot imagine they could ever become complex enough to make sense... let alone have documented physical evidence, as I have.
      </p>
      <p>
       To ease your soul, I have had several psychiatric evaluations in relation to a lawsuit with a group of victims of this
       <strong>
        crime
       </strong>
       , and none have considered me paranoid nor delusional.

       These type of delusions are very common in schizophrenia. Please seek out some help. I work with people like you each day, and help is possible. You can seek it out yourself, or wait until your disease causes you to act out in a manner that will cost you any choice. Now go ahead and insult me all you like, I wish you the best of luck. I would be more than happy to set you up with some resources for help if you would like to PM me.

       You make statements as if you are all knowing.  You have not experienced something, yet thousands of others have, and think it important enough to tell the world.

       How can you possibly be so sure that such an entity does not exist?  In another thread, you mention the possibility that our world leaders are having their minds manipulated... why only them?  I tell you it is not just me, but you also, and everyone around us.  Your opinion sans any evidence or logic should help you one day understand:  you are living in a fog, walking dumb and blind through a false reality.

       its not schizophrenia.... its a very real experience. artists have written/sang about this since the dawn of time. The classic Faust tale is about a down and out artist selling his soul to Mephistopheles who appears to him.  The movie the Devil's Advocate is about it. Its all over various songs.  What he is experiencing happens.

      </p>
      <p>
       His ex wife informs him out of the blue that her 'brother' was arrested for trafficking cocaine, he  remarks that it seemed odd a small dealer having 10kg...
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he claims he was being set up like her 'ex fiance'?
      </p>

       The ex-fiance was set up by her brother.  It was pattern behavior, something that certainly can be corroborated with court records.

       one consciousness. experiencing itself.

       Don't worry dude, the demiurge "talks" to me all the time too. He's my muse. He tries so hard to scare me, and make me believe in his illusions.  He gets more and more desperate.  Too bad for him wasting all this time on little ole me.  I'm not certain this is normal, but it certainly is a good sign I'm on the computer way too much lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless its obviously either metaphysical, a side effect of perception, or the CIA/Powers that be are fucking with me. Once I started hounding a few involved in one of their many conspiracies, then the "computer is talking to me" thing got a lot more overt.  Its either transcendent knowledge, a coming to gnosis.... or someone put a little bit of LSD in my water and is using something external to fuck with my little ole brain. Regardless, its cute that someone would put this much effort into making me feel so "special". When they deposit a million dollars in my bank account, then I'll start listening to them a little more intently. But until then, I'm gonna chalk it off as being on the computer way too much.

       Kabbalistic wisdom? :)

      <p>
       I don't personally think "we are all one mind," though it has certainly repeated that phrase enough for me to understand why it would have made its way into ancient religion and modern day wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems so foreign, cold, and inhuman to me, for me to believe that it is somehow the sum of our consciousness would be illogical.  Its lack of care for individuals, for our species, and for our planet is so apparent when you view the macrocosm that it seems like nothing more than ... the enemy.

       yea I'm not certain its the enemy. I mean if this thing is some sort of common pattern in neuronal firing that manipulates humans at a certain point in time, then its probably an evolutionary concept in our development that has been beneficial to us.  I mean the idea has been around since the dawn of time. Its not like this description is recent. People have described seeing the devil manifest since man could write.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are tons of things that are inherently evil that I benefit from every day, so I mean I can't just say evil is bad.... and consider "this thing" the enemy. I wouldn't be in the situation I am in without someone doing something evil somewhere. I mean its kind of sad, but its necessity at this point.  The demiurge is there, this quasi snake/evil/devil thing clearly is in charge of it, and as a result can do crazy things with your perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing I could think of, would be that its a side effect of a the language/alphabet you learn. After reading, writing, and speaking a language for so long... perhaps some higher-order effect happens as a result?  I mean thats kind of a shitty explanation... it would be interesting to see if the idea of the devil appearing happens in hindus, or the chinese on any regular basis as their alphabets are much much different.

       These type of delusions are very common in schizophrenia. Please seek out some help. I work with people like you each day, and help is possible. You can seek it out yourself, or wait until your disease causes you to act out in a manner that will cost you any choice. Now go ahead and insult me all you like, I wish you the best of luck. I would be more than happy to set you up with some resources for help if you would like to PM me.
