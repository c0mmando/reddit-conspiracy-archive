    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you put too many eggs in the &quot;Loose Change&quot; basket. There are many opinions, just because you don&#39;t agree with a few people&#39;s perspective and theories doesn&#39;t all of a sudden make the official story true. You can research 9/11 forever, it will never end, given how much is out there but to make a definitive conclusion because you don&#39;t agree with one of the earliest documentaries on the topic then maybe you might prefer to believe the official story. Loose Change got most people questioning but by no means does it contain irrefutable evidence- many other sources do though. In hindsight, I also see &quot;Loose Change&quot; as very weak and misleading. Once you decide to enter the rabbit hole, the pieces all come together to reveal a very clear big picture. But only you can discover that for yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do it all the time with the New World Order theories. I don&#39;t see the point behind taking generations and generations to instill someone or some people as the rulers. IMO, it just seems more logical to continue to control from stealth. OR it&#39;s actually a religious war. Religion and beliefs is the only thing I could imagine a group of people roaming around in the dark controlling everything just waiting for the right time to strike.</p>

<p>Other times I start to think that this is all being done because the powers that be, were warned by a higher life form of an impending doom, and they are trying to save themselves or the &quot;best&quot; of humanity they can. Higher life form being &quot;God&quot;, or aliens.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a problem. You shouldn&#39;t want to believe, you should want the truth, or to get as close to the truth as the known facts will allow you. <em>Wanting</em> to believe is not very desirable. Wanting to know the truth is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not Scotch tape, it&#39;s industrial adhesive. On thinner materials, such as the reflective Mylar used to reflect solar heating, it&#39;s preferable to use some kind of adhesive rather than fixing them with bolts/screws/etc, because the latter creates a hold that can weaken the material. That would be bad.</p>

<p>Seriously, this is yet another example of people seeing something they don&#39;t understand and then immediately believing outlandish nonsense instead of actually <em>educating</em> themselves on what they are seeing.</p>

<p>The entire &quot;the moon landings were faked&quot; movement approaches Flat Earth Society levels of idiocy. </p>

<p>Man landing on the moon hasn&#39;t been repeated in 40 years - despite technology &amp; computing power getting exponentially better. This means space technology has regressed in the past 40 years, not improved - which is not the case for every other engineering effort. </p>

<p>Where&#39;s the evidence of thrust in this <a href="http://youtu.be/cOdzhQS_MMw">video</a>? Why is there no evidence of high-energy particles on the Apollo film? Why were the astronauts not worried about falling on the moon and piercing their suits and dying? How did less than an inch of aluminum shielding prevent micro-meteorites from tearing through their ship? How did the astronauts survive the harsh space radiation if their suits had no radioactive protection? And on and on and on... There&#39;s a million goddamn things wrong with the Apollo record.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not Scotch tape, it&#39;s industrial adhesive. Things like this have been used to hold together wears on blimps, parts on autos, and so on for years. Its a powerful tool, especially when you&#39;re dealing with fabrics, thin aluminum, and other materials you want to hold together without creating holes in it.</p>

<p>Far more interesting is that duct tape <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/63673/13-things-that-saved-apollo-13-part-10-duct-tape/">really was used during an Apollo mission</a> for a minor fender repair. Had nothing to do with space travel or holding a lander together, but interesting nonetheless.</p>
