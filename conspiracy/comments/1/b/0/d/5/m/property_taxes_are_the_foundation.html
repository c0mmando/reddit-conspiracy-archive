       If you've put just a moment of thought into it you would realize that property taxes are the root of the government's control.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is impossible to legally live completely off the grid. You cannot farm your own food, live off your land or live free from debt because the moment you acquire property in the US your are perpetually in debt. You must make money somehow to pay for your taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government can raise funds through use taxes other than property tax, but it won't because that is the root of its control over you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until we are free from property tax, we are not free.

       The only property I "own" that I pay taxes on is an old Camaro.  The car cost me around 7k when I bought it and I've had it for almost 7 years.  I have to pay nearly $150 every year on this car.  In the time I've owned it I have paid nearly 1k in taxes on it.  I'm 24 and fresh out of college.  If I own this car until I'm 66, I will have paid the full value on this car to the US Government just to possess it( probably a lot sooner due to inflation and rising tax rates ).  Add that onto the 200 that's already taken out every paycheck for state and federal taxes.  My votes don't count, my views are not represented, the police are corrupt, and I use no public services.  What the hell am I paying for?

       Planned non op.  You pay registration if you use it..and you pay a non operator fee if you plan NOT to use it....you literally pay the non op fee just so you don't get FUCKED with a ton of back fees when you DO decide to use it.  Same thing with the smog racket.  You pay smog fees even if you DON'T have to smog the car legally anyway.  They call it a "smog abatement fee"  So you pay them 20 bucks just for the "luxury" of not having to physically smog it.

       I think the secret here is to start a Christian Church on your land. I think that Christian is best because they sorta accept it as part of the fabric of the nation. Then, make your son/daughter the pastor.

       Property taxes take up about 45% of my mortgage payment every month, they have gone up every single year I've owned my home, it is almost to the point where I cannot afford it anymore.  The city is using the funds to literally set up the Agenda 21 infrastructure(bike paths, "new" flood walls, putting in roundabouts, etc) and it is driving people out of their homes.

       They are setting up "poverty friendly" infrastructure that will actually
       <em>
        cause
       </em>
       the poverty.   Okay lets put it like this.  It's big expensive public works projects that drive up property taxes, which causes gentrification(aka displacement of the poor who lose their houses due to high taxes[side note: I am one of these people about to not be able to afford my mortgage because the property taxes have literally skyrocketed the last 5 years in my area due to these exact measures, property taxes alone are almost 50% of my monthly mortgage payment])  The foreclosed and unoccupied homes can then in the future be bought up by big investment companies at super low costs who then will build "high density" housing.  The housing will have income ceilings meaning that the people living in these homes can't make
       <em>
        over
       </em>
       a certain amount of money(a few buildings in our downtown area have already started this), meaning they will then be moving the poor back
       <em>
        into
       </em>
       these homes, etc etc.  It's basically a long term plan to start consolidating cities and forcing people into Soviet style high density cities.    Check it:

      <p>
       The bike paths are being set up so that the poor who will not be able to afford cars will be riding their bikes to work to school etc(my area is in the northern plains, half of the year its below freezing out here).  Roundabouts are being placed as complimentary infrastructure to allow for more walking traffic, they are part of something called "complete streets".  All of these massive projects are designed to fulfill their own purposes if you catch the drift.  I know it sounds out there but go over to the
       <a href="/r/UNAgenda21">
        /r/UNAgenda21
       </a>
       sub and look at the posts of brand new, supposedly independently created, plans for all these different cities, they use the
       <em>
        exact same
       </em>
       wording found in Agenda 21's developmental goals.

       Actually my friend, you should look into getting allodial titles for all your property.  Once you achieve this, then you can live off the grid legally as you say.

       Once a title has been filed with the county recorder it's pretty much a moot effort. Almost every property has been filed with the county recorder, so it's unlikely any home or acreage near a city could ever be freed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only properties remaining free and clear are estates and plantations owned by old money from pre-revolutionary war days.

       Property taxes are a bad joke, to say you can own something but you still must rent it?  Humbug.  There are ways of getting around that if you want to try you luck with code and technicalities.  I saw a good video on you tube where a feller's yearly registration tax of $70 or so on his car was replaced with a $0 tax because it tuned out that he owned it . "Oh we'll just correct that for you... mmhmm.. okay and I've changed your renewal for future year to zero dollars".  the same can wok if you're crazy and tack down an alodeal title for your property, or an ancient deed suggesting that the property (or area your property is on) was once owned in full and that your deed stems from that in some manner.

       I own a home.  P+I is actually respectable in terms of 'rent'.  Affordable.  Add in taxes, its a new ball game, and it changes the dynamic drastically.  Where I am at School districts take most of the tax money for what I pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course you get to write off the interest on your federal return, so that helps at the end of the year.  It is the only saving grace to owning a home.  I know in the past there were murmurs of getting rid of the tax write off for homeowners.  If that ever gains traction, a for sale sign will soon follow.  That would break whatever is left of the middle class.
