<p>I&#39;m not a big conspiracy buff. So please forgive me for any ignorance. I like to think I am starting to awaken. But I see how drastic things have changed from when I was a child to now, and something deep inside is telling me something is wrong.</p>

<p>The NWO thing doesn&#39;t completely convince me. I&#39;m having trouble understanding a convincing end game. A point to it all. Unless there really is someone who plans to place themselves as supreme emperor of Earth. But if they&#39;re smart enough to do what they&#39;re doing, they would realize (IMO) of how trivial that would seem.</p>

<p>Anyhow, DHS buying up stuff, our rights being pulled from us, the people being conditioned, underground highways, D.U.M.B.S., and now all the talk of comets, asteroids, etc. </p>

<p>Does the government / powers in charge know there is a large rock coming and planning for survival? </p>

<p>Massive debt, prepping, taming the masses? Have they spent more money than they can hide? Are the &quot;elite&quot; buying their way into survival? I know, it sounds like a bad movie with massive special effects based on the end of the world. </p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in everyone&#39;s thoughts on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been hearing such talk since the Reagan administration, and I&#39;m sure it goes back further than that.  To hear the folks at the government tell it, they&#39;re always preparing for something catastrophic.  And those Reagan-era FEMA camps have never been used for anything, even for their purported intended purpose during natural disasters.</p>

<p>Thing is, fishily enough, sometimes they are doing stuff right under your nose.  There are suspicious number of training exercises that turn into the real deal <em>during</em> the exercise.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right to look at things with a critical eye.  Sometimes a government boondoggle is just a government boondoggle, and you wind up with 4000 tanks rusting away in a parking lot because no one can afford to keep them, and were built simply to funnel money to a defense contractor.</p>

<p>Other times, if you follow the money, you realize there is a longer game afoot.  No where is this clearer than with the last ten years of bank fraud.  There I wouldn&#39;t look at the piles of cash mounding up in the banks, I would always look at the real wealth it&#39;s being converted into.  One of the biggest transfers of wealth in US history was when the banks used debt-slavery to confiscate real property from small farmers.  What are they using it for now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is the funny part. look at how little labor they actually need now. if the were to wipe out the &quot;consumer&quot; how many people would they really need around to pamper them and keep their standard of living, while no longer having to worry about over population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drones need soldiers to operate. You think they are of a mind of their own? No, they are remote piloted. You think the &quot;consumer&quot; is that dumb to sit still and become dust, no, it&#39;s called preservation. It&#39;s rather humorous when it comes to the &quot;kill the populous conspiracy&quot;. What happens to the food? This isn&#39;t Aldous Huxley where food is harvested by robots. What happens to the elite when who relied on the masses for the labor when it really isn&#39;t there anymore? The housing begins to collapse with age, who&#39;s there to fix it? Roads start to become overgrown with weeds and trees, who is there to fix it; because as an elite I wouldn&#39;t do labor.</p>

<p>The number one thing that no one looks at when talking about killing the population is what happens next. Reasoning will lead you places but when you ignore the obvious you have become blind with fear. Maybe one day you will realize you became a sheep despite not trying to be one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well. We are going to see a collapse of the current financial model and we could descend into anarchy for a bit. I think Fema Camps and 100,000s of coffins DHS bulking up are all preventative for the possibility of WWIII/nuclear attacks on united states. The nuclear threat never really went away. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdO2Xh51Q-U">Collapse with Michael Rupert explains why the destruction of our industrial civilization is inevitable</a></p>

<p>We are inevitably going to undergo a monumental change with the shift from industrial civilization to something else. whether for better or worse I don&#39;t know. I guess we&#39;ll all see. I&#39;d look for Disclosure on extraterrestrials. That&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping for.</p>

<p>tldr; it&#39;s going to get worse before it gets better. just how bad nobody knows</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing concrete to fund this but I have the hunch a really BIG event would be treated in secret by all governments, not just ours. It&#39;s one thing to have people prepare for a hurricane or eventual quake and another for say, an ELE-grade meteor impact. Widespread panic would just begin the massacre earlier.</p>

<p>Everybody says &#39;But something like that couldn&#39;t be hidden from public, thousands of astronomy buffs and observatories all over the world etc etc&#39; but hey, last month Russia got hit and no one was the wise on it. Granted it must have been a very small rock but still. It&#39;s a big sky, and guess if something truly important is detected, it will be kept secret for as long as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends how you look at the NWO. It certainly does exist, but what it actually entails is up for debate. It&#39;s all pretty sketchy, but the term &#39;New World Order&#39; has been thrown around the mainstream media for decades. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re trying to hide it.</p>

<p>In my eyes, after trying very hard to connect all of the dots? It&#39;s simply an energy crisis. I say simply, because it&#39;s not quite as elaborate and exciting as asteroids or supreme rulers or solar flares, but it should be taken just as seriously.</p>

<p>Google Michael Ruppert, and watch <a href="http://www.1channel.ch/watch-23285-Collapse">his movie</a>. He&#39;s written a few books too. It&#39;s interesting stuff, and makes a lot of sense if you consider all of the factors. I&#39;ve seen a lot of theories out there on what the fuck is going on with the world at the moment, but nothing ties them all together like this one does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not too long ago I was on Reddit and this guy posted to AskReddit. I can&#39;t remember the exact name of the post but it was something like: Reddit, Nasa would only know about a large asteroid a few weeks before impact, would you want them to tell you?</p>

<p>Something about the post felt weird to me, like the question was aimed at trying to probe how the public would respond to something like that. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve heard about it but I&#39;ve been hearing about an object that will come record close in 2016 and they&#39;re pretty sure it&#39;s going to miss us, but when it does pass it has a small window that it could pass through and if it does, we&#39;re looking at an impact in 2036(?) I would love to hear some more info on that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you see, the Sun&#39;s twin star passes by every few thousand years. It has caused all the mass extinctions in our planets history - It has wiped out ancient civilization after civilization. All had stories told, myths and legends, some were perverted and turned into the bible and such bullshit as a way to control people. But all the legends, all the stories, they are all about our twin Sun and its return as the destroyer.</p>

<p>The elite know this. They know the rogue Sun is approaching again. They knew this 100 years ago, when the federal reserve was created. Thats why when you multiply M1-through-M10 - doubling every 10 years - you get the unsustainable exponential growth of the money supply this year. 100 years later, the curve goes vertical. The system crashes. They knew this would happen, but they didnt care, they needed to print that money, to build their bases, to try to survive what is coming. The system is crashing now, its mathematically impossible to pay off the debt, or balance the budget, but they dont care, they&#39;ve already bought what they need.</p>

<p>Look around you. Global warming? Its a lie. Its the radiation/magnetism of the twin Sun is heating the core of the earth. Look around at the record earthquakes. Long dormant volcanoes becoming active again. Sinkholes popping up all over the world. More and more meteors being spotted - having been drawn into the inner solar system by the rogue Sun. Mass animal migration deaths, as their innate navigation is messed up by the disruption of our magnetic pole. Just last year, they had to repaint all the runway markers because the pole is moving. They told you this was normal. It is not.</p>

<p>Soon, in the late summer/fall of this year in North America, you will be able to see the second Sun in the sky. It will be the second brightest object in the night sky, rivaling the moon. There will be no more dark nights. They will lie and tell you its a comet. It is not. It will grow bigger and bigger. When will you figure it out? Before you fry from the radiation? Are crushed in an earthquake? exploded in a volcano? drowned in a tidal wave? It is the end.</p>

<p>They&#39;re ready for it.</p>

<p>Are you? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a better reason to disbelieve it than the fact that it&#39;s just another bit of &quot;the end of the world is next year. Oops, we meant <em>next</em> year&quot; nonsense, and that reason is simple: From a scientific, evidence-based standpoint, that whole wall of text above is an absurd joke.</p>

<p>I could break down why a bunch of it is, and others could do an even more thorough job than I could, because there are a half-dozen areas that are easily refuted, but the basic one is so utterly basic it should be enough to reject this ridiculous piece of crazed fiction in about eight seconds of thought: If there was a twin star approaching, amateur astronomers would have discovered it <em>years and years and years ago</em>.</p>

<p>And I say &quot;amateur astronomers&quot; for a reason. We all know that on r/conspiracy, citing actual experts in a field is a big no-no because <em>they&#39;re in on it</em>, right? They&#39;re part of the coverup! But amateur astronomers, who number in the hundreds of thousands worldwide (if not more), on a regular basis discover new objects and watch the sky routinely, tracking objects and hoping to make a major discovery.</p>

<p>A <em>second sun approaching us</em> would kinda sorta qualify as a major discovery, wouldn&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>And yet no one seems to be able to see the damn thing. When it comes to large objects we&#39;ve mapped our local skies to a remarkable degree, but somehow we&#39;re missing a <em>sun</em> that is close enough to circle back on us every few thousand years.</p>

<p>It&#39;s absurdly stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s something you can sink your teeth into: The sun&#39;s missing angular momentum. In the solar system, the planets have 98% of the angular momentum, and the sun only 2%; this is approximately the opposite of what it would be if the system were simply orbiting the galactic singularity along with the rest of the galaxy.</p>

<p>That means our system is orbiting something else, and that something can only be Sirius, or something closer we (may not include government and secret-society insiders) can&#39;t see; but the sun has too little angular momentum for it to be Sirius, so that leaves either a dim binary companion, such as described by the greater ancient civilizatons, or a local singularity that Sirius A, B, and Solaris are all orbiting, as described by the Dogon people; but the effects on light and dust of which ordinary astronomy should certainly have noticed by now, as close (in stellar terms) as it would have to be; something <em>is</em> known to be pulling on the outer gas giants, but it really could be either one. All signs point to a brown dwarf companion, or possibly a red dwarf surrounded by an insulating cloud of some kind; and any accompanying planetary objects, of course.</p>

<p>Perhaps not entirely, there is always Curiosity; but in a personal and intimate manner it has been a failure.  A failure causes many of the ills you see in society today.</p>

<p>It was originally well conceived and relatively innocuous, you could even say benign around the late sixties - early seventies as we tried to end the Cold War.</p>

<p>But that wouldn&#39;t last (thanks to that bastard Reagan), that in itself was an act of desperation.  As time grew shorter we had to take more drastic measures, most regrettably the removal of one President John F. Kennedy.</p>
