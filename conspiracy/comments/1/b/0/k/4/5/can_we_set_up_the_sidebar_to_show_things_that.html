        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I would like us vote on or have the moderators decide whether something has clearly been proven to be a conspiracy and place a link to it like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2010/12/my-files-on-lbj-and-cia-assassination.html">JFK was killed by the CIA and LBJ</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/ex-italian-president-intel-agencies-know-9-11-an-inside-job/7550">9/11 was an inside job in cooperation with Mossad</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/12/leadup-iraq-war-timeline">The American people were lied to in order to go to war with Iraq</a></p>

<p><a href="http://govtslaves.info/dhs-preparing-for-a-total-police-state-takeover/">America is becoming a full-fledged police state</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to argue the validity of my sources, I want us to collectively find the absolute best ones and solve, to the best of our abilities, major conspiracies that have happened and are happening. I think showing them on the side-bar will allow the pieces to come together a little easier for us collectively and give more unity and validity to our group.</p>
