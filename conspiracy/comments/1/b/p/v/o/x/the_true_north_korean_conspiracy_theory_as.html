        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As you all know, the recent news about North Korea threatening the United States and its&#39; allies with ultimate nuclear destruction has pervaded our media and taken the country by storm. The truth, however, is far more plausible than the laughable military capability of a country locked in an embrace with 1950s technology. To start, back in 1964 the U.S. government generated a false conflict in the Gulf of Tonkin in order to receive public backing for increased military action against North Vietnam. The same is occurring now. The media tells us that North Korea is threatening war, but never has Kim Jong Un been seen giving a speech explicitly saying so. Which leads to the question that if this new leader is attempting to flex his muscles at the U.S. and his own generals, why is he not going public? The answer is because he and his country truly have no idea what is going on because North Korea is so archaic and so cut off from the rest of the world. </p>

<p>Back in 2000, there were only 9 countries without a privately owned Rothschild&#39;s central bank. These countries were: Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Cuba, Venezuela, Syria and Libya. Now there are only 5 after the U.S. invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and the death (assassination) of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. North Korea is next on the list, with Syria to quickly follow them. </p>

<p>The U.S. government learned the hard way through Iraq and Afghanistan that invading a country is costly and hurts morale. So obviously the best way to take care of North Korea would be to have China do the dirty work. The American plan, I feel, is to create a Gulf of Tonkin like incident that will prompt the Chinese to invade and clean house to prevent the United States from acquiring a position so close to the Chinese border if the U.S. were to take North Korea itself. This incident will come in the form of a copycat Teapodong-2 nuclear missile launch by an American submarine, which an American Aegis class destroyer will shoot down. This will prompt a Chinese invasion of North Korea, which will allow U.S. investors to set up the desired central bank. </p>

<p>Subsequently, this failed nuclear launch by a rogue state will cause an international crackdown on Iran&#39;s nuclear weapon hopes. When Iran fails to comply with international wishes, the United States will have its reason to invade Iran and take over it as well.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few things:
1. There is no way China would unilaterally invade their ally for launching a crappy, destined-to-fail missile at the United States. And no one would expect them to. At best, they&#39;d stay neutral during the US counterattack.
2. What on earth would a private western bank want with North Korea? The country has no infrastructure, no goods of value or manufacturing capability, nothing but 25 million starving and dirt-poor peasants. It&#39;s a nonsensical motive.
3. You can&#39;t launch a Taepodong-2 from a submarine, or anything but a fixed launch pad. It&#39;s far too large (about three times as big as the largest submarine-based missile in existence).
4. North Korea has made the threats through their own, state-controlled websites. Go read it yourself if you&#39;d like. In fact, I heartily recommend reading the DPRK&#39;s propaganda sites - it&#39;s very entertaining stuff.</p>

<p>Also I agree with pretty much everything else you said. NK is very much the aggressor in this situation. There is no American led conspiracy to go to war. They´ve already got plenty of justification to pre-emptively strike NK if they wanted to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>information is information. Information is verifiable and true, or unverifiable, and if unverifiable, potentially false. I don&#39;t categorically reject what I see on the screen. Because I do not believe one suspect thing, doesn&#39;t mean I reject anything I see. There are verifiable things on the internet. Those things that a couple of people say, or corroborate. Sometimes a separate thread, or article. But with NK, it&#39;s only 1 source, in the entire world? How about some diplomatic cables? How about some words coming out of a leaders mouth, adressed to a nation (maybe) but another country (best source). This is what I don&#39;t see. This is why I can&#39;t believe wholeheartedly. When people have been wholesale tricked in the past, why? Has it been from multiple source and verifiable sources? Or has it been when the ONE source was lying, or misinterpreted.

    <div class="md"><p>North Korea has few diplomatic relationships and all access to the country is heavily restricted. They communicate publicly through the same websites that they&#39;ve used for 10 years, sites that are universally held to be the official DPRK channels.

<p>So you could be as misinformed as he is? See the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1bpvox/the_true_north_korean_conspiracy_theory_as/c98xpn5">top post in this thread</a> for reasons why his theory is nonsense. The whole idea that this saber rattling is being manufactured by the U.S. falls apart when, with the slightest bit of research, you can see that these statements <em>are</em> coming from North Korean state-run media.</p>

<p>Unless you want to postulate that the United States secretly controls North Korean media, too. Would you like to take that step?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just the American media, NK escapees have talked to plenty of media outlets.  Troops tried to escape to China recently and were sent back.  You can see the prison camps on Google satellite images.  If NK wasn&#39;t the hellhole that it&#39;s made out to be then why do they refuse to let their own citizens leave?  Seriously, the evidence is overwhelming, just because the MSM reports something you don&#39;t necessarily have to believe the opposite.</p>

<p>not sure which resources I&#39;m exactly living off of.... but I&#39;m pretty sure we wouldn&#39;t be speaking arabic right now if we never invaded iraq. Ill also tell you a little secret.... people do not join the military to fight for their country.... they join because they don&#39;t have many other options. At least 95% of the time this is true. Military members are criminals, liars, cheats, and lazy asses. They join because they need money whist possesing zero marketable skills. &quot;economic draft&quot; is another way to put it. </p>

<p>I earned the rank of SGT in the 101st by age 20. I went to the NCO board, been acting platoon sgt numerous times, and led a squad on the streets of baghdad damn near every night I was out there. We destroyed that city based on a lie. Also, don&#39;t tell me to do anything, you second rate piece of shit. I earned my place in candyland. The difference between me and you is: I actually know how the world works, and you do not. You think terrorists attack us because of our freedom, or that because their religion says to. Both of which would be wrong. Idiot. </p>

<p>Is it so bad that I want our country to represent true good around the world instead of central banking imperialism? Raping countries for their resources you covet so much?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll ignore that they were taken out of context by most of the MSM recently, but my understanding is that the DPRK are posturing because this will get them more financial assistance from China. The last thing China wants is American bases closer to Beijing. I thought that the Kim Jongs had a specific plan for holding China to ransom: &quot;Give us money or we let the Americans in.&quot;</p>

<p>Please stop this escalation towards war. We&#39;re all on this planet together, the <strong>only</strong> conspiracy/illusion of note is thinking we are separate from each other. In analogy: Our species is a chemically dependant basement dweller who spends their Saturday night carving its own name into its arm.</p>
