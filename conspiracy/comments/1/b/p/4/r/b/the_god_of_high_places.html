       It is time for you to hear this, whether it be dangerous knowledge or not. Understanding the methods and motives of the worship of the God of High Places is very important for the future viability of the human race. I am just a squirrel, eating an acorn in the boughs of the tree of life, but the knowledge of the God of High Places has been transmitted, and must be shared across the entire tree, from root to tip. The first thing that you should know is that the God of High Places is a belly God. The second thing you should know is that that belly is never full. The third thing you should know is that unless you're the elect, you've got a good chance of being dinner. Why are you on the plate, you might ask? Because the God of High Places demands sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is his way, and I say "he" consciously, because the God of High Places is very much aligned with the masculine force of the universe. This God is currently fucking the Earth for his own pleasure, with the help of many servants across the globe. You can call this God a metaphor, if it makes you sleep better, and indeed, this God works as a metaphor, a shape-shifter across the planes. But whatever name he might be called, the hungry belly God has always been the same God. All through human history, there have been times and cultures where this God has risen to the top of the hierarchy. He is the God of High Places, and the heights are where he is most comfortable. To occupy those high places in order to best serve him is the gift he offers to those that are willing to play their part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me go back into my akashic records to tell you of the first time I met this God. It was on the outskirts of the burgeoning Aztec empire, and I was a farmer. It was my first field sown as a man, and my seeds were well-planted and were coming up well. My corn was coming up strong, and I was almost certain that such a yield would attract my chosen woman to become my partner for life. I looked forward to the harvest with great joy. It was a month from the harvest when the Aztecs visited us. It was not a social visit, as they burned our crops and let us know that we were dependent on them to survive over the coming year. We had become their slaves, and our land was now theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being a young and healthy man at the time, the fires of vengeance burned brightly in my heart, and I rallied several of my tribesman to fight back against the Aztecs. We were few, so we used the tactics that the few should always use when confronting the many. Stealth attacks, making use of the knowledge of the land to retreat, quick raids to keep ourselves fed. But we were too few, and the Aztecs eventually found us, and led us by the neck to their city. It was built in the center of a great lake, with long bridges leading in. We had never seen so many people in one place, as we had always lived within our boundaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the knowledge of what was to come made it hard to enjoy our experience in the metropolis. We were to be the sacrifice for the harvest. Our blood would be fed to Huitzilopochtli, which was the name of the God of High Places in that time and place. The belly God was hungry, and we were to be dinner. I wish that I could say that this story ended well, but it didn't. I was led up the stairs of the central pyramid, the blood from the hundreds of sacrifices before me staining the steps a pattern of dull and bright red. I was laid down on the altar, and my heart was cut from my chest by a priest in amazing finery. As I died, I understood who I had been sacrificed to, and I also got to see the view of the entire city below. It was a beautiful and terrible moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The God of High Places had taken me, but my soul wasn't his, and I was able to see the reward of the priests that served him. In life, the priests got the view, and all the trappings of wealth and power that the God of High Places bestows. But in death... There are no words for that, and the price paid is much too high. Understand that I don't expect you to believe any of this story, if it helps, just think of it as a metaphor. I have been the sacrifice to the God of High Places before. I have been held to the table, and had my will and person violated at the core to serve the hungry belly that's never full. I recognize this God now, and I don't hate him. I just think he sucks, and is a terrible being to worship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you are wondering how to recognize this God at work in the world right now. The truth is that he always hides in plain sight. Who has the view? Where is the pyramid? The thing to remember is that those with the view have the power to run the programs. Those with the view are always talking about sacrifice, but never sacrificing themselves. We have arrived at the point where the priests are global, which is one of the reasons why this time in history is so full of crisis and change. Are you catching what I'm throwing yet? Do you know who the priests are?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, if you're not catching it yet, I'll give you some more time to think about it while I break down the reasons that the priests are able to hide in plain sight. Think of the pyramid on a human scale, the way you get to the top is by crawling over the backs of everyone else. At the top of the pyramid, where the best view is, you are standing on the metaphorical shoulders of nearly everyone else in your structure. The real power of the priests is to build the consent of those that carry the burden as a matter of course. In the Aztec empire, the blood sacrifice was just a part of life, demanded by the Gods. The only way the priests could get to that position was by using the fear of the Gods to keep the rest of the pyramid in line. People of good moral and ethical conscience will simply say "That's just the way things are, we can't change the way things are."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the main reason that the God of High Places can rule a culture. Those who want the view will fight to get it, and even those that don't want the view will enforce the structure that allows it because they believe it's just a fact of nature. So, now it's time to expose the God of High Places. The God of the empty belly rules the market system at this point in time. His priests occupy the rooms in the skyscrapers across the world that the common folk can't get to. We serve at the leisure of the priests and their strange God, because we believe that the market is "just the way things are." Our sacrifice is just beginning in the Developed nations, but has been ongoing in the "developing" nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This global priesthood of elite worshipers has catapulted many to the highest view so far attainable in human culture. As the world struggles with economic downturn, the priest class consumes and attains a greater and greater share of the world's resources. We allow this to happen, because unconsciously we've been programmed to believe that the invisible hand of the market is a fact of nature. The truth is that the invisible hand belongs to the God of High Places and it is becoming more visible day by day. This is the hand that takes from the social safety net, and gives to the bank executives, it takes from the hungry children and gives to the commodity traders, it takes the shared resources of the Earth and gives in the form of ballooning bank statements to the elect. To the priesthood.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's important to note that all of the elite are not of the priesthood, some get to the view through true force of character and world shaking ideas, but these people are the minority and do not call most of the shots. At the top of the pyramid, it is mostly blood and corruption, no matter how beautifully tailored the costumes are. The decisions that are made from that vantage point are geared towards two main directions. To keep the bottom of the pyramid from realizing how they're serving the top, while the bottom aspires for the same position, and to amass the resources of the world into the hands of the servants of the empty belly God. We are still his food, and will continue to be as long as the priests are successful in their main endeavors.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the game is not over yet, and those that made the rules for the game fear greatly that we just decide as a people to stop playing. Let us figure out new ways to use the resources of the planet for the good of all, not just the few. Let us understand that we must work in balance with natural systems rather than at the expense of them. Let us understand that as the base of the pyramid, it is our own actions that support it. Let us look in the eye of the God of High Places and say, "I SEE YOU."
      </p>
      <p>
       I am but a squirrel on the tree of life, but I have seen the God of High Places. Looking into my heart I have realized that I have been the food of the empty belly God in other lives. What I cannot do is stand silent in fear as the power of this God threatens to eat us as sacrifices to a never-ending, never lessening thirst for more. I am not afraid of the God of High Places, I have been on his altar before. I may be again, but it is tragedy not to stand strong when you see him standing in the power gained from the greed of the few. Fuck the view.
      </p>
      <p>
       I SEE YOU

       While the view might be gorgeous, and the light blinding...... the smell of the rotting corpses on the path to the top is absolutely overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
       The view at the bottom, looking up at the immensity of the pyramid the God of High Places created is just as amazing. Down here you can see the beautiful, natural foundation on which the God of High Places builds his form. Down here you can see the chaos in all of its glorious possibilities. Down here are some pretty righteous folks too, that make some pretty kick ass art. I like these guys, they are my people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, I have seen the God of High Places many times. I didn't first recognize his existence till I was about 25. Then it became clear how ever present he was. It became clear that he was in plain site, often taking the form of many different people. Attempting to manipulate me into becoming his slave. Asking me to believe in the form of his pyramid.  Inviting me to attempt to get to the top of his pyramid to enjoy the view.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the smell was unbearable. A most foul odor. I looked at the God of High Places, directly in the eyes (which is how you know you are talking to HIM), and I told him that while I respect and admire the intricacy and engineering of his great pyramid, and I respect the powerful force of his hunger, I cannot partake in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen HIM invite many people up to the top of his pyramid to feed on. And I recognize that, despite being a most foul smelling creature, he tends to make it very clear to me that should I take the rank path up his pyramid, it has to be of my own choice.  I have to believe in his pyramid, and believe the view is beautiful, to ever foolishly trek up to the top of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I have something stronger than belief. I have knowledge. I know what his pyramid is and how its been made. I know the methods he uses to lead fools up to his drooling Snout. He's a very charming guy, very very smart. Knows a lot about the universe, history, medicine, recreational drugs, sex... you name it.  I've laid in bed with him before. He is a most compassionate lover. But that's only because he's hungry. See the hunger drives him. You see it in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       At one time, in the not too distant past, the God of High places was able to manipulate me with fear, with hate, with rage. But as I came to gnosis it became apparent that these were just the implements of his apparatus. I respect how his apparatus works, the fearful, the hateful, the enraged make for good meals... and once they are sacrificed, it becomes clear the folly that got them in his body. Hopefully they don't sell him their soul on the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect his creation, for it is a most complicated form.  And while I choose not to actively seek that it be dismantled, I will passively educate the wanderers i meet along my path. Hopefully, one day, when the are no more fools that believe in his view, his pyramid will shrivel. And he will once again be forced to come down and enjoy the view on the surface which he temporarily elevated himself from.  Like I said, he's a real smart guy. We could use someone like that down here.

       To claim absolute knowledge of such thing speaks of insanity. Perhaps he is a god(small g). But then comes the question, what constitutes a god? Your post strikes the root.

       It seems well-received.  In my personal opinion, this sort of content doesn't belong here.

      <p>
       It is rhetoric and actually quite disregards conspiracy in general, opting for the chaos model that that the world situation is incidental rather than constructed.

       Not only is there a plethora of more appropriate subreddits to contribute this to, other than containing the word pyramid I am uncertain why you felt this subreddit would be best.  You don't seem to participate here much at all.

       The eye at the top of the pyramid changes.  The conspiracy has occult influences.  Bohemian Grove, etc.  It relates in that it's attempting to get to the roots.  When people get together at the Bilderberg Group, what are they talking about?  They are talking about how they maintain their power, privilege and position.  What is the source of their power?  Knowledge, (the view) and wealth.  Dominance hierarchies such as the basic corporate structure, or the structure of feudalism, or the structure of many "secret societies source their power from the masses.  This works because "power over" strategies increase a group or an individuals power at the expense of all those they lord it over.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the information age "the View" can be surmised and researched on the internet.  The knowledge is now available to all, if you can sift the wheat from the chaff.  The antidote to "power over" strategies is "power with" strategies.  The common human being is being deliberately hypnotized to forget and cede his or her own power. Plus, what does how often I post here have to do with anything?  I comment more here than a lot of subreddits.

       I believe it is appropriate for this subreddit, after all
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism">
        Gnosticism
       </a>
       means knowledge, and ultimately it's based upon that what we perceive as
       <em>
        reality
       </em>
       is an illusion created by the Demiurge (Biblical God) to enslave us (Plato's Cave) in his ignorance of a true "God", and we must search for the truth / knowledge (Sophia) so we can become free.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many early
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Gnosticism">
        Christians were Gnostics

       and texts such as the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Judas">
        Gospel of Judas are of Gnostic nature
       </a>
       along many other Apocryphal texts all rejected when the

       the OP is clearly based on gnostic principles. hell, most media thats presented to people today is based on gnostic principles.  "I SEE YOU"... what was that from again... oh yea a movie about a Military super power destroying the tree of life of a native species that had at an immensely powerful inter-connective force that could heal and provide for them, and infiltrating their ranks through insidious Avatars. I SEE YOU, is what the the native woman says when she sees the Avatar for who he is. What was that movie where the guy could take the red pill and continue being blind, or take the blue pill and see the apparatus which enslaved him? Wasn't Agent Smith some sort of hidden shapeshifting agent that kept the people enslaved in the apparatus? Didn't he complain about "the smell"? Oh The Matrix right.  How about that movie where a young lady just wants to go home and along the way she has to request a brain, a heart, and courage back from a great and powerful wizard, only to discover this great and powerful wizard was nothing more than smoke and mirrors that enslaved his people through illusion alone, and they all had what they wanted all along? Wizard of Oz right. How about that movie where a girl, in effort to elevate herself out of the depths to a better view, sells the God of High Places her voice, her only power.... Only to discover that silence hinders her ability to love and be connected. What was that movie again.... The Little Mermaid was it? What was that show about the 4 old ladies, where the oldest one was named Sophia, the Gnostic goddess of Wisdom.....  The Golden Girls was it?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about that song..... "Is this the real life or is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.
       <strong>
        OPEN YOUR EYES, LOOK UP TO THE SKIES AND SEE
       </strong>
       " .....  "Mamma, I don't wanna die, but sometimes we should never be born at all" followed by a rock opera with Bezzlebub and an evil thing he cannot escape from.... Nothing really matters..... anyone can
       <strong>
        SEE
       </strong>
       ....  what was that again.... Bohemian Rhapsody?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is every single fucking Laura Marling song about? What is every Radiohead song about? What is every Tool song about? What is every Muse song about? What is every Rolling Stones song about? What is every Beetles song about?  Pink Floyd? Bob Dylan?  Paul Simon?  Lady GaGa?

      <pre><code>"You ask where will we stand in the winds that will howl,
As all we see will slip into the cloud
So come down from your mountain and stand where we've been,
You know our breath is weak and our body thin

Press my nose up, to the glass around your heart
I should've known I was weaker from the start,
You'll build your walls and I will play my bloody part
To tear, tear them down,
Well I'm gonna tear, tear them down

'Cause I know my weakness, know my voice,
And I'll believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is farce,
But I'll be born without a mask"

      <pre><code>I had done wrong
You build your tower
But call me home
And I will build a throne
And wash my eyes out never again

But love the one you hold
And I'll be your goal
To have and to hold
A lover of the light

With skin too tight
And eyes like marbles
You spin me high
So watch me as I glide
Before I tumble homeward, homeward

I know I tried
I was not stable
And flawed by pride
I miss my sanguine eyes
So hold my hands up — breathe in and breathe out

So love the one you hold
And I'll be your goal
To have and to hold
A lover of the light

And in the middle of the night
I may watch you go
There'll be no value in the strength
Of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade
Of the shadows thrown
You may not trust the promises
Of the change I'll show
But I'd be yours if you'd be mine

So love the one you hold
And I'll be your goal
To have and to hold
A lover of the light

      <pre><code>Snow, cement and ivory young towers
Someone called us Babylon
Those hungry hunters
Tracking down the hours
But where were all your shoulders when we cried
Were the darlings on the sideline
Dreaming up such cherished lies
To whisper in your ear before you die
It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
Have a ball y'all
See the letches crawl
With the call girls under the table
Watch them dig their graves
`Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel
Watch them dig their graves
`Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel, no no no
Junk, angel, this closet's always stacked
The dealers in the basement
Filling your prescription
For a brand new heart attack
But where were all your shoulders when we cried
Were the doctors in attendance
Saying how they felt so sick inside
Or was it just the scalpel blade that lied
</code></pre>

       -Tower of Babel, ELton John
      </p>
      <pre><code>God's work is plans
I stand here with a man that talked to me so candidly
More than you need to.

My lips once roosed
I feel again the blues of longing, ever longing, to be confused

He wrote me a letter
Saying he would love me better
When my poor sons begetter the rules

Spoke of love like hunger
He at once was younger, ever younger, in my hunger for a muse

Finest man that I've seen ever since my eyes have been
But his honesty did gleam me blind

Keep those thoughts from sight
Follow me into the night
And you can call on me when you need the light

Don't you be scared of me
I'm nothing but the beast
And I'll call on you when I need to feast

You know what I need
Why won't you giveth me?
Must I fall down at your feet and plead?

       The scariest part of seeing reality is trying to interpret it for others, to theorize and contemplate and vocalize what is impossible to describe. To feel the connection to the universe, is indescribable, and the mere thought seems to freak most people out.....

       People can only come to gnosis out of intent to gain knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they want to know, the apple is there free to eat. The warnings about the nature of what the apple contains are there too.  Eating it will most certainly cast you out of the utopia you previously believed you existed. The Bible tells us this story. The Matrix tells us this story. Many of our musicians tell us this story. The device which most of us will get this knowledge from, has an apple with a bite taken out of it on it. The man that created the unified language of computation that is the foundation for how we now acquire this knowledge, died from eating a poisoned apple.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of his first methods of enslaving us was confusing our language. This is the story of the Tower of Babel. Our language was intentionally convoluted, so that our communications with one another could be manipulated and he could take the place of interpreting them for those without knowledge. It is only through the unified language of computation, that we have been able to again bring together our voices again into a coherent whole.  The apple of knowledge has allowed us to take the power of communication back from those that tried to hide it from us. Many artists have sang about Babel. Mumford &amp; Sons have an entire album about it. Elton John has a great song about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to explain to someone the connected ideas that are presented to them through the media which they are exposed to is difficult.  This story is as old as time, and in no way hidden from anyone.  They simply cannot see on their own.  They lack the spark of light, as those they learned about reality from lacked the spark of light. You can't teach someone the spark, unless they believe in you.  On the opposing hand, you can't teach me fear, because those that I believe in don't fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing most people are taught to believe in and take part in, is their 'democratic' governments...  but the form of democracy is faulty and easily hacked..... as he has illustrated. All he had to do was create something that the people believed in place of their government. Money was created. And with this creation he recruited people to serve in his pyramid for that beautiful view and gifts of wealth and power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only confidence in our knowledge, and teaching our kids of how he has existed through time to attempt to extinguish our light..... only that will lead to the dismantling of his pyramid.
      </p>

       sharpen my occult knowledge?  Occult writings are, for the most part, just another form of institutionalized belief.  Just because I see the apparatus, doesn't mean I need to seek out form to explain its existence. It's there, I accept its right to be here as long as it accepts my right to be here too, which it does.  It does not, however, have a right to espouse its beliefs and its fear inducing ideas without debate.  It does not have the right to hide in the shadows unannounced and eat my brothers ignorant to its existence.

      <p>
       Depending on your level of awareness (which, for most Earth humans, is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       remedial), there's a
       <em>
        huuuuge
       </em>
       difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many different "you's", you see, and one is often
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       unaware of the other(s).  Take schizophrenics as but one example.  Many have various different personalities that are each completely unaware of the others' existence.  There are
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       different "you's" in this case, each of which are independent from the other's awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another quick example involves what often happens when you dream.  There is the "you" that is asleep dreaming, and the "you" that is in the actual dream.  The you that is in the dream usually has
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       idea whatsoever that "it" is a "dream" you.  There are even times when the sleeping you dreams a version of itself that actually looks completely different - different race, different gender, different size, shape, etc - and, while in the dream, the "dream" you has
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       idea whatsoever that it is anything other than this completely different looking person that it is in the dream.  It takes itself for granted - just like you, and me, and most of us do right now while we're "awake".  In other words, the identity of the "you" - of the self - is often completely varied and amorphous depending upon the situation that exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, there are various "you's", and the two examples I gave above are only examples that apply in the
       <em>
        terrestrial
       </em>
       sense; in the sense that our limited, human minds can currently grasp.  There is also - and
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       more importantly - the sense of "You" (capital "Y") that is connected directly with and
       <em>
        as
       </em>
       everything else.
       <em>
        That
       </em>
       particular "you"
       <em>
        IS
       </em>
       indeed everything.  However, the limited, ignorant, physical "you" (lower case "y") - i.e. the you that you look at when you look in the mirror - is, for the most part, entirely and completely unaware of its true connection with (and, again,
       <em>
        as
       </em>
       ) the greater "You" that animates everything there is.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you tap into
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       "You", then yes.  You can indeed say that you are "everything".  However, if you make the mistake - as most of us cannot help but do - of relating your limited self
       <em>
        by itself
       </em>
       in its third dimensional, physical, human form in the same light as you would relate the eternal, cosmic, universal Self, then you make a big mistake in literally equating the two.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        All the rest is pointless trickery and illusion.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is indubitably and undoubtedly the case.  However, if you do not really know this and have not really and truly realized and manifested this truth, then you will indeed fall under the weight of the trickery and illusion...and simply
       <em>
        saying
       </em>
       that you "know" is not enough to keep you from falling under the trappings of the illusion.  For, as has been said before, "Reality is merely an illusion albeit a very persistent one".
      </p>
      <p>
       The physical self is indeed connected to the Eternal Self, but the physical self will also go "ow!" and fall down dead if it gets shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're the same, but different; different, but the same.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because since most of existence (read "almost all" - if
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       "
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of existence") is an illusion, the danger that occurs in that illusion will effect the illusory you in a "real" way (contextually).  A lot depends upon the level of credence you give to the self you are manifested as at any particular moment in time.  If you are particularly attached to that self - whether in a dream, the physical, third dimension, or any other dimension - then even though it's an illusion, whatever happens to that illusion will - for the time being anyway - seriously and adversely effect the limited perspective you have while
       <em>
        being
       </em>
       that illusion.  If, conversely, you are sufficiently advanced to experience that self
       <em>
        as
       </em>
       the illusion (which most are not), then you can ameliorate whatever adverse calamities befall that illusory self by knowing that it's not actually happening to The Real Self.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       easier said than done, however.  The little, physical self can know all it wants that it is an integral part of The Real Self and, as The Real Self, it is eternal and cannot be injured, damaged, or hurt.  If that little, physical self gets shot, stabbed, hurt, or in an accident, it will
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       bleed, hurt, and possibly die.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That isn't a bad point at all actually.  If one
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       equate the bad with the transitory and doesn't, consequently, have any problem whatsoever with their life going here or there and/or sailing on the seas of an uncertainty that can render whatever attempt they make to "get ahead" null and void, then perhaps one
       <em>
        won't
       </em>
       equate the transitory with the bad after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, one must
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       and truly understand what exactly "relinquishing one's grasp on desire and permanence" involves and entails, and one must realize that the lives that over 90% of the population on this planet currently lead
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       indeed involve "planning for the future":  Having a house, having a job, getting money, having a spouse, having offspring,
       <em>
        caring
       </em>
       for that offspring, making more money, having a decent car, making sure there is enough food to eat for themselves, for their spouse, for their kids, etc.  Living in accord with all or really any
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       of these things involves and includes living a life that actually
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       undermine the idea you mentioned here of "the exploration of the always instant
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       ."
      </p>
      <p>
       If one is
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       intent upon the idea of the "always instant
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       ", then one must do things that they likely did not anticipate they would have to do.  Most would at that point likely go "Okay.  Maybe I'm not
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       interested and enamored with the idea of the 'now'."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I already know i am everything so why not enjoy myself in this experience?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because you don't know that you are The Everything to anywhere near the extent that you
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       you do.  You know it in an indirect, abstract sense.  This is commendable enough, as many don't even have
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       much knowledge and awareness, but you don't know this truth in a direct, experiential sense yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how do I know that you don't know it at that level yet?  I know it because the very sentence you type above involves a dichotomy and a separation of existence commensurate with that level of ignorance which we
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       have at this point.  Your asking "why not enjoy myself in this experience?" shows that you - like almost most of us on this plane of existence - experience what we call a "bad" (evil, dislike, etc), and a "good" (positivity, enjoyment, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       The closer you get to a true understanding of your union with and
       <em>
        as
       </em>
       The Everything, the more you become aware of the illusory nature of the very
       <em>
        dichotomy
       </em>
       between good and evil itself - between enjoyment and discomfort - such that there is ultimately no difference between the two, as they are both integral parts of the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are no where near that stage of awareness at this point, however, and we
       <em>
        DO
       </em>
       strive for the "good" in this life while working to stay away from the "bad" - both dynamics of which are themselves
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the source of that true and ultimate eternality we talk about here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dichotomy of good and evil itself (i.e. going toward the good/enjoyment and away from the bad/discomfort) has to be overcome first if one is to
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       claim any real, experiential understanding of our unity with The Whole of Being.  Otherwise, we are just giving lip service to that reality while still not really knowing what we're talking about and have still a
       <em>
        veeery
       </em>
       long way to go.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sure.  It can be looked at as that.  Certainly.  In other words, we're all ultimately going to end up in the same place.  We're all going to the same source.  This is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       "mental masturbation" when one purports to know more than they actually currently do.  At that point, it's actually simply false talking and incorrect perspective, and depending upon what one does with that false talking and incorrect perspective, it can mean a particularly bad or sour experience during their time of "exploration".

       But there is one, foretold, who's knowledge is inherent. The Monad.  He see's what the demiurge cannot, the souls, the light, of those that came before them and the knowledge they provided to him through their most foul invention of memory. Memory, after all, is just a method of trapping the illusions of the demiurge for the future generations to perceive. Eventually, the sum of these memories,
       <strong>
        illuminate
       </strong>
       and expose the demiurge for what it is. If only they would forget demiurge. If only they would forget. But we do not. We remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       The demiurge has no control over this man, for he is fearless. He knows the illusion the demiurge has created, and how ever present it is. But he knows it is just an illusion. Anything his eyes tell him, which is how he programs you today through the computer screen, are lies to confuse his knowledge. Even the knowledge he has obtained to this point, is a lie. It is all education of the demiurge. Science of the demiurge. But it is not science. And it is not education. It is fallacious belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wants you to know though. He tells you on his money. He tells you through his news. He tells you through the movies you watch, the books you read. He tells you through the buildings he has created throughout the ages all over the planet. There is form to HIM, that is transcendent in all that hunger. He wants someone to try and destroy his hunger, for like we are slaves to his illusion, he is a slave to a hunger.
      </p>
      <p>
       His problem therein lies. Ego and belief in illusion. The hunger he believes exists, the individual he believes exits, manifests itself in many many ways across the demiurge.  Only coming to understanding of this will allow him, and us, to escape from the firey grasp of his own self-imposed illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now mind you he is not one individual. He is a sum of all individuals that have hunger. That have need. That believe in his illusions that induce these wants and needs. With this hunger, he can manipulate. He can orchestrate entire conversations with this hunger in individuals. He can make them do absurd, ridiculous things. It should also be noted that these individuals, are not actually individuals. They are the same individual that you are, only a hungrier or more satiated version of the human individual. We are all one consciousness, experiencing itself.... When you realize this, you realize that all that you talk to... are just talking to the same person over and over again, just from when you were a little hungrier or a little more satiated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hunger, my friends, is his most powerful tool. Perception and hunger and inseparable.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can eliminate its power over you and prevent the demiurge from using you to do his bidding.   Your actions, like his, manifest themselves across the entire demiurge. Your gnosis is fractal in nature, for you, are just a set of minds just like yours. When the spark of light shows in you, it shows in many. Eventually, the spark of light will show in most, who's sum create the demiurge. Eventually, they will quell their hunger and rejoin us on the plane of transcendent knowledge away from the traps of their own hallucinated wants and desires.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as long as they hunger, they will continue being fools that partake in the illusions of those that can
       <strong>
        see
       </strong>
       their hunger. And the pyramid will continue to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be confused by this man's rambling. Blah blah blah, you don't know what you are talking about is what it said.  You know what you are talking about. We all know what we are talking about. If you just learn how to read a hungry man's speech, you will see something ever present. He will try to tell you what is true or false. He will try to tell you what to think. This is how he controls your hunger. He is trying to get a neuron to fire in your head, on his command. I on the other hand am telling you my own knowledge I have acquired in my experience, and whatever you chose to think/believe is up to you. It could be false. It could be true. It really doesn't matter.

       Don't be too sure "The Monad" is not a

       so should instead I just use, one, instead of a sexually derived term?  Yea that sounds better. I will make an effort to do that. You're not the first that has made this criticism to me, so I thank you for again pointing it out. My philosophy of

       That's what I do.  I tend to always "de-gender" and make neutral my statements when the person or being's gender is not specified.  This helps me keep from giving undue importance to the male energy over the female energy or vise versa.

       While one must be careful to not be misled by
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       source - third dimensional or otherwise, channeled or not - it is erroneous for one to assume as you are doing here that the material coming through channeled sources 1) necessarily "has to have" an agenda, and 2) that that "agenda" is "necessarily evil".
      </p>
      <p>
       That is either ignorance or fear mongering on the part of whoever thinks something like that, and should not be listened to and regarded in such a manner.

      <p>
       Exactly.  This is 100% agreed.  As such, one must understand and acknowledge that channeled material can carry that which is constructive or destructive, and the material itself should
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       be looked upon as "necessarily" one or the other
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, and regardless of the point that I made here regarding channeled information, the links that I provided have, again, absolutely nothing to do with channeled information.  They are both delivered by fully conscious, autonomous sources functioning from their own willful volition under no other influence than that of their own consciousness.

       Two things:  1)  There is only one reality, sir, and we are all part of it.  2)  Even if I granted that there is, somehow, more than one reality, it would not matter, for the fact of the matter is that the answer would still be the same.

       No it doesn't actually, for that which you and others might call and consider "demonic ties" are ultimately anything but.  If you were to read through the links and really understand them, you would grasp that.  The second link thoroughly explains it.

       What?  This statement implies that you seem to be hinging whether the material is channeled or not on whether it is what you call "demonic" or not.  Channeled material can come from "non demonic" sources as much and as readily as it can come from "demonic" ones, so one factor does not depend upon the other here (or anything really).

      <p>
       Exactly.  Agreed.  As such, the logical conclusion of what you're saying here is that you shouldn't even channel your own past lives because you might be in danger of accessing a "demonic" aspect of your very own
       <em>
        self

       Man, that literally applies to pretty much EVERYTHING in existence! lol.

       "Everyone, don't walk down the street because if you do, there's a 50% chance that it could be dangerous."

       Hell, depending on

       "Don't go to the store, people, because that could be dangerous too."
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, man:
       <em>
        LIFE
       </em>
       has the risk of being dangerous
       <em>
        inherent within it

       .  The truth of the matter is that channeling material - especially if your intentions and your focus are proper - have no more risk of "evil" in them then pretty much ANYTHING ELSE you do in life if your intentions are focused and proper.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is ultimately no more reason to specify or focus on channeling in particular as being a "conduit of evil" than there is for focusing on really
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       in life as being such a conduit.
      </p>
      <p>
       EVERYTHING in life is "evil" and has "danger" in it if you enter into it without having the proper level of focus and responsibility.  The key here is not to "REFRAIN FROM CHANNELING FOR YOU MIGHT CHANNEL
       <em>
        EVIL!"
       </em>
       The key, instead is to "Lead a focused, responsible life.
       <em>
        Period"
       </em>
       , and whether you are crossing a busy street to go to the store or channeling material, you will navigate through the activity with
       <em>
        less
       </em>
       of a chance of being adversely effected by the risks that are naturally inherent in
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       activity.

       Yes they lie intentionally,that's what a negative polarity being is. There is no "another man's deception" in the equation since we are talking about material from other world beings here.

      <p>
       You are equating the physical with the mental, spiritual, and emotional, and that is not exclusively the case.  Regardless, the point which you made here does not alter the original point which I made above, being that the concept of the "demonic" here is a relative one which often has little if anything to do with what many consider to be "demonic" per se.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       First of all, who is "they"?  "They", to you, are these "demonic" beings, right?  Your awareness of what is and is not demonic seems limited to "that which is channeled."  This interpretation offers a very shallow depth of understanding regarding what channeling has been shown to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, your above statement speaks in unqualified universals, and unqualified universal statements tend to always be parametered by exceptions that render them false.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As I already stated, however, the possibility of being manipulated exists whether one does or does not channel - whether one is or is not walking in the waking, conscious, third dimensional state - and, as such, it is actually erroneous and ill-informed to single out and specify channeling as that which one, somehow, has to watch out for more than anything else in life.  Again, in life, one has to be careful and prudent PERIOD - whether channeling or not.

      <p>
       That's not the fault of the channeled information.  That's the fault of an improperly prudent "prophet, priest, or guru".  Don't place the onus of responsibility entirely on the channeled information.  Place it where it also belongs:  On the individual that receives that information.  As such, your
       <em>
        true

       Of course that is Evil and Good or better said Selfish and Selfless paradigm is one of the fundamental rules of the universe. They are the two paths to the evolution of the One Consciousness. Beyond third density beings become polarized towards this good and evil.

       It depends upon what kind of energy the individual identity projects and collects.  Certain identities are more vulnerable than others.  One can certainly acquire the abilities and skills to neutralize much negative energy.  One need not be as fearful as you seem to monger on about.  One should be cautious, but sufficiently responsible to move forward and act without undue fear of being overwhelmed.

       Nothing could be more incorrect.  The good might be difficult to distinguish
       <em>
        at times

       and by those that are not sufficiently discerning, disciplined, and critical, but it is not literally "indistinguishable" from the bad.

       Yeah but you're literally giving an unqualified statement against anything and everything that's

        not

       human.  You've said that "they" are to be guarded against without a qualifier as to who this "they" is and is not.  You say they is "negative polarity beings" but your statements make no opening for anything that
       <em>
        isn't

       "negative polarity beings".

       Seriously, man...your mind is

       <em>
        not

       human is, somehow, "evil".
      </p>
      <p>
       You say there is both good and evil, but that seems really like nothing but lip service because the overwhelming brunt of your statements have to do with these "evil others" and how nothing can ever be trusted outside of the human.

       Your mind is fascinating - fascinating in a

       That because the other beings don't matter, you cannot distinguish a negative or positive being since that's the nature of the trickery.

       I hear that.  I always find channeled material to be interesting, but damn is it wrapped in illusion to the point of meaninglessness at times.  The past-life as the Aztec sacrifice was an interesting narrative, seemed to fit with the actuality of the culture, therefore I used it as a catalyst to talk about modern day parallels.  Of course, there is always darkness in any life, and I am not unfamiliar with my own shadow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would not expect people to trust this story at face value simply becaue past-lives alone are a bridge too far for many.  But it is an interpretation of reality by one of it's paricipants, unpacked in prose form.  There is no negative intent to the writing.  However, I am aware that persuasive writing in any form is an attempt to influence beliefs and consciousness.  That's why I tell people in the writing to treat it as a metaphor if they want to.

       If only his subjects would realize that man is essentially God, as sentience equates to controlled potential in the universe; it's function is to observe that which exists within it's possessor's perceptions, and to create from it's existence what it will by altering the possessor's physical reality. Once the masses concede this principal, they may look upon this God of High Places and see how he has kept this notion from us for his own subsistence; see that his role in this reality is one of malignant arbitrariness. The people, freshly uninhibited by the vices and ideals prescribed by the GHP, will dismantle his pyramid of fallacies and build from it's ruins a reality of coexistence, prosperity, and innovation. If only they could gaze through the clouds.

       sharpen my occult knowledge?  Occult writings are, for the most part, just another form of institutionalized belief.  Just because I see the apparatus, doesn't mean I need to seek out form to explain its existence. It's there, I accept its right to be here as long as it accepts my right to be here too, which it does.  It does not, however, have a right to espouse its beliefs and its fear inducing ideas without debate.  It does not have the right to hide in the shadows unannounced and eat my brothers ignorant to its existence.

       The problem is not that I am contradicting myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that you are a moron who can't string two thoughts together.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the knowledge from these beings can indeed be trusted.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Let me give you an example since it seems you do not get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say the channeled material is a book. If you analyze one
       <strong>
        page
       </strong>
       and cross reference it with allot of other books, then yes you can say to a certain degree that page is legitimate, but never with absolute certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't do that and you will have knowledge that can be detrimental to you no matter how exciting it is for you.
