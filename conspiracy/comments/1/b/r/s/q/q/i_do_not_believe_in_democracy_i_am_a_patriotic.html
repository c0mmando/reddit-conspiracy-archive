    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with you 99% of the time if this were another country and we were under a fascist or communist constitution. However the founding fathers created something special and rare, I know it was not perfect but, over time, with lots of luck and endless sacrifice, it helped create a freedom and wealth for individuals this world had never seen.  After the American Revolution George Washington was offered untold treasure and Kingship of America, yet he chose to step away from this, so as to not get in bed with the international banksters.  I doubt many live today so noble.  I see you and alot of others just attacking my statement, mostly with semantics and personal affronts. &quot;Great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, small minds discuss people.&quot;  Is this not just a place to share and discuss ideas of freedom and liberty?  There has been some good points brought up, but the aggression leaves me to question your age, maturity, knowledge, and motivations.  I still stand behind my original statement.</p>

<p>A public affair is a public affair, something concerning a large amount of people. The word &quot;republic&quot; (originally) simply meant a form of rule other than a monarchy, it could be an oligarchy, a plutocracy, a democracy. </p>

<p>You&#39;re trying to get way too much out of a word that is more or less an empty/floating significant by now. It doesn&#39;t have an essential definition simply because it is used (and abused) in so many different ways, especially since the transformation of its meaning by the Federalists (Art. 10., IIRC) who, FYI, kind of switched the meanings of &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;republic&quot; around to get away from the (then) negatively connoted word &quot;democracy&quot;. It is also avoided by almost all political science literature because of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Total unchecked freedom is an illusion, and not a reality. This country is based on a government elected by majority rule. Even if the two party system is a farce.</p>

<p>You need a reality check as you need a majority to protect the rights you have or are losing now. Just because you don&#39;t agree with certain laws is part of the process you need to learn to live with, or revolt against. However if you choose to revolt then you need a democracy to affect change or else you are alone.</p>

<p>The democratic principle is supported by the US Constitution, and it&#39;s founding fathers who insured a three branch system to give majority rule, but also insure that minorities are protected as well.</p>

Look at Switzerland&#39;s &quot;sheep&quot;, no one would dare, not even Hitler.  The three branches were created as a checks and balances to counteract what the founding fathers knew would happen over time with any system of government/rule: The Iron law of oligarchy.  That is why sovereignty is important, sovereignty of the nation, sovereignty of the state, and sovereignty of the individual.  I&#39;m adamant about the rights and powers of the individual, because an oligarchy is an inevitability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing all the points. First of all: do you not know your history? One, it&#39;s white washed by a particular cultures perspective, not to mention the view of your own ego which is the accumulated experiences of your life. Another, you&#39;re history is only a small piece of a greater history of pre-history, and a meta-history of indigenous culture that did not keep records. </p>

<p>Anarchism is not necessarily about little states. Anarchism is about not having a State. Which is in other words a centralized, privatized, and or representative system of governance that has private interests larger than that of particular communities. Not to mention, capitalism creates an in-equality of voice that does not bode well with &quot;democracy&quot;. And how can a rich white man who is lobbied by multi-national corporations with billions of dollars and lawyers on their side helping them represent young people, minorities, women, or any number of the diverse people who make up any nation? </p>

<p>Anarchism is about philosophy. Anarchism is about participation and responsibility first for the individual, then the greater consenting community. It&#39;s all about scale. If a community decides to create a hierarchical structure, or an economy, or utilize natural resources and advance technology, they are free to do so and it is ultimately encouraged for the diversity. However, an individual or a community imposing on another is frowned upon, as it typically is now, so what&#39;s so different anyhow? Governing is not the problem. The centralized interests of the State are the issue, and the fact that those interests are very closely connected to the even further private interests of large corporations who happen to monopolize the diversity of potential people create into a very few influentially wealthy hands.</p>

<p>More like tribes, communities. People deciding together how to run things. If we were to say, go outside and talk you know. Meet in the neighborhood where we typically work in collaboration to create a secure, sustainable, efficient, resilient community to thrive and provide for the whole. For, our local residence would already be plentiful with the fruits of our labors as well, and we&#39;d have plenty of time and be happy to help our community flourish the same way. But, yes it is a dream for we allow corporations and technology to alienate ourselves from one another and our local environment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s up to individuals to decide that we are well enough to be Humane. To take responsibility for ourselves and the security of our community. That is what Anarchism is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of this sounds super happy and peaceful and free. And maybe it would work with little idealized Sims, but human beings don&#39;t always behave themselves. &quot;Anarchism is about philosophy.&quot; You&#39;re right. But there&#39;s no way to impose your philosophy on other people&#39;s minds. Long ago, we all lived in semi-anarchy, which turned into small local tribal governments, and from there government evolved independently all over the globe. It&#39;s how humans naturally associate.</p>

<p>&quot;...an individual imposing on another is frowned upon.&quot; Great. Who does the frowning? How do you mandate what is frowned upon? The young United States was frowned upon by the Native Americans, but we all know how effective a deterrent that was.</p>

<p>You paint a pretty picture of thousands of Communist utopias, all happily interacting. People are going to want resources that their little group doesn&#39;t have access to. That means trade, and bartering is terribly inefficient, so that means money. And trade and money mean central financial structures. This is how things work. It is how things will always work.</p>

<p>Sometimes, people aren&#39;t going to want to pay for these resources... but they&#39;ll have plenty of iron and gunpowder. Or they&#39;re going to have personal disagreements with the smaller utopia next door. Or they&#39;re just going to have a particularly ambitious leader, and they&#39;re going to go to war. If you think you can prevent this with &quot;philosophy,&quot; you&#39;ve never met a human being. We&#39;re power-hungry. Superpowers will form, empires will form.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying your philosophy doesn&#39;t sound pretty. But I am saying that it&#39;s pure fantasy. And rather than chase a fantasy, I think the time and brainpower is much more effectively spent on finding solutions to problems in the real world. Our system of government will always be a work in progress, and it will never be perfect, but we can make it better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s fantasy because we only know of a culture of competition, dependence, and greed. We don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to live in a society of plenty. A society of sustainable ecosystems where one doesn&#39;t need to take, for he has already given effort to pay for their needs. It&#39;s about collaborating with people. Not alienating them. For example, say I have a sustainable plot of land, in a community of sustainable individuals and we also have a community farm plot. We must have excess. Instead of hoarding it, we would share it with people who are not yet sustainable. </p>

<p>You see, we must create connections instead of seeing people as enemies. We must create circumstances where people can fit in and work together, rather than be kicked out and forced on their own. It&#39;s about philosophy because it is a change on consciousness. Sure, not everyone will be on the same level. Anarchism gives people and communities the freedom to do what they wish. If people create inclusive systems that flourish and provide, if people co-create these systems for the benefit of the many, why would one who does not know how the system works risk fucking it up just so they can steal?</p>

<p>Colonialism, imperialism, nationalism, these are the things that created the mess we&#39;re in. Centralized interests. That is why this is not something that will happen after a riot. This change does not happen over night. We aren&#39;t just going to molotov the white house and shoot cops. We&#39;re going to first create sustainable and efficient communities. Next we&#39;re going to make personal connections with individuals on a broad scale. Once we have a feeling of security with the resources we&#39;ve built up, and the friendliness we&#39;ve created in our community by being kind and sharing and opening up to people, then we can kick the State and corporate interests out of town. </p>

<p>We&#39;re all Anarchists. Everyday we choose not to rape and kill. Is that because of the threat of jail? I hope it&#39;s because people know that that shit is fucked up. The only difference is, today we have some centralized representative government that decides who can marry, what people can ingest, where when how and why a pipeline is being put, who can get away with not paying taxes, who&#39;s business is affluent enough to get subsidies. </p>

<p>So don&#39;t worry about governing, for that is what we do individually and socially everyday. The State and their centralized interests, is what the Anarchist disapproves of. For no one is representing me. No one is representing the Earth. No one is representing the sub cultures or the women or the minorities or our animal brothers and sisters. Only we can do these things, for we make up the State. That is what has happened, we&#39;ve been kicked out of government because the Federal Government has become the centralized figure head for all local governance. </p>

<p>When a community has a sustainable source of resources which grow freely in the wild, who needs money? When your resources produce more resources, who needs to compete? The natural world provides, and that is why centralized interests have alienated us so far from it. Now, we&#39;re dependent on monopolized resources and our representatives to say the word and protect us from all the big bad bullies of the world.</p>

<p>Bring on the bullies. I&#39;ll tell them I love you, here&#39;s an apple pie. Join us and grow more apples and bake more pies won&#39;t you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that between 3-5% of a population are sociopaths, right? Those are charming people with no empathy. The rest of humanity is not completely rational. Maybe with a few thousand years you can adjust the mixture of genes and culture, but it&#39;s highly unlikely.  I recommend you step out of the world of philosophy and into the sciences- psychology, sociology, neuroscience, etc. Heck take a walk over to tHe marketing department if you want to see how people make judgements.</p>

<p>A government is nothing more than an organized way of creating a system of laws. Breaking it into smaller groups rarely changes group dynamics. Groups will conquer other groups. And with your &quot;all carrot no stick&quot; approach will end up with something as weak as the United Nations. Sanctions, shunning, or letter writing does little against a group that just had a massive drought and the next tribe over doesn&#39;t have enough supplies. The stick is necessary.

    <div class="md"><p>Never had a problem with any of those 3-5% yet. With enough carrots, what do you need a stick for? Again, the State and government are not the same thing. If the tribe next door doesn&#39;t have enough supplies, we make cuttings from our perennials, share seeds with them, and help implement a sustainable design system to allow them to flourish.</p>

<p>What is the stick today? Is a peaceful, flourishing community of natural resources not enough? Maybe for the 3-5% of people you speak of, but if they can&#39;t realize what&#39;s happening as people transition into a more thoughtful lifestyle, too bad. They can assimilate or start a community of their own.</p>

<p>The other thing is, I&#39;ll say it a million times, this doesn&#39;t happen over night. But if you look around, you&#39;ll see a lot of people becoming interested in local business, eating local food, their health in general. It has begun, and will grow until the State recognizes our intentions, and at that point if it it is a democracy, we will be encouraged and helped. But, I&#39;ll say this a million times too, these interests do not line up with that of the State, for it negates the need for their existence when people govern themselves, create and distribute their own natural resources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your context would only be valuable if we are not the state, but we are. We ,citizens of the USA, are the government. We elect people and granted there is much corruption of the system, we can change things on a larger scale. Your way removes the true ability to change your group. It might sound like a good thing, but each area has too many ups and downs and massive destruction will occur.  Destruction that is larger than any small groups can work to overcome.</p>

<p>As for the 3-5%, that is just the sociopaths, and they are antisocial without empathy-antisocial with empathy is an even larger number. That&#39;s not even those that are willing to follow them and commit acts in that name.  Those acts are much easier to accomplish because people in small groups develop xenophobia, an evolutionary response to harm from strangers.  I recommend a wander in close knit societies to get a feel for this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you missed it, but I say all the time the State is a centralized think tank that is beyond the government. I will agree, we make up the government. However, the government is privatized at the federal level. And I nor anyone I associate with, has the wealth or status it would take to influence any kind of change be it federal or even local government for that matter. That is why I say we have an issue of scale, for the interests of those at the top of the pyramid is why different of a scale than that of those at the bottom of the hierarchical pyramid who have to worry about sustenance and paying for rent.</p>

<p>I just think everyone is scared. Why can&#39;t we be our own police? Why can&#39;t we create our own &quot;punishment&quot;, if that makes us feel more secure? I just don&#39;t see how you can feel represented by this &quot;democracy&quot;. Sure we can send all the fucking letters and petitions we want, but it always comes down to capital influence and social status. </p>

<p>We live in Anarchy, we just don&#39;t realize it because we have all of these hierarchical structures that make it appear like we aren&#39;t working together. Everyday we all play our part, but the larger scene we don&#39;t see that is unfolded by the CEOs and the elites in political office is the part that influence the whole globe, this is the part that doesn&#39;t represent us and doesn&#39;t care. When&#39;s the last time the house had a hard time passing a bill and said &quot;you know, let&#39;s see what the people who we represent have to say.&quot; Half the time, elections are rigged anyway.</p>

<p>I think we can agree to disagree. If we have a State, it should be good government. But what we have is a State that is in bed with corporations. And that just doesn&#39;t bode well when you have a diverse array of people and their interests to represent. </p>

<p>And if it all went correct, the current governing structures would engage in the people&#39;s democratic voice of disapproval and longing for change. We could have the help we need to move to a more sustainable environment. We could have the technology and resources to scientifically come up with ways to produce plenty of food and textile products just from plants. And this is what I mean by replenishing resources. However, it&#39;s not in the interest of private entities for it creates independent and sustainable communities who are no longer in need of corporations pushing third world resources made by underpaid workers and sold by more underpaid employees.</p>

<p>It comes down to our intent. I intend to grow food and get to know my community, and share my production and knowledge. Corporations intend to make profit. The State is in debt and also wants to make profit. So, who will be more wholesome? The dude who grows plenty of food to share, or the likely sociopath who wants profit?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to look at history, for indigenous people still exist in the far reaches of this planet and live with Earth. Western culture, including that of the Greeks, is at a certain point of perspective. Colonialism, capitalism, the exploit of natural resources to the point where you need to set sail across the high seeds to find more to exploit. These ideas will leave us with a dead planet. Are we not wise enough to make these connections? Between nature and what it provides for our sustenance? Are we not considerate enough to perceive that other people have feelings and needs like us?</p>

<p>Come on, this is 2013, if we can&#39;t decide together to be good people, I&#39;ll do it on my own and you&#39;re welcome to share my bounty. </p>

Except, the police have been privatized (this is an anarchy, which is great for business) and she hasn&#39;t been paying them. So, the police won&#39;t help her. Its up to you. Do you run into her house and put your own life at risk for her? You have nothing to gain, and everything to lose. Do you do it?</p>

<p>The last time you heard a car alarm go off, did you do anything? The last time you saw a child crying in public, did you do anything? </p>

<p>In an anarchy, I could march into town, fire a few shots in the air, and declare myself King. Now, someone might shoot me. But odds are, they won&#39;t. And if someone does shoot me, then odds are its because they want to be King, not because they&#39;re working for the good of the community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>people without guns run and hide when they see a gun, it what the movies tell them to do. gun ownership for self defense would be a moral duty in anarchy. also some men died protecting their wives/girlfriends in the james holmes shootings, so you can dismiss the whole DNA argument.</p>

<p>actually in an anarchy there is no money. so no privatised police force. no police force at all actually. an individual community would be capable of operating as a militia though. the whole anarcho-capitalist concept is an oxymoron and therefore dismissed. but the neighbour would not been screaming for help, the intruder would of been shot. </p>

<p>indifference to children and car alarms is a symptom of the capitalist system where a well-meaning human being can end up getting sued for trying to help.</p>

<p>anarchists are not pacifists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are going to create money because money is convenient. And in your anarchy wonderland, who&#39;s going to stop them? People are going to buy and sell things, because that&#39;s what you do with money, and who&#39;s going to stop that?</p>

<p>People are going to form a police force, because other people are dicks and every-man-for-himself style justice leaves a lot of people out in the cold. Call it a militia if you want. It&#39;s the same thing. And people are going to set up a power structure to manage that police force/militia/drunken posse.</p>

<p>Somebody is going to be charismatic and ambitious and that person is going to become a leader. It happens in every social structure on earth. People like being led. And Dear Leader is going to enlist the help of other people to handle day-to-day tasks, and now you have a government. Oops.</p>

<p>Hate to break it to you, but anarchy is never going to seriously exist on this planet.</p>
