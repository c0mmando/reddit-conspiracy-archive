       you have to scroll down to the bottom to see it. See that huge spike in price back in 1980? Well it is well understood and documented that the 1980 spike was because the Hunt Brothers were trying to corner the market.

       The total number of bitcoins is less than 21 million. That is in the software. Even at $200 per bitcoin that only gives us a total market size of $4.2 billion USD. I imagine you could have a major effect on the Bitcoin Market with just 2-4 million BTC, which was less than $1 per in recent memory.

       Am I completely off base here, or is it possible the Bitcoin market is being manipulated?

       I'm not anything close to being well-informed on this but here's how I look at it: The ruling elite are bankers. Just like when Lincoln/US brought into being the Greenback, albeit for different reasons, the European bankers could not let that currency stand because they could not control it. Same goes with this; however, it is not Bitcoin itself that directly threatens them. It is the idea of a uncontrolled currency being used on a global scale.

       You're correct about what actually threatens them. What you're incorrect about is your assumption that Bitcoin represents a legitimate challenge (it doesn't) and is therefore something for the ruling elite to fear (it isn't).

       the idea can be quickly killed by media. Just publish threatening articles about bitcoins being used to fund terrorists and bad guys using to hide taxes, later "to protect citizens" issue the law to forbid any legal company to accept currency "used by terrorists" and job done. Bitcoin or uncontrolled money is finished

       I agree that some might try to squash bitcoin, and that these instances have already occurred to some extent.  But, any Idea which is born out of selflessness and altruism can not be destroyed.  It's very much like artists, or revolutionary scientific breakthroughs/minds,  which cannot be fully appreciated, fully realized, within their own lifetime.  They may feel defeated and may never personally reap the rewards of their hard work and sacrifice.  However, with patience and enough time the seeds they've planted will ultimately flourish in ways even they themselves could not possibly have imagined.  No one, no number of people, can exterminate an Idea such as the one represented by bitcoin.  What most won't realize is that the very propaganda used in attempts to destroy the Idea ultimately becomes the very potent fertilizer which nourishes the Idea into blossoming and flourishing.

       It is almost a fact that the Bitcoin market is manipulated.  But the questions should be "by whom?" and "for how long?"  You can look through the history of Bitcoin trading all the way back to when it was less than $1, and see that several very public manipulations of the Bitcoin market have been attempted, have been successful for a time, and have eventually succumbed to the will of the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       At one time, a fairly average individual could have a huge impact on the Bitcoin market.  And they did.  Back when it was big enough to matter, someone took out a $20,000 short position, and made the mistake of announcing it on the forums.  Someone else decided to spike the price and squeeze their position.  They both lost out in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it took a wealthy individual.  Look up pirateat40.  He manipulated the price for over 6 months, with the help of some very gullible investors.  Then his ponzi scheme collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today it requires a corporation.  And just because manipulation is a game that is destined to failure, doesn't mean it won't happen.  It's entirely likely that some corporation, Google or Apple or Western Union, is currently eyeing the Bitcoin market.  They may even already be there.  And there is no way to predict their motives or effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soon, however, Bitcoin manipulation will be left to governments and banks.  That's when the real fun begins.  Hedge funds and private investors are already taking bites at Bitcoin.  The early adopters will be mostly rational, profit-driven.  But soon some bigger fish will show up, and try to eat the Bitcoin market before it gets too big.  I for one don't think they will be successful.  But it should be interesting regardless.

       Bitcoin is a textbook seigniorage scheme. It's just like cap-and-trade, only it turns out developers/'hackers' are a lot more gullible than even pseudo-sovereign nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key to understanding scams is understanding when the money is made. The majority of the money was made when the currency was initially inflated into having value, then sold into circulation (seigniorage: 'Satoshi Nakamoto'). The illusion of supply control comes from their extremely complicated and pointless explanation for 'mining' bitcoins (tell me, why didn't they just create all the bitcoins at once? How were the first several million created, they certainly weren't 'mined' over decades). The 'walking around' money is made through manipulating the exchange, which the currency creators still do. The coke and hookers money will be made when they dump and walk.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you notice, the biggest rallies in Bitcoin are always right after a bug, hack, or flash crash. It is after moments like this that the illusion is most vulnerable; people are in danger of remembering there's no value underlying this currency and enormous counterparty risk, especially given the resolute anonymity of the market markers. So whenever something 'bad' happens, the ensuing 'rally' is always enormous, inflating the value to new highs and bringing roaring PR back. No one seems to remember the very real existential flags being thrown up by these crashes; the entire 'wallet' concept was just irreparably broken by hackers and yet the PR machine has us singing praises about this thing? A major inflection point just showed in the market, it was immediately papered over with PR and now everything is okay? Everyone seems to forget that unnatural market behavior like this is more evidence of manipulation, and therefore of enormous risk (particularly at value peaks, as any one could be the last).
      </p>
      <p>
       By the time you realize the pump is over, they'll be counting your money on their own private island in micronesia because you have no idea who the cabal behind 'Satoshi Nakamoto' even is. One of the first red flags to look for within a seigniorage scheme is anonymity of its members. Cue Bitcoin, Jekyll Island &amp; Federal Reserve, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing about bitcoin is like silver. Bitcoin operates in concert with the fiat ponzi because it's a ponzi fiat. Silver is a physical commodity, it is an insurance policy against things like the Federal Reserve Note and bitcoin. The spike in silver came when the Hunt Brothers realized the supply of physical silver collateralizing the fiat market was too small to be sustainable, and decided to prove it by cornering enough of the silver supply to prevent the J.P. Morgue from shorting it as effectively (as they still do on a daily basis). Their lives were nearly destroyed until they gave their position up, which allowed the market to return to its manipulated state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin, by contrast, is just being pumped because its investors are being pumped. By the time y'all see the brick wall at the back of the theater, it'll be way too late.

       This is wrong on so many fundamentals.  You obviously do not actually understand how bitcoin works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is 1 example of your lack of understanding:
       <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block">
        https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block
       </a>
       Only 50BTC were created intially and only 50 per 10 minutes running the hashing algorithm.  They were of 0 value until others agreed to the value through mutual trust of the encrypted exchange capability of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Im not saying there isnt market manipulation as a whole or various other oddities.  But what you say above is just fundamentally incorrect and shows more assumption then knowledge.

       Full disclosure: Senjutsuka has a significant financial interest in this scam, so be aware he'll spin you a bunch of trash to suggest the system is somehow 'elegant' or 'complicated.' I have zero financial interest in this scam, and am only interested in providing the counterweight to the PR onslaught.

        I signed up. I'm currently running 2 companies and have stake in 3 others (equity for tech/bus dev). I'm definitely interested in getting involved in a bitcoin startup and some of the people I know are interested in investing in something like this.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have contacts in several VC/Angel circles and know some interesting individuals worth pitching to when the time is right. Bitcoin is still a bit of a hard sell to these east coasters but I've managed to get a few monied individuals to jump in recently, so its not impossible.

       False.  Im a small technical business owner that wants to get involved in bitcoin b/c I've studied the fundamentals, the math, and the technology for a few years and find that it is not lacking.  I have friends who I talk to for FREE.  So no, I dont have significant money in this.  In fact I only own 1 btc right now.

       Nice job trying to distracting from the facts I listed.  Its still true, no one generated millions instantly like you assume.

       To be clear, I'd like to hear you refute what Senjutsuka said, instead of just attack him personally.  Full disclosure: I am really into Bitcoin, (I don't have very much invested at all), and understand that Bitcoins have been, and always will be generated at a calculable rate since the Genesis block

       Which is all meaningless if the operation is allowed to continue for an arbitrary amount of time before taking it public. It doesn't matter if you're producing them every 10 minutes or every 10 seconds if they're falling into the same pockets.

       You want a refutation because you're playing their game. They wave their left hand in front of your face like you're a monkey ('genesis blocks,' 'algorithms,' it's just too complicated for you to understand...right) and think you'll ignore the right hand behind their back.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can create any bogus process you want, but until you take it public you control all of the theoretical production. There is zero transparency about the origination of this currency, but I can guarantee you that until its value was inflated into
       <em>
        something,
       </em>
       the first bitcoins didn't change hands. So the question is, who sold the first bitcoins? Because that person made a pile of fucking money out of nothing, and before that they were sitting on a pile of fucking worthless-ass bitcoins until they talked some suckers into this scam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any time someone is creating something out of nothing, you should be careful. Any time they won't tell you who they are, you should be wise.

        They're still controlling the fucking exchange these things trade on. Helllooooo...

       This is a scam and you'll be taken, unless you're a paid PR shill for them in which case you'll continue to try to slide the topic into an arena where your bullshit algorithms and fancy showmanship will carry any weight whatsoever.

       If the Bitcoin system survives until all the coins are mined, the year will be around 2140.
       <em>
        If

       Bitcoin is still in use in 130 years it will probably be an important feature of international trade, and the miners will be rewarded with transaction fees instead of created bitcoins.  Transaction fees already exist (anyone who says otherwise knows about as much about BTC as someone who says silver is easy to find under spot does about the Ag market) so there is no threat of sudden implementation.

       I had a real dependable source for junk or the occasional ASE or .999 bar or round. Almost always junk. It was an antique store with a we buy gold sign. He sold under spot for everything but ASEs and those he sold me for spot. One day it all dried up. I still check in from time to time and last time he told me some dude dropped off $20,000 for him to hold till he got in enough silver to cover it.

       That hurts.  The best I can get around here is spot+$1.50 for generic silver rounds, unless there's some 90% in, I get that for a hair over melt.  I have found Maples, painted ASEs, and Libertads in the $1.50 over bin, though, and that's always a good day.

       I find it highly unlikely that Bitcoin will exist in decades.  The problem with Bitcoin in the long term is that the block chain will grow very large, I've heard in the multiple terra byte range.  Its possible that it could grow slow enough that storage capacity and wireless bandwidth outpaces all of this.  Also it is possible that they could create some really slick synching methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically I'm thinking that in 10-15 years that it will be painfully obvious that the distribution aspect of Bitcoin is 10-15 years old and that new algorithms could do the job better.  Then an incompatible code fork might be necessary.

       You may be right.  I have weighed those possibilities, and I am paying close attention to other cryptocurrencies.  If one of them looks clearly better than Bitcoin I'll trade my small BTC reserves for whatever seems like a better buy.  As of now, my BTC has more than quintupled in value even with today's sell offs, so I'm going to keep riding this train for awhile.  Regardless of what happens to Bitcoin, I think some sort of cryptocurrency is going to become a major player on the international scene.  Right now Bitcoin is poised to take that spot, but I may move into something else if there seems to be good reason to do so.

       They are saying that gold is plummeting.  That is ridiculous.  It immediately corrected from the top and then has been trading sideways for a while, rather boringly actually and not plummeting.  This is why I like the metals now because people are losing faith and dull journalists find it easy to write yet another article like this.  China is still gobbling up crazy amounts of metals, the bankers are still super eager to get gold like in Cyprus and Libya.  Its a joke.  Gold for the win.

       Wow!  Have you seen silver's price?  Its down below $26.  Its very suspicious since this NY Times hit piece was written a day before.  The price of gold had not plummeted this hard in over a year and a half.  Then suddenly - wham!  The next day after the article.  That article was totally ridiculous yesterday and now today it is true.  That is whack man.

       Bitcoin isn't a currency. It's a 'virtual' commodity masquerading as a currency. But it's traded on a controlled exchange, shows heavy signs of manipulation, and in all other ways is a textbook seigniorage pump 'n dump scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tally stick was an actual currency, and yes, it was perhaps the most successful currency in recorded human history. It's not a suitable example however, because bitcoin functions less like a tally stick and more like an uninsured, uncertified otc slv silver certificate, only its day-to-day value is determined by anonymous sources and they've dropped all pretext of having the debt collateralized by any physical asset.

       If it weren't for this I'd believe bitcoin had a chance. Since its there I believe they are the MySpace of crypto currency, they fucked it up and there will be a bigger one someday.

       I wont disagree they may be the myspace of crypto but the idea that there is a kill switch built in is simply false.  The premise is that one or a few people own a majority of the coins.  This is simply not true:

       By block 70 (market total of 3500 btc) other people were using the software and generating.  The speed of hashing also increased significantly in the first few weeks and continued to do so beyond that point meaning more adoption was occurring.

       Jeeze man if you are sitting on Bitcoins then just get out of a lot of it and get into silver.  Bitcoins have gone nuts and nobody is talking about silver now after two years of $27-35 price range.  Bitcoin could even double from here but you must have already made a killing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect silver to double or triple in the next 1-3 years.  I think that $28 is a fantastic price.

       At most 1M are sitting in early accounts and have never moved (meaning they probably got deleted when bit coins were less the 1000th of a penny a piece - if so they are gone forever).  That is less then 10% of the market right now and less then 5% of the total bitcoins that will exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally your math doesnt make sense.  There are only 11M in existence.  If 7 people own 80% then they are doing a lot of transacting with only each other assuming 2-10 million are actually circulating...

       Yeah, it is being manipulated in my opinion. I checked out the activity on bitcoin.org - which should be good indication of how much interest the general public is taking in this currency. Here are the stats on Alexa:
       <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/bitcoin.org#">
        http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/bitcoin.org#
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see from the chart that there is definitely growing interest in bitcoin, but the increase in interest is nothing close to the parabolic rise in price. This is because big money speculators are getting in right now and driving up the price... and a lot of this could have come from a single manipulator (perhaps even operating through various agents).
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was the Federal Reserve, I would without doubt buy up as many bitcoins as possible... and once it gets really expensive, sell them all off in one go and watch the price plummet. I would then buy them up again at pennies on the dollar. I would make money and destroy the credibility of digital currencies for a good, long while, and still own the currency.
There may still be some time to make money out of this currency, but I would urge you to be careful if you are going to invest in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, I could be wrong - but this looks like a total bubble and manipulation to me.

       You are 100% correct, and just imagine if you are a share holder in a  central bank who doesn't like any thing competing with paper money.  You spin up your presses and buy a chunk and shake things up.  Sure, economics has plenty of fancy names for economic cycles but make no mistake - there are centralized driving forces behind every cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't understand that even when we had sovereign, debt free money (coined by congress), the forces were at play to destabilize it as much as possible in order to pave the way for centralized currencies.  Economics is the art of making simple concepts complicated.

       I was aware of Bitcoins years ago and the price did flounder about for a while and it took some time to go from nerdy programmer Linux/BSD types to where it is today.  I thought very hard about buying some a few years ago for computer experimentation, sovereign person research.  I never got around to buying them.

       About three years ago I realized that some form of cryptographic currency was going to eventually make it so I was looking at some way to securely store it.  I lock my main Linux notebook down pretty damn tight but I felt that probably that would not be good enough.  So I decided that a special purpose notebook with a fully open source Linux OS would be the way to go and that ideally it would have a clamshell keyboard and weigh at most half a pound.  That little device would end up being my wallet and it would hardly touch the Internet at all.  I've kept my eye on the

       If it weren't for this I'd believe bitcoin had a chance. Since its there I believe they are the MySpace of crypto currency, they fucked it up and there will be a bigger one someday.

       Whenever the price drops it's a buying opportunity.  It may be years before spot hits $50 again, but eventually it will.  When that happens some of us qwill be ready to double our money.
