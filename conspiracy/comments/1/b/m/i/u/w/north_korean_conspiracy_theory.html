        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>we are just being told that NK plans to attack the US and SK,  when infact they have made no such threats and NK is so shut off from the rest of the world they have no idea this is happening. SK will then take all of NK and be in debt to the US.</p>

<p>TL;DR __ US and SK lie about threats so they can take NK</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, the timing of the movie &quot;Red Dawn&quot; which is an obvious North Korea hit-piece happening right before this latest &quot;news&quot; seems pretty suspect- especially considering the movie was re-made using North Korea, instead of China as the aggressor.</p>

<p>It also happens to be one of very few new movies available to watch for free on Youtube: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xon7LWHXgnI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xon7LWHXgnI</a></p>

<p>Check out the anti-North Korea propaganda if you&#39;re interested.</p>

<p>The idea that North Korea could take over a large section of the US is laughable, but if you read the comments under that video, many people think it&#39;s possible after watching that crap movie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or, maybe it&#39;s because North Korea needs to be vilified. </p>

<p>Had China been the aggressor in the film, it have been a lot more believable.  North Korea obviously doesn&#39;t have the capability to invade the U.S..  Is Hollywood really making movies to appeal to Chinese tendencies now?</p>

<p>Watch the movie - the North Koreans talk about how our government is corrupt and they mix truth and fiction.</p>

<p>&quot;We are not your enemies, because you too are victims, victims of an American culture in which greed, irresponsibility and fraud were openly encouraged,  victims of a corrupt government in bed with wall-street.&quot;</p>

<p>That was written in to because it&#39;s true- so the audience relates to it, and it becomes more believable on a baser level. </p>

<p>An EMP is used to shut down the country before the attack- we are constantly reminded of EMPs and I bet EMP will be used before whatever large-scale fake event is next attempted.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a potential fake event-  EMPs shut down power for the west coast and central part of the country, and then a nuke, or multiple small nukes are set off in a few major cities (remember the T.V. show Jericho?)-  The attack will be blamed on North Korea, and other &quot;axis of evil&quot; countries, and then total martial law is enacted, and the &quot;war on terror&quot; goes into overdrive.</p>

<p>Just an out-there speculation.</p>

<p>North Korea was obviously chosen to be the aggressor in this movie at the behest of orders from the military/political class.  It seems more than coincidental after this movie was released we were told North Korea is planning to attack us with nukes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just wanted to address your first question about Hollywood catering to the Chinese; the answer is yes. The person you responded to had already given reasoning as there is a huge Chinese market for western films. I read an article the other day about world war z, the movie based on the book, where the producers of that movie had to alter an aspect of the script to appease the Chinese state censors. Never mistake the power of a market in these sorts of things, your other points might hold true, but sometimes it&#39;s just about money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, me and my girlfriend are looking for something to see at the movie theater last weekend. I do a quick search, and there&#39;s one movie that has more showtimes at the mega-theater in my area: <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2302755/">Olympus Has Fallen</a></em>.</p>

<p>I walked out of the movie feeling like it was a pure propaganda piece. The basic plot is that North Koreans manage to terrorize Washington DC and successfully invade/gain control over the White House. There were at least 3 scenes in the movie where the U.S. flag is shown in tatters. The NK/SK conflict and the DMZ is specifically referenced throughout the movie.</p>

<p>There are scores of newer movies available on Youtube. They&#39;re uploaded, fly under the radar as long as possible, and are taken down. It&#39;s only been uploaded a short time. It will undoubtedly be taken down with a DMCA notice, just like this videos usually are.</p>

<p>Of course it is. But the movie was written and filmed with <em>China</em> as the invader, not North Korea. They changed the aggressor from China to North Korea in post production. The movie was initially supposed to feature China as the villain.</p>

The new leader is posturing to save face with the old guard generals, so they will have confidence in his ability to be in power. That&#39;s why the rhetoric is so much high the first year he&#39;s in power. They did the same when Kim Jon-il took over for his father in 1994 he started shit like his father before him also did.
The new young bull is just strutting his oats to the world of how he is a bad ass. He will tone it down soon, and the USA will remove the missile defense off Guam back to Hawaii (We have the golf ball out there already plus missile destroyers). He then will declare himself the victor to his people and their Dear Supreme Leader God has warded off the imperialist devils the USA once again saving them as his father and grandfather did.

    <div class="md"><p>Are you really saying that you don&#39;t think that the North Korean government isn&#39;t as informed about what&#39;s happening in the rest of the world as any other government?</p>

<p>Last time I checked, it was the people of North Korea who were cut off from the rest of the world, not their leaders.</p>

<p>If indeed the threats were made up, the North Korean government would obviously know about it and would let the people of their country know if they thought it could help them in any way. The North Korean government is in control of everything the people of North Korea know about international news. Whether the North Korean government did make the threats (and used them as propaganda) or not (and is obviously still aware of the made up threats), the North Korean government still has the same level on control over what the people is allowed to know.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a problem with the idea that the threats might be made up, but the idea that North Koreans don&#39;t know about the made up threats because they&#39;re cut off from the rest of the world is plain ridiculous. If the actual people of North Korea aren&#39;t aware of the threats that were directed at South Korea and the US, it&#39;s because their leaders don&#39;t want them to know, not because they&#39;re so cut off from the rest of the world that they&#39;re oblivious to what&#39;s happening. Whether the threats are made up or not is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Now, if by &quot;North Korea&quot; you were referring to the government of North Korea not knowing about what&#39;s going on (assuming this is a &quot;conspiracy&quot;), you&#39;re an idiot, and I don&#39;t think I need to prove that point any further. However, if you were referring to the general population of North Korea not knowing about the made up threat, I guess you&#39;d better come up with a good reason as to why their government (which is undoubtedly aware of the made up threats) would hide that from them, since this is perfect propaganda material (being able to provide concrete example of a lie from the greed driven imperialist pigs) based on actual facts that they wouldn&#39;t even have to lie about...</p>

<p>So I&#39;m not sure how the theory of North Korea not being aware of the made up threats, if indeed they are made up, makes any sense at all...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No probably not. If you read KCNA (Korean Central News Agency) It is fairly explicit in its&#39; threats against the U.S. and SK (NK also has a stated goal of Korean &quot;Reunification&quot;. </p>

<p>An Example:</p>

<p><strong>KSDP Will Make Every Possible Effort for Earlier Conclusion of Showdown with U.S.
Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- The chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party (KSDP) made public a statement on Tuesday in support of the important decision made by the dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un at an operation meeting on the Korean People&#39;s Army Strategic Rocket Force&#39;s performance of duty for firepower strike and the special statement released by the government, political parties and public organizations of the DPRK to implement it.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The prevailing grave situation calls upon all Koreans in the north, the south and overseas to dynamically turn out in a nationwide all-people resistance to sweep away all the U.S. imperialists and the pro-U.S. sycophants and traitors from the earth, the statement said, and went on:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The new strategic line laid down at the March, 2013 Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers&#39; Party of Korea which called for simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear armed force is the most just revolutionary one as it correctly indicates a shortcut to coping with the prevailing grave situation and opening up a bright future of the nation as early as possible.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The KSDP, which regards independence as its idea, is convinced that under the present situation the strategy for achieving reunification and the way to be followed by the nation lie in countering the U.S. nuclear blackmail with a just nuclear strike and a provocation with a prompt great war for national reunification. 
Now that the DPRK&#39;s armed forces for self-defence have gone into a practical military action and the inter-Korean relations have been put in the state of war, any provocation to infringe upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK even a bit will not escape a prompt physical strike.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Various political parties and organizations and people of different social standings in south Korea should properly understand who is harasser of peace in face of this grim situation and turn out in a just struggle against the U.S. and the wicked confrontation maniacs keen to ignite a nuclear war, irrespective of ideology, political view and religious belief. 
The KSDP Central Committee and all its members will make every possible effort to bring earlier the day of putting an end to the long-standing history of the confrontation with the U.S. by concerted efforts of the nation.</strong></p>

<p><em>Whether you think the U.S. is imperialistic or not the rhetoric used by North Korea is definitively hostile. There are plenty of articles on KCNA discussing pre emptive nuclear strikes on the U.S., SK, and Japan.</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The true N. Korean successor should&#39;ve been Kim Jong Nam, the eldest son of Kim Jong Il, born in 1971, but after being caught trying to get in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-nam#2001_Tokyo_Disneyland_incident">Japan&#39;s <em>Disneyland</em> in 2001</a>, his father had no choice but to select his youngest son, born in 1983, Kim Jong Un (rumors say there is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenji_Fujimoto#Claims">middle son, born in 1981, but he&#39;s somewhat <em>effeminate</em> and unfit for leadership</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un">Kim Jong Un, never was an astute student, overall indifferent to politics</a>, and with an overt admiration of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnSJVASO8mE"><em>Western lifestyle and icons</em></a>, make him an even less prolific, reliable, and predictable character in N. Korea&#39;s already troublesome government. </p>

<p>The maintnence of N. Korea&#39;s regime is paramount to its military hierarchy and overall status quo enjoyed by the higher echelons, and even comparable to Soviet Union&#39;s &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union#Membership"><em>luxuries</em> had by Party Members in comparison to general civilians</a>.</p>

<p>So there is a clash between higher Military echelons, Chinese interest in holding N. Korea as a <em>buffer zone</em> against S. Korea, and Kim Jong Un himself holding a role never meant for him, possibly being advised by someone close to his father, but who has his own agenda.</p>

<p>The situation might just be used by Kim Jong Un to conduct a purge eliminating all opposing forces inside the Party and establishing him as the undisputed <em>ruler</em> of the almighty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songun">Sogun Korea</a>.</p>
