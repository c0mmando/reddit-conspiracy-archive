       I am on a mission to figure out what it is that gets through to people, as I am very committed to waking people up in an attempt to change things before it's too late and I was hoping you guys could contribute by telling your stories. Tell about what it was that first got you to question things, how you've gone about it from there, or whatever you want. Have an interesting story about how you 'woke up'? I want to hear it! Thanks!

       I realized how the gubbermont was implanting tiny RFID chips in vaccines so they could activate them and turn me into a zombie.

      <p>
       Nah, I'm kidding. I actually realized how polio and smallpox are just gubbermont scams to make us take vaccines which cause autism.

       I woke up with my morning glory being gently caressed by my gf, switched on Fox News and realised Bill O'Reiley does not get any. I have since learnt not to take news as fact from people who are so blatantly starved of the vulvic pleasure.

       It clicked for me with the Patriot Act. I don't know exactly what did it for me, but on 9-11 I remember wondering if the government saw it coming but didn't stop it because they needed an excuse to go to war. I was being mocked (in high school) for not supporting the Patriot Act, which scared the crap out of me, and I thought that maybe wars would just be incidental and that the Patriot Act and other neofascist legislation were what 9-11 was all about. That's about when I started seriously questioning things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I also learned at a young age to push my teachers' buttons to get what I wanted. I was a really manipulative little brat, but I suppose it helped me realize early on when people were trying to manipulate me. And I grew up mostly without a TV, which I'm thankful for.

       Year was 2005, been at a new job for a few months and almost by accident someone mentioned some documentary called "In Plane Site", and that it had something to do with 9/11 - I had no idea what I was getting my self into.  I thought it was just going to be going over the events of that day, maybe show a some new footage; damn, was I wrong.  Everything just sort of clicked right there and then...

       I would like to say that i thoroughly enjoy conspiracydocumentaries.com and that there is much i have learned thanks to that site.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regard to burning DVDs i have had this thought reoccur periodically in my brain ever since i first saw zeitgeist addendum a few years ago, although i for a couple reasons never got around to it. Mostly because im antisocial and would never hand them out myself, and partly because i dont think people would feel safe putting a burned dvd into their computer. Ive considered just leaving some somewhere (say by the library at my college with a sign and a stack of DVDs) but always figured theyd get snatched by campus security before very many would get picked up.

       September 11th 2001. I don't know what happened, but as I watched all of the news footage something felt wrong. I started questioning everything about it. I then started getting interested in the conflicts in the Middle East and began questioning the real reason we were there.

       The truth is that that the majority of people on this subreddit are somewhere along a varying spectrum of craziness. They think you're crazy because you believe in a conspiracy they don't, so they downvote you. They fail to realize that most people view their crazy the way they view your crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I don't really believe in any true conspiracy theory, but I think UFOs are a lot more plausible than the jewminati. So if it makes you feel better, I think you're less crazy than your down voters probably are.

       It would make sense not to downvote what you disagree with, but people are too eager to get their version of events out, and go to lengths to put down "disinfo shills".

      <p>
       This sub isn't really for all theories or opinions. In fact, the best way I could describe it is as a giant echo chamber. You come in already with some prejudices and opinions you want confirmed, and if you got these opinions from the same BS sources as everyone else here, it gets repeated and regurgitated as if it were the holy gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you truly want your opinions challenged and would like to enlighten yourself with new perspectives, I would stop using this sub.

       I'd have to go back at least as far as the controversy over the Warren Commission Report for my first inklings of conspiracies. A reading of Irwin Schiff's
       <em>
        The Great Income Tax Hoax
       </em>
       in about 1986 is what really got me going though.

       It was a mix of things for me, my life had been involved with news and the entertainment industry, as well as researching my genealogy I came across odd findings. Then watching loose change an my own independent research. Started finding the truth in entertainment industry, war, religion etc. bout 3 years ago

       Lived on an Indian reservation, hearing stories passed down, as well as knowing some of my immediate family having some secrets to hide. I will say from just my experience, we as conspiracy theorists are on to some big findings soon, I'm currently researching religions and demonology and paganistic rituals, a lot big people are down with some dark shit, but hide it exceedingly well.

       I've looked at both sides of the 9/11 conspiracies for years. It wasn't until I saw this that my stomach dropped, felt sick, and a day or two later realized that I was in denial. It was the first time in my life I realized what true denial was.

       The original uploaded by Pilots For 9/11 Truth has been removed by youtube. The full video, which I've had trouble finding, has the ACARS data released by NORAD that shows a wargames plane crossing paths with flight 175 over Pennsylvania. It appears that the war games plane continues to New York while flight 175 pings it's way across Pennsylvania over the ACARS and radar systems eventually being joined by an escort continuing west while going off radar.

       Short of that, I've always enjoyed reading and analyzing conspiracies, UFOs, blackops, etc.

       I read the book "Natural Cures They Don't Want You to Know About" in middle school. I feel like I always thought something was wrong in the world and with society. In high school I tried to tell some classmates about 9/11 and how it was an inside job and everyone called me crazy. I'm not a complete loner now, but my friends today understand that I'm a truth seeker and I'm not that interested in being an everyday consumerist that watches tv. Idk, that's just the beginning of it

       I don't know what kind of witch doctors you go to, but if it wasn't for modern medical science, I would be dead, so would my daughter and my son wold be blind. Do me a favor, OK? If you ever get sick, by no means go to any type of licensed medical professional. I'm sure you can find some shaman to wave some smoking sage around your head and that should clear everything right up. Idiotic troglodyte fuck.

       I read the book "All the Shah's Men", the story of the CIA taking down Iran in the fifties. Also, the book "Confessions of an Economic Hitman" which solidifies the facts that corporations and few elite are controlling world events.  Highly recommended books.  Oh yeah, 9/11, without even watching any documentaries on it, it's obvious there was controlled demolition.

       Explain to me what's so obvious about. Clearly my knowledge of structural engineering and explosives is lacking, because to me, "giant fucking passenger jet filled with explosive fuel traveling several hundred miles per hours exploding into one of the tallest buildings on the planet" was sufficient explanation. I'm probably just blind/a sheeple/a shill/haven't gone down the red rabbit pill hole yet.

       But, but, but... there's this guy, with a YouTube channel, and then there's this other guy too with a blog and they both agree this was a controlled demolition!! I mean, neither of them is an engineer, or has access to any kind of testing equipment, or any access to the scene or any of the material from the attack. But he DOES have some really blurry, grainy surveillance camera stills and eye witness accounts from every hobo on the streets in a 5 mile radius of ground zero so IT MUST BE TRUE!!

       Have you heard of WTC 7?  No plane crashed into it, no jet fuel that caused the fires inside yet it falls just like the twin towers.  If that isn't obvious enough then you're truly blind. Did you just watch Fox News and CNN to get all of your information on that day?  Why don't you ask a structural engineer and see what they say?

      <p>
       Do you really think there's a good chance that if I ask any given structural engineer, they'll probably corroborate that 9/11 was an inside job? Do you think most of them believe that? The link I gave you refers to a report from the Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers which investigates the collapse and concludes it was caused primarily by fires.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, if it was an inside job, why would they make such a transparent mistake? You think they're capable of covering up the biggest conspiracy in history that must have implicated thousands of people, none of whom spoke out, none of whom were caught by security, demolition, or engineering experts after the fact, but you think they thought no one would notice a skyscraper falling down? Why wouldn't they just get another plane and fly it into it for good measure? Hell, why even destroy it at all? 2 sky scrapers and thousands of deaths not enough to gain public support for invading the Middle East, or whatever the alleged motives are?

       Never in history has a building ever collapsed from a fire.  When the buildings collapsed, they fell at near free fall speed. You think that a fire burning only on a section of the building will make it collapse in such a way?  If the structural integrity at the base of the towers were not damaged in any way (which it couldn't have been because only the airplanes hit the tower, right?) how does it suddenly collapse at near free fall speeds?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of people (civilians, firefighters, policeman) who were there on that day that spoke out to the news saying they heard and felt explosions while in the buildings, from the basement floor on up.  All these testimonies that were recorded on that day was only shown on that day and never again.  Don't you think eye witness testimony minutes and hours after the event occurred is more reliable than what's put on on the report of the collapse by people who weren't there?  Of course you have no idea because you only see what is put on the mainstream media, plus you're not American so you probably have no idea of how the media works.  Can't blame you because most Americans don't either.

       I presume now that  Waco was a test of the power of mainstream media to excuse government acts that otherwise would have been very shocking.

       Waco taught that the government can even  use military force against innocent American  children and have no repercussions if the population is sufficiently propagandized.

       The propaganda poisoning the atmosphere about the Davidians (and they were very well chosen for this test) was extremely clear if you had forewarning.

       That the government was going to kill an entire church full of people right in front of everyone to see if they could get away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did the heinous act of attacking and killing innocent American   children  at  nearly point blank range   with military tanks. and got away with it by news media manipulation. It was easy to  see the manipulation since I had been told it would be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       People were conditioned to scream for action against them. They did as they were manipulated to do. The first thing done at the Davidian's property was the dogs were all shot and the police presence was done in such a way as to panic those inside into acting brashly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It worked like a dream for the government and the banking sector which wants almost total control now.. If anyone reading this wants to know the theory the government goes by to manipulate people, see the ideology  and influence of Edward Bernays.

       Absolutely was 9/11. I was in elementary school when it happened. It took only a couple days for what happened to sink in. I didn't realize how deeply Israel was involved until a few years ago. Once I started looking at who was connected to who, the picture became rather clear.
