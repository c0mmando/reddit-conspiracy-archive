       Had a good semi discussion with someone the other day about what it means. I think it's different for everyone, in the same way that theism is. They can be very abrasive over there, and I'm not as militant about things precisely because I'm not 15 anymore. That being said, what you see when you walk in there is a bunch of people feeling validated for maybe the first time, feeling as if they are a major group. It's hard to be ostracized in a society that constantly tells you you're not being treated differently. I would imagine many people in this subreddit feel the same at times. That's why I don't get too bent out of shape when the worst members call me a sheep (y'all really need a new metaphor ;)).

       Examine the fact that you are using a song from an artist being funded/sponsored by corporations as an inspiring soundtrack to your passive-aggressive rebellion, and allow it to help you realize exactly how impressionable you are. Now, compare that to how easily your peers are manipulated with nationalism and ignorant submissiveness, and call their attention to it. Make them think and question themselves, not merely react and marginalize you. Show them there is more than what they see instead of looking down on them because they can't yet. Someone has to show them, why not you?

       Teacher here in U.S.  I really hate the whole pledge thing.  And in my state they have to do the state pledge as well.  I'm patriotic but I believe making students do it everyday is making the whole act meaningless and pointless.  I never make an issue about if someone is doing the pledge or not as long as they aren't disrupting it.

       An interesting fact about the pledge of allegiance is that the original version did not contain "and to the United States of America" part. It was originally "I pledge allegiance to my flag and the republic for which it stands, one nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."

       Interesting...thanks for the info.  I knew about the "under God" portion being added in the 50's.  Texas also, added "under God" recently.

       I really do believe there is a place for a pledge.  But I think too many people basically worship the idea of the pledge.  As a result it becomes as meaningless as some religions for some people.

       I think having your earbuds in maybe watered down your point a bit. Instead of looking like you were purposely avoiding the ceremony the ear buds put across that you maybe you weren't even paying attention. The statement you made was more about your preference in music than your opposition to the anthem.

       I think he's trying to emphasize/accentuate his lack of participation. Yo OP! Just drop the earphones, and sit motionless, and you've got yourself a potent statement! Check out other activists around the world. Google Occupy, Anonymous, The Zeitgeist Movement; 3 angles of attack, on the same problem, which I advocate.

       That's very wrong that the French version would say something different than the English one.

       Alright so before I begin, I would like to say OP IS A FAG. I go to school with OP and he is complete fuck. First of all he is a pathological liar and an egomaniac narcissist. He did sit for the national anthem but he was not sent to the office, and is not the small time rebellion you all think he is. He is going through a Tyler the creator phase and thinks he's a fucking God. Please downvote post to shrink this faggot liar 'sego.

       When you get older you'll find that the things you stood up for were results of simple rebellious attitude. Practice humility and respect and you'll find yourself at peace with the world and most importantly yourself. It's interesting how time and age brings wisdom.

       ..or the illusion of it. =P
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying you're wrong, just saying that's one thing I realized as I grew up. As a kid, I totally believed older=wiser as a rule, but as I got older the line between age and wisdom faded and I realize it was an illusion to begin with. Time doesn't impart wisdom anyway, experience does.

       I think that last bit is important. If you spend your life hiding from the world in your grey-beige cubicle, you won't be any wiser than a 14-year-old kid. Experience is everything.

       Well, yes and no. Two people can have similar experience and come out with completely opposing perspectives towards said experience. It's all really relative to the individual, subjective vs objectiveness. Open mindedness is key. Typically, or rather traditionally, the older a person is the more likely they will be 'set in their beliefs' while the youth are much more malleable. I'm just ranting, ill shut up now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two semi-relevant quotes come to mind, though I have no idea who to credit for either one... "Losing an illusion makes one wiser than finding a truth.'' and ''The empty bucket makes the loudest noise."

       yeah, I'm going to have to disagree. I think if you don't agree with aspects of your government one of the first steps is to not pledge your allegiance to it. allegiance should be conditional at best, not soullessly pledged, or in the canucks case sang daily

       Yeah but not standing up to acknowledge the national anthem in your twelth grade class is hardly an effective way to make a stand against your Government and seems more like  a way to gain respect from similarly minded peers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, not singing the anthem does not exactly revoke your pledge of allegiance (I am not sure it even counts as a real pledge of allegiance), especially if you have been singing for the past ten years with no problems.

       I can admire the mindset and encourage it but this seems a little circlejerky.

       I did the same thing when I was your age.  The next year was after 911 and I had a jacket I made with the towers that said remember the truth.  And upside down american was below it symbolizing America in distress.  While I recieved harassment all day and certain teachers stood up for me at the end up the day I was told I could never come back if I chose to continue wearing the jacket. 
I stopped wearing it.

       I first sat during the pledge in 4th grade, because my older brother told me they couldn't make me stand and pledge, my teacher grabbed me by the ear and drug me to the principles office. it fucking hurt and was humiliating, he like knocked over desks to come at me. dude was enraged. I was sent back to class as soon as I got to the office, because I had every right to refuse to pledge. I don't think I ever pledged my allegiance again.

       Good job standing up for your beliefs! Me and 4 of my friends did this our senior year at an assembly. It was right after 9/11 and we sat in protest. We got a lot a guff, they said it was illegal but we for some reason we never got into trouble for it.

       OK... first off, it's clear you're a little kid. I also love Tyler, The Creator. I love him enough where I went and bought his new album that came out yesterday and gave him my money. However, that part didn't need to make it in the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       See, what you were doing was being a disrespectful shit head. Not that you don't have the right to be, but you weren't doing it to stand up to something you believe in, or because you were just tired. You specifically didn't do it cuz you wanted to piss off your teacher and mak a scene to look like the "smart kid who wont conform or be brainwashed." There's times I didn't stand for the anthem too. However I didn't have my headphones in, I was asleep at my desk. My teachers would care sometimes, but I didn't disrespect them. I love my country. However, I don't need to stand for a shitty song to "prove it."
      </p>

       I remember being your age. I too thought I was a badass. Also, no one came up to you and said they will join you. All they did was call you a moron.

       Support your country not your politicians.  Canada is a great place to live and you bash it just because you take some lyrics literally.  TtC says don't take his songs literally so why are you taking this one?  If you did,  are world would have no order. 'fuck pigs, fuck guards,  all some fuckin retards.'  is any better? If he wasn't a moron  he would have used the word idiots

       Actually at the rodeo when I was a little kid my parents made me walk around with them all over the outside part then walk up the astrodome having to stop and stand for awhile every few feet. We finally reached the level we were headed to and i couldn't stand anymore so i sat down. Everyone got pissed off at me because the national anthem was playing. I was just tired =(

       I'm Canadian and agree that standing up to an anthem you might not even identify with is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       One time, my ESL (basic english) teacher was standing on the hallway while the anthem played.. This random guy was walking around the hallway with a hat on when she spotted him. She brought him into the class and started YELLING LIKE CRAZY about his hat, and his lack of respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       After 4-5 minutes of yelling and him being quiet (she yelled at him thru the entire anthem) he spoke korean and a girl translated that he didn't understand english, he had landed in canada the day before.

       Its good to live in a country to doesn't kill you or your family for sitting down for your beliefs.  Thousands of good young men and women have died to ensure you have the opportunity.  That song, as most national anthems, commemorates their sacrifice-i am sure they would do it all over again to protect you right to express yourself. TWD

       Props on standing up for what you believe in. I had to endure the same thing while in school.

       I do think it is disrespectful to listen to music while this is going on though. It's one thing to refuse to stand and recite government propaganda but there needs to be SOME level of respect shown.

       I did this same thing in High School; they sent home a school-wide letter about it to every student's parents. Still didn't get me to stand up for the "pledge of allegiance" though. Fucking drug-riddled dens of mediocrity.

       apparently you don't know how to read, or are just too lazy to realize that most of these comments are calling OP out for making this story up, or, if he is telling the truth, for being a disrespectful attention seeking shithead of a child.

       what's funny is that since you have this model of what a "conspiracy theorist" is in your head (a gullible ignorant "retard") that even though we're doing THE EXACT OPPOSITE of what you're saying we're doing, in your mind you still see the reactions you want to see.
