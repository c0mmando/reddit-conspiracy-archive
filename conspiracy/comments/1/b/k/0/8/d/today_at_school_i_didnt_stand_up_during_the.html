    <div class="md"><p>Had a good semi discussion with someone the other day about what it means. I think it&#39;s different for everyone, in the same way that theism is. They can be very abrasive over there, and I&#39;m not as militant about things precisely because I&#39;m not 15 anymore. That being said, what you see when you walk in there is a bunch of people feeling validated for maybe the first time, feeling as if they are a major group. It&#39;s hard to be ostracized in a society that constantly tells you you&#39;re not being treated differently. I would imagine many people in this subreddit feel the same at times. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t get too bent out of shape when the worst members call me a sheep (y&#39;all really need a new metaphor ;)).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Examine the fact that you are using a song from an artist being funded/sponsored by corporations as an inspiring soundtrack to your passive-aggressive rebellion, and allow it to help you realize exactly how impressionable you are. Now, compare that to how easily your peers are manipulated with nationalism and ignorant submissiveness, and call their attention to it. Make them think and question themselves, not merely react and marginalize you. Show them there is more than what they see instead of looking down on them because they can&#39;t yet. Someone has to show them, why not you?</p>

<p>..or the illusion of it. =P</p>

<p>Not saying you&#39;re wrong, just saying that&#39;s one thing I realized as I grew up. As a kid, I totally believed older=wiser as a rule, but as I got older the line between age and wisdom faded and I realize it was an illusion to begin with. Time doesn&#39;t impart wisdom anyway, experience does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yes and no. Two people can have similar experience and come out with completely opposing perspectives towards said experience. It&#39;s all really relative to the individual, subjective vs objectiveness. Open mindedness is key. Typically, or rather traditionally, the older a person is the more likely they will be &#39;set in their beliefs&#39; while the youth are much more malleable. I&#39;m just ranting, ill shut up now. </p>

<p>Two semi-relevant quotes come to mind, though I have no idea who to credit for either one... &quot;Losing an illusion makes one wiser than finding a truth.&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;The empty bucket makes the loudest noise.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK... first off, it&#39;s clear you&#39;re a little kid. I also love Tyler, The Creator. I love him enough where I went and bought his new album that came out yesterday and gave him my money. However, that part didn&#39;t need to make it in the story.</p>

<p>See, what you were doing was being a disrespectful shit head. Not that you don&#39;t have the right to be, but you weren&#39;t doing it to stand up to something you believe in, or because you were just tired. You specifically didn&#39;t do it cuz you wanted to piss off your teacher and mak a scene to look like the &quot;smart kid who wont conform or be brainwashed.&quot; There&#39;s times I didn&#39;t stand for the anthem too. However I didn&#39;t have my headphones in, I was asleep at my desk. My teachers would care sometimes, but I didn&#39;t disrespect them. I love my country. However, I don&#39;t need to stand for a shitty song to &quot;prove it.&quot;</p>

<p>I remember being your age. I too thought I was a badass. Also, no one came up to you and said they will join you. All they did was call you a moron.</p>

<p>One time, my ESL (basic english) teacher was standing on the hallway while the anthem played.. This random guy was walking around the hallway with a hat on when she spotted him. She brought him into the class and started YELLING LIKE CRAZY about his hat, and his lack of respect.</p>

<p>After 4-5 minutes of yelling and him being quiet (she yelled at him thru the entire anthem) he spoke korean and a girl translated that he didn&#39;t understand english, he had landed in canada the day before.</p>

<p>c. is most important of all</p>

<p>adults condoning the subtle brainwashing of children they should be awake and aware enough to protect.</p>

<p>TELL EVERYONE NOT REMAINING SEATED WITH YOU THAT THEY ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN THE NORTH KOREAN CHILDREN FORCED TO BEGIN &quot;PLEDGING ALLEGIANCE&quot; TO THE FLAG AND SINGING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM TO &quot;SUPPORT THEIR TROOPS&quot; AT A YOUNG AGE IN SCHOOL BEFORE THEY ARE ABLE TO THINK CRITICALLY OR FORM OPPOSING OPINIONS FROM KIM JUNG EUN&#39;S. Tell them to enjoy being dumb slaves, enjoy paying the government for the PRIVILEGE to use YOUR OWN LABOR/LIFE/EFFORTS to LIVE, it&#39;s called taxation, enjoy paying for the western imperial aggression in the middle east, enjoy directly financing(via taxation) murder.</p>

<p>I did this same thing in High School; they sent home a school-wide letter about it to every student&#39;s parents. Still didn&#39;t get me to stand up for the &quot;pledge of allegiance&quot; though. Fucking drug-riddled dens of mediocrity.</p>
