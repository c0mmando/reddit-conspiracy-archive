       Really?  Seems to me that most people feel their leaders suck fucking
       <em>
        balls
       </em>
       but many simply don't feel there's really all that much they can do about it because the system is
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       stacked against the effort, so they just end up saying "Fuck it." and just try to make sure that there's enough gruel on the table to make it to the next day.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least that's how I feel.

       This is mere anecdata, but I personally know
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       few people who voted "for" either Obama or Romney in the sense of actually thinking they were a good or desirable choice.  I do know quite a few people who figured one of them was a bigger monster and cast a vote for the other as the only way they could think of to avoid having that bigger monster in the White House.  I don't know anyone with the resources to participate in a real revolution and continue to keep their family fed and sheltered at the same time, and most people I encounter are too busy and exhausted trying to survive today to think very hard about tomorrow.

       Well, that's actually incorrect.  Strength in numbers
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       actually work.  It's just that we as a human population have never actually DONE it.  We're kept so separated and at odds with one another that the best we've ever been able to do is organize a limited, barely-together mob uprising here and there, and there seems practically no way that we as a human population will all rise up
       <em>
        together
       </em>
       as ONE and challenge TPTB - which is what we would need to do to topple them/it.  If we were to do that, however? it would be Game Over for TPTB
       <em>
        easily
       </em>
       .  Unfortunately, I'm not sure that they have really all that much to worry about in terms of having all the plebs globally rise up together against them.

      <p>
       All of this is indubitably true so long as we allow ourselves to remain separated as we do.  Yes, unfortunately.  I wish we could all but rise up together...but we are sheep - or we at least certainly act like sheep - and sheep don't know how to do much but follow masters.

       If every human rose at once, it may work, however at this point there are so many systems in place specifically to keep it from happening. Despite our interconnectedness, it has in many ways never been harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about any revolution in history, now imagine how it would play out in the west today. First the people are bathing in propaganda, so getting word out is hard. Second, even when word does get out, all communication channels are monitored. Third, the ringleaders would be arrested on "suspicion" of "terrorism", long before the first shots were fired. Fourth, the "freedom fighters" would be relabelled as " domestic terrorists", kidnapped, tortured and disappeared. Fifth, any actual battle would be hopelessly one sided, even if "the people" got their hands on machine guns and rpgs, it'd be like a militia vs terminators. Finally the entire revolution would be subsumed by popular culture, white washed and sold back to us as a line of edgy teen fashion .
      </p>
      <p>
       Never before have the ruling powers had such omniscience and omnipresence, never before have psychological operations primed and controlled entire populaces, never before has the technological gap been so large between the rulers and the ruled. Never before has any cultural empire stretched as far as the one we now live under. Just think about this: there are several times more US military bases on earth than there are countries.

       This is certainly as I would picture it as well, but I'm not convinced the militia couldn't still win.  I'm not convinced that Goliath would win ten out of ten times.  I'd personally rather fight with even a minimal chance at success than to not even try and have a 100% chance of enslavement.  However, I do not disagree with your overall assessment.  You are, unfortunately, very much correct, it seems, and you paint a picture that, while very hopeless, also seems rather accurate indeed.

       I have a feeling this is a pretty old quote, back when more people believed that those in power were working in their favor, however I'm fairly certain there are still tens of millions, if not over a hundred million americans who still believe people like Barack Obama actually care about them and are 'just and fair'.

       <em>
        never EVER
       </em>
       trusted the government - even when I was a grade school-aged child.  I just felt it

       and intuitively (somehow) that the shit was wrong and bad.

       It's just mind-bogglingly crazy to me that anybody ever trusted Obama in the first place let alone NOW.  Hell my sister has one of those stupid ass Obama stickers on her damn car and I literally cringe every time I see it.

       You're definitely an exception then. I can't have one conversation with parents or relatives or even my SO without them dropping the "uh oh here comes the conspiracy theories! You know he's just doing his best with a bad situation" lines. It's absolutely infuriating. There's very little that makes it past their delusions and into their mind, where it might have a chance of triggering some critical thought.

       couldn't agree more.. I don't even try anymore, the wall is too thick. at this point, sometimes I kind of wish I didn't know or have any critical thinking skills. it must be nice to live in dreamland all the time.. and believing everything is going to be okay, but we've all gotta pay the price for our actions at some point.

       Yeah.  It's really unfortunate actually because my SO is now definitely more in tuned to the the b.s. that's going on globally, but that's only and I do mean ONLY because of me and my constantly giving her example after example of how fucked up shit is and then having to have a half hour to an hour

       Well of course you no doubt heard that Hawaiians want their Kingdom back. However there a at least a dozen groups that have their own political ideology. Some very radical whereas if you are not at least 50% Hawaiian you will be entitled toward no rights.

       Since I'm only 1/8th, and don't qualify for hardly jack in many Hawaiian benefits etc... I don't share that pov or even the current Office of Hawaiian Affairs position. Hawaii has to include all born on the island be it Japanese, Chinese, Anglo, Filipino, Samoan etc... or it won't work. Way too much immigration and births of generations since historically like my wife of 3rd generation Japanese. She is just as local as most native Hawaiians. There would be civil war if such denial were to unfold. Hawaiians of 1/4 blood only encompass less than 20 percent and pure Hawaiian is very rare now.

       I know at least there are a dozen guys who claim right to the monarchy from my association with them alone. Put a little booze in them and they all make that claim and know how to make a better Hawaii. Sheesh!

       If it had to go alone other than tourism, and renting out pearl Harbor. Without federal funding. pretty much we would be like Haiti. Most Hawaiians don't have a clue to economics, and many here in political positions are just as corrupt as those fucking bankers, lawyers, politicians etc.. that are in US power now. The old kingdom before was just like that with it's territorial control and taxation by Ali'i's (chiefs) and Kahuna's (priests) working over the common native. No different and the only thing that changed was someone overthrowing them for land, money and power.

       Even if the USA were to fall apart. Either the Western part or another country would eye Hawaii as a frontline base. It's way to strategic for shipping and military protection and jump point. That's why Hawaii was annexed to begin with. Once the military saw Pearl Harbor that was it. USS Maine to start the Spanish American war was a false flag to get naval bases in the Caribbean and Pacific.
