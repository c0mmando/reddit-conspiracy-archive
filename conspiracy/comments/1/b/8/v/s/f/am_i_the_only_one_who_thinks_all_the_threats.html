       Yes, in a whole subreddit filled with people who see sinister machinations behind any and all events in the world, no matter how small, you are definitely the only one who thinks something as potentially major as North Korean saber rattling is part of some larger conspiracy.

       are there not sinister undertones to every single aspect of life, even within our limited sensory bandwidth of perception? identifying to what degree is another question. another question is of the purpose that these shades of undertones colour life + reality, and to what resolution can we unify understandings towards more holistic/fractal ideas----&gt; that others fail to recognize as anything more than 'conspiracy theories'.

       In every single article it never links to a source or a news article from KNCA. They always just say KNCA said or anonymous South Korean official says. Everyone seems to think North Korea is the only one capable of propaganda, but no questions everything that North Korea is supposedly saying which is coming through a middle man with no direct links to sources.

       Can you think of examples in which we have accomplished our goal through trade instead of sanctions? I always feel think is the better way, but haven't had the chance to research examples (solid data anyway).

       How? I can recall U.S. And U.N. specifically don't want them to test nukes. And what does N.K. do? Test nukes so then how else should they be punished without going into a conflict?

       No. This is more a reaction on the part of NK to increased sanctions by the US and a recognition on the part of China that NK is not that valuable to China.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NK government needs to entertain its citizens with the boogie man that is trying to kill them! The evil US! (some truth to it. If NK had gas for its tractors, the people would have more food and less famine.)
      </p>

       So, the conspiracy is on the part of NK, not the US.

       Not sure about that, but it's definitely being purposely overplayed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I popped on r/WorldNews last night, and there were 4 posts about NK on the front page - 2 of them were posted by accounts less than 5 days old and that was the only thing they'd posted. IIRC another was an older account that had posted nothing
       <em>

       NK 'news' for months, but don't quote me on that one.

       The thing that gets under my skin about the recent threats from N.Korea is the fact that no media outlet will touch the fact the US was doing Naval exercises off the coast of the North last month.

       Exactly. I'm sure you would be annoyed if the army were to show up and practice next to your house. Thing is, they don't want to tell that because that would tarnish the USA's reputation. Another point is that if the citizens knew this, and a war did break out, who would get some of the blame for it? You know who.

       Eh. Iran never threatened yet theyve been "on the brink of wmds" for 33 years. NK has openly threatened the US for who knows how long yet there havent even been public statements regarding it so either a) the us knows no one is stupid enough to attack us (which brings in the question why cia trained operatives in the middle east with little motive would enact 9/11) B) NK is full of shit C) there is some colluding/problem reaction solution going on. Or a combination.

       A big belief is that NK is collapsing, that Kim Jong Un is losing power and is mainly being controlled by the Generals left by Kim Jong Il, and that the US is waiting for NK to collapse. If NK attacks and america attacks back it will IMMEDIATELY get aid from whomever is willing to support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       NK is attempting to draw the US (along with the US probably wanting to go in anyway) to get more aid and then go from there.

       North Korea, unlike the middle east, doesn't mean much to the US. It is a throwback to the previous geopolitical paradigm between 1st World and the now defunct (bar NK) 2nd World.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason it warrants any media focus is because the cold war of old wasn't that long ago in the grand scheme of things, and therefore there will always be a relatively high level of interest. Also there was revived interest in NK under Bush - in the process of justifying aggressive foreign policy in the middle east, his Axis of Evil speech involved naming every shady country with a history of not approving the American flag within a 100 mile radius of their borders (metaphorically speaking... maybe?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, North Korea are traditional Chinese allies - so again these stories feed into the 'Chinese vs US diplomatic hostilities' discourse.

       The Dennis Rodman NK Story brings in the TMZ type news viewer and brings NK into more of a watercooler, FM Drive Time Show conversation  ultimately bringing more people's attention to NK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have the saber rattling from NK and they have more people's attention so they can profit from the marketing, selling, packaging and advertising around the "fear".
      </p>
      <p>
       We have the news reporting on FB and how people changing their avatars to promote marriage equality.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really about national attention and keeping that attention focused on something other than the cash grab in Cypress, the US involvement in Syria as we prepare the way to invade Iran at the request of our owners.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the world runs on greed, war and the blood being shed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       See it for what it is.  Understand that the media is there to profit off of your attention.  The watch dog media is there to protect its owners not the freedom of the viewer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step back from the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn to live outside of the banking system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Live abundantly learning to do more with less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love your friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Know that anyone or any institution that seeks to divide humanity is working to keep the money and blood flowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Choose to not be a part in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enjoy nature.  That is the real beauty of the world.  See your connectivity in all of this and then loop back in and see how your TV, your laptop, your phone is yet another trap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Limit your exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fear is a choice.  If you're not buying it then don't watch the outlets that sell it.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no death.  Money is the root of all evil. We are all one. Love thy neighbor. Be the change you want to see in the world.

       I would fucking love to see what China has to say about that. If push came to shove and America and China engaged in land warfare, then they would do what they did in the fifties, flood the place with troops and push us off. Got very close to doing it the first time. Downvote me all you want but, at the end of the day, Iraq used to be one of our allies as well, Donald Rumsfeld, 1983, "We would never let Iran just roll in and take control, Iraq is a sovereign nation".

       do which ever I chose sir. I think you are looking for Shouldn't and you are correct, I shouldn't. I was mixing up my democracies and my dictatorships, wot a wanker aye? Just, please, for my sake, don't forget where Saddam got those weapons in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The know-how and material for developing chemical weapons were obtained by Saddam's regime from foreign firms.[22] The largest suppliers of precursors for chemical weapons production were in Singapore (4,515 tons), the Netherlands (4,261 tons), Egypt (2,400 tons), India (2,343 tons), and West Germany (1,027 tons). One Indian company, Exomet Plastics (now part of EPC Industrie Ltd.) sent 2,292 tons of precursor chemicals to Iraq. The Kim Al-Khaleej firm, located in Singapore and affiliated to United Arab Emirates, supplied more than 4,500 tons of VX, sarin, and mustard gas precursors and production equipment to Iraq.[23]
      </p>
      <p>
       "The provision of chemical precursors from United States companies to Iraq was enabled by a Ronald Reagan administration policy that removed Iraq from the State Department's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. Leaked portions of Iraq's "Full, Final and Complete" disclosure of the sources for its weapons programs shows that thiodiglycol, a substance needed to manufacture mustard gas, was among the chemical precursors provided to Iraq from US companies such as Alcolac International and Phillips. Both companies have since undergone reorganization and Phillips, once a subsidiary of Phillips Petroleum is now part of ConocoPhillips, an American oil and discount fossil fuel company, while Alcolac International has since dissolved and reformed as Alcolac Inc.[24] Alcolac was named as a defendant in the Aziz v. Iraq case presently pending in the United States District Court (Case No. 1:09-cv-00869-MJG).[citation needed]"

       With friends like these, who needs enemies? And he was a fuckhead to the Kuwaitis, not the Americans. All I am trying to illustrate is that someone you believe to be ally today could be tomorrows boogieman. You are probably right though, SK is pretty fucking inoffensive and the only reason they still exist is because of America, Britain, Aust and New Zealand. No resources though, if America gets too overstretched elsewhere, then SK becomes China's penis. Here's an upvote for the pleasant conversation.

       Maybe not a distraction, but a set up to a NK FF.  TPTB here keep painting NK as these dangerous militant extremists.  Perhaps they're just Al Qaeda 2.0; the "next wave of terrorism!"

       It's all threats and posturing until someone loses an eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is to say, it's posturing until it becomes real. Nobody knows when it's going to become real. I do agree, it appears the US media and government have chosen to spend some time talking about North Korea lately, which in itself means nothing. But the dwarf who runs NK might decide to send one of his suicide squads to attack Hollywood at any time. Who knows? He might decide to kidnap Justin Bieber. That's the sort of thing his father used to do regularly. He might decide to declare that his horse is a god. Not an easy dwarf to predict, is what I'm saying.

       North Korea have always been so secretive about everything. NK's army isn't as big or as bold as it used to be. Did you see that recent photo with Kim Jung sitting at a military computer with a logitec mouse (one of them ones that cost like $5)? If there was a war, USA would win because they simply have a bigger army and more man power behind it. If NK uses nuclear missiles though...

       On a side note, I don't think anybody would miss JB being kidnapped.
