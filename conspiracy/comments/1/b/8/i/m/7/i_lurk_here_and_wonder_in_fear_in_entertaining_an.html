<p>How do you know what information you have is necessarily, the indisputable actual evidence of what had happened in an event or correlation?</p>

<p>How do you come to a conclusion?</p>

<p>I am just curious, because <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is kind of a place that helps to mentally masturbate myself.. yet, I don&#39;t fully believe it because it seems so absurd/scary like I would have to even hide or want to post this in fear of an unforeseen retribution that threatened an agenda..  Can someone please enlighten me?</p>

<p>I am not trying to sound degrading or too skeptical.. but I want to know your guys&#39;s opinions. </p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>TL;DR - How do I make sure and fully believe what you guys (or anyone for that matter) is saying? </p>

<p>You develop a set of skills. Scientific principles, methods of reasoning and furthermore human psychology. These skills help you to assess to what degree you &#39;believe&#39; certain theories (apart from perhaps elements of what we call spirituality or the new age movement, only your intuition is really of help here as society has not developed scientific theory to a point where we are capable of having a rational discussion within the community on these topics). </p>

<p>At a point you will start to develop theories of your own.However, always keep in mind that the skills you have learned can be flawed. Particularly in human psychology. We are all crazy bastards that words fail to describe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most conspiracy theorists aren&#39;t really about what are the facts or what is the absolute truth or a specific theory.</p>

<p>Most likely its the actual opposite, we are skeptical of the official story and the government, we discover strange anomalies,faulty logic and evidence that contradict it.</p>

<p>Most of the conspiracies you see are rationalizations in a world were the <strong>LIE</strong> is just that big and as such the whole world view.</p>

<p>You might consider lizardmen as a silly conspiracy full of nutjobs until you realize the extent of the <strong>lie</strong> to get to rationalization of lizardmen is the way to make the work make sense to them.</p>

<p>The rabbit hole is deep and fundamental with the essence and rules of the universe beyond what current science,modern thinking and even occult groups have manged to fathom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you can start by learning <a href="http://www.logicalfallacies.info/">logical fallacies</a>. The more you learn about them, the easier they are to recognize when they are presented to you. i&#39;m assuming most people are in r/conspiracy because they are skeptical, not because they believe whatever they here. most people that believe in conspiracy theories started off by finding an event that didn&#39;t add up for them (9/11, Federal Reserve Banking, JFK assassination, Roswell, Iran/Contra...) the more they looked into it, the more research they did, the more they realized the official explanation  was not the entire truth. this can be the &quot;rabbit hole&quot; moment, when a person comes to the conclusion that the world is not what they thought it was. they feel lied to and manipulated, maybe they feel like a slave or a fool. but after that moment, they are skeptical of official stories and more aware of propaganda and agendas. keep in mind, that some people believe in some crazy shit. the trick is to keep an open mind, but stay skeptical until you have enough information to draw your own logical conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always say, &quot;always question&quot;. You cannot be trapped in the same sort of cycle of believing everything the opposition is saying, just because its speaking anti-government stuff. Than you&#39;re just doing the same thing, just with different information. A lot of things on the subreddit, to be honest, is just crazy stuff that pertains no facts or evidence. That is the stuff you should shy away from. Or, if it interests you, than find evidence and find facts for it.</p>

<p>What I like and hate most about this subreddit is often the absurdity in the posts. I like to think. I like to analyze and to research. I like to hear other theories on ideas because it may connect dots to theories I already have. So, while hearing far-out and crazy ideals can be good if you&#39;re able to internalize it yourself and sort out facts, but they can also be bad if you just take it as truth without actually researching.</p>

<p>Question everything until it makes absolute sense to you.</p>

To truly understand an impossible amount of information would need to be known (such as people&#39;s personal accounts that are locked in their minds now) on this plain of existence. We all have made our own understanding of the situations, &amp; as we have already seen, we all have different views with agreements &amp; disprovals interwoven between us all. Some is reality, some isn&#39;t, figure in it out I see as a personal journey though.

<p>How do you know what information you have is necessarily, the indisputable actual evidence of what had happened in an event or correlation?</p>

<p>In one sense, you kind of don&#39;t.  Given the level of secrecy rampant in TPTB and their nefarious actions, it&#39;s important as an investigator to leave open room for doubt; to leave open room for opposing perspectives.</p>

<p>Therefore, it&#39;s not necessarily about being &quot;100% right&quot; about any one thing.  It&#39;s more about knowing and understanding the general direction of a phenomenon - being able to forecast the general tendency of a thing.</p>

<p>Do we know EXACTLY which specific individuals did 911 and how?  I wouldn&#39;t go that far.  However, you don&#39;t need to in order to understand that all the evidence available reasonably (understatement) points toward 911 being a false flag &quot;inside job&quot; attack on the American people BY the American PTB and was <em>not</em> done by who the government narrative says it was done by.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is kind of a place that helps to mentally masturbate myself</p>

<p>Then you&#39;re doing it wrong.  You shouldn&#39;t come here for that.  Come here to educate yourself - not to mentally masturbate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>yet, I don&#39;t fully believe it because it seems so absurd/scary like I would have to even hide or want to post this in fear of an unforeseen retribution that threatened an agenda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well then - and this is going to sound harsh, but try to take it in the best light possible - you got to grow some motherfucking balls, son.  Man up.  The world you live in is a <em>fucked up</em> one.  We live in very harsh times right now.  Shit isn&#39;t sunshine and rainbows here.  It could definitely be worse than it is, but make no mistake:  It isn&#39;t an oh so fun joy ride either.</p>

<p>So man up.  If you want to investigate and uncover what&#39;s really going on in this planet, then get ready to have to face some really, really harsh shit; some really scary shit; shit that will likely turn your entire life upside down in terms of what you think was good and right and how you may have been raised to view the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can someone please enlighten me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Enlightenment sometimes happens by way of removing visual coverings that often blind you and frighten you more than you might have ever otherwise anticipated.  Enlightenment can happen by way of uncovering the obscurity of your living in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2afuTvUzBQ">a cave</a> to such an extent that it freaks you out and makes you want to do nothing more than RETURN to the darkness and obscurity of that cave and say &quot;fuck enlightenment&quot;.  Enlightenment may end up making you be more like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7BuQFUhsRM">Cypher</a> than anything else.</p>

<p>Your wanting enlightenment means you want power, and with great power comes great responsibility - often time a responsibility that we ourselves are not worthy of or ready to handle or receive.</p>

<p>So if you want truth, be ready, because you just might get it and you might not be able to handle it if and when you do get it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do I make sure and fully believe what you guys (or anyone for that matter) is saying? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Research and research some more.  Keep searching and keep an open mind while you&#39;re doing so.  Be critical.  Don&#39;t be skeptical.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKHUaNAxsTg&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded#">Science and skepticism as it is practiced in today&#39;s day and age is often time nothing more than the new religion and is dealt with in a manner no less dogmatic than the religions that &quot;skeptics&quot; try to rail against</a>.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be skeptical.  Be a <em>critical thinker</em>.  That is a much different, much better thing.</p>

<p>Good luck, and best to you,</p>

<p>There is no cheap, practical, and quick way to truly verify the information you get besides witnessing it first hand, and even that is unreliable.</p>

<p>Generally members here enjoy patting themselves on the back for not trusting Mainstream sources but then strangely believing junk sources.  It is not exactly fair, but it comes from the mindset &quot;Source A routinely Lies, Source B says Source A lies, Source B does not lie&quot; I suppose. I digress.</p>

<p>No matter what your source is, news can not give you the ability to determine if something happened, as even video can be easily faked.</p>

<p>All the news allows you to do is determine how you <em>feel</em> about something.  Without a significant level of trust, there is much that you, personally, may not know for certain.</p>

<p>Consider the Sun.  How do you know how big it is?  It&#39;s diameter or distance? Mass and Density?  You trust the abstract principle of science to take care of that for you, and generally agree with what science says is true.</p>

<p>Not that that is terrible.  Science has proven correct in your life every time the tests were within your means, so why not believe in the atomic theory?  Sure, even scientists themselves don&#39;t claim to have really seen an atom, and the construction of it you imagine is just the imagination of the artist, they&#39;ll even admit that.</p>

<p>Science can help you stay healthy too.  Man has been around for a long time, but now he can get his entire alphabet of vitamins in one convenient pill.  Not that your average consumer gleans any impactful meaning from the phrase &quot;Vitamin C&quot; insofar as what it IS, only what it is expected to DO.  They can get a health nut to consume just about anything, if they put it in powder form.</p>

<p>Now, few or none of these beliefs instilled in you by institutional science or media may be harmful or incorrect, but do mind exactly how much trust you take for granted in your daily life.  You (and many, many more) believe a great deal of information you personally do not know, but were told by others to be true.</p>

<p>Consider how easy it would be to abuse that trust that has been built up in you over the years. Wonder if it already happened.</p>

<p>How do I make sure and fully believe what you guys (or anyone for that matter) is saying?</p>

<p>Let me put it this way for you.</p>

<p>The truth depends on the level of consciousness. What for the one person is an unconditioned truth another won&#39;t believe. Therefore to &quot;enlighten&quot; yourself, you have to first uplift your consciousness to a certain degree where it can accept a specific pieces of information.</p>

<p>The best way to do it is to read a book. A good book. Within a book you will first be introduced slowly to the topic and the stream of information will level your consciousness up.</p>

<p>Read something from David Icke or what I can really recommend is the new book from Chris Hedges - Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt.</p>
