        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1>Who are the Illuminati? Satan&#39;s strong delusion of Revelation.</h1>

<p>There exists an icy wall between the reality most people believe and the truth.  There are many people all around the world who believe in a massive conspiracy, one that has been passed down from generation to generation for the purpose of <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/02/silence-is-freedom-tyranny-is-security.html">controlling humanity</a>.  The 13 bloodlines of the Illuminati gave the world a list of names, people to blame for those who have glimpsed through this wall of ice.  Many have come in contact with it, and all leave with the clear and obvious truth that there is more to our reality than it seems.  In the recent past, the icy wall has proven very clearly that it is a master of deception.  It would have us believe the entire worlds currency are controlled by one family, the Rothschilds.  The wall would like you to believe that a tiny country, formed not more than 70 years ago, is secretly pulling the strings of the largest and most powerful military machines the world has ever seen.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Zionists are not controlling the United States, or the British Crown.  The Rothschild family, while certainly powerful, is not a sacred bloodline destined to reign.  Take a step back, this is what the conspiracy theorists and truth seekers believe... to think that they are not victims of a grand delusion, a deception designed to place blame on a small faction of people is inane.  The Illuminati in total, and the grand NWO conspiracy, are nothing more than the final layer of deception before the Apocalypse: the <strong><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-obvious-alien-influence.html">great delusion</a></strong> promised in Revelation.</p>

<p>An <strong>apocalypse</strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a>: meaning &#39;un-covering&#39;), translated literally from Greek, is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disclosure" title="Disclosure">disclosure</a> of knowledge, hidden from humanity in an era dominated by falsehood and misconception, i.e., a lifting of the veil or revelation.</p>

<p>The Illuminati are nothing but scapegoats, a fictitious movement based on a long dead secret society. <strong>The <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/your-future-and-freedom.html">idea they stand for</a> however, is very real.</strong> The difference, of course, between the two, is that what most people name the &quot;Illuminati&quot; is not a monolithic organization.  It is not some grand conspiracy, made up of humans who have plotted in secret to deny the masses their liberties and their future.  The icy wall that victims see is nothing more than an illusion, a monolithic front for a large group of loosely knit organizations who for a long time in our history had little to no interaction with each other.  Organized crime, secret societies, religious groups, affluent families and secretive governmental organizations today embody what is seen as the Illuminati.  Their dark secret, though, is not that they have all worked together in con  cert for thousands of years in order to bring about the apocalypse, but rather that they had a real and constant contact with the being that has <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/of-divinity-and-devil.html">masqueraded as <strong>God</strong></a> for the same amount of time.  These groups were separate and most believed they were working against each other for most of our history.. the factions of fascism, corruption, and communism were systematically used to infest and infiltrate the government of the United States of America.  They used extortion, coercion, and infiltration in order to take over the enemy from within.  This tactic is timeless, and it is the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/ihs-and-unholy-war-part-i.html">modus operandi </a>of this alien influence.  The greatest enemy, a force of liberty and freedom, has been destroyed not in open battle, but by changing its beliefs.  A cancer has eaten away at the inner core of democracy, and now uses it as nothing more than a facade, the new opiate of the masses. 
<a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/ihs-and-unholy-war-part-2.html">![]<a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/ihs-and-unholy-war-part-2.html">9</a></a>In recent time, these disparate groups have been made aware of each other, and made aware of the fact that the force they have been in contact with has infiltrated the highest level of international governance.  Today, they most likely believe the same lie, that they will be the new masters of the planet, with the assistance of this nefarious force which has systematically <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/ihs-and-unholy-war-part-2.html">used deception</a> in order to seize control of the masses since the dawn of time.   Their belief, of course, is driven by a mind controlled world view of no other option.  In the end, they will be left with exactly what they see, <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/nobody-is-mind-controlling-me.html">a lost cause</a>.  What they most likely do not see is that they are being made an example of.  That the international corporate imperialism will not be viewed by the masses as a natural result of greed, but rather as a systematic destructive force which has intentionally forsaken the planet by <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/12/global-oil-consumption-humanitys.html">destroying its scarce resources and using them in order to make this world unlivable</a> without the <strong>assistance</strong> of an outside force, that <em><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/04/ihs-and-future-colonize-now.html">may not be providing it</a></em>. The global economy is being destroyed, as well as the global ecosystem, and <strong>all people</strong> will be left with a single question.</p>

<p>To all those who <strong>know</strong>, and believe I am wrong, I ask you to remember the words of Jesus on the cross:  &quot;My god, my god; <strong>why</strong> have you forsaken <em>me</em>?&quot;</p>

<p>All is not lost, but it is if you yourselves do not change.  The trajectory we are on is to the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/12/a-blind-eye.html">Biblical abyss</a>, and there will be no coming back.  You will not be saved for your service to evil, nor will you receive some compensation for the horrendous deeds your commit.  What you will be left with is the eternal knowledge that you sacrificed the lives and spirits of your brothers and sisters for nothing more than self gain which was no more than illusion--control of an icy wall that will one day surround you as well.</p>

<p>It is the whole of humanity that we should <strong>all</strong> be concerned with, and our <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/tale-of-hidden-coup.html">subservience to an alien force</a> that has been responsible, personally  for the most atrocious events in our history should be the single most paramount problem in our <strong>focus.</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>On the precipice of victory, take guard... for nothing is as it seems.</strong>  The delusion of course, is that we are destroying ourselves.  It&#39;s <strong>not us</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a conspiracy on a conspiracy, who knew? while i agree with your take on the massive undertaking at work on the perceptions of the general populace on reality i cannot believe this is the work of &quot;satan&quot;. all your doing is tying on fictional characters when the real culprits are right in front of your eyes. do some research on the creation of the christian religion. there are holes all through it if your willing to actually question and use critical thinking to see the cracks in it&#39;s armor of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d would never argue that religion is not deception.  What has become apparent to me however, is there is truth in the statement.. <em>we are not alone</em>, and religion itself is <strong>more</strong> than our lack of understanding of that truth--it is a result of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>look it up yourself, i don&#39;t need to do the research for you. i have done it myself and seen enough to know it is mostly made up for pure control. i&#39;m not saying there is nothing going on in the background. i&#39;m not saying there is no god. i&#39;m saying the christian religion is basically a form of mind control for those that currently do not have the capability&#39;s  to find out the answers for themselves. type in your Google browser fallacies in the bible and you will find many contradictions in the bible that show it is not a pure doctrine.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>John 16:30 is followers of Jesus realizing he&#39;s from God.
They&#39;re saying, there is no reason to ask further if he&#39;s from God or not. In the previous verses they comment on how he speaks so plainly and not in riddles, this is why they say he knows all things. It&#39;s a translation error and you&#39;re focusing too much on the word used and not the context.</p>

<p>Matthew 24:36 is talking about the time Jesus will return to earth. In the same chapter he tells what to look for when that time comes. In other words he knows when it will happen, just not the exact date that is only determined by the creator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well done. Most people seem to disregard statements of there being some entity on this planet acting as Satan if you will...the control. If you look back into the years and listened to the artists talking about selling their souls to the devil and putting out the same agenda in music and movies as many have done, you can see the picture. Music videos have many hidden goodies for those that are awake. Just as an example, Lil Wayne had a music video put out the day before the &#39;Batman Massacre&#39; took place in which it depicted skeletons in the theater, about 12 or so...coincidence? Maybe. </p>

<p>Look at it as not Satan himself, but someone or someTHING using the Bible as the fear to get an agenda done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s not a bad guesstimation, and I do feel that it at least has to do <em>somewhat</em> with and abstract, &quot;collective consciousness&quot; notion of sorts.  However, it <em>does</em> indeed also have to do with an actual organization of specific individuals purposefully aligned to exact the manipulation that has been going on for longer than the history books tell.</p>

<p>The multitude of facts in the first link I included - the Corbett link - simply cannot be accounted for without understanding that there is a very specific organization of individuals involved here.</p>

<p>I would not say that this is in <em>replacement</em> of your postulation that it is a &quot;monolithic&quot; thing.  I feel it <em>also</em> is that, but in addition to that it is also more specific and actual as well.</p>

<p>Oh that is certainly, absolutely the case.  Even today there are factions that believe (erroneously) that they are working independently of anything other than their own volition.</p>

<p>This does not in any way, however, negate or take away from the fact that there is an overwhelming amount of evidence showing that a clandestine, very well organized central power has <em>also</em> (if not predominately) overseen the workings of many facets of control on this planet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  There is a force above these individual organizations that oversees and controls them whether these individual organizations are aware of that control or not, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read your link on &quot;The so called &#39;deep secrets&#39; of Satan&quot;.</p>

<p>Much about how these beings can and should be regarded is addressed <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz">here</a>.</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t doubt that a demiurge similar to what you described in your link can indeed exist on this planet, I also know that the demiurge has no power over Existence, for it was <em>created</em> by Existence.  Existence created everything there is, and, as a result, everything is indelibly connected to Existence and is, thereby, as immutable, indestructible, and eternal <em>as</em> Existence Itself is - i.e. nothing can be destroyed, only changed in shape, form, and energy.  The undermining of personal identity is ultimately of no consequence whatsoever, for there is no such thing as the destruction of that one Identity from which all others come - that one Identity that created the personal identity of the demiurge and of all beings in the cosmos (indeed the of cosmos itself).</p>

<p>The demiurge is but one drop in that same infinite, eternal ocean that created you and me and everything else.  As such, to fear the demiurge and its influence is to fear your own mother and Creator, for all is One.</p>

<p>All is one big Play - one big Game.  Some are more aware of this reality than others.</p>

<p>Independent of what I just said here, it seems to me that the organization you describe as responsible for the things you mentioned in the &quot;deep secrets of Satan&quot; thread is one that doesn&#39;t negate but, instead, <em>reinforces</em> the very idea of the &quot;Illuminati&quot; that you seem intent upon claiming don&#39;t exist here.</p>

<p>Ultimately, a rose by any other name is still a rose, and whether it be called the Illuminati, the Mexican Mafia, the Zionist Syndicate, the Luciferian Doctrine, or whatever one wants to call it, there DOES seem to be an organization that runs things on this planet.</p>

<p>If nothing else, the link you provided reinforces the comments I&#39;ve made in this thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the major secrets of all secret societies.  They are told and shown the symbols that naturally occur and give praise whenever they arise.  The universe will always show that it is in control and flash up the symbols to show you.  Every winner of a race, or scorer of a goal will throw their arms up in a large sign of typhon, they do this unconsciously, an event like the last Olympics had a lot of seemingly coincidental symbolism, where only one or two vantage points could capture it.  The alternative explanation is that idiots like Danny Boyle and Lady Gaga are all members of the illuminati, if you believe that Lil Wayne puts on his robe and pentacles then you really should get yourself checked out.  All of this is happening naturally, the masons recognise this, every mystical branch of every religion know this, this is why those symbols are drawn and recorded, because they are real and will manifest in reality.  It is learning what each symbol represents that gives one access to real power.  Why do you think the current powerful people want everyone to be atheists, to think masons are idiots?  The more people who aren&#39;t looking, the more power they can control.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In sorry, but this is bullshit because the Illuminati did exist. This is a letter written by George Washington hosted on the Library of Congress website.</p>

<p><a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mgw:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28gw360395%29%29">http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mgw:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28gw360395%29%29</a></p>

<p>Now what is debated is the intentions of the Illuminati and If they did wield any power or influence. This letter from Washington indicates that he believed their presence and power was not being used for good.</p>

<p>&quot;It was not my intention to doubt that, the Doctrines of the Illuminati, and principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more truly satisfied of this fact than I am.&quot;</p>

<p>So what he is saying is his suspicions about such an entity may not be unfounded and asserts his conviction by being &#39;truly satisfied of the fact&#39;. I can&#39;t exactly vouch for his conviction but I believe that he was a knowledgable man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey.  FYI.  As far as the &quot;Illuminati do not exist&quot; thing?  Listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAgtmtMtPJY&amp;amp;t=18m56s">this</a>.  Research it for yourself and see what you come up with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For future reference, here was my experience reading this post.</p>

<p>&quot;The Illuminati do not exist. The truth is much stranger than fiction, in this case.&quot;</p>

<p>ok, let&#39;s see what this fellow has to say.</p>

<p>&quot;Who are the Illuminati?&quot;</p>

<p>an interesting question, I am intrigued.</p>

<p>&quot;Satan&#39;s&quot;</p>

<p>Aaaaaaaaand fuck this thread I&#39;m out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this isn&#39;t even about any kind of disbelief in Satan. I dunno. Maybe there is a Satan. I believe in God, or something very much like God, although I am not a believer in any particular religion. I&#39;ve seen things that seemed like they were evil fores and what not. I&#39;m just saying, bringing up Satan in any context means that no matter what your point is, you are very bad at being an effective communicator in regards to any important subject because you are instantly alienating people that may otherwise have taken you at least somewhat seriously.</p>

<p>In other words, it&#39;s 2013, stop talking about Satan if you want critical thinkers to take you seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been shown the <strong><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/04/false-flags-police-foreknowledge-and.html">machinations of an alien invasion</a></strong>, and have attempted to warn everyone about it.  It&#39;s not the kind of invasion you would expect, because that wouldn&#39;t work as well as one <em>you don&#39;t see coming</em>.  Here&#39;s a hint, they are <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/p/mind-control.html">using mind control</a> to take over the planet without even needing to set foot on it.  For a three year period, I have personally witnessed effects of mind control similar to several prominent victims of this <strong><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/04/schizophrenia-is-alien-weapon-against.html">same conspiracy</a></strong>.</p>

<p>There is a significant amount of additional evidence of mind control in our history.  First and foremost, consider the cases of the recent assassinations from <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-cia-mind-control-and-judicial-system.html">Kennedy</a> to <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-manchurian-candidates.html">Reagan</a>. Incidentally, I was born on the day John Lennon was assassinated.  It&#39;s been made clear to me that the <strong>MK-ULTRA program is casually related to the Roswell incident</strong>, I think it&#39;s a trojan horse, and this &quot;entity&quot; is attempting to use that program as evidence to the world that our government is<a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/nobody-is-mind-controlling-me.html"> responsible for mind controlling everyone</a>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a big problem.  Mind control has been used for much, much longer.  In the 1800&#39;s a case, <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/04/john-nash-james-jesus-angleton-and.html">James Tilly Matthews</a>, links directly to John Nash and <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/04/john-nash-james-jesus-angleton-and.html">James Jesus Angleton</a>.  It also appears that mind control was utilized for the benefit of the Nazi&#39;s during World War II; and that the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-hidden-hand.html">Angel of Death was actively researching the technology behind it</a>.</p>

<p>Also, just like the <strong><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/15/not-just-sandy-hook-china-s-terrifying-knife-attacks.html">Sandy Hook</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/12/14/china-knife-attack-school.html">China Stabbing</a></strong> incidents occurred at nearly the same time with very similar stories, a similar event occurred in the 17th century, in <a href="http://law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/salem.htm">Salem</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devils_of_Loudun">France</a>.  These things are too much to be <em>coincidence.  Maybe</em> they are trying to disarm us, and blame the government for it, at the same time?</p>

<p>Even before that, we seem to have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/2021-Times-Battle-between-Machine/dp/1480169994">significant amount</a> of evidence of the use of this technology, going all the way back to <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-dendera-light_24.html">Ancient Egypt</a>.</p>

<p>Please wake up?</p>
