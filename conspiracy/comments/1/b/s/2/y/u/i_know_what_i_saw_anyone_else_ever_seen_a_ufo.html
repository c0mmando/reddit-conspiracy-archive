    <div class="md"><p>My dad and stepmother both saw 3 very small UFOs in full color fly low and absolutely silent near some vehicles in a parking lot of a restaurant at sundown. They then shot up fast into outerspace until no longer visible. Dad was a disbeliever until that happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a disbeliever until my experience as well. Woke up around 3:30 am camping at enchanted rock (we camped on a rock ridge in full view about a quarter mile west of the rock itself) and there was a disc with 12 lights around it hovering above the west/northwest end of the rock. It spun counter clockwise and did all sorts of weird tilting and zig zag maneuvers, like a rigid, jerky, figure 8, or Z if you will. These were very fast movements with very abrupt stops. During the 3 hours we watched it, we saw it shining lights down onto the rock... and in one moment of terror, onto our campsite. We heard weird noises in the woods all night, and saw tons of other &quot;jumpy&quot; stars in the sky, only they were much farther out and could only be seen as a dot of flickering light. Make no mistake though, the one near our campsite was CLOSE. Honestly it was the most terrifying night of my life, and the sad part is, now I wish I could have had the courage to go stand under it, seeing as though I probably could have jogged to it in under two minutes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe ten years ago, I was in my family&#39;s house, just fucking around on a computer, next to a window facing the backyard. I heard bizarre and clearly unnatural noises, loud and close by, coming from the direction of the backyard -- I can&#39;t envision them so precisely in my mind any more, but I remember describing them as sounding like R2D2&#39;s beeps, and something like a synthesized duck call. So, as you would expect, this immediately got my attention, and I looked toward the origin of the noise, which was out the window immediately next to me. In my dark backyard, upon turning my head, I saw a geometric pattern of independent red lights -- they seemed to be tracing the form of an object, as though they were simply the vertices of a dark shape, but I could see fairly clearly between the lights, and I could see that there was no shape obstructing my view of the backyard; there was only floating lights; they were attached to nothing. I took all of this information in over the course of maybe two seconds, and, immediately, I became terrified, ducking out of view of the window as if frantically avoiding gunfire. I stationed myself on the floor in the kitchen one room away, where I could not be seen from any window in the house. The noises persisted for some time while I remained very frightened, but they eventually stopped. At last, after having not heard the noises for a fair while, I summoned the courage to get up from my hiding place and check the window again, but, by the time I finally did this, all signs of the lights were gone, and my backyard appeared perfectly normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those lights you described are similar to what we saw on the rock. Took the shape of a hexagon, but as you said, it was only the outline, and I could see through the shape between the lighted edges. Very strange stuff. Glad you posted. I hope more people man up and talk about what they&#39;ve experienced on here. How long do you think the whole thing lasted?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nope. but i recently made a comment recently that I believe is of some relevance. I hope you don&#39;t mind that I&#39;m gonna post it.</p>

<p>What led to my unpopular opinion that ETs are here?</p>

<p>&quot;What led me to this unpopular opinion was not one thing it was a culmination of things.  This is a very complex and controversial topic and started with my getting interested in UFOs googling one night. First what enabled me to look further into this issue was the <a href="http://keyholepublishing.com/Leading-UFO-Documents.html">US government Documents</a> that shows that the US, at one point, took reports of UFOsvery seriously and was convinced that the flying saucer phenomenon was real and was not ficticious.</p>

<p>I was taken aback by those documents always believing that there was really nothing to this whole thing. So I did what any person with an aroused curiousity did, I looked into it further. </p>

<p>What convinced me even more of the validity and serious nature of this topic was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vyVe-6YdUk">the Disclosure Project</a>. Over 500 government, military, and intelligence community witnesses testifying to their direct, personal, first hand experience with UFOs, ETs, ET technology, and the cover-up that keeps this information secret (got that from their website). The accounts of many of these people are astounding. </p>

<p>Now I was convinced that what I had previously thought to be true was not the correct view. So I looked into sightings. One that sticks out to me was the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdIdDpJYSOM">Phoenix Lights incident of 1995</a> which, the official story i believe, is attributed to flares. But those are not flares. flares to not do what those lights did. The governor of arizona had a press conference about the event and had some people come out in alien costumes to dismiss and make a mockery of the event. 10 Years later the same governor that dismissed the case admits that he, to this day, has no idea what those lights were.</p>

<p>Abductions are particularly fascinating and controversial. There is not, at least what people will accept, conclusive evidence that these actually take place. But the stories recanted from people under hypnosis, from seperate hypnotherapists, are remarkably similar and terrifying. If you would like a lecture on abductions I would suggest Dr. Karla Turner. College professor turned UFO investigator because of the abduction experiences that her and her husband faced. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdIdDpJYSOM">Dr. Karla Turner MUFON conference 1995</a></p>

<p>Animal mutilations are very odd. Cleanly stripped carcasses from animals all over the world are found without any blood in the body or around the area where the body was found. These animals have been found with very precise drilling marks in their bones. Very eerie. </p>

<p>I usually don&#39;t talk about crop circles because of the nature that these phenomenon hold in the public opinion but I do think that there is something to it that is not human. Surely some, if not a lot, are hoaxes. Always have to watch out for the hoaxes.</p>

<p>Astronaut <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iNMPdbnkcw">Dr. Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 14, walked on the moon</a> has been trying to expose the veil of secrecy and his testimony is quite remarkable. He says that he has been briefed on the issue officially and that there is, in fact, a government coverup going on. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlkV1ybBnHI">Buzz Aldrin also had quite an interesting experience</a>. Gordon Cooper as well has an interesting stance on the matter.</p>

<p>The truth about this subject is highly complicated and I honestly believe that we are being visited by an extraterrestrials. How many and what they are I have no idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Friend and I were driving at night and in the sky above us a very bright light just kind of &quot;appear&quot; - it didn&#39;t come from over the horizon. After looking at it for a few seconds we pulled over and then were both convinced that the light was actually a flame. The oranges and yellows looked like some sort of rocket, but it seemed to be stationary. After about 5 minutes, it faded away again - again without crossing over the horizon. No clue what it was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw something similar one night. Had a very close encounter that same night with an actual disc. It had 12 lights around it and spun counter clockwise. It was about 2000 feet off the ground and about 1/4 mile away. We watched his thing hovering that close to us for 3 hours.. most terrifying night of my life. A lot more happened... should I go into more detail?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did, once, when I was a Mormon Missionary in Japan.  I was riding my bike past a construction site that had a big clear plastic wall surrounding it.  It was around 5 in the evening, in the summer, and the sun was starting to set.  I caught a glimpse of something in the plastic wall as I was riding past it, and at first I thought it was a reflection or glare or some sort.  But it wasn&#39;t bright enough to be that, and looked an awful lot like the Space Station.  It was moving at a relatively steady pace, and then it suddenly accellerated and zoomed out of view.  </p>

<p>I remember thinking that there ought to be some kind of audible sonic boom from something accellerating like that, but there was just nothing.</p>

<p>Also, one of my buddies who I mission&#39;d with was from Peru, and he told me once that he was at a big religious campout thing near the coast by Lima, and that a bunch of them saw a UFO.  It came really close to their campsite and then took off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess this piece of the story is missing as well. That night, before we went to bed, before we saw the ufo, we saw a small bright light on top of the rock which we at first thought were flashlights. We then saw it take the shape of a hexagon; six bars of light, which broke apart from each other and explored the rock. Extremely fast. One shot across the rock in about 15 seconds... the rock is a mile long. Another came down the west side of the rock (which is probably a 75° incline and a 300 foot drop) in a couple seconds, and went below the treeline... this is also why the noises in the woods were THAT much scarier that night...</p>

I went in afterwards, I gave up at staring it, since I had lot of works to catch up on, not sure what happened after.</p>

<p>I thought it was the weirdest shape of lights I&#39;ve ever seen in my life, theres not much traffic out at this time either, and also big blast of light that lid up half of the sky(same area), only things weird things I&#39;ve seen my life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw something similar one night. Had a very close encounter that same night with an actual disc. It had 12 lights around it and spun counter clockwise. It was about 2000 feet off the ground and about 1/4 mile away. We watched his thing hovering that close to us for 3 hours.. most terrifying night of my life. A lot more happened... should I go into more detail?</p>

<p>edit: meant to say THIS thing, but I&#39;ll leave it because the sentence is funny</p>
