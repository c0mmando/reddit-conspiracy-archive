       This is not new news or anything but I couldn't find anything about this when I searched this subreddit and found this story interesting. Basically 10 remains in total with 6 being children were found when renovating Ben Franklin's old house.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm not mistakin Ben Franklin was the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. Just wondering what people think about all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS. I know I spelled Skeletal wrong in the title.

       Quoted from:
       <a href="http://history.knoji.com/was-benjamin-franklin-a-serial-killer/">

       "During the time that Franklin was in England some two hundred years ago, medical dissection was outlawed. The body trade had become so lucrative, that many people had turned to murder to provide a living for their family. Many families lost loved ones to grave snatchers, and some funeral homes were selling the bodies of customers to these "body snatchers" who would then sell them to research facilities, and hospitals. When these things began to happen, the practice of human dissection was outlawed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many doctors and scientists however continued on with the practice purchasing bodies on the black market. Enter Dr. William Hewson. The good doctor was the husband of the daughter of Franklin's landlord in London. He was a scientist, a surgeon, and had a curiosity nearly as insatiable as Franklin's own. It should be noted at this point that Franklin himself, a scientist was fascinated by the human anatomy and medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bodies recovered showed signs of medical procedures. The skulls were neatly sawed, and bones showed scalpel like cuts. The final verdict? Dr. Hewson and Franklin were working together discecting bodies for the purpose of scientific experimentation. If they had been caught in these times, they likely would have hanged for their practices. However they were not caught, and the knowledge of their crimes, (yes it was a crime) were hidden away beneath the soil for over two hundred years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even after the official report was released, many still speculated about the possibility of Franklin being a serial killer. Rumors pushed the hand of Philadelphia scientists, who began survying Franklin's Phiadelphia estate. To the dismay of conspiracy theorists however, no bodies were discovered, adding validity to the conclusions of the London Archeology Community.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in truth, Franklin was not a serial killer. One could make a valid argument that he was indeed a little strange, after all who wants to live on top of the bodies of ten people? But this, will just pass into the school of history as one more notable interest of the amazing Benjamin Franklin."

       I wouldn't necessarily call these the facts - more like the official version. I don't always trust the official version. 
For instance, did konji.com mention that Ben Franklin was a member of the Hellfire Club en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellfire_Club and
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiyiJzpa4Fk">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiyiJzpa4Fk
       </a>
       ... The supposed president of this club was the Devil, according to Wikipedia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, six of the ten bodies found were of children, which would be consistent with satanic sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I'm saying, is don't automatically believe the official version - sometimes the powers that be lie and cover up the facts.

       The "devil" was the president of the "hellfire club" with "secret members" including "Ben Franklin" according to Wikipedia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Uhhuh, did you know that there was c4 in the twin towers on 9/11 and that I have some snake oil to sell you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen interesting ideas on this subreddit before. I won't deny it. But the devil? What reason would Franklin need the devil for? I'm pretty sure the official story covers just about everything, especially since the people who reaerarched it set out to cover everything. Which is why I was happy.

       is there any doubt that the towers were imploded, instead of collapsing ?

       Much like most of the internet, the writing on their page isn't exactly "knoji's".  I merely chose their re-publication of a common story.

       The question, "Was Benjamin Franklin a serial killer?" was merely phrased to help sell some advertising on some History and Discovery channel shows.

       Was it normal to bury people in the basement at that time? I don't know anything about that time period, but I can imagine a situation where somebody dies in the winter and the ground is frozen outside so you have to bury them inside, but I don't know.......

       Indeed, I remember going to the meeting where we planned when to have the shooting. Oh good there was so many animal sacrifices and blood drinking, good times were had by all until the illuminati showed up and drank all the blood wine.

       they're happy enough to know children were murdered, and their parents then paraded as props. There is no need for blood drinking. Robby Parker is happy to shed tears all over the country, at least on queue.
