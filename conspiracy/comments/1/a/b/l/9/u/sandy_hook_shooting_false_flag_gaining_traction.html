    <div class="md"><p>Just saw a thread in r politics about this in the new queue...That said, this is not a very detailed post but damn if it&#39;s not creepy enough to attract attention.</p>

<p>*This was the response of one member {Ryan} of the forum in question, according to one poster from the GLP thread</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems to have been answered on that forum.... if true, then it is bs, Here is [the discussion of two users]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>look in the url here above: message2167331</p>

<p>Every forum uses IDs in chronological order for every post... If you go to threads from years ago, the id &gt;&gt;number will be a lot smaller... for example message1167331 was from 2010.</p>

<p>They explain that to prove to someone that threads timestamps can be manipulated, they adjusted it for that &gt;&gt;post but the id of the thread doesn&#39;t correlate with other id&#39;s from 2010.</p>

<p>the result is a thread that was created recently had timestamps adjusted to make it look like 2010, but the id &gt;&gt;number of the thread shows it is really from recent:</p>

<p>drseussofporn:
Yeah . . . there was some timestamp manipulation here. If you look at the thread, the ID is 3417. Around that &gt;&gt;time, all other thread IDs were in the low to mid 1000&#39;s. Nice try though.</p>

<p>Ryan:
Yeah, it was done to prove to a Sandy Hook truther here on our forum that not everything &quot;timestamped&quot; on &gt;&gt;the internet is accurate. Things can be manipulated. But I guess that was lost on some people... &quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Update 1: Ok, here&#39;s something else interesting. If you look at the waybackmachine record for the forum in question (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101225103941/http://www.unforumzed.com/forum.php">http://web.archive.org/web/20101225103941/http://www.unforumzed.com/forum.php</a>) from December 22 2010 and then take a look at the subforum of the main &quot;General Discussion&quot; section where the post was made, which was supposedly called &quot;conspiracy corner&quot;, you will see that it does not exist on the waybackmachine. That specific subforum could have required registration to view, but seeing as their warez forums were even viewable by the googleindexing bot I doubt they had the conspiracy corner hidden. (Mini update: turns out the thread was originally in the &quot;off-topic&quot; section and was moved to conspiracy at a later time.)</p>

<p>Update 2: When showing search result does google draw timestamp data from the post as exists or does it generate within google from when the thread was first indexed? (<a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;amp;output=search&amp;amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;amp;q=http://www.unforumzed.com/showthread.php?3417-Obama-use-school-shooting-to-disarm-America&amp;amp;oq=http://www.unforumzed.com/showthread.php?3417-Obama-use-school-shooting-to-disarm-America&amp;amp;gs_l=hp.3...1303.1303.0.1876.1.1.0.0.0.0.88.88.1.1.0.les;..0.0...1c.1.5.psy-ab.AiuRlQ8Q67E&amp;amp;pbx=1&amp;amp;fp=1&amp;amp;biw=1024&amp;amp;bih=743&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;amp;cad=b">https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;amp;output=search&amp;amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;amp;q=http://www.unforumzed.com/showthread.php?3417-Obama-use-school-shooting-to-disarm-America&amp;amp;oq=http://www.unforumzed.com/showthread.php?3417-Obama-use-school-shooting-to-disarm-America&amp;amp;gs_l=hp.3...1303.1303.0.1876.1.1.0.0.0.0.88.88.1.1.0.les;..0.0...1c.1.5.psy-ab.AiuRlQ8Q67E&amp;amp;pbx=1&amp;amp;fp=1&amp;amp;biw=1024&amp;amp;bih=743&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;amp;cad=b</a>)
 Google time stamped the thread in 2010, no question.</p>

<p>Update 3: Quote from the OP of the prediction which seems to confirm that the post did originate in 2010 and it was locked as of January 15th of this year; </p>

<p>I have try to inform unforumzed.com about Sandy Hook shooting in December 17, 2010 but my discussion was censored by unforumzed.com Administrator. I received a message from Churubella that my topic is lock down.-<a href="http://www.unforumzed.com/showthread.php?3436-Sandy-Hook-Truther-%28bowel%29-quot-Movement-quot/page6">http://www.unforumzed.com/showthread.php?3436-Sandy-Hook-Truther-%28bowel%29-quot-Movement-quot/page6</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Update 4: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The original Unformezed thread from 2010 does not appear to be active. It appears they locked it away around 1-15-13. However, the original poster, kathaksung, returned to the thread [just mentioned] and posted his old thread and complained he was being censored. Peeps then took that info and found the old thread in Google archives...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Update 5: This is a rabbit hole, I leave you with what I take to be a reasonable analysis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s either a hoax, a good one, or real and Ryan[the first, and only, person to claim the thread in question was a hoax] and a few shills jumped in to dismiss it, say they made it up, quickly banned kataksung.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive personally never modded a forum&#39;s timestamps. But only admins could go in and change these times and dates. They would have the highest level access with database control and would need to alter each and every persons comments timestamp when they commited the comment. Thats changing every instance on every field that contains the timestamp data.  All in all I think the entire timestamp manipulation thing (not just on GLP) is fishy. </p>

The YouTube comments on all these conspiracy videos have my blood boiling. &quot;That medical examiner didn&#39;t shed one tear! And his name is Carver! CARVER! Get it? Like CARVING up BODIES?! See, it&#39;s all a hoax!&quot; STFU.&quot;</p>

<p>(his response): Exactly. That&#39;s the thing about conspiracy theorists -- it&#39;s never enough. Show them a crime scene photo and they&#39;ll want security camera footage. Show them a screen shot of the security camera footage and they&#39;ll want the actual video. Show them a clip of the footage and they&#39;ll scream that you didn&#39;t let them watch the full, unedited thing. Sometimes I think it&#39;s a gore porn fetish masquerading as concern.
We went through this with Obama&#39;s birth certificate. It was never enough. People who believe in this shit trust no one, and so they will find foul play in everything that&#39;s presented to them.&quot;</p>

Frangi - re: question 2</p>

<p>No amount of money offered would make me even consider giving up my child to anyone. If you&#39;re really believing this theory, think harder. </p>

<p>I hope/believe you&#39;re playing devil&#39;s advocate or at least just trying to be a pot stirrer. If not try this one on for size. If the government is behind all this and as evil as you think it is, why would they nicely ask parents to kindly give up their kids to implement restrictive gun laws that would make the American people as helpless as babies? Wouldn&#39;t it be more like, &quot;We&#39;re taking your kids. They will be safe, but breathe a word of this to anyone and we will kill them.&quot; The parent&#39;s grief would be real. You now have roles for &quot;crisis actors&quot;, etc. Easy as hell to make this stuff up, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some questions to mull for you. Assuming the above is true, was the shooter drugged? How exactly was he coerced into killing his mother? Is she not dead either? The teachers and other adults in the school, actually killed or whisked to an undisclosed location too? Were their families told the same essential thing the children&#39;s families were threatened with in my scenario? Were all those tiny coffins filled with rocks? </p>

<p>Frankly I think all the tiny heads that believe this stuff are filled with rocks, dryer lint, and dust bunnies. It&#39;s sure to be some government plot. Most likely it has to do with the coming invasion of aliens that will bring on a pandemic certain to cause the collapse of the economy, EF5 tornadoes nationwide, nuclear war, solar storms, asteroid hits, the New World Order, category 6 hurricanes, and disruption of the internet. You do have your bunker supplied and ready, right? Don&#39;t forget your guns.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p><em>These are all from the &#39;follow-up&#39; link, you can see it <a href="http://www.unforumzed.com/showthread.php?3436-Sandy-Hook-Truther-%28bowel%29-quot-Movement-quot/page6">here</a>; page 6 is linked, where kathaksung comes back. From the bold link above, where Ryan plays off of Scarlet, suggests to me that Scarlet is a shill too. Sure enough, multiple thousand posts, same (wish I could embed links but these stupid parentheses mid-url... post110 <a href="http://www.unforumzed.com/showthread.php?3436-Sandy-Hook-Truther-(bowel)-quot-Movement-quot/page8">http://www.unforumzed.com/showthread.php?3436-Sandy-Hook-Truther-(bowel)-quot-Movement-quot/page8</a>) generic, ad-hominem shill behavior.</em></p>

<p>That is the dns entry timestamp that is in no way able to be changed or stricken from google cache without deleting the entire thread that was created using said dns entry.

<p>&quot;I already did that search and all those &quot;timestamp manipulation&quot; threads have nothing to do with manipulating a timestamp in a forum posting. You know why? Because it can&#39;t be done.</p>

<p>Whenever someone posts a thread here, or any forum, the timestamp is generated based on the time it was posted and then that value is inserted into the database in a particular field. Now unless someone manipulated that timestamp behind the scenes (someone with direct access to the database), it&#39;s legit.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a brilliant way to get traffic for the forum.</p>

The writers are not vetted, and they are paid per click. Just like any other blog, they gather content from other people and post it for clicks. Even the executive editor admits, &quot;They&#39;re blogs. They don&#39;t get edited. We don&#39;t give any direction to people on what to write in their blogs.

<p>Living in New Haven, I&#39;m pretty sure those buildings were planned WELL before Sandy Hook. All of downtown New Haven has been under massive replanning for YEARS. 
Yale owns a ton of property, you&#39;ll find stupid numbers for anything. The worst thing about Yale are their students and predatory property jacking.

    <div class="md"><p>The Sandy Hook shooting as a false flag op?  Ludicrous.  It was staged so that strict gun control could be enacted, thus disarming America, making it ripe for police state takeover?  Sorry to break it to you, but the police state is already established and up and running in America.  The PATRIOT Acts I and II took care of that.</p>

<p>And the practical details conspiracy theorists are proposing that prove a false flag op are laughable.</p>

<p>The parents of the dead are &quot;disaster actors&quot;?  How does that work?  Actors are being used as grieving parents?  And none of the actual members of the Sandy Hook community are standing up saying, &quot;Who are these people?  They don&#39;t live around here?  We don&#39;t know these people?&quot;  If that was my community, I could tell a stranger from a neighbor and with all the media roving around, I&#39;d sure as hell tell someone.  So far, though, accusations of &quot;disaster actors&quot; are coming from people who don&#39;t live in Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>Or the story surrounding the family of Kristen Parker, who was killed in the massacre, and the imbeciles who claim she was photographed with her family and President Obama <em>after</em> she was supposedly murdered.  Never once thinking that the blonde haired girl in the photo was Kristen&#39;s younger sister wearing a hand-me-down.</p>

<p>I think conspiracy theorists who&#39;ve jumped on the Sandy Hook bandwagon have no understanding of how things work.  America learned a lot from Nazi Germany.  Among other things, America learned you get more money out of people when you keep them in low wage jobs, rather than concentration camps.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked at the Sandy Hook &quot;evidence&quot; and it&#39;s bullshit.  The logic doesn&#39;t hold up and the grainy photographs and strategically edited video are unconvincing.</p>

<p>The only false flag there is about the Sandy Hook tragedy is conspiracy theorists who are pushing narratives that have no logic, no proof and no sense behind them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IF it was a conspiracy, and I&#39;m not saying it was or wasn&#39;t, what was it for? Initially it seemed clear that it was a gun issue and it was a great opportunity to ban future sales of certain guns and have greater oversight on sales of the rest. Taking weapons, remember, was never even mentioned as a possibility by anyone in the government. But as we&#39;ve seen, 3 months later, there has been no new gun legislation and talks of it have virtually ended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, Walmart( along with other popular retail outlets like Academy Sports )has actively been reducing the amount of ammo they ship and display in their stores.  The same people that <em>always</em> buy ammo are the ones going in and buying ammo, but there&#39;s much less of it to sell.  They claim it&#39;s because of increased demand, but take states like Texas and Arkansas for example that have no foreseeable anti-gun legislation in the works( quite the opposite ).  Arkansas is even the Walmart home state, yet every store across the area is limiting three boxes of ammo per customer, always have empty shelves( with no one ever over there asking to buy ), the clerks are saying they haven&#39;t received new ammo shipments in weeks, and they&#39;ve increased their ammo pricing by at least 50%.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think supply and demand here plays nearly as big of a factor as you think.  The owners of local gunshops that I&#39;m friends with tell me it&#39;s nearly impossible to order ammo from manufacturers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>jeez, I dread waking up to an  orangered after a night of drinking...    Been awake for a long time now, just was kind of apprehensive about what I might have done...</p>

<p>This one isn&#39;t that bad.    If you&#39;ll hear me out on this...  <strong>They&#39;re out for us.</strong>   I knew of the Memory Hole Blog just from reading whatever conspiracy related issues, websites, etc., long before Sandy Hook.   Just whatever  hmmm, that&#39;s funny but not haha type issue with a reference to James Tracy&#39;s Memory Hole blog, long before his name became linked with Sandy Hook. </p>

<p>I&quot;m not really very organized.  So I can&#39;t give you dates/times when I might have seen his blog about a totally different issue way before Sandy Hook ocurred.</p>

<p>Down here in South Fla, all the local news organizations suck.  We have the Palm Beach Post, the Sun Sentinel (they endorsed Romney), and the Miami (Bath Salts, zomg, zombies...) Herald.   All the so callled &quot;alternative media&quot;  we have is the New Times.  There&#39;s the PalmBeach /Broward and the Miami editions  (owned by the Village Voice).   They&#39;re alternative like I&#39;m King Kong on top of the Empire State Building right now.  They&#39;re trying to smear James Tracy bigger than shit and it&#39;s so obvious.  So really they&#39;re attacking US!  Because we know they&#39;re full of shit.  (See Paul Craig Roberts&#39; blog post about agenda driven news.  It&#39;s been posted here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>).</p>

<p>So anyway the PTB are aware of how much traction conspiracy theory or even just questioning the bullshit the Main/Lame Street Media is pumping out on a daily basis is getting with the general public.  Sandy Hook is their big thing now because they can say, (props to you know who) THINK OF THE CHILDREN.  So again <strong>we&#39;re</strong> being targeted.  (I have a post in the future where I&#39;m going to go off on them big time and it&#39;s going to funny and real!)</p>

<p>I&#39;m very much aware that you&#39;re right; it&#39;s another contrived media event  (see Mr Roberts blog) which was designed solely for the purpose of our :( government  taking away <strong>another one</strong> of our rights.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a gun person, but I agree with you.  I should be able to decide for myself just like I should be able to alter my consciousness which people have been doing since forever without my overreaching government getting in the way. The bottom line is that I think they&#39;re using Sandy Hook (with disinfo) to smear us and to herd everyone back to their CIA news media.</p>

<p>From the looks of things, this guy screams things like this all the time, meaning EVENTUALLY he&#39;s going to get something even close to right. His &#39;message&#39; was vague enough that it could have meant anything.</p>

<p>There&#39;s several possible layers to the theory, calling it one cohesive theory is ridiculous. There&#39;s the thought it was an outright hoax, as in it never happened and actors plaid parts to sell the story. There&#39;s the thought it happened, but greatly exaggerated. And there&#39;s the thought it was a false flag that actually happened as reported, except it was orchestrated by tptb. All of these different theories have a lot of potential overlap.</p>
