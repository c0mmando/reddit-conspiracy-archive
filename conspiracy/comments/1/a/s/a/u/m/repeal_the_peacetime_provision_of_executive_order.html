<p>I&#39;m talking about sections 102-104 of the National Defense Resource Preparedness Executive Order. It&#39;s about 4 pages long, and extremely disturbing. Even more so than the NDAA, if you can believe that. Please take a look and help spread the word. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s on the whitehouse&#39;s own website. It&#39;s true. And yes, what the fuck, indeed. In fact, it&#39;s worse than you probably realize at the first glance. </p>

<p>This executive order is effectively a secession of the executive branch from the other branches of the government. This is accomplished in section 104, where three councils are designated as responsible for determining when and under what circumstances resources and people can be seized. Notice that all three councils are in the executive branch, meaning the president only needs his own permission to control the economy and impose military might on anyone he chooses. </p>

<p>The executive branch has gone rogue, and it believes it owns the world and everyone in it. The really scary part... is that it has the power to enforce that belief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see any provision claiming authority to seize resources or labor, just stuff about assessing what resources and labor are necessary in case of national emergency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont see any of what you are claiming, read through the sections that you mentioned. Would you give more detail for me to re read, such as &quot;oh hey, go look at section 104 b (3)&quot; or what have you. Because i am not seeing what you claim to be in the purposed bill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure thing, and I&#39;m glad you asked. They gum up the sentences with so much superfluous language that it&#39;s difficult to retain the gist of what they are saying, so what I&#39;ll do is cut out the redundant parts, but I wil not do so to alter context or meaning. Anything in brackets is designed to make the quote read smoothly and grammatically but will not add or alter any content or meaning to the existing language.</p>

<p>From Section 103:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Executive departments and agencies...shall:</p>

<p>assess on an ongoing basis the capability of the domestic industrial and technological base to satisfy requirements in peacetime and times of national emergency... including subcontractors and suppliers, materials, skilled labor, and professional and technical personnel;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Section 104:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[and shall] be prepared, in the event of a potential threat to the security of the United States, to take actions necessary to ensure the availability [of said resources].&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So those sections establish the authority to use the military to regulate production and/or seize any resources, including human labor, that are deemed necessary for national security or the continuity of government, as well as the authority to intervene in the economic sector to &quot;ensure tha availability&quot; of those resources in the future. The most pertinent part being that they can do this during peacetime. </p>

<p>The Executive order is an amendment to some existing legislation from 1950 (The Defense Production Act), but the amendment is major because that act only applied to wartime, which meant it required congressional approval and the declaration of a state of emergency. Now, they can do it whenever they want, with only their own permission. They might be doing it right now. </p>

<p>Some of you may disagree that they say they have the right to seize or regulate resources, because they only say &quot;assess&quot; and &quot;take action.&quot; But what you have to remember is that they are talking about <em>military action,</em> because the executive branch <em>is</em> the military and police, and the military is specifically designed and intended to take <em>martial</em> actions. </p>

<p>The legislative branch is designed to prohibit, the judicial branch to interpret those prohibitions, and the executive branch to en<em>force</em> those prohibitions. But in Section 104, this order establishes three executive councils as the policy-making forum,which is what congress is supposed to be for. And section 804 uses some tricky language to declare immunity from judicial revew. Notice where it says...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word &quot;construe&quot; has a very specific meaning in legal context. It means to interpret, and interpretation is the bailiwick of the judicial branch. So they are saying that nothing the judicial branch says can interfere with budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals from the Director of Management and Budget (another executive branch position). The courts cannot interfere with the legality or implementation of the authorities granted in this order. They, and congress, have been rendered moot in matters of national security, which could be anything they wish it to be, since it is not defined. And since we&#39;ve already seen homeland security involve itself in matters as trivial as raw milk production, I think it&#39;s safe to assume that they can and will apply military authority to anything they don&#39;t like. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t like Korea, but Korea hasn&#39;t done anything to reasonably provoke martial action? Well that&#39;s a matter of national security. Seize the broadcast stations &quot;resources&quot;and &quot;take actions necessary&quot; to force the &quot;skilled laborers&quot; there to report stories of Korea saying it&#39;s going to nuke everybody. That&#39;s just one simple example. Not saying that&#39;s what happened in that case, but if they wanted to... they could. </p>
