       I see a lot of you guys have a good iinsights on various incidents and happenings. But how do you assimilate it together? What is your grand theory. We all know that for sure, the world is not run by a lot of people. Even if can accept that it is actually run by governments , but we know for sure that the control is in hand of a handful individuals or groups or organizations. So, what is your "Grand Threory of Modern World?" and how do you support it?

       Its a corporatocracy with banks tossed in.  These institutions dictate 95%+ of the policies in the world.  How? They control the money (federal reserve, world bank, IMF) and the food (monsanto, other GMOs).  When you control the money supply, an the food supply of the world, it doesn't matter who the people elect.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Give me control of a nation's money supply, and I care not who makes it's laws."- Amschel Rothschild
      </p>
      <p>
       This puts me at odds with myself because I think elections are bought and paid for, but I honestly don't think it matters who gets elected, so maybe the corporations save their money on the election and just buy policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at business in the world, you can see a monopoly or oligarchy emerging.  The established corporations buy smaller emerging ones, so they can maintain their power.  Cartels (utilities- electric, gas, cable, cell phones) fix rates so they all profit excessively.  Now, I know it's taking a leap in the absence of fact, but it would make sense that the major corporations are all owned by a cartel of individuals (or families) who have had money for 1000s of years.  I'm not implying the satanic illumanati blah blah blah, but when you look strictly at how business has evolved, it makes sense that a group of very rich people are jointly running the massive corporations. And when everything the government needs (food, resources, raw materials, money, vehicles, weapons, R&amp;D) is provided ultimately by a small group of people, they control a government's moves.

       These Families have control over the world since a long time ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are using different power structures to achive their goals.(Bilderberg,CFR,Trilateral,Bohemian Grove,Skull &amp; Bones,Zionism etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no doubt that the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds have a special place in this hierachy.

      <p>
       Its the modern Illuminati coming from the original bavarian Illuminati.

       There is a question that I want to pose to the regular posters here on r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you're certain the government wants to murder you, poison you, take away your guns, take away your rights, put you in camps..ETC
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you doing nothing about it? I mean, you literally believe you're going to be murdered by your government, but you sit around doing nothing, moaning on the internet, going to work and living life exactly as normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, that in your heart of hearts, none of you actually believe this nonsense. If you did, you'd go out and do something about it, you wouldn't be sitting on the internet reading blogs.

       You can try to wake up and inform the people that matter to you, as well as make some personal preparations.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good part of surviving disaster is about attitude. You have to change your mindset from that of a victim to that of a survivor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your actual survival will depend on circumstance, a good amount of luck, planning, what you have, and your other skills, but it all means nothing if you give up because you "wah wah can't do anything about it".

       Strange how I graduated at the top of my class in chemical engineering then. The disaster is when people start getting rounded up and shot, man. Every time the public gets disarmed it leads to genocide. Nobody is holding a gun to your head and making you read this sub. Wake the fuck up duder.

       1915-1917, Turkey, 1-1.5 million Armenians killed

      <p>
       1929-1953, The Soviet Union, 20 million deaths

      <p>
       1933-1945, Nazis, 8-13 million - the scariest for me because it was a "slow burn" at the beginning
      </p>
      <p>
       1949-1952, 1957-1960, 1966-1976 (you let it happen THREE times? that's what the Constitution's there for, folks), China, another 20 million died

       1960-1981, Guatemala, 100,000 deaths (Myan genocide)

       So going by history here, it doesn't look like very nice people want to take away your ability to defend yourself. Not the type of person I would want to trust, anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot answer your questions for the "UK genocide", as they would require premonition and I would not be wasting my time on the internet if I could tell the future. No matter who does it and when, it will always be for power -- power for power's sake.
      </p>
      <p>
       During peace, banks, economies, and lobby groups take the wealth of the many and redistribute it to the few. During war they'll just shoot your family and take your shit right out of the front door, no secrecy required.

       None of those examples come from a first world democracy. None of those examples would be any different if everybody had a gun.

      <p>
       Armenian genocide didn't happen because guns were taken away, the guns were taken away at the start of the war. Doesn't support your point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chinas genocides were all about famine and starvation, absolutely nothing to do with guns.

      <p>
       The soviet union death toll has absolutely nothing to do with guns.

       They were taken away at the start of the war to make the genocide easier to pull off: how could that not support my point? And you dodged the Nazi example, as the Germans did indeed vote Hitler into power -- totally, being armed wouldn't have helped save a single Jew or Gypsy. /s

       And if I had a time machine and I could send you back to the days of Stalin's regime, and I offered you a gun before pressing the button, you'd refuse because it's going to have no outcome on what happens to you? Give me a break.

       The Fed wants to tie our hands behind our back and promises not to hit us when we can't defend ourselves. And because you live in a "first world democracy" (because you've been told that you do, and that this is good), they're totally trustworthy, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck that. If nothing's going to happen then why do they want to take the guns away? Why are our generals and admirals being asked if they would KILL American CITIZENS if they wouldn't give up their guns?

       I know that you have a brain, I know you have powers of logic. I know that r/conspiracy has a lot of bullshit and a lot of unimportant "how is this a conspiracy" shit, but I feel like you come here to debate us for other reasons. I won't act like I know you -- but to me, it feels like you are kind of afraid of what we've been predicting regarding the current state of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe when you refute our arguments and evidence (usually you just write them off), you're trying to prove to yourself that what we're saying won't happen. Hey, I don't believe half of the shit that I see on this sub, but you have to keep your eyes open to see the fire on the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love you like a brother man, but you can't be so arrogant and think that we (as a people/culture) know everything there is to know and that we're
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       much different from cultures that came before. We're not enlightened, people are shitty to each other, and have always been shitty to each other. It's "a conspiracy theory" if you don't want to be a victim.

       We're facing a civil collapse here if the economy goes. Look at the numbers. Our debt is insane, there's no way that we can get it under control, the world's banks are already failing, and the world doesn't have enough money to pay its own debts. The US economy is a house of cards and 2008 was a small hiccup compared to what's going to happen when it all comes down (many economists/people with math skillz can see that the economy is totally unsustainable). So that's what I'm going to guess would start it off.

      <p>
       That's as much as I feel like writing because it seems like if a dog took a shit on your face while you were sleeping, you'd smell it, touch it, look at it, maybe even taste it, and have so little faith in your own facilities that you'd send it to a lab to prove it was shit before you believed your own eyes.

       I guarantee that 100k of survival equipment that dude has bought, will go to waste, or atleast won't be used for the purpose he currently thinks it will.

       Who gives a shit? Oh yeah, you do. You dont know if he has spent a dime on anything, I certainly havent. You sound like a raving lunatic way more than the people around here, and there are some really fucking crazy people around here. you got issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       just because people are interested in these stories does not mean everyone believes everything, its just very interesting shit, way more interesting than the bullshit you watch on tv. Frankly, you are just a teenager who thinks you are smarter than everyone else in the world, and its your mission to educate all the dumbasses. In short, you are  a narcissist.

       It is very interesting, man. I'm sure that many of us here are notorious for wikidiving too... it's just insane how much information you can consume when it's engaging. People here don't believe everything on the sub, that would be just as bad as believing everything you see on the news, or commercials...

       Yeah thats the whole thing. All of
       <em>
        this

       is the most fascinating thing on earth. Way more interesting than any movie or tv show or even most books ever written. Its just goddamn

       Well unlike American libertarians who think everything is about themselves, most of us actually care about the welfare of others in society. You don't want your fellow man being scammed, especially when it's putting them in to a state of fear and alarm.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you grow up, and realise libertarianism is one of the most laughable ideologies around and only exists on the internet, you'll feel differently in regards to these issues.

       "Cherry-picking" an argument, ladies and gentlemen. Because he can't believe a word I say... oh except when it supports his arguments, or makes him feel intellectually superior to me. And I guarantee that somebody with $100,000 of equipment would not be blowing it up on the internet -- seriously bub?

       So why do you care what I spend my money on? And I don't have $100,000 of survival equipment either, it was bait that you happily gobbled up. Paranoia and skepticism are justified with evidence, but if you only consider MSM to be the portal of truth and objective analysis, you'll only accept the reality that they sell
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       They are abusing your fear of the unknown and cashing in on it. If it's free,
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       are the product.
