        This week I've seen multiple posts that can
        <strong>
         only
        </strong>
        be described as anti-Semitic
       </a>
       . I am openly opposed to Israeli State actions and view the way their lobby manipulates the US Government as a deep conspiracy, however, there is a clear difference in being opposed to a government's and people's policies and being outright prejudiced against a specific religion or people. I've been on this sub for 2+ years, and the depths of racism that it has fallen too is amazingly scary. Mods, do something about this!

       I have read YOUR post history and I simply don't see where you stand up at all for equality for Palestinians, for freedom for Palestinians, for representation in their government for Palestinians or for protection under the law for the Palestinians.  I simply don't see you doing anything except describing those of us who DO stand up for this as racists, trolls and stormfronters.  I see you as someone who is trying to put an end to our right to speak out for The Palestinians and their decades-long suffering by labeling us all as Anti-Semites.  I see you as being dishonest about your own motives here.

       I believe that the trolls (professional or not) are gaming the subreddit by manipulating the voting system through using a script that manages multiple accounts as well as creating silly posts and comments to poison the well. Not that all of the trolls are being insincere about it. Some actually get a sense of personal satisfaction from mocking others who believe the govt has proven itself to be untrustworthy, as misinformed as that is. However, we
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       know the govt openly admits to having a program to manipulate social media websites and this particular subreddit would be a hot target.

       Best thing to do is be polite, strong willed, logical and most of all persistent.

       Fuck off with that patronizing bs you racist scum. Why would I want to discuss anything with your bigoted ass? I doubt you even have the balls to express your opinions in public cause you know you'd get your lame ass knocked down.

       They're interesting. There's different kinds, shades of grey from slight paranoia to full blown belief in chemtrails, UFO's, lizard people, and deeply disturbing and plain wrong denial of 9/11 terrorist attacks, Sandy Hook and Aurora massacres, or the holocaust.

       He's a blatant racist. I mean, he's a director of the American Freedom Party, which argues for a white supremacist American state. He doesn't believe in the Holocaust. His continued existence at CSULB is proof that free speech still exists, no matter how vile the speech is.

       He's been accused of academic fraud, his papers have not gained peer worthiness, and all his supporters of merit are considered to be either closet racists or outright anti-Semites. It's like the equivalent of me holding David Icke as proof that lizard people really do control the world. Oops, my apologies, just change "lizard" with "Jewish" and they're the exact same.

       No, I've been exposed to the ideas people like you present tot, as I've read enough about Nazism to understand you're taking advantage of a racial/religious/creedist separation to promote
       <em>
        your

       personal ideology because
       <em>

       are right and everyone else is wrong. You in particular are bad at taking plays straight from Goebbels' playbook tot, as you are a flat out bigot trying to promote your racial ideology.

       So if more than one person seems to disagree with you, that means it's actually just one person with multiple accounts. Because clearly everyone in the world agrees with you, and only one person disagrees.

       This is your logic, I hope you appreciate how idiotic it sounds. Oh, and just to be clear, no I'm not the guy you initially replied to.

       So I am someone else simply because my post count is one and thereby I am new? 
By your logic, there are no new users on Reddit. 
By your logic, all posts are from the same person, since no new users means only one user on Reddit. 
By your logic, we are the same person and you have been arguing with yourself.
Continuing this logic, you have multiple personality disorder and possibly paranoid schizophrenia since you seem to believe everyone is actually one person who is against you.

       Very well then, show me the working of your logic and how this led you to come to your conclusion.

       And while you are busy with that mental olympics, I'll quote the subreddit's  description. It goes as follows "This subreddit is a thinking ground, above all else we respect everyone's opinions and ALL religious beliefs and creeds." Let me condense that: "...we respect everyone's opinions..."
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not. You are in violation of what this board stands for. You have called me a racist, worthless, a bigot and "scum ass" whatever that may be. I have not said anything racist, nor bigoted. I must assume that you have painted me with the same brush as you have others. That is called prejudice, or bigotry.

       You also insult, belittle and threaten violence on everyone who does not share your opinion. You seem to have an issue with freedom of speech. This is fascism.

       I am not promoting any Ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather I speak against all Ideologies and Zionism in particular because of it's wide influence and obvious use of propaganda, control of media,  history of corruption etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       In my humble opinion all humanity is equal at least in dignity. It is a common thread of which you are not apart of. If anything I'd be neutral but the side of truth and justice is squarely and uniformly

        not

       Zionist.

       Any way for future reference this sums up the way i feel about Jews:

      <p>
       That said Zionism will ultimately fail. Not because of me or whiterighter bigots, not because of Greece. It will be it's own undoing and your damn fault.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any way. Keep it up. I'd ask you to remain civil but I know you won't.

       lol. bigot comes out of closet as bigot, but then refused to accept he's a bigot because the implications are too negative on the self-worth to handle. liberal education really messed up your head huh? sorry you're stuck with this identity crisis and like a hundred years out of date to be a racist nobody without consequences. It must sucks that everyone knows your racial ideology and worldview is nothing but a blight on this world. I mean, it must keep morale real low for you guys, hence all the unwillingness to accept your own identities as loser skinheads and reliance on petty trolling with seriously unsound 'philosophising' (it's the only word to describe that jumbled mess of shit you just wrote) to back up your stupid ideology.

       Spoken like a backwater hick who no one likes or respects. Congratulations 'mahm, you have reached the definition of trash. Now you and your butt buddies go play and find reason everyone else is to blame for you guys being white trash. Sometimes I pity you guys, but mostly I remember watching your buddies get beat up by Mexicans and Anarchists growing up. Good times. ;)

       Liar. You are a fucking liar. picture of ur hand with a time stamp or you're just bigot trash like the rest. I will actually discuss Babylon and treat you with a short respect during the conversation if you do this. If not, I'm justified in thinking you're a lying hillbilly fuck who has a very low education and is unworthy of tolerance or respect.

       Ha. I will do no such thing and you may think as you wish. Not just because You are an agent of babylon. Also I have noticeable hands and no camera. I do not desire your respect. And you can justify your thoughts any damned way you choose.

       In the eyes of the Almighty One I'd rather suffer your intolerance and hypocrisy so that others may open their eyes. Everyone is worthy of tolerance and respect. Especially those who disagree with you and Imperialist bull shit. Those who you deem so low while you have no clue just how truthfully one live.

       So now blacks aren't allowed to be anti-Zionist? That is mighty racist of you. Assuming anti-Zionists are white. And calling a, presumed, white person a "hill-billy fuck" is also racist. Seems that the only racist person here is you.

       Violence has it's place in society, you know, otherwise the police wouldn't wield it all the time with such
       <em>
        efficiency
       </em>
       , and if it's used dealing with people who openly seek to exploit racial divides to create a society of fear with rights for some and not for all than I am in full support of that violence being used to defend the nature of a fair and equal society. I don't care if you try to bastardize the word 'hate' to somehow mean "willing to use violence", because that's not what the word means, nor do we as a society consider it 'hate' when police use violence to defend the law and order for the people. You as well have a markedly poor understanding of fascism if you don't understand how insidious an ideology it is, and how people use race as the predominate means of creating an 'us vs them' dialectic that allows for totalitarianism. Go back to lala land if you must, but just know you're tacitly (if not openly) supporting Nazism by defending these bastards like tot who would seek to create a racially codified world.
