       North Korea has no way to support itself after these sanctions go through, they have no means to continue on, and thats why they are threatening with war. In reality they are bluffing and just want the sanctions removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a time where North Korea can be taken advantaged of, to do almost anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats one possibility, or the other is much worse. All the media coverage of NK is used to push the rhetoric that NK is going to attack, blame a false flag on it, and things start moving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mossad could use NK as a scape goat for something worse, or the US could.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just be wary if anything happens, and look deeper than just NK.

       Or NK could use a nuke, chemical or biological weapon in or near the US and the media could downplay it as an accident or the work of some domestic group or al-Qaeda.  They would then get "Sorcha Faal" to write a piece saying that it was North Korea and that they used Soviet-developed "scalar" weapons to discredit any notion that it might have been NK.  Not that it's a bad thing.

       cuz they're close by, pretty much lol. And also near China. The first invasion, was ordered by toyotomo hideyoshi, I believe. Around that time, Japan was more or less unified, and had a hunch of battle hungry soldiers around. So they sent them all over there to die and whatnot. Until Japan had their industrial era, they were pretty cool with Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then during the Sino-Japanese war, fighting did take place in Korea, but it was mostly against Chinese.
      </p>
      <p>
       Japan did way way WAY worse things to China, than they've done to Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainly Japs are flat out xenophobic, and that's the only reason they hate Koreans.

       Fair enough, but I'm talking special ops.  Surely they can feed the fewer special ops soldiers a bit better than the average soldier, and certainly way better than the average NK citizen.
