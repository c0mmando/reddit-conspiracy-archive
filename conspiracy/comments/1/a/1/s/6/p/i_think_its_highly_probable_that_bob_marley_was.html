        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay guys I&#39;m not going to waste time looking for sources for everything I&#39;m about to write, but the information is widely available all you need to do is google it. </p>

<p>There are a few reasons why I think Bob was indeed murdered. </p>

<p>Firstly, the CIA are known to have kept extensive records on Bob, where he was going, who he was meeting etc etc. These records have still not been fully released so obviously some foul play must have been occurring at the time...</p>

<p>Secondly, during the period of political unrest in Jamaica leading up to the first assassination attempt, I remember from the Marley movie that Bob had two CIA bodyguards. The night of the attempted assassination these bodyguards apparently didn&#39;t show. Coincidence? I think not, the CIA clearly knew something that Bob and his entourage did not. Even if this attempt on Bobs life was not carried out directly by the CIA, more likely a hired gun, it remains extremely suspicious. </p>

<p>Thirdly, and most shockingly, I have read that Bob was given some football boots by the son of someone working in the CIA (can&#39;t remember exact details, google it). When Bob put these boots on he was pricked in the foot by what appeared to be a small copper wire. A few months later Bob suspiciously got cancer in the same toe. I find it hard to believe that a strong, healthy, mixed race man could get skin cancer in a part of his body mostly covered from sunlight... I wonder what the odds are. This whole football foot incident is so unbelievably suspicious and combined with the previous happenings with the CIA I really do think Bob was murdered.</p>

<p>Why did the CIA want Bob dead? He was quickly becoming one of the most powerful, and revolutionary males on the planet. This was not a typical 3rd world revolution though, this was a revolution of peoples minds and self identity not of violence. Bobs vision of a better, more equal, and more loving global system simply did not conform to the western ideas of hierarchy, consumerism, materialism, racialism etc. </p>

<p>Please people tell me I&#39;m not crazy, it seems so goddam obvious.... </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Some more information regarding the cancer:</p>

<p><em>Bob Marley died of melanoma cancer in 1981. He was 36-years-old. The official report is he contracted cancer after injuring his toe which never healed while playing football in 1977. The conspiracy theorists allege that Marley was given a pair of boots with a piece of copper wire inside that was coated with a carcinogenic substance that pricked his big toe by Carl Colby, son of the late CIA director William Colby. There is an eerie similarity between Marley and Castro involving poisoned shoes.  Cuban ambassador to T&amp;T, Humberto Rivero said the CIA and Cuban exiles tried more than 600 attempts to kill Castro from exploding cigars, injecting him with cancer, to a wet suit lined with poison. In the case of Marley the CIA allegedly used cancer in his shoes, for Castro they placed the highly toxic poison thallium salts in his shoes. After only eight months being elected as Prime Minister of Dominica, radical politician Rosie Douglas was found dead on the floor of his residence in 2000.</em> <a href="http://guardian.co.tt/lifestyle/2012-02-27/cancer-secret-weapon">Source</a></p>
