       Two wars costing trillions and skyrocketing our debt, putting neocons in power and deregulation of everything causing financial collapses, privacy is a thing of the past, and now we're cutting meals on wheels and other social programs because we don't have any money from wars and yet cutting defense is not an option.

       I just find it interesting that they kind of won way more than they expected.

       You are too entrenched in the official narrative. The "terrorists" haven't won; they don't even exist, not in the Arab/Muslim fanatical bomb-everyone for Allah kind of way we've been told. Terrorism is a pretext for the expensive adventures overseas, not the cause.

       The point is, the terrorists were the ones calling the shots on 9/11. Cheney mainly, bush was a puppet, a patsy if you will. Terrorists were the ones denying aid to natural disasters. Terrorists are the people holding this country hostage over demands that the richest of us keep getting richer, and the poor get poorer. Only a Terrorist would say that the brave men and women returning home from fighting the wars of the rich are potential terrorist threats. A Terrorist would continually lie to the people they are supposed to be leading.
      </p>
      <p>
       They changed the meaning of the word Terrorist, to suit whoever they want to get rid of. It doesn't take much these days to wind up on that list. Hell for me saying Terrorist so many times in one post, I'm sure I'm getting looked into. You wanna protest? TERRORIST! You want money from the government to help you survive? TERRORIST! You want to be able to choose what substance you put into your body? TERRORIST! You want to grow a vegetable garden on your own property? TERRORIST!

       Stealing the world's wealth for the benefit of the top 1% of income earners? You're right, that's not terrorism. Thats life.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, sure. My statement was oversimplified. America isn't the sole terrorist of the world. Obviously. But, they're terrorizing the most amount of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very word, "terrorism" is relative. It all depends on who is defining it. Its rooted from the french revolution and was used by the governments being overthrown. If history tells us anything, it's original meaning and connotation haven't changed and will never change.

       Hm, kinda. The point I was trying to make is that there are armed resistance groups who plan bombings and murders all the time. Is it really unbelievable that some of them would be able to carry off a larger scale attack like 9/11?

       Pahaha, buddy. 9/11 isn't what we think. You can either listen to the variety of experts and professionals or you can listen to the report from a branch of Federal govt. Take your pick. I'm not saying I know what happened that day, but why the frick did those towers fall along with tower 7 that contained tons of SEC information?
      </p>
      <p>
       I was 8 when this happened and even to me, the towers falling was completely out of nowhere. It shouldn't have happened and if only two planes had hit the buildings then they should still be around

       So you're telling me, these 1,600 expert architects and engineers don't know what they're talking about? They just made a 2hr documentary to ruin the validity of their careers? No big deal, it only takes like 10+ years of schooling to get to their spot. So why not ruin your career you worked so hard for... Dude, shutup. 9/11 was a demolition.

       Popular mechanics is apart of the Hearst corporation who is also responsible for Seventeen, Cosmopolitan, Oprah, Esquire and many other mainstream magazines and newspapers.

      <p>
       In fact, they even own 50% of the A&amp;E tv networks. So popular mechanics is apart of the same corporation that released the video. So yeah.

       I'm familiar with the "terrorists have won" meme. But I personally reject it, because it implicitly concedes that 9/11 was caused by the type of terrorists described by the official story. That, in and of itself, is a huge victory for the actual perpetrators of 9/11.

       You guys really need to stop this "9/11 inside job" crap. It discredits any actual things that happened. Like the neoconservative takeover because of it. Concentrate on that instead of the stuff about bombs in buildings and building 7. It's how they can easily discredit people.

       Mate, you need to spend some time not watching TV and thinking on your own. Believing the official 9/11 story is up there with believing in Santa Claus.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give you just one of the hundred reasons it's ridiculous:
 - On 9/10 David Rumsfeld says Pentagon can't account for 2.4 trillion dollars.
 - On 9/11 the Budget Analysis department of Pentagon is destroyed, most of the dead people are accountants.
 - Same day building 7 of the WTC is destroyed, Pentagon's primary financial information backup site was in that building.

       There are a thousand reasons 9/11 was shady, the 'missing trillions' are not a good hook to hang your hat on.  The funds were not gone, they fell through the cracks due to poorly maintained, outdated and manual accounting systems.  90% of those discrepancies were reconciled within a year.

       It's straight accounting, there are no witnesses and evidence  is replicated ten different ways in twenty different places.  Personally I believe that Dov played a key role in the attacks, but I don't think covering up accounting fraud was why he was hired.

       Accounting of a big organization is extremely complex. Data can be replicated billions of times, but without people who understand it, it doesn't matter. E.g. the data on how to build an intelligent machine is copied a hundred trillion times in each of the 7 billion people on Earth, still no one is able to understand and use it.

       Outside of Sarbanes Oxley, there are very few laws regulating corporate accounting. We're a self-regulating profession.

       Which is irrelevant anyway, because the federal government is not subject to the same rules.

       Underwear bomber was an inside job.  It was an intelligence agency that conducted the operation.  Maybe they had stock in L3 and it's back-scatter scanners.  Point is, the 19 year old moron they had carry out the attack was a "patsy" in every sense of the word.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, we recognize that "insider trading" is a real thing.  The fact is, that the government didn't have to create 9/11 to benefit from it.  They just had to see it happening before it did and figure out a way to gain from it.

       You can look at this two ways.  One is to see that OBL set out to bankrupt the US via asymmetric warfare, and that GWB stupidly obliged him.  The other is to see that OBL was a CIA asset, that 9/11 was presaged on Federal Reserve Notes and in popular television, that the WTC was demolished, and that the implosion of the US economy has been engineered.

       But since you brought it up, no, it's not more important.  But making idiotic claims about 9/11 being "an inside job" genuinely harms the ability of small government and liberty advocates to accomplish anything, because we get unfortunately and unfairly lumped in with such stupid claims.

       What is the terrorists' objective?
      </p>
      <p>
       Officially, it is to convert all persons to Islamic fundamentalism through the use of force. I like the Koran, and I like Muslims, but I have not been converted to Islamic Fundamentalism, and never will be. I am also not afraid, and I do believe that I am serving Allah, if Allah is truly the single God of all the universe, by reacting with tolerance towards all people, not hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the terrorists' objective was to spread Islam, it didn't work. If it was to kill infidels, it may have technically worked, but at such an extraordinary cost to those who believe in Fundamentalist Islam and Islam in general that it could not be the reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone did plan the attacks, and understand what the effects would be, their objectives would have been:
      </p>
      <p>
       -Create a massive surge of negative emotion through a world-wide visible ritual of death.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Turn brother against brother to cause more death, destruction, and killing worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Facilitate approval towards those in power who disapproved of the terrorist act.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR If the terrorists wanted to spread Islam, they failed. If some higher power wanted to cause massive fear, destruction, death, and centralize power, they succeeded.
       </strong>

       They don't. These "terrorists" who we are fighting against in the Middle East are more worried about getting electricity. Most of the people we are actively engaging are still living in the stone age. Fuck, when we got over there they thought we were Russians in some villages. They are so out of touch that they didn't know the Soviets left.

       Since our American government is the terrorist, once you look at the man behind the curtain, it is of no surprise. It was their intent to win from the beginning. The only thing left to ponder over is what happens next. This has been happening for 60-70+ years. I fear it will only be more and more grim. Fortunately most people are ignorant to these issues and get to live a life of blissful materialism. Critical mass is approaching though, you can bet on that. Somewhere down the road, some event will start a shitstorm. It's not guessing as much as viewing facts. Every empire before has collapsed, with some calamity. History will not exclude us.

       It's straight accounting, there are no witnesses and evidence  is replicated ten different ways in twenty different places.  Personally I believe that Dov played a key role in the attacks, but I don't think covering up accounting fraud was why he was hired.

       Stealing the world's wealth for the benefit of the top 1% of income earners? You're right, that's not terrorism. Thats life.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, sure. My statement was oversimplified. America isn't the sole terrorist of the world. Obviously. But, they're terrorizing the most amount of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very word, "terrorism" is relative. It all depends on who is defining it. Its rooted from the french revolution and was used by the governments being overthrown. If history tells us anything, it's original meaning and connotation haven't changed and will never change.
