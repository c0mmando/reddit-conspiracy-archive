       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen%27s_arrest#United_States">
        Laws regarding citizen's arrest
       </a>
       vary from state to state, but the basic idea seems to be:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A private person may arrest another:
For a public offense committed or attempted in his/her presence.
When the person arrested has committed a felony, although not in his presence.
When a felony has been in fact committed, and he or she has reasonable cause for believing the person arrested to have committed it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Money laundering, accessories to murder, felony fraud, racketeering, innumerable counts of larceny, etc. are the felonies that many of these bankers have already committed and still continue to commit before our very eyes. There are mountains of legal evidence against them for a case, so I would think there's enough to make a citizen's arrest too. Additionally:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        To make an arrest, a private person, if the offense is a felony, and in all cases a peace officer, may break open the door or window of the house in which the person to be arrested is, or in which they have reasonable grounds for believing the person to be, after having demanded admittance and explained the purpose for which admittance is desired.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, what's stopping us from singling out those responsible for these illicit operations, breaking down the gates and doors of their mansions to arrest them, and bringing them before courts en masse? I think this is an avenue that hasn't been explored enough by the American people yet and would love to see some discussion about the potential risks and rewards of it.

       I fully support the idea of arresting these d-bags, but let me point out something that I immediately considered after reading these posts: these banking executives very likely have armed bodyguards.  In any scenario where you could get close to the banker, you would very likely be facing a hail of gunfire in "self-defense."  I imagine this has a lot to do with why execs haven't at the very least been citizen arrested at this point.  You would have to plan very carefully to get close and disarm these individuals.

       Easy way to protect yourself from that would be to have someone video tape the citizen's arrest, and have everyone shouting the fact that they're making a citizen's arrest. That way he can't justify gunfire in self defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       To protect from him just destroying the camera, have it live stream to a recording PC (and make sure the banker knows this is happening before he does anything rash). If something bad goes down, your friend safe at home can show the video to authorities.

       don't forget, it's totally legal to call up any/all of the militia.  Then the government would be in the position of taking up arms in favor of felons (rather than begrudgingly supporting them in the open).  Also, as counterintuitive as I'm sure it may seem to some here, I believe the militia would be in a better position to handle things non-violently.  Far better than a mob.

       Well my hope is that a militia is comprised of more thoughtful people than terrorists.  Plus executions would be waaaaay over the line.  This would be delivering into the hands of the judicial system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, win or lose, it would force positions to be taken- either for the people or against them.  We can't keep the national discussion stagnant.

       What's the other option?  An angry, untrained mob?  They'll just go after whomever is the current head.  Use the tools at our disposal.  Nothing will happen otherwise- our leaders have
       <em>
        already

       stated so.

       the other option was just go with video camera to film arrest. I do support the militia movement and think they could be very useful but i think it would be better to try the citizen arrest without them first as any firing could be blamed on them and used for a reason to label all of us domestic terrorists

       well there's nothing saying that using a militia
       <em>
        needs
       </em>
       to be violent.  And having some protection there for the arrestor is probably warranted since he's probably going to get hassled by the cops and arrested himself, or beaten senseless by the guards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless, whomever decides to do it, and his accomplices
       <em>
        needs
       </em>
       to be well-groomed and take thought to their appearance.  Recording it and getting it out there, the whole stunt could go south quickly if people thought you were just some punk or hobo.  There needs to be statements pre-written and wording figured out beforehand.

       It should be easy to bring 500 or more people with you for what they have done. Body guards are not going to stand by your side against a calm and patient 500 man strong group demanding your arrest. Catch them in a public place, surround the exits to their homes, make it a camp out siege if you have to. Don't break any laws trying to break in to private property to seize them, just wait them out. The longer it goes on, the bigger the publicity will be.

       I totally agree but if fifty people were standing between him and escape I doubt the bodyguards would shoot.
But good luck finding fifty people with balls big enough to not scared when they pull guns or cops show up.

       Why does it have to get violent? Be civil about it, you are only a civilian arresting another. You would have no right to attack him, unless provoked or they resist. Anyway, you get enough people and the body guards probably wouldn't try to stop you.

       Except that arresting is done legally while kidnapping is done illegally. If you keep everything within the confines of the law, any opposition you face is resisting arrest, and aiding and abetting a fugitive.

       but fortunately the act of talking about it at least then forces them to spend extra cash on bodyguards.

       so maybe we should be talking about aerial attack so they have to buy other expensive gear to protect themselves.

       the more diverse threats we can imagine credibly, the more they'll have to spend on defense.

       Very true.  It's also true, though, that we put a lot more importance on that money than it is truly worth.  Money works now because it gives people power.  There
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       come time in the future, even if not in our life time, when money is unnecessary.

       I can agree with your distinction, that money was taken from us and is being used against us, but it is not our goal to get our money back but to change the system that made money(power/control) important over all else.

       I think you're forgetting half of all people fall below average intelligence, and they're the ones pumping out kids before they're ready. All you need to perpetuate the idea that money=power is a class of undereducated, underfunded people who see people with money and want it.

       i always thought it'd be cool if local OWS encampments utilized Skygrabber to at least intercept footage.

       apparently encryption was stopped because of performance issues, so even without putting the footage to good use, just having it would require the fascists to encrypt their feeds and thereby lose drone performance.

       The sad thing is that you don't even need something that powerful.  As much as I love the Barrett .50s, an average hunting rifle in .308 and up can get the job done at a little over half a mile.  I'm a .30-06 guy myself.

       There are white hats in the military and private sector that have been watching this develop for many years. I could post names but it would only cause confusion as the naysayers would indeed arrive and start posting lies and slander.Also they are working in the line of danger and we need not distract. What you can do to get involved is shut out all mainstream sources of news and entertainment. Stop paying for all propaganda. These criminals know very well the power of our collective consciences and want to distract us from knowing how powerful we are against them. The damn television has brainwashed many but many more have already awakened to their game of cointelpro and mockingbird. Not to mention paperclip where as the scumbags.prescott bush brought the nazis home to us to set up the CIA.OSS and brought the nazi propaganda machine as well.
So use our minds against them. It does work,pray meditate think positive
Enough people have been harmed. We want no more confrontation. 
We are many they are few. The rest is up to you

       Evidence that can incriminate bankers in a court of law.

       This is exactly the problem. Disregarding the arrest portion, even a criminal indictment before the court can't move forward without the governments approval. It's the perfect methodology for a crime, control the government.

      <p>
       I think this is the biggest flaw of the argument made by this thread. These people can bend the law and know the loop holes of the law to get away. When they do get away, we would be their next targets too - so we need to keep that in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are risking a lot and I still think there is not a single evidence that we actually hold against them in court. Besides, we assume the judicial system actually works and will punish them... but we know this is far from reality. Rich and popular people have always got out of jail by doing very little punishment and in most cases, they get away with the crimes completely and write books about it. I think it is great that we are thinking in this manner and maybe we can pull it off if we get the media involved in it but we better have all the right things in the first try. I am saying this because it only takes one failed attempt for everyone to think we are just tin-foil hat wearing weirdos that shouldn't ever be taken seriously again, and we won't be able to do this all over again with another banker.

      <p>
       The evidence exists, it's not up to the arresting person to have it though:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When a felony has been in fact committed, and
        <strong>
         he or she has reasonable cause
        </strong>
        for believing the person arrested to have committed it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, from a technical standpoint it's completely doable. Even if it didn't result in a conviction I think the message of arrests is enough to make a point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Off the back of it, you'll have people in the justice system who are willing to go out on a limb and make a name for themselves pursuing it through more conventional means.

       Is the blame really all on them anyway? Don't forget the government our President has committed treason and lied at every chance he has gotten. As a country we torture our enemies and bomb them in their places of worship, while they build death camps to house us and they plan more wars on our behalf. The IRS buys shotguns and homeland security stockpiles enough bullets to kill every man woman and child in america 5 times over and they tell us it is for our protection. Our Congress has totally caved and even when we call in 500 to 1 on bills that no one agrees with they go against the will of the people. There hasn't been a fair vote in years and with things the way they are one is not likely to come. We train our police to be ruthless highly militarized forces armed with tanks and drones and god knows what else to unleash havoc on the citizens. No longer are they there to serve and protect but to carve out the kings taxes off the backs of the slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pulling corrupt bankers out of their offices to hand over to corrupt Police, and brought in front of corrupt Judges bought and paid for with bailout money in their pockets though I would love to witness seems like a failing proposition. I agree if we wan't to fight back then we need to take matters into our own hands as a citizenry and tear down the windmills that stand in our way. But be careful when fighting monsters lest you become one yourself.

       By what book? And the only way to do it would be with violent aggression...if there was a peaceful way to fix the problems with this country they would be fixed. There is simply and absolutely no peaceful way to dethrone a tyrant, much less a band of tyrant brothers with hundreds of years of brilliant defensive framework in place. If you wanna bring down a giant you need to be willing to get dirty.

       I see where you are coming from and see the framework you are referring to (they have recruited the most brilliant of the brilliant over decades to design and implement their safeguards), but they are grossly out numbered. There can be a peaceful resolution, but the problem lies with uniting the people, which is the biggest hurdle to clear because in order for that to happen, we must first agree on a common goal and then how to achieve said goal.

       There needs to be substantial physical proof. Records of transactions, and fraud are pretty easy to get ahold of if you know your way through a computer system. If someone gets hard copies of evidence distributed to the masses, I'd like to see them TRY to stop the bankers from being torn limb from limb.

       I agree.  Let it crash and burn.  If it's corrupt from head to foot why let it go on?

       I think mainly because threats are so dire that people can't be arsed, and would rather go on living the illusion and hope for the best for their lot only.   Selfish, not meek.

       You do realize that they're looking for a way to paint people like us in a bad light. They've been calling anyone who questions the current political system "crazy" and have even gone so far as to start calling "patriots" potential terrorists. Once they start hearing about people making "lists for arrest" they'll really start to kick up the heat. Think before you act, we don't need to start a revolution violently.

       Compiling a list of people is exactly the type of things that will get you painted as a "terrorist". You don't need a "list" to arrest people that you know are committing felony offenses. It's bad enough that "conspiracy theorists" and "patriots" are already being accused of terrorist activity.

       Pretty sure citizen's arrest is so you can hand the bad guy over to the police who will book and prosecute. The problem with this idea is that the police will not book and the DA will not prosecute. At least, they wouldn't prosecute the people you brought in. You however, you they will prosecute.

       We have to fix the problem at the top of the government. The bankers and other corporate criminals only get away with their crimes because the politicians let them.

       We need to have well-organized, professional and formal 'Citizens Indictments' - perhaps that could be a step in the right direction. Follow procedure as though it's a Federal Court proceeding and indict the people that the feds don't. At the very least it would bring some of these bad guys into the light of day without getting anyone hurt or arrested. The decision of the Citizen's Grand Jury could be the basis for petition, legal action, media pressure and political pressure on the powers that be to pursue lawbreakers.

       Just get someone with press credentials to schedule an interview and explain that there will be a camera for recording. Have the camera live stream.
       <em>
        Do not
       </em>
       tell them that there will also be 15-50 witnesses there to watch and document the arrest. Stay civil. Hell, you made an appointment, its pretty much the most respectable way to go about it.

       If the government will not arrest them, they won't let the state press charges either. So you could citizen's arrest them, only to have them released as soon as you escorted them to the police station. The government has been bought in almost every country, well, ones with a central banking system anyway. 
I wouldn't be surprised if it was the idea behind the euro, easier to control if they all have the same currency.

       Those are some serious allegations. Is there any concrete evidence depicting these felonies? Sure, it
       <em>
        seems
       </em>
       like these banks have done illegal things, but is there any solid proof
       <strong>
        at all
       </strong>
       that any of these have happened? If not, you probably shouldn't jump the next suit you see on Wall Street. You can't detain someone to bring them in for questioning like the police can (and should, in this case). Citizen's Arrest laws are not excuses to play vigilante freedom fighter.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       holding on to some pieces of paper that unquestionably incriminates a company or an individual in any of these crimes, then arrest away (well, you should probably lawyer-up and call the FBI first, if you think they'll do anything about it). But you better believe the banks are going to have a far superior lawyer than you. To say it would be an uphill battle trying to convict these people would be the understatement to end all understatements (one of the many reasons the gov hasn't gone after them, even if they should). Even if you arrest them, it will be the federal/state governments that will try them in court (their alleged crimes aren't against you, they're against 'the people'). Then when (not if, but
       <em>
        when
       </em>
       ) the bankers win their case in court, they'll go after
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       for unlawful detention/imprisonment, breaking and entering, burglary, trespassing, assault, battery, not to mention every single slander law on the books. And proving those charges would be a cakewalk.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This
        <em>
         is
        </em>
        an avenue that's been explored by the people before; it's just not feasible, practical, or legal.
       </strong>
       There may be some rogues who think they'll stick it to 'the man' and show 'them' who's boss, but the law (and often the evidence) is stacked significantly against them.

       And what do you plan to do once they are "arrested"?  An arrest is meaningless without prosecution.  You can't take them to the jail yourself without the police doing it for you.

       In short, there is no citizens' arrest unless the police and prosecutors are willing to give you backup.

       To win this battle or war all you have to teach each other and others is to bank with local credit unions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't bank with any of the following and discourage the use of them:

       You don't see local credit unions on this list because compared to big bank, we barely use our credit unions.
Teach people about banking with local credit unions and big banks won't have money to buy expensive bodyguards or lawyers but the evidence of corruption will be everpresent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money can be lost, evidence cannot be lost (it can be covered up).

       Not sure if its been said but what's the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The law say sure you can arrest someone but you have to hand them over to Law Enforcement as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you hand them over, irrespective of the evidence you've obtained the DA is going to not press charges. Your banker is released and you'll be arrested for detaining/kidnapping.
      </p>
      <p>
       With your excellent video and admission you give the government the case on a silver platter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you could prosecute the case that would be a different matter.

        So, what's stopping us from singling out those responsible for these illicit operations, breaking down the gates and doors of their mansions to arrest them, and bringing them before courts en masse?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The police. In the words of Lenny Bruce:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "But ya see, I can't do it cause I do business with these assholes, and it looks bad for me, you know, ah . . . so I want somebody to do it for me, you know? So I tell you what: Here's a stick and a gun and you do it -- but wait till I'm out of the room. And, wherever it happens, see, I'll wait back here and I'll watch, you know, and you make sure you kick 'em in the ass and throw 'em in there.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Now you'll hear me say alotta times that it takes a certain kind of mentality to do that work, you know, and all that bullshit, you know, but you understand, it's all horseshit and you just kick em in the ass and make sure it's done."
       </p>
       <p>
        So what happens? Now comes the riot, or the marches -- everybody's wailing, screaming. And you got a guy there, who's standing with a short-sleeved shirt on and a stick in his hand, and the people are yelling, "Gestapo! Gestapo!" at him:
       </p>
       <p>
        "Gestapo? You asshole, I'm the mailman!"
       </p>
       <p>
        That's another big problem. People can't separate the authority and the people who have the authority vested in them. I think you see that a lot in the demonstrations. Cause actually the people are demonstrating not against Vietnam -- they're demonstrating against the police department. Actually, against policemen. Because they have that concept -- that the law and the law enforcement are one.
       </p>

       So, let's presume you do arrest them. You're presuming a power that you lack -- the power to "bring them before the courts." A citizen's arrest is the power to arrest someone
       <em>
        and turn them over to the police
       </em>
       . The prosecutor having authority over the offense then gets to decide whether or not to bring charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I mean, even presuming that you could, why would you?
