I mean people think your lazy if you dont live in a house but i know alot of people who would rather live outside and me personally if i could live in a hut on a beach legally for free i would.  Instead of working for little to no money while barely getting by.

    <div class="md"><p>So then why dont people like you and i just stop playing their game? How would I start a place for people to go that want to farm their own food live off of nature and stop being used by corporations? Are there already places like this that arent on bad soil(for growing crops) and would be open to having somebody show up on their doorstep asking for a piece of their freedom? This is my dream. Sorry for the spelling and gramatical errors im on my phone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that it takes quite a lot of work to grow crops and live off of nature? You would need to work to build shelter to keep from freezing or burning to death. You would need clothes. You would need water. And medicine. It is a lot of work to live like that. </p>

<p>You dont need to put yourself in huge debt for college. Go to a smaller junior college, or become a part time student and only take a few classes at a time. The reason most people get into so much debt is because a lot of people don&#39;t understand how to live within their means. You don&#39;t buy what you cant afford.</p>

<p>Honestly, you sound like someone comming up on the end of highschool, a little apprehensive of the responsibilty of taking care of yourself. And maybe a little lazy, or afraid of work. </p>

<p>Think of it like this: 
-If you lived off the land &quot;free&quot; from work or responsibilty, you would still be working very hard to survive. You would be unable to buy medicine or tools, unless you sold the food you worked so hard to cultivate (in which case you are running a person business and you have to work extra hard to feed yourself). 
-Alternatively, you could also go to a junior college or trade school and study a subject that captures your attention, something you enjoy. And you could do that for a time, earning a currency that you exchange for other people&#39;s work. A person who grows food accepts your currency in exchange for food. A person who makes clothes accepts your currency for clothes. Those people exchange currency for whatever job you do. 
-The end result is pretty much the same, exept in the latter instance you have the luxury of doing something you enjoy for pay. You can get medical attention to your children and loved ones. With even a little wise money management you can do all this quite comfortably, and you can retire and enjoy your time with your grandchildren. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not afraid of work, i work hard everyday, i am in cknstruction... the thing is i work hard to make other people more wealthy while barely being able to get by i went to school to be a chef but working in a restaurant hasnt givin me the ability to make enough to pay off my student loans so i went back to construction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure how being a hard working construction contractor makes others more wealthy. Somebody who purchases your services, is making an investment with their own money. Investments are made in the hopes that they return profit. No different than when you buy that new saw. The guy who made the saw doesn&#39;t think to himself, &quot;Man, i just busted my ass to build that saw, and this dude is going to go make money off of it.&quot;</p>

<p>I think if you are barely able to get by, you need to work on your budget. My wife and I are expecting out first daughter in the next few months. We live in a very small house that we will have paid off in a total of a mere7 years. It is already vastly more valuable than when we purchased it, thanks to the work and money we have invested in it. My wife is an elementary school teacher (teachers are incredibly under paid) and I have some student loans still, but we both live quite comfortably and will continue to be able to do so after our daughter is born. </p>

<p>If you are having trouble just getting by, you might check your finances and work on a budget. Set aside the money for bills and whatnot, and determine how much you can spend where. It is paramount to be rid of any debt that you may have. Firstly, don&#39;t buy anything that you can&#39;t afford (eg. will put you in debt), unless you absolutely need it. Secondly, begin paying off your debts. This is most easliy accomplished by focusing on the smallest one first. Pay all bills, and budget a fraction of what is left to go to the smallest bill of debt (on top of the minimum payment). The way debt works is they give you money and then you owe them more than they gave thanks to interest. If you only ever pay the minimum amount then it will take vastly longer and cost far more to pay off. So, if the minimum payment is 100 dollars consider paying 200 or even 300 dollars. This extra money goes directly to the principal, thus reducing the amount of interest you will accrue. Once you have paid off your smallest debt, you will find that you suddenly have all this money freed up. Seeing as how you were getting by alright with your budget, instead of spending this extra money on something else, put all of it towards the next smallest debt. You will see your debt snowball away, until you have no debt!</p>

<p>That was a long convoluted section. Sorry. It is great that you went to school to be a chef! That is awesome, I always play at being chef when cooking for my wife. What you might consider is putting a little bit of money back every month, towards following that career (assuming that is still something you are passionate about). Maybe purchase a small plot of land and, having experience in the field of construction, build yourself a small resturaunt. Maybe something with minscule overhead, like a small drive-up (building just big enough for whatever cooking equipment you need in order to reduce materials cost and utilities, with a service window. Everybody eats in their cars or at the picnic tables under a tree or something). Be sure to provide food or service that people can get nowhere else. </p>

<p>The absolute worst thing you can do is become disheartened. Becoming debt free is very doable, and that will provide you with the relief I think you are looking for. The people who claim to be slaves are people who have become discouraged by debt and don&#39;t see a way out. It is easier for some to wallow in self-imposed &quot;slavery&quot; than to free themselves from the things that stress them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are very condecending towards me but ok let me explain my situation. I am 24 and i have been in construction since i was 16 i work for three different contractors and work is steady for the most part winter time gets rough my life is blessed for the most part i have enough money to feed my daughter for the most part. i make rent and then im broke i do not have a computer i use my phone to look at the internet i am grateful for the life i live. 2 years ago i went to college while working and i got a cullinary degree i got a job as a chef and worked many long hours to try to come up with the money i needed to survive in the end my career choice wasnt good enough to support the two of us. I work now back in construction. My question is why work to barely be able to survive when if i lived on a beach i would be able to fish for my food work with nature and keep my daughter and i fed without the need to damage the planet... i dont work for myself because i wouldnt be able to find the work without these 3 contractors because work isnt easy to come by so i am making my bosses wealthy while living on just enough money to get by. Until i pay of these loans i am screwed and i have them for 12 more years hopefully work doesnt slow. I cant ruin my credit or i wont be able to own a house... i was working hard for the american dream but it doesnt exist anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am only a few years older than you and I have also worked since I was 16. I worked through the evenings after school and had a 30 hour day on saturdays at a sale barn, dodging cattle and shoveling shit. I am no stranger to back breaking work. Your problem is that you are resigning yourself to the piss-poor work from your 3 contractors. Seek out better employment. You seem to think that your contractors are the only ones who can find you work. You are laying yourself at their mercy, and they don&#39;t sound like they have your best interests at heart. </p>

<p>You sound thankful for the life you have and for you daughter. This is good. But think about her. What happens if you move to a beach and live that way? Are you going to only feed your daughter fish? What about fruit and vegetables, or bread, or clean water? What about medicine? What about shelter? What about an education for her? You think selling seashells is going to provide all that for her? </p>

<p>Do you like to cook? If not find something else you are good at and enjoy. Hell, even if you stay in the construction industry (society needs able builders as much as anything), work on bettering yourself. Learn more about the job, become better at it, learn more about the jobs of the people above you. In the winter, take up a second job. Maybe when construction is slow, thats a good oportunity to work on your cullinary skills as a chef for some more income. You are young yet, eventually you will be better at what you do and you will gain more responsibilty (and more pay). Cut the fat, do away with things you or your daughter dont need (its ok to spend for your daughter&#39;s happiness, she needs to be a kid and such). PAY OFF THOSE DEBTS! Every single dollar that you spend on debt is money in your pocket when you have no debt to pay. Paying off your debt doesnt ruin your credit, so I&#39;m not sure where that came from. </p>

<p>I noticed that you rent. It is diffucult, especially if you are having trouble, but house payments are typically less than rent. If you can Move from renting to owning, that is a big step. You will probably need a loan as there are precious few that can pay cash for a house, but there are some things where the debt is worth it so long as you pay it off as fast as you can. Be sure you don&#39;t buy more than you need. As a construction worker, I&#39;m sure you are more than capable of looking for defects like foundational problems or load-bearing support problems. Find a well built, small house that you can get for a reasonable price (again, never buy more than you need). If you can exchange the cost of rent for the cost of a house you will own then you won&#39;t feel a thing financially (eg. 500 dollars rent utilites included -VS- 300 dollars house payment + 200 dollars utilities). The differnece being that the 500 rent dollars are gone forever, where the 300 house dollars are invested in a thing you own and can sell if you want. </p>

<p>Did I mention that paying off your debt helps quite a lot?</p>

<p>It was not my intention to seem condescending, and I am sorry for that. It is just that I cannot abide people in despair when they don&#39;t need to be despairing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are just content living in a corrupt society? Every aspect of our government is corrupt... the food that we eat is poison is this really better for my daughter i understand your point of view but you are looking at things as if everything is fine and we are being treated fairly. If i were to get more jobs or a better employer does it change the fact that im detroying the planet teaching my daughter horrible values such as capitolism and feeding her food that is raised unhealthy and tainted. I think you should do some reasearch about what is really going on around you.. nothing about this situation we are in is ok...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said it was ok, and I think maybe you should do some research. </p>

<p>Not all food is tainted. I have a freezer full of grass fed beef and I will add half a hog to that as soon as it is finished growing. I get the vast majority of my vegetables from a vegetable garden about 15 minutes from my house.</p>

<p>The only person responsible for teaching your daughter values of any kind is you. She will pick things up from school, but the responsibility of her growth is on your shoulders. If you don&#39;t like capitalism, then why are you teaching your daughter with a capitalist standard? </p>

<p>As for destroying the planet, you can do many things to reduce your impact on the enviroment if you feel strongly about such things. </p>

<p>I would argue that there is no government on this planet that is without corruption. It is the nature of power to corrupt those who hold it. There is also a lot of good in the world around you, and you can&#39;t be discouraged by the corruption you see. Getting a better employer may not cure the government of it sickness, but it will reduce your stress and that is a start. </p>

<p>Try this. Stop buying as many mass produced foods as you can and buy from local small grocers. Or failing that, try a farmers market or other such organic food store. Grow your own vegetables, or buy from somebody who does. I strongly urge you to save up for maybe an entire side of beef (be sure you have enough freezer space!), or you can buy a half side (roughly a quarter of an entire cow). Make sure you get it as locally raised as possible, and stay away from feedlot stock, you want grass fed. Pork can be cheaper because it is a smaller animal. My point is, get a decent quantity of meat that is locally raised and butchered. It will last you a long time and be without all the poison you are worried about (tends to be less expensive per pound as well). You&#39;ve got the cullinary skills. Try getting as much of your food in the most local and most raw forms possible. It stimulates local, small business and gets pure and healthy food in your bellies. </p>

<p>Maybe do away with TV, it would save you whatever your satilite or cable costs and you wouldnt be bombarded with a constant reminder of how stupid many officials can be. It would also allow you and your daughter to read alot more books or listen to music, and you can always buy a tv series or movie if you want to watch it. Try a public library! They cost next to nothing, often times its nothing, and there can be a vast repository of knowledge in one building. </p>

<p>Try something. Try anything! The alternative is that you give up on hope, and you and your daughter live the rest of your days exactly as you describe.</p>

<p>I am not content with living in a corrupt society. But you have to understand that a society is made up of individuals, and society is merely a blanket description of all of these individuals combined. Not everybody is as bad as society seems to portray. The only person who has control over you is you. None of these things I have mentioned are easy to attain, and for the most part all of that corruption you see comes from bad people gaining power by selling easy (AKA convenience). Most people will let anybody walk all over them if they are peddled some cans of easy. It is hard to achieve these goals, especially becoming debt free. But you will find that you have much more control over your life as you start to reach your goals. </p>

Teach her that there are things she can do to work against that, however - difficult as that will be.  Teach her to be intelligent and NOT depend on others too much.</p>

<p>The truth is that it IS a difficult world.  You&#39;re doing <em>nobody</em> any favors by trying to keep them from this very real truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t completely a slave. You currently have a choice between at least 2 career paths that we know of. The construction job probably pays more now but the cooking thing could pay more down the road. 
 Someone I used to work with said to be a great chef you have to attend 1 of 2 schools, one is in France, Cordon Bleu &amp; the other,in America I forget the name of. If you have some talent cooking you may try to attend one of these. You could also improve your knowledge of construction and become a Forman or superintendent or become an inspector or go into home improvement sales. At least you are still able to make choices so don&#39;t get overwhelmed. If you can&#39;t find work in your area try to look into other areas with more wealth. Become a contractor yourself in a better area. 
You are responsible for your daughter and still have to pay rent,bills,taxes,etc. but you do have choices. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>human greed is what allows this debt slavery to continue. Why buy a $300,000 house when a small apartment would have been more than enough? oh wait they don&#39;t make those anymore. American standard nowadays is a mansion with a 2hr commute at 4$/gallon prices.</p>

<p>You can live like that guy in jamaica with no debt, working really 20 hrs a week stress free with plenty of time to do whatever else you want. Even in America. That&#39;s what I&#39;m planning on doing. Plenty of dying towns in America which haven&#39;t been converted into 300K a piece debt mcmansions. You can buy plenty of property in pittsburgh for cash. Hook me up with some public transporation and I wouldn&#39;t really need to work for such lifestyle</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t have to pay for my MSc. Obviously in Scandinavia everyone is paying for free education in taxes, but I&#39;m free to move anywhere obviously. Besides, I don&#39;t think that an around 30% tax rate even is excessive considering we&#39;ve got socialized medicine (which I don&#39;t even use since my employer gives additional private coverage, but whatever). </p>

<p>And yeah, we do work less than people did previously. People retire earlier and Finland has some of the longest yearly holidays in world. My previous workplace had 7-8 weeks paid holiday a year. </p>

<p>Anyways .. most of the worlds problems stem from the amount of people on the planet. Demand is always rising faster than the amount of resources we come up with to meet the demand. </p>

Every aspect of our government is corrupt... the food that we eat is poison is this really better for my daughter i understand your point of view but you are looking at things as if everything is fine and we are being treated fairly. If i were to get more jobs or a better employer does it change the fact that im detroying the planet teaching my daughter horrible values such as capitolism and feeding her food that is raised unhealthy and tainted. I think you should do some reasearch about what is really going on around you.. nothing about this situation we are in is ok...</p>
