       Clarifying: My post is horribly misleading. Anti-depressants can be affective and treating symptoms for depression. My argument is, people become dependant on a drug that treats the symptoms of depression, and doesn't cure the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went to a therapist for a cure not a treatment of a symptom. Treating a system is more profitable than curing an illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depression is more than a chemical imbalance, yet that's what we're told. Add more chemical X and you will be fine!!
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hmm well I still have no ambition, im still lonely and have no life skills, I just feel slightly less shitty about it!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the priority treatment of symptoms through a drug and not a cure through better invested theraputical stratergies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not "well you have low self-esteem and feel worthless so lets find something you have a talent in and start working hard to making yourself a proud person, a long and hard journey that offers a permenant cure"
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead we get "you have low self-esteem and feel worthless? Take this drug you will feel better in 4-6 weeks, keep taking it... maybe forever."
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti-depressants don't fucking work. In fact Therapists and even rehab clinics are horrible at their jobs, the rate of failure to help patients is so high compared to other fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       15% of the population faces General Anxiety Disorder and Depression. That's a large portion of the market. $140 for a 1 hour session. $34 for a box of anti-depressants. I kept that up for 4 years and it didn't help at all. Just make the patient feel a little better, enough to make them think it's working, but enough that they need to keep coming back.
      </p>
      <p>
       There must be people who see the failure rate of anti-depressants, therapy and rehab and just think "Well fuck, this shit works about as much as homeopathy".
      </p>
      <p>
       Why haven't there been any huge leaps in psychology and instead I'm just told to "breath deeply and take these pills".
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this applies to hundreds of industries (sick people = profit) but I think it's pretty sad to prey on people already beaten so low. I'm sure a lot of therapists think it works, it's what they've been told, it pays their bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a wild thought which I'm having ever increasing faith in, anyone like minded?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I beat my depression after moving into a japanese dojo and following their philosphies of life.

       They "work" in the sense that most people aren't depressed anymore. I know when I took them I didn't feel depressed anymore, just numb. To me, no longer being able to feel the full range of human emotion was even worse than being depressed. Makes people into good robots though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's very rare that a person is depressed because their brain "isn't working right", i.e. they have an actual disease. I think it's far more common that a person is depressed precisely because their brain is just fine, and the depression is a perfectly natural response to being in a shit situation. Poor diet, lack of exercise, lack of healthy social interaction, and a crappy repetitive job aren't exactly rare in our society, and I don't think it's such a mystery why depression is so common. It's your brain trying to tell you you need some positive change in your life, and the depression becomes an embedded pattern when instead of making the needed changes to our life, we try to learn to live with depression. Then it becomes a very difficult pattern to break and I can see the appeal of just taking a pill to "make everything better". Of course, the pills just remove the symptoms, they don't really fix the problem.

       I couldn't agree more with this statement, and I will attest to feeling the same things described when taking anti-depressants. It was like they limited my ability to feel
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       , and the sole purpose of my life became coping with my inability to feel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that anti-depressants could serve a purpose, but we have over-prescribed entire generations of young people, because we all want to just take a pill and have everything be alright. There are other ways to get out of depression, and a good majority of the most effective treatments do not rely on big pharma medication at all. I think that anti-depressants should be a last resort; not a first.

       I also took AD meds for about a year. I never noticed a difference either way honestly. The only thing that I saw which was a radical change was an increase of suicidal thoughts. I quit that stuff ASAP. I'd never take it again either

       You are ignoring the heart of his statement. He is not saying they do not work for everybody; you have extrapolated that. He is giving his experience that they do not work for
       <strong>
        everybody in every situation
       </strong>
       , which is true. There are people who are given antidepressants when that is not what they need.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was listening to a neuroscientist just a few days ago on this subject, and he drew the line at physical vs psychological issues. If one is depressed due to biology (brain isn't creating the right mix of chemicals), he would recommend a pharmaceutical approach (anti-depression meds) as the problem can be fixed with the proper chemicals. However, with psychological depression, he felt drugs would only propagate the underlying issues; the issue is not biological imbalance but rather there is typically a lack of meaning or purpose in life, or some other mental block that is causing the patient to not engage with their reality properly. I'm sure there is also a whole spectrum inbetween those two examples as well. The point is that it's not a cut and dry situation; there are different solutions for different cases. Often tho, the medical arena treats everyone the same because it keeps the bills rolling in.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of it, I feel both of you need to get out of 'black-and-white' land. Neither of you is 100% right; it's both ways in different ways.

       It isn't like users on reddit read a headline, and then immediately believe it to be true, so you being critical of his headline is mostly irrelevant. It should be clear that the OP wanted to have a discussion (text-post, no sources or articles), and voiced his personal opinion to begin the discussion.

       I disagree. The OP is speaking from their own personal experience (that is quite clear). From what they wrote, I think psychological depression or an over-diagnosis could be in play, and therefore I think it's completely relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those without a chemical imbalance, anti-depression meds would seem like scam. That's what the OP is reporting. It just means his depression is most likely not derivative of wonky brain chemicals but instead from a different source. Loading him up on more drugs is probably not the answer, and they are perceiving that through their experience.

       While the points you made are all very true, and I am glad to hear that anti-depressants have helped you and many other people, you cannot deny that we have a problem with over-prescribing medication. When I was 14, I saw a therapist once for an hour, and left her office with a prescription for anti-depressants. She didn't even bother trying to pursue other avenues to help me through my issues, and as an adult now I can see just how wrong this was. And this happens all across this country, to millions of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, anti-depressants do "fucking work" in that they perform the job they are prescribed for. They will take away your ability to feel "depressed" because of the situations you are in. They will also take away your ability to feel, period. But they are not the solution. They are just a way to twist humanity in exchange for profit, like the good majority of the drugs peddled by big pharma.

       The effect they have is 100% subjective. You can get similar results from drinking the appropriate amount of alcohol or smoking cannabis.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no objective test that can determine if someone has a "chemical imbalance."

       I am not saying they don't have an effect, but I am saying we are throwing darts at a board and counting the good feeling ones as success.

       They do work, but they take MDMA and alter it to become highly dependant.  The amount of pain and suffering to detox them just is not worth it.  Take some MDMA once in awhile and get outside in the sun and exercise

       Although he has indeed posted a bit of a rant, he does raise some good points, for instance, only the Google challenged wouldn't know that the pharmaceutical industry will abandon a line of research if it does not lead to a new drug that doesn't actually cure anything. Even if it cures something, it won't be pursued if the money isn't there.

After three and a half months of being useless, unable to wash or dress, and confined to a chair, when I finally made it back to work, I couldn't function normally. I had anxiety, anger, and paranoia issues. I couldn't focus on my work or life in general. After being prescribed an anti-depressant which I am still taking, I can tell you with first-hand knowledge, despite my reservations, they have worked. Are they over-prescribed? Probably. Are they 100% a scam. I'd say no.

       They work for some people, but not much better than a plecebo. There are millions of people who claim homeopathy has worked for them, which it probably did, just not for the reasons they originally thought.

       There is double-blind clinical evidence that antidepressants work better than a placebo by a statistically significant amount.  That means neither the person handing out the meds and observing the patient, nor the patient knows if the drugs they are taking are real or placebo.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a drug fails this test, then manufacturers are not allowed to describe it as a treatment  for that condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same studies on homeopathy show that it works just as well as a placebo.
      </p>
      <p>
       For some people a placebo is all they need, and I rather wish that placebos were more often prescribed in those scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back when SSRIs first came on the market (Prozac), it was a really big deal.  SSRIs were able to treat a massive host of people who did not benefit from the tricyclic antidepressants, or the side-effect laden MAOIs.  If placebos were sufficient, this would not have been the case.

       Yes.  Many people with depression are dependent on medication to treat their problems and lead a productive life.  If it is necessary, and unavoidable, I see no problem with this.  I am dependent on water, but I don't think my water company is evil because it charges me for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would it be nice if there was a cure, and not just a treatment?  Sure.  But we don't have that yet, because it is a very difficult thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, many people have used antidepressant medication as a temporary aid which allowed them to get other help that they need, or to get through a particularly bad event.  Sometimes it's just a temporary imbalance, such as with postpartum depression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depression has a nasty tendency of setting up a feedback loop of a downward spiral.  You're depressed, so you hide in bed for a month, you end up loosing a job or falling out with loved ones, bills start to climb, you eat too much, or too little, you can't motivate yourself to get some exercise...and when you see yourself doing these things, and the world crumbling around you just makes you more depressed, and makes you want to hide in bed even more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meds can yank you out of that downward spiral, and help you to pick up your shattered life.  That, possibly combined with some cognitive and/or behavioral therapy can get you to a state where you aren't dependent on the meds anymore, and you can work with your doctor to ween off of them.  When this is possible, it's great news.  As you learn techniques to constantly evaluate yourself and make sure your life isn't beginning to slip again, it is possible to reach a state where you can reduce or eliminate traditional therapy as well.

       A placebo would likely work just as well.  They work because you believe they will work.  Not because of any interaction of the chemicals with your body.

       GAD affected every aspect of my life.  I couldn't sleep and I had anxiety attacks completely at random -- I spent a couple years trying to figure it out on my own.  I finally saw a doctor and I've been on a low dose of Zoloft for about a year and a half.  I no longer have anxiety attacks and I can sleep at night.  I needed some help with the wiring in my brain and I'm glad I found it.

       The fact that antidepressants are ineffective for a lot of people is no conspiracy.  Psychiatry is difficult.  Any psychiatrist should freely admit that science understands next to nothing about how depression works.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't mean that the meds or the therapy is a scam.  It's just the best we've got.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every med works differently on every person, because every person has a different chemistry. A med might work wonderfully for one person, and have no effect for another person.  A drug might give one person horrible side-effects that are worse than the symptom being treated, yet give another person no detectable side-effects at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The process of figuring out which drug, if any, is best for a person is still only a half-step above poking around in the dark.  You try a drug, discuss how well it did or didn't work, and then decide with your doctor whether to keep the same treatment, or move on to trying something different.  Since the meds often take a month, or longer to build up in your system, this process can take ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of shitty therapists out there, and that really sucks.  I wouldn't call that a conspiracy, though there do seem to be problems involve a lack of sufficient accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things are not done this way purely because of profit.  They are done this way because no one can think of anything better so far.

       This is what I used to believe. I think it's a bit of both worlds. For independent therapists it's the best they have, because that's all they where taught, because big pharma ensures the current paradime is maintained.

       Therapists with a proper doctorate in psychology and/or psychiatry aren't just taught a list of techniques to use in treatment.  They are trained in how to discover new techniques and scientifically evaluate them to determine their efficacy.  Good doctors constantly read publications to learn what new discoveries are happening in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pharmacies hire people to do research, these are doctors, interested in healing people.  If, in the course of their research find something like an absolute cure for depression, and the company wanted it silenced, how well would that really work?  They could try bribing them with hush money; but you could either take the hush money and still leak the discovery, or you could go to the papers with the fact that the company tried to silence knowledge of a cure.  I suppose they could kill them, but then how do you silence the fact that all these researchers working for pharmaceutical companies keep mysteriously dying?
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I see it, any time a pharmaceutical company discovers a new drug, they charge at full-tilt to patent the thing.  Because if they don't, a competing company might beat them to it.  In order to get a drug patent, you have to disclose exactly what the drug is, and how it is synthesized or collected.  As soon as the patent is filed (even before it is approved!), all of that information becomes publicly accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how exactly does big pharma ensure the current paradigm is maintained?

       Good question and yes I think you have proven that the stratergies you listed would not work.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a bigger problem than just an evil board of directors. Most of the time the problem occurs not because someone is trying to the bad thing, but nobody is doing the good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think big pharma can be related to a lot of other industries like the energy industry or oil industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are better solutions but there is already so much invested In the infastructure of the current system that it is self-propergating. Developement to improve the current system has far less risk and far greater gains than re-inventing the system. So more resources are goi g into iteration, re-inforcing the strength of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       So anti-depressants already have a foothold in the legal system, the medical system and increasingly more accepted by society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pharma is a business so using an analogy oil companies look at solar power and go hmm, it's better in theory, but without the correct infastructure, economic foothold, supporting laws and ease of production, it's going to make less money, we don't want it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best interests of the patient are not the best interests of the business. They dont need to lynch people and burn dowb labs, the current system ensures that development is slow and breakthroughs still need to set up infastructure, a difficult task in an already saturated market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even of they do find a cure half of society will refuse it anyway because they believe it's dangerous or not as good as the current system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pharmas will take on new developments WHEN they can make money, until the it's up to institutions and governmebt funded programs to develop the new treatments, which go a lot slower without big pharma support.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats assuming pharma isnt evil, if it is then they are simply buying patents and discarding them and corrupting politics to make new treatments slower to develop.

       I used to work in the Phsych industry as an insurance biller for 3 years and I can tell you that this guy is right. There are probably 1% of the world's population who actually need some sort of antidepressant or psychotropic drug.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had access to all the patient records and went through them daily to send progress reports to the insurance industry. In these files were people who came in feeling bad and over a 7 year period were put on a drug, then it would fail and then they would get another one, then it would fail, then another and so on. A lot of the times the patients would have to ween themselves off one drug and transfer to another because if taken off cold turkey, they would go crazy from the withdraw, not their behavior. This is outlined as side effects that can occur in the drug manifests. All documented in their files, even the failing drugs and the missives about trying a new drug and the hopes it might right the patient straight from the damage done from the previous drug. I have no idea how many files I read to which people went off a drug, went nuts and nearly killed themselves, yet prior to ever being on the drug, nary a suicide attempt. There were three i read that did kill themselves after coming off the drugs. Only one tried to wack themselves prior to coming in to get the drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pharmaceutical representatives AKA Drug Reps would come to the office and feed the doctors free food twice a week if not more. During the free lunch the drug reps would spew information about the drug and how they should try it and give feed back. The drug reps and drug companies give drugs for clinical trials along with a big fat check for results of the drug trials. They also gave incentive to the doctors for writing scripts, things like vacations disguised as pharm conventions or electronics shipped directly to their houses.
      </p>
      <p>
       They go as far as using female models who have a good speaking presence to present the drugs in meetings, while a real doctor who came with her sits and answers the tough questions. Not once did they ever not send a hot woman. Most these women, college graduates with associates in art or some shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would often be asked to change the billing diagnosis of a patient just to get a a claim paid because the doctor maxed the benefits for one treatment type and now has to bill for another just to get paid. All the while they keep writing the script, pushing the drugs while holding up a little piece of paper issued from a medical board somewhere saying they can do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of fraud in the Phsych industry is disgusting. It's all about pushing the drugs into people's systems so the doctors get their kick backs, repeat patients and clinical trials. It's a business, they have to profit and the only way to really do so is through the insurance industry. People without insurance don't seek the help of psychiatrists, they go to therapists. Psychiatrists can write the scripts, the therapists can only renew them with the doctors endorsement. So non insured people who feel bad and need a therapist, get couch time and now prescription.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will not find documentation readily available talking about the bad things antidepressants and beta blockers and mood stabilizers cause. the Pharmaceutical industry squashes as much as they can when they can, just to sell the drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Phsych industry is a scam to sell drugs, guys like dasstrooper chimes in saying his piece as a patient not realizing he has been addicted to the drugs. He has been given an excuse for his depression and now needs the drugs. Rarely will a therapist say a person should try a healthy diet for a bit, when depression hits, go for a run and find a hobby to keep your mind occupied.
      </p>
      <p>
       Straight therapy doesn't sell the drugs, taking responsibility for your actions doesn't sell drugs. If they can convince the patients, the patients convince the constituents the constituents empower the legislature, the legislature keeps pharmaceuticals legal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the worst case scenarios begin, children, addicted to the drugs grow up with the same problem, never tqaught how to deal with but other than a pill, go off their meds and whined up shooting up a school of first graders.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pharmaceutical industry is dangerous, pharmaceutical psychiatry is dangerous and it needs to be looked deeply into. It seems from my experience in the years I spent processing HCFA forms that most doctors in the industry really don't give a fuck about the patients but more so their ego, their stature, their tenure and their huge fucking paycheck. I quit cause I quit cause I couldn't handle the fraud.

       My ssri has helped me incredibly. That being said I think the problem is that we have so many people depressed because of the way our culture is. Everyone is overworked, underpaid, and constantly held down by the man...man.

       You'd think that money is the best cure for depression and all that, but that's not the case. The rich and famous can also be seriously fucked up.

       Coming from an ex addict with a personality disorder, therapy has done tons for me. In the same way that medication usually requires several different approaches before one works, therapy requires several different techniques before one fits what is going on. The issue with therapy in my experience is usually the quality of the therapist, not the actual research, nor the field of psychology itself. A lot of therapists do not properly use what they are taught in a clinical setting and get crappy results; when I finally found the therapist that worked for me, I immediately understood this difference. I have been clean for 2 1/2 years, I am able to empathize with people in a strong way, and have maintained my current job and relationship for over a year. I've never had to use medications, but my understanding from my therapist is that she usually only recommends it when the person suffers from something that debilitates their ability to gain anything from the therapy, such as bipolar disorder or extreme cases of depression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just saying, it worked out pretty well for me!

       They work for me. And while sleep, diet and exercise can make me feel better, just like any "normal" person, the AD allow me to feel like a capable human being. From what I hear, if it doesn't work, that means you don't need it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do think we are over medicated and they are prescribed out to people who don't need it. I went through years of cognitive therapy, and it did help a little. But if you have clinical depression, your brain's process is all fucked up. ADs are supposed to fix those broken connections.

       AD are not supposed to be a cure, they are a means to manage a condition that otherwise will cripple a person. I speak from experience. Dark, pitch black, sickening shit experience. You take AD to be able to get up in the morning, to be able to function without thinking about the best ways to kill yourself that wouldn't leave a mess and/or body. You take AD so you are able to get to that appointment for your CBT that will train you in recognizing destructive thought patterns and how to combat them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't "beat" depression, that's a load of shit. Depression will always be a part of what you are, just like you can't cure alcoholism. You will always be at risk of falling back into the old behavior and if you're saying otherwise you're lying or in full denial.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "well you have low self-esteem and feel worthless so lets find something you have a talent in and start working hard to making yourself a proud person, a long and hard journey that offers a permenant cure"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Except when you are depressed everything you touch turns to shit. Everybody leaves, you ruin peoples lives and nobody likes you. Your attempts at craft/hobbies are hopeless sysiphus-like torture with no chance of fullfillment because you realize your pathetic existance should not even be allowed to continue, yet there you are clinking away at some fucking instrument which you are convinced sounds like shit or you draw something horribly ugly. To have someone I don't trust (when you're really depressed you don't trust anyone, because a freak like you can't ever trust
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       ) come up to me and say "hey lets find you a hobby that you are good at so you can feel better" is one of the biggest fuck-you moments you can find. It's almost as bad as "get over it".
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are truly depressed you need both parts. You need the AD to help you get to the point where you can actually work out how to process help you're getting from something like CBT.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I don't disagree that AD are being over-prescribed to a lot of people who legitimately are not depressed, but to say that they are scam is just false.)

       The brain is terribly complex and most doctors are afraid to admit that they have no fucking clue what causes mental illness other than "genetics and environment".  So we go with the best thing we have at the moment: anti-depressants.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the '50s and '60s, other drugs were used for the exact same purpose.  Only the drugs were far more addictive and prone to abuse.  Amphetamines, barbiturates and opiates were once the gold standard treatment for depression.  Some drugs like
       <a href="http://www.dexamyl.com/dexamyl.jpg">
        Dexamyl
       </a>
       contained a combination speedball of uppers and downers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main difference?  Those drugs actually worked.  They were also highly addictive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying today's antidepressants don't work at all, but for far too many of us they're completely ineffective or even harmful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Starting at age 16, I began cycling through every SSRI except Paxil as well as some older drugs that were far worse (tricyclics are the devil).  This went on for 9 years with zero improvement in my mood.  You have no idea how disappointing it is to put all your hopes into a new drug only to be let down every time (when you're already depressed).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also:  I would take opiate withdrawal over Lexapro withdrawal any day.

       I went on a gluten free diet and my depression lifted after about a month. It felt like a miracle. I said to myself, "aha, so this is what normal feels like". I felt like I'd had flies buzzing around in my brain and I had gotten so used to it I didn't even know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I urge everyone to try a dietary intervention for any mental health issue. Don't worry about skeptics citing placebo effects, lack of RCT etc. etc. If it works for you, great, and if it doesn't you've lost nothing by trying, and you would be healtier anyway.

       I don't know if they're a scam, per se, but they sure as hell don't fix the problem. It's like doing nothing but taking pain killers when your leg has been severed; sure, it feels a lot better, but it ain't doing shit to fix your leg.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just the easy and quick solution to a problem that isn't a quick and easy fix. People who are depressed are generally that way for a reason - and much more often than not, it isn't because of some bullshit 'chemical imbalance', it's because this fucking society
       <em>
        breeds
       </em>
       psychological disorders like that. Anxiety, as you say, being another one that is a huge issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is interested in the cause of depression and anxiety, just how to fix the symptoms. It's so fucking backwards.

       Yes, they are a scam. Even if some of them work on some people, the fact that diet and exercise improvements are rarely mentioned by your doctor prescribing the medication or the doctor performing "therapy" means that they would rather take your money. If they could sell you food, vitamins, and exercise equipment, they would. There is just so much more money to be made from drugs.

       We live in a fucked up, caustic, poisonous world - especially in the West.  That's what it is.  That's the
       <em>

       Yes and the government is going to use the list of people who have been prescribed anti-depressants to create their list of mentally ill people who are not allowed to possess guns. This is the real back door destruction of the 2nd amendment.

       No I didn't say that, in fact if you read I state they actually did have an affect. They numbed my feelings and instead of having random episodes of wanting to commit suicide I just kind of got used to being miserable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good exercise, healthy diet, good routine, sense of community, feeling loved, having a purpose. These can be very effective methods of resolving depression.  I wasn't suggested any of them. Just talk about my feelings and take anti-depressants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people will take them, and they will get better! I warn that correlation does not equal causation. Our society is so economically driven we really have to be careful.
      </p>
      <p>
       We'd all probably be happier living in a small village with little to no technology. No one would believe that though because that goes against whats been cultivated within us since birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im very lucky, living at a japanese dojo I get to escape our current society for a few hours every day,  in those moments Im happier than I have ever been.
      </p>
      <p>
       My statement cannot be falsified with a counter-example so I don't know why Im getting so many responses saying "They worked for me!! You're wrong!!" Good Im glad they worked for you, because they didn't for millions of other people, some even got worse.

       The one thing I'd offer as a counter is that antidepressants are still used in countries such as Scotland &amp; Wales where there's no prescription fees at all, and even then they're sold to the NHS for rock bottom prices so not much profit being made on them (e.g. 28 tablets of 40mg of Citalopram costs only $2.10 USD to the NHS, but even then patients don;t pay anything in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland).
      </p>
      <p>
       You hit the nail on the head about psychology, there absolutely should be more advances in the field, although it seems odd that a psychologist should be saying "breath deep and take the pills". That seems more like a psychiatrist's job; a psychologist (over here certainly) is more used for talking therapy and ways to help recognise and deal with anxiety, depression, etc. that the person themselves can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the unfortunate things about the medications is that each one has a ~30% chance of not working for someone, and it can mean there's plenty of people (including one of my best friends) that have been put on about 6 different medications before they've found one that has some sort of positive effect. What I would say is that it seems antidepressants are WAY over prescribed in America for cases that wouldn't get a prescription over this side of the pond, and even then they seem to go for the more expensive ones (which is just ludicrous).

       I'm Australian and the government pays rebates for therapy and anti-depressants. Well patients are voters, and many patients believe it works. I did for a long time, I accepted it unquestionably. "Oh anti-depressants well of course they'll help do something, pyschology is a science isn't it? university degrees and all that? should be legit"
      </p>
      <p>
       I know entire families taking anti-depressants who aren't diagnosed as depressed. They're still depressed, and they're taking anti-depressants, and they're depressed. IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT.

       What should it be like?  Do you think that people and their feelings and problems aren't complex enough to warrant it being hard to treat them?  It is a science, it's just a very hard science.  Even normal medicine, which is more of a rigorous science, gets it wrong at times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry if SSRIs don't work well for you, but they've saved lives.  They just don't work for everyone.  Depression is complex, and hard to understand.  (Also Anti Depressants do treat things other than straight up normal depression.)  The simple fact is that we don't understand the brain quite well enough yet.  Maybe some day we will, but I think you should recognize just how hard it is to do what you wish.

       I mentioned this a while back, but I went to a psychiatrist to discuss something completely unrelated to my depression/anxiety and when I told him that I hadn't been taking my depression/anxiety meds because I felt they weren't helping at all, he refused to speak to me any more about any other issues no matter how serious they were and threatened to have me committed to a mental hospital if I didn't take these non-working antidepressants.

       I was on Prozac for a couple years. I will never go back to it. It just a bandaid on personality faults, which years of meditation and often painful self-discovery have helped truly heal. Being sober of these psychological drugs have helped my true self come out, no matter how imperfect.

       Had to go cold turkey off Effexor and was actually thinking of suicide only to find out it was a side effect. My mom went through the same thing 15 years ago witu zoloft. I wholeheartenly believe these are the intended effects to keep people using them or making sure mental conditions continue to exist within the patient that continue to need treatment if they stop taking it. They are perpetuating symptoms to treat at the cost of our REAL mental health. And people die over it. I could have easily snapped.
