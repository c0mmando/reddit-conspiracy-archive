    <div class="md"><p>Not sure why you got downvoted for asking a simple question...</p>

<p>Although my view is the same. Pretty much no chance. If they wanted to get rid of NK they&#39;d likely just instigate something with South, and then they&#39;d just have to support whatever military operation the South carried out. That&#39;s how i&#39;d do it anyway. No need to involve anything so large scale on US soil - all it will take is something like an artillery strike on SK and they&#39;re finished.</p>

<p>It refers to an actor, a member of the situation, a participant, ect.. As an example, me, you and Santa go to rob a bank. We would be the &#39;players&#39; pulling off the heist.. The bank people would be the neutral players, and the cops would be players on the enemy team. That help you out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anything this whole NK thing shows the US govt real intentions. Iran threatens no one, so we send in a bunch of ships and military bases to surround them. Then get pissed when they shoot down a spy drone over their country. Then we basically tell them every week we are going to bomb them. Iran= 4th most oil reserves in the world. On the other hand North Korea blatantly comes out and says they want to nuke the US and South Korea, and the US is like &quot;whatever&quot;. North Korea= no natural resources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zero as NK always pulls out the rhetoric and it&#39;s just the young buck trying to make an impression that he is a serious tough ass to his warlords. NK always threatens war every time US and ROK troops do maneuvers Been going on for decades.</p>

<p>If anything a false flag will happen in Iran not NK. As a retired Marine who served over in SK the RoK&#39;s will kick there ass on the ground as they have the finest equipment vs. NK piece of crap equipment. They just need our air cover and sea cover. Hell NK can&#39;t even keep their 1960 trucks running .</p>

<p>BTW China even though they say they standby NK won&#39;t let them do jack shit. Bad for Chinese and US business and China likes to make money. Not even NK fucks with China&#39;s money ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If North Korea was going to do anything why would they go to the trouble of trying to hit the U.S. with a nuke? Li&#39;l Kim has to be craftier than that. North Korea needs to reinvent its shit and find a way to become a player on the world stage. They would benefit more from that than from continuing to isolate themselves and more importantly they would be spitting in the faces of the U.S. </p>

<p>Think about it - a North Korea that drops a bomb will be met with military force from South Korea and the U.S., but a North Korea that suddenly becomes a little more open to the world creates a much stickier situation for the U.S. because that&#39;s the kind of North Korea that will regain support from China and leave us looking like jackasses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comprehension must be very limited.</p>

<p>One would not come to this conclusion <em>just</em> from this video, but rather from the overall insurmountable evidence.  This video, as part of that evidence, is only relevant to this thread&#39;s topic.</p>

<p>The US government kills MILLIONS all over the world - Men, women, and children - without remorse.  To think that they would <em>not</em> kill their own citizens, based merely on a geographic relationship is silly.  Their agenda knows no bounds.</p>

<p>They let many of their own starve, suffer ailments, deny many acceptable standards of living, manipulate laws and enforce them with a brutal police force, why is murdering them so far out of the question?</p>

<p>Our economy is in ruins while they continue to spend billions on aid to foreign countries, while arming DHS to the teeth and terrorizing our citizens, and you don&#39;t see fit to question their actions and motives?  Look at history... Look at world trends... Look at what the future may hold... And you still say nay?  You are the worst kind of fool.</p>

<p>It hasn&#39;t been 100% proven that the US Govt was the mastermind behind 9/11, but their complicity is undeniable and their complacency is sickening.  The manner in which they seized upon the opportunity to profit demonstrates greed beyond measure.</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t done very much research into this, it&#39;s obvious.  I&#39;m not going to do your homework for you, but if you still think a plane actually crashed into a field in PA, there is much you don&#39;t understand. Although,  I doubt you are even remotely receptive to the truth.</p>

<p>Factions in the US Govt <em>ARE</em> the terrorists.  It totally escapes me how some like you fail to observe the blatantly obvious.</p>
