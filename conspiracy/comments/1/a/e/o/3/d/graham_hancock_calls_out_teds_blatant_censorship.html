       I loved Mr. Hancock's video and found it to offer a fascinating perspective on human history and the "sovereign right to our own consciousness." Regardless of the creator's supposed editorializing or the soundness of the science, it was thought provoking and engrossing. I'm thankful that such thinkers exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I think some of the more strident supporters are being a little hysterical. TED is a private company with a reputation and a brand to protect. They are not a public institution and don't have any kind of responsibility to post every talk on their public youtube channel. If they don't want to associate their brand with Hancock they don't have to. This isn't some kind of fight-the-good-fight civil rights issue.

       You're right, but here's where the good ol' fashioned talks from mom and dad when you're kid SHOULD come into play but they don't in this world: do they have any monetary, political, or organizational responsibility to post every talk to their site? No. SHOULD they, being how big, what, and who they are with the audience they have? Yes.

       Really, it could be summed up like this: People CLEARLY

       I believe allowing the use of sacred plants and ritual hallucinogens and entheogens (conspicuously missing from my word dictionary), and psychedlics in at least properly consecrated ceremonial settings would accomplish far more for our public health as a society than could any actual restructuring or reforming of what is clearly a defective and deceptive so-called health care system whose only consistently evidenced motivation is to promote the well-being of the selfsame health care system and its satanic litle cousin the insurance industry.

         No it isn't. Cannabis as used to "cure cancer" (which it doesn't do) isn't homeopathy. It's not been diluted to the point that it is statistically unlikely to find even a single molecule of cannabis in the substance given to the patient. Homeopathy works (well, not really, but y'know) on the idea that "like cures like" (so cannabis would only cure cancer if it also caused cancer) and that diluting something makes it stronger.

        <em>
         Even though they do not act on the disease
        </em>
        , placebos seem to affect how people feel (this happens in up to 1 out of 3 patients). A change in a person’s symptoms as a result of getting a placebo is called the placebo effect. Usually the term “placebo effect” speaks to the helpful effects a placebo has in relieving symptoms. This effect usually lasts only a short time. It’s thought to have something to do with the body’s chemical ability to briefly
        <em>
         relieve pain or certain other symptoms.

       Acupuncture is legit and then some. Ever had it? No. It's amazing. I don't know about "for colds," but I think you're making that up. It cures serious drug addictions, which is pretty profound.

       That's a massive fallacy - the least of which being misdirection. We're not talking about homeopathic treatments - which are under researched I might add - acupuncture for colds (the fuck? I think you just made that up), and chiropractic for personality disorders - we're talking about the food we're putting into our body...

       The evidence for DMT is simple to replicate. Do it. You can order the ingredients online and make your own brew. Try it out and see if its true. At that point you will understand that the Ayahuasca entity exists firsthand. What it means for you will be your own interpretation.

       but "i experienced it" isn't a valid form of evidence. you can make yourself experience all kinds of weird shit with datura or toad venom or fasting/prayer. that doesn't make it real.

       now, if a person could pass a predetermined message to the entity that could be retrieved later by someone else, that would be something.

       You live in an interesting world when you are more apt to accept some undefined external evidence over your own experience. Whats more is many people claim that they do receive useful and pertinent information from their contact with the Ayahuasca entity/ies. You can always try it to find out. Its not an amazingly difficult experiment to perform.

       it's not undefined, just the opposite. you give a passphrase to the entity, if that passphrase can be given to someone else without other communication, the entity could be real. that's not undefined evidence.

       that's because it's not an experiment at all. taking hallucinogens and then having a hallucination doesn't prove anything. experiments need to have a variable that can be tested. this is why i mention the passphrase.

       I am saying that you can do the exact experiment that you describe. Just do it. Yes I went to church to try to commune with Jesus and God. I read the Bible to try to see if I can get the same meaning out of it as a confirmed believer. And guess what, I can. It is all true and it is only up to you to try to demonstrate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you discount your dreams? What objective evidence do you have that anything you take to be real actually is real? And many catholics do receive useful information FOR THEM from entities beyond what they perceive to be the limits of their minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have the capacity to attempt exactly the experiment that  you've described. Do it. You will be surprised. Up until that point you're just a pseudo-skeptic. You've got religion, son, and its the materialist kind. If you feel like challenging the dogmas you've accepted, you've already laid the framework. Do your experiment and report your findings.

       PS the scientific method doesn't necessitate materialism. you just need other people to be able to replicate and tinker with your paradigm. so if you can talk to jesus, or the DMT spirit, and that party can pass a message through space and/or time (like a real, actual entity would be able to (versus something you're imagining)), then you have positive evidence for the existence of a real entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       in order to get the Science seal of approval, you can't be a magician doing parlor tricks. if DMT can't even meet that standard, why should we believe you? that's.... Science. get your friend DMT to pass a message from you to someone else. even a minor acquaintance could afford you such a trivial effort. if DMT has such an important message, it can prove it by passing an unmistakable signal in order to prove itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is the only way i can think of to differentiate from a real entity and a very-real-seeming, very consistent hallucination. even atropine will make everyone feel like they're flying.... it just tickles our shared neuro receptors. but are we actually flying? no. are we flying in our dreams? we have no evidence of that. do we transcend dimensions? we don't know that we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR have the DMT spirit pass a message between two random humans, and see if the receiver gets the right answer. that would prove its existence. otherwise, can't prove it's not just drugs.

       Great, you have just stated what it would take for YOU to intellectually accept that the entities that people claim to contact while under the influence of DMT are real entities. So try it out. I am not interested in the "Science" seal of approval. I have tried the substance and experienced for myself the reality of the entities. I do not need further proof, but you do. And guess what, you can have that proof. Just do your experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       You shouldn't believe me because of anything I say. You shouldn't believe something because its received the "Science" seal of approval. You should believe things because they have been demonstrated to YOUR personal level of proof. But everything you've said is semantic posturing if you are unwilling to attempt the experiment that you yourself have posited. You can do this experiment, so do it. Having been in that space myself, I say you will be surprised at the result.

       Not that there aren't any good talks from TED, its just that corporations use the "scientists" that are locked in their own minds as useful idiots.

       Apparently Bill Gate's idea to cull the African population through "vaccines" was an "Idea worth spreading". The idea that the use of shamanic ritual can help us overcome adversity and better understand ourselves, not so much. Clearly, it's unscientific to say that the answers to the world's problems already lay within us when there is so much money to be made out there.

       Yeah, fuck those people when you have the tech to create mosquitoes that can be used as a delivery system for a vaccine that could save millions of lives. Who needs new ideas when we can try and fail to vaccinate everyone by driving around in trucks and/or hoping people find their way to vaccination centers or even know what the hell is going on.

       You don't have to know how to read a book to get bit by a mosquito, but it could be potentially as effective as a shot.

       I liked Hancock's video, but some of the examples he gave were ridiculous. No one should be saying the ancient Egyptians "had it all figured out." No one knows what happens after you die except a few people who actually died and were resuscitated. Taking psychedelic drugs does have a permanent effect on your psyche, but it would not be able to change your genome. Even if it did lead to the first consciousness, those people wouldn't have been able to pass that on to their children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking DMT to change peoples' minds about what their doing does seem like a good idea though. I just can't imagine the world's leaders agreeing to something like that. TED shouldn't have taken it down. Maybe flag it and say something like, "This guy was on DMT when he came up with these ideas. Take them with a grain of salt."
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree with everything he said, but that's no reason to take his video down.

       I agree. He is reciting pure speculation. Especially ancient cave painters being on drugs. There is no evidence of such. Does he even consider it may have been a clear headed ancient artist who was just talented?

       I guess if saying the speed of light is a constant is deemed 'bad science' talks by Einstein would be rejected by TED.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if TED takes a speaker's money and gives him/her time on the stage they need to stand by that and give them the same exposure as their other speakers.

       Nobody forced him to come to the conference and take part. There were rules on what was expected of participants and he got pissed when he got called out on breaking them? TED isn't your personal platform to do whatever the hell you want. All the speakers are there for the benefit of others, not themselves. (well, a side-effect is networking with people but only crazy people see that as a benefit, I suppose)

       Loved the beginning, but he lost me towards the end, when it turned into an anti-profit lecture. Pursuit of profit itself does not lead to increased pollution or over-consumption of resources; what he's referring to is caused by interventionism and a loss of property rights, which he ironically didn't identify the way he rightly identified government as the problem in the case of drug prohibition.

       I don't think an empirical study could prove such a broad claim. I'm using deductive reasoning. If you mean "supporting propositions/examples needed," then I can do that. Here's an example: if I pursue profit by opening up a food stand and giving consumers what they want, there's no necessity to pollute. As far as the pursuit of profit in a modern economy, if property rights are protected, then adjacent entities will sue the polluter, resulting in a system in which there are strong pressures not to pollute. However, governments prevent property rights from being enforced by implementing collective ownership of things like rivers, air, land, etc.

       Let's say a company pollutes around it without affecting its own land or employees. It would have to pay the full cost of cleanup, which would be higher than the cost of disposal through efficient third-parties--but let's assume that people in the area aren't strong enough to retaliate, maybe in an African country where infrastructure isn't well-established, so cleanup wouldn't be enforced. In that case, I agree the company would find it cheaper to pollute, but that's the case with government intervention anyway because the governments there are so poor that the company can bribe itself out of responsibility.

       The use of coal and oil for purposes useful to humans is a result of the massive energy they can produce, not of profit-seeking spirit. People living in a system without profit, if they're smart, would make use of coal and oil as well, so it's not the hunger for profit that results in pollution if there can be profitable ventures that are completely "green"--it's something else.

      <p>
       I'll answer your point directly. No, I don't think the government forces greedy people to cheat, it just makes it easier the larger it is. And I think private greed is better than theft because actions are worse than thoughts and inclinations--if by "greed," you mean "the results of greed," it would help if you pointed to how anarcho-capitalism exacerbates greed and facilitates the channeling of that greed, as opposed to the system you think is better.

       I don't deal so much with the reasons legislatures might have for enacting certain laws, I focus more on the result of the laws, which in the case of anti-trust laws is to deprive a good company from acquiring too much of the market, which is bad for consumers. Earlier I said monopolies survive better with government--that's not exactly true. A monopoly can survive just fine without government, but those that survive are those that serve the consumer--with interventionism there is no discrimination between good and bad monopolies, especially when it comes to the monopoly on force.

       You've just described government, a monopoly of greedy people who have no watchdogs. But I'll address your point directly. A lack of
       <em>
        government regulation
       </em>
       does not imply a lack of regulation--in fact, a lack of government regulation can result in more regulation than before, as oxymoronic as that sounds (maybe it's meant to sound oxymoronic to limit debate on the subject). For example, when the consumption of alcohol was very regulated (during prohibition), alcohol consumption increased and the quality of alcohol decreased. If there were no government regulation on alcohol consumption, quality would increase and consumption would be more moderate.

      <p>
       As if "authorities" were virtuous and the only path to justice--politicians aren't bribed and actually keep the peace? Anyway, there would be a stronger disincentive for a company investigator to accept a bribe because it would negatively impact the company's reputation and people would have a choice of whether or not to choose that company, which isn't the case with government. As far as murdering the investigator, the offending company could try that, but if an investigative company sends an investigator somewhere, I doubt there'd be nobody watching him or getting updates from him or tracking him electronically, and if it were to surface that an investigator was murdered by someone in the offending company, that would not exactly help its case. There might be more than one investigator, as well.

      <p>
       Not like a court, which thrives on aggression and arbitrary law. If a company doesn't recognize the authority of the DRO, it can request to have another DRO review the case, until both parties agree. If it refuses to engage in dispute resolution with any DRO, and the DRO finds it guilty, it would lose all reputation in the business community (0 credit score type thing), it would owe the affected party a sum of money or whatever, and the affected party is in the clear to claim that sum or sentence. That's one theory.

Then it would have to make sure word doesn't get out, to avoid losing customers (assuming no government aid to Wal Mart through regulations that crowd out competition, eminent domain, etc). Anyway, it would not be smart for a company to do that.

       Depends on your definition of monopoly. If it means "large share of the market," there's nothing preventing a company that serves consumers from acquiring a large share--if it serves consumers.

       <p>
        A monopoly exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.[1] Monopolies are thus characterized by a lack of economic competition to produce the good or service and a lack of viable substitute goods.[2] The verb "monopolize" refers to the process by which a company gains the ability to raise prices or exclude competitors. In economics, a monopoly is a single seller. In law, a monopoly is a business entity that has significant market power, that is, the power, to charge high prices.[3]

       No, regulations are enforced without government, and more efficiently. I'm talking about organic regulations, not arbitrary law. We've already talked about it, but property rights are a better regulator of pollution than laws without complete preservation of property rights, for at least two reasons: a) if X were to buy a stretch of land/water, X would have invested more than renting from the government and would make sure it didn't pollute its own property (of course, property can be rented privately, but government fines on corporations are negligible compared with the real cost), and b) if X were to pollute, neighboring entities would sue X if the pollution were to spread outside the limits of Xs property even a little.

       <li>
        <p>
         "Tanker crews were not told that the previous practice of the Coast Guard tracking ships out to Bligh reef had ceased."

       <li>
        <p>
         "The oil industry promised, but never installed, state-of-the-art iceberg monitoring equipment." Presumably, the oil industry promised the government is would install this equipment, as a result of regulation.

       <li>
        <p>
         "Coast Guard tanker inspections in Valdez were not done, and the number of staff was reduced."
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Of course, the spill resulted in bigger government: "This disaster resulted in International Maritime Organization introducing comprehensive marine pollution prevention rules (MARPOL) through various conventions. The rules were ratified by member countries and, under International Ship Management rules, the ships are being operated with a common objective of "safer ships and cleaner oceans"
      </p>
      <p>
       But MARPOL didn't prevent the BP oil spill, but I'm sure government grew even more after it. Companies are consistently blamed, no matter how big government is, and then government grows the more disasters there are.

       Good question. First, there's the problem of getting enough companies to sign up in order to avoid failure through opposition (by militias and other security companies).

      <p>
       You assume too much. I didn't ask what you think a monopoly is because I haven't encountered the term and its definitions, I asked to get a sense of which definitions you use. The term is supposed to mean 100% market share, when used strictly, but it's sometimes used to refer to command of a very large market share. For example, late-19th century Standard Oil is commonly referred to as a monopoly, but it never acquired 100% of the market.

      <blockquote>

       That's a different definition from the stricter one on Wikipedia: "A monopoly exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are the two definitions, which you quoted yourself, so I'm confused as to why you don't think "monopoly" can be an ambiguous word:
      </p>
      <p>
       "In economics, a monopoly is a single seller. In law, a monopoly is a business entity that has significant market power, that is, the power, to charge high prices."
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition based on law shows how little politicians know of economics. It does not follow that if a company that has significant market power, it will charge high prices. Standard Oil did the opposite. It also doesn't follow that is a company has the power to charge high prices (all companies do), that consumers will buy the product instead of looking for alternatives.

      <p>
       That's not a rebuttal. But maybe you will criticize me for not substantiating my claim enough. A company will lose its monopoly status if it stops serving consumers because there are always alternatives. Substitution, emerging competition, already-established companies that can switch their production to undercut the monopoly, etc.

       Payment to look the other way increases to the point of being prohibitive when property rights are actually protected, but they aren't protected under governments, for example when a river is communal, and ultimately not owned by any entity that can claim damages. One could say that, in that case, government owns the river and can seek remuneration, but it's arbitrary and subject to corruption.

       but "i experienced it" isn't a valid form of evidence. you can make yourself experience all kinds of weird shit with datura or toad venom or fasting/prayer. that doesn't make it real.

       now, if a person could pass a predetermined message to the entity that could be retrieved later by someone else, that would be something.
