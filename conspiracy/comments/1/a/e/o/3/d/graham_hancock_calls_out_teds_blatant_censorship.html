<p>&quot;All I can say is this is extremely devious behavior on TED’s part. On the one hand they take down two videos from Youtube that had generated enormous public interest and traction (mine had received over 130,000 views and Rupert’s over 35,000 views)&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I loved Mr. Hancock&#39;s video and found it to offer a fascinating perspective on human history and the &quot;sovereign right to our own consciousness.&quot; Regardless of the creator&#39;s supposed editorializing or the soundness of the science, it was thought provoking and engrossing. I&#39;m thankful that such thinkers exist.</p>

<p>That said, I think some of the more strident supporters are being a little hysterical. TED is a private company with a reputation and a brand to protect. They are not a public institution and don&#39;t have any kind of responsibility to post every talk on their public youtube channel. If they don&#39;t want to associate their brand with Hancock they don&#39;t have to. This isn&#39;t some kind of fight-the-good-fight civil rights issue.</p>

<p>edit: fixed some grammar</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, but here&#39;s where the good ol&#39; fashioned talks from mom and dad when you&#39;re kid SHOULD come into play but they don&#39;t in this world: do they have any monetary, political, or organizational responsibility to post every talk to their site? No. SHOULD they, being how big, what, and who they are with the audience they have? Yes.</p>

<p>Really, it could be summed up like this: People CLEARLY <em>want</em> the talks that are removed. Case and point.</p>

<li><p>No it isn&#39;t. Cannabis as used to &quot;cure cancer&quot; (which it doesn&#39;t do) isn&#39;t homeopathy. It&#39;s not been diluted to the point that it is statistically unlikely to find even a single molecule of cannabis in the substance given to the patient. Homeopathy works (well, not really, but y&#39;know) on the idea that &quot;like cures like&quot; (so cannabis would only cure cancer if it also caused cancer) and that diluting something makes it stronger.</p></li>

<p><em>Even though they do not act on the disease</em>, placebos seem to affect how people feel (this happens in up to 1 out of 3 patients). A change in a person’s symptoms as a result of getting a placebo is called the placebo effect. Usually the term “placebo effect” speaks to the helpful effects a placebo has in relieving symptoms. This effect usually lasts only a short time. It’s thought to have something to do with the body’s chemical ability to briefly <em>relieve pain or certain other symptoms.</em></p>

<p>it&#39;s not undefined, just the opposite. you give a passphrase to the entity, if that passphrase can be given to someone else without other communication, the entity could be real. that&#39;s not undefined evidence.</p>

<p>that&#39;s because it&#39;s not an experiment at all. taking hallucinogens and then having a hallucination doesn&#39;t prove anything. experiments need to have a variable that can be tested. this is why i mention the passphrase.</p>

<p>/thread</p>

<p>PS the scientific method doesn&#39;t necessitate materialism. you just need other people to be able to replicate and tinker with your paradigm. so if you can talk to jesus, or the DMT spirit, and that party can pass a message through space and/or time (like a real, actual entity would be able to (versus something you&#39;re imagining)), then you have positive evidence for the existence of a real entity.</p>

<p>in order to get the Science seal of approval, you can&#39;t be a magician doing parlor tricks. if DMT can&#39;t even meet that standard, why should we believe you? that&#39;s.... Science. get your friend DMT to pass a message from you to someone else. even a minor acquaintance could afford you such a trivial effort. if DMT has such an important message, it can prove it by passing an unmistakable signal in order to prove itself. </p>

<p>this is the only way i can think of to differentiate from a real entity and a very-real-seeming, very consistent hallucination. even atropine will make everyone feel like they&#39;re flying.... it just tickles our shared neuro receptors. but are we actually flying? no. are we flying in our dreams? we have no evidence of that. do we transcend dimensions? we don&#39;t know that we do. </p>

<p>TL;DR have the DMT spirit pass a message between two random humans, and see if the receiver gets the right answer. that would prove its existence. otherwise, can&#39;t prove it&#39;s not just drugs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great, you have just stated what it would take for YOU to intellectually accept that the entities that people claim to contact while under the influence of DMT are real entities. So try it out. I am not interested in the &quot;Science&quot; seal of approval. I have tried the substance and experienced for myself the reality of the entities. I do not need further proof, but you do. And guess what, you can have that proof. Just do your experiment.</p>

<p>You shouldn&#39;t believe me because of anything I say. You shouldn&#39;t believe something because its received the &quot;Science&quot; seal of approval. You should believe things because they have been demonstrated to YOUR personal level of proof. But everything you&#39;ve said is semantic posturing if you are unwilling to attempt the experiment that you yourself have posited. You can do this experiment, so do it.

If you mean &quot;supporting propositions/examples needed,&quot; then I can do that. Here&#39;s an example: if I pursue profit by opening up a food stand and giving consumers what they want, there&#39;s no necessity to pollute. As far as the pursuit of profit in a modern economy, if property rights are protected, then adjacent entities will sue the polluter, resulting in a system in which there are strong pressures not to pollute. However, governments prevent property rights from being enforced by implementing collective ownership of things like rivers, air, land, etc. </p>

<p>unless you pollute enough to kill all adjacent entities. alternatively, if you only poison poor people, they can&#39;t afford good lawyers like a big company can. then they have to prove that it was your pollution that killed their loved ones, and you will appeal for years.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say a company pollutes around it without affecting its own land or employees.

<p>The use of coal and oil for purposes useful to humans is a result of the massive energy they can produce, not of profit-seeking spirit. People living in a system without profit, if they&#39;re smart, would make use of coal and oil as well, so it&#39;s not the hunger for profit that results in pollution if there can be profitable ventures that are completely &quot;green&quot;--it&#39;s something else.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll take that as you passing on a rebuttal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>well, i&#39;m a syndicalist, if that gives you any idea. the rich are parasites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d like to know more about syndicalism. I&#39;m not against co-ops and things like that in principle. If they can out-compete hierarchical structures at serving the consumer (in an environment without the state), then I&#39;m not opposed. Are you an anarcho-syndicalist or can syndicalism include support for the state?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so because i oppose capitalist greed, that means i automatically support blanket taxation? you didn&#39;t address the point. also, do you think private greed is better than theft that pays for public services?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll answer your point directly. No, I don&#39;t think the government forces greedy people to cheat, it just makes it easier the larger it is. And I think private greed is better than theft because actions are worse than thoughts and inclinations--if by &quot;greed,&quot; you mean &quot;the results of greed,&quot; it would help if you pointed to how anarcho-capitalism exacerbates greed and facilitates the channeling of that greed, as opposed to the system you think is better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i don&#39;t need to. does anything in libertarianism explicitly prevent it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to because, logically, if something isn&#39;t precluded, it does not follow that it will happen or will happen significantly. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>not if they don&#39;t have any money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why, are they&#39;re all handicapped too? Now you&#39;re just making up situations that wouldn&#39;t occur. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>also you gave all their breadwinners cancer. chemo ain&#39;t cheap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is why a company won&#39;t want to give them cancer in the first place. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would have to pay the full cost of cleanup,
who appraises the costs? who pays the pollution investigators?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The security company or a private investigator would calculate that, perhaps included in the DRO (dispute resolution organization) costs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>who determines what is fair?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nirvana fallacy, who determines what is fair now and does a good job of it? Or are you referring to a greater sense of fairness in an anarcho-syndicalist environment. I&#39;m interested to know how fairness would be achieved in that system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>who determines acceptable levels? are there judges in your system? who pays them? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There would be DROs paid for by either an insurance company or out of pocket, with the losing party likely paying the winner the cost of bringing the dispute to the DRO, as opposed to settling between the two of them. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t. Dishonest DROs would be weeded out as people opt for another company consistently.</p>

<p>You say that as if democracy were a good thing. It&#39;s an illusion designed to make you feel involved in a corrupt, unrepresentative system that exhibits what you criticize in powerful corporations. I&#39;d like to understand why you attack corporations (which, admittedly, are destructive at the moment), but defend a system based on violence that represents a monopoly on the exploitation of an entire population. </p>

<p>This is why I asked for a more specific example of what you mean by annihilating the surrounding population, to prevent us talking past each other. If you&#39;re talking about poisoning all/most inhabitants in a certain area, I&#39;m pretty sure that would mot bode well for the company, especially if their product is food or medicine. Would you buy food from a company that has resulted in the annihilation of a population somewhere?</p>

<p>I blame both, and I assert the bribe payer with nobody to bribe would be less powerful. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>is that why we have anti-trust laws?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t deal so much with the reasons legislatures might have for enacting certain laws, I focus more on the result of the laws, which in the case of anti-trust laws is to deprive a good company from acquiring too much of the market, which is bad for consumers. Earlier I said monopolies survive better with government--that&#39;s not exactly true. A monopoly can survive just fine without government, but those that survive are those that serve the consumer--with interventionism there is no discrimination between good and bad monopolies, especially when it comes to the monopoly on force. </p>

<p>Who owes the great programmer who dies poor because of copying? If it&#39;s the copier, what moral principle is the copier violating? Don&#39;t take that as me deprecating the work of programmers, they are artists like any other, but there&#39;s no moral basis for seeking remuneration from someone who copies an idea and profits from it. </p>

<p>Would that include taxation?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>having no watchdogs allows polluters and monopolists to do whatever the fuck they want. that sounds like a pretty severe exacerbation of greed to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve just described government, a monopoly of greedy people who have no watchdogs. But I&#39;ll address your point directly. A lack of <em>government regulation</em> does not imply a lack of regulation--in fact, a lack of government regulation can result in more regulation than before, as oxymoronic as that sounds (maybe it&#39;s meant to sound oxymoronic to limit debate on the subject). For example, when the consumption of alcohol was very regulated (during prohibition), alcohol consumption increased and the quality of alcohol decreased. If there were no government regulation on alcohol consumption, quality would increase and consumption would be more moderate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...except when it already happened in the past (e.g. company towns, slavery, bhopal, rivers on fire, oil trusts, etc.)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Company towns: still exist. Nothing wrong with a company town, per se.</p></li>
<li><p>Slavery: maybe you haven&#39;t heard about Jim Crow laws or the Fugitive Slave Act.</p></li>
<li><p>Bhopal: 49% of the company was owned by the government and the plant was regulated by the government, so you&#39;re arguing against yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Rivers on fire: BP disaster</p></li>
<li><p>Oil trusts: government aid of the railroad monopoly</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>no, they spent all their money trying to save their love ones that you poisoned. plus now they&#39;re sick from the same poison.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t poisoned anyone. As far as a company poisoning an entire town, if we assume everyone&#39;s poor and lacks insurance, there are always individual benefactors and organizations that help those who don&#39;t have the money for a lawyer. That&#39;s only one factor. I&#39;m sure it wouldn&#39;t bode well for the company to be on national/international news for killing an entire town.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you know dow still hasn&#39;t paid out for the people killed in bhopal? exxon still hasn&#39;t paid out for the valdez spill that happened two decades ago either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though the company was partly government-owned and regulated? Exxon was also regulated. I guess the lesson is regulation doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[citation needed] if it&#39;s between polluting for decades and possibly maybe paying a settlement or paying to clean up every single drop of pollution, a profitable company will pollute every time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re assuming the current system, in which the government imposes small fines. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you mean the government? i don&#39;t consent to authorize the use of violence or coercion by any company. now what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Security companies would not be aggressive, they&#39;d be defensive, unlike the government. The reason I know this is because a company that, for example, attacks peaceful drug users, will lose customers because it costs more and drug users won&#39;t want to contribute to it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and what&#39;s to stop the company from bribing or killing the investigator with no authorities around?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As if &quot;authorities&quot; were virtuous and the only path to justice--politicians aren&#39;t bribed and actually keep the peace? Anyway, there would be a stronger disincentive for a company investigator to accept a bribe because it would negatively impact the company&#39;s reputation and people would have a choice of whether or not to choose that company, which isn&#39;t the case with government. As far as murdering the investigator, the offending company could try that, but if an investigative company sends an investigator somewhere, I doubt there&#39;d be nobody watching him or getting updates from him or tracking him electronically, and if it were to surface that an investigator was murdered by someone in the offending company, that would not exactly help its case. There might be more than one investigator, as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>oh, like a court? what if the company doesn&#39;t recognize the authority of the DRO? what incentive does a company have to pay for a DRO that may rule against them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not like a court, which thrives on aggression and arbitrary law. If a company doesn&#39;t recognize the authority of the DRO, it can request to have another DRO review the case, until both parties agree. If it refuses to engage in dispute resolution with any DRO, and the DRO finds it guilty, it would lose all reputation in the business community (0 credit score type thing), it would owe the affected party a sum of money or whatever, and the affected party is in the clear to claim that sum or sentence. That&#39;s one theory. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and how many lives will be ruined in the process? do you suggest that i sacrifice my and my family&#39;s lives on the altar of your system?</p>

<p>How many lives are ruined by government? Criticize your own belief with the same fervor you direct toward mine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>american election law is an illusion, but we&#39;ve all been in a group that agreed to vote on something before, and it turned out well.</p>

<p>Not sure what you&#39;re referring to. Are you basically saying that democracy can work sometimes? I don&#39;t dispute that, what I dispute is the claim that it&#39;s a good system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i&#39;m not defending any system. i think libertarianism is a terrible idea that will lead to walmart throwing me in a fucking slave camp or worse. no thanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I appreciate your honesty. I don&#39;t see that happening because Wal Mart would have to make sure you don&#39;t have a gun, don&#39;t have a security company watching over you (which wouldn&#39;t be expensive, it would probably work the same way people pay ADT), and others won&#39;t come to your aid. Then it would have to make sure word doesn&#39;t get out, to avoid losing customers (assuming no government aid to Wal Mart through regulations that crowd out competition, eminent domain, etc). Anyway, it would not be smart for a company to do that.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>if it had a monopoly (like monsanto terminator seeds) i wouldn&#39;t have much choice now would i?</p>

<p>By &quot;monopoly,&quot; do you mean &quot;owning a large share of the market,&quot; or &quot;owning 100% share of the market&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what in libertarianism explicitly prevents monopolies?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends on your definition of monopoly. If it means &quot;large share of the market,&quot; there&#39;s nothing preventing a company that serves consumers from acquiring a large share--if it serves consumers. If it doesn&#39;t, it would survive more easily in the environment we have now, in which it&#39;s easier to crush small business competition with regulations, subsidies to powerful companies, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a &quot;good&quot; monopoly is like a &quot;good&quot; skin mole. it&#39;s only a matter of time until it turns bad.</p>

<p>If it turns bad, it soon loses monopoly status (assuming no interventionism), so that&#39;s not a problem.</p>

<p>You warped the meaning of my sentence, which read: &quot;I don&#39;t deal so much with the reasons legislatures might have for enacting certain laws,&quot; not &quot;I don&#39;t deal so much with the reasons.&quot; But good try.</p>

<p>a monopoly, since you don&#39;t know, is cornering the market such that the company dictates the conditions of sale rather than the consumer.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A monopoly exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.[1] Monopolies are thus characterized by a lack of economic competition to produce the good or service and a lack of viable substitute goods.[2] The verb &quot;monopolize&quot; refers to the process by which a company gains the ability to raise prices or exclude competitors. In economics, a monopoly is a single seller. In law, a monopoly is a business entity that has significant market power, that is, the power, to charge high prices.[3] </p>

<p>No, regulations are enforced without government, and more efficiently. I&#39;m talking about organic regulations, not arbitrary law. We&#39;ve already talked about it, but property rights are a better regulator of pollution than laws without complete preservation of property rights, for at least two reasons: a) if X were to buy a stretch of land/water, X would have invested more than renting from the government and would make sure it didn&#39;t pollute its own property (of course, property can be rented privately, but government fines on corporations are negligible compared with the real cost), and b) if X were to pollute, neighboring entities would sue X if the pollution were to spread outside the limits of Xs property even a little.</p>

<p>it won&#39;t be on the news, because no one has cameras because the power outlets aren&#39;t standardized, and the antennae can&#39;t transmit because the spectrum isn&#39;t divided. total interference. plus the company owns all the local stations anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right, standardization doesn&#39;t happen without government. See: <a href="http://www.igi-global.com/viewtitlesample.aspx?id=69808&amp;amp;ptid=59532&amp;amp;t=standardization+as+governance+without+government%3a+a+critical+reassessment+of+the+digital+video+broadcasting+project%E2%80%99s+success+story">one of many</a> cases of standardization without government in technology. Also, local stations =/= all journalists/news vehicles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the lesson is that libertarians are ideologues with no logic skills. if someone dies in a high speed car accident while wearing a seat belt, should we abolish seat belts? or perhaps we should have BETTER safety measures?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The point is not that if a safety measure fails, it should be removed, the point is government regulations have failed so many times that to claim  government regulation will solve the problem of pollution or whatever is to resort to the nirvana fallacy. It would be more logical to discuss which system regulates best, and it&#39;s not necessarily the one that regulates with the most violence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i&#39;m assuming the wild west, where no one can enforce anything against the company&#39;s mercenary army.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Wild West was more peaceful than today. There were less per capita bank robberies and duels were between willing participants. The movies warp the real numbers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>citation still needed, btw.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Citation for Exxon having been regulated at the time it polluted? I&#39;ll refer to the MIT source cited on the Wikipedia page. I couldn&#39;t find the complete document, but it&#39;s probably safe to assume the source does contain the points listed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill#Identified_causes">here</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;Tanker crews were not told that the previous practice of the Coast Guard tracking ships out to Bligh reef had ceased.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The oil industry promised, but never installed, state-of-the-art iceberg monitoring equipment.&quot; Presumably, the oil industry promised the government is would install this equipment, as a result of regulation.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Coast Guard tanker inspections in Valdez were not done, and the number of staff was reduced.&quot; </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, the spill resulted in bigger government: &quot;This disaster resulted in International Maritime Organization introducing comprehensive marine pollution prevention rules (MARPOL) through various conventions. The rules were ratified by member countries and, under International Ship Management rules, the ships are being operated with a common objective of &quot;safer ships and cleaner oceans&quot;</p>

<p>But MARPOL didn&#39;t prevent the BP oil spill, but I&#39;m sure government grew even more after it. Companies are consistently blamed, no matter how big government is, and then government grows the more disasters there are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>mercenaries attack whoever their bosses tell them to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you be more specific? What situation do you envision in which a rich person hires mercenaries to attack peaceful drug users? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>libertardworld is a fucking unmitigated disaster. it&#39;s the wild west.
people would have a choice of whether or not to choose that company
NOT IF THE COMPANY IS A MONOPOLY.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the Wild West was relatively peaceful. And again (again), there are good and bad monopolies, with bad monopolies dying off more easily the worse they become. What is your definition of a monopoly, by the way? What percentage of the market must a company &quot;own&quot; to be considered a monopoly?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>doesn&#39;t matter, the company has a mercenary army. cases mean nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would still be shunned by the business community and go bankrupt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>strawman. i don&#39;t support corrupt governments murdering people either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you support any institutionalized violence, like taxation or government regulations backed by threats of force?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so do you now volunteer to be the first to have your shit taken based upon the pronouncements of the corrupt DRO? stop dodging the question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are you assuming the DRO is corrupt?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...like not kill us all with pollution or doomsday virus? oh noes, our fweeedummmmb!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Freedom results in the best chance of those events not happening.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>well which is it? democracy can work, or it can&#39;t?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was thinking about the loose definition of &quot;democracy.&quot; It never works better than voluntarism when used in the political sense or &quot;rule by majority&quot; backed by threats of violence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how is libertarianism not just rule by the richest?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like you want me to prove a negative. Why do you think it is?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so the ADT guy is gonna follow me around?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He could if you paid him too, but that&#39;d be inefficient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what if security companies collude to form a defacto government with zero accountability? what&#39;s to stop really bad oppressive government from springing up (since big business loves government so much)?
to avoid losing customers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good question. First, there&#39;s the problem of getting enough companies to sign up in order to avoid failure through opposition (by militias and other security companies). Second, there&#39;s the problem of mobilizing such a large organization in secret in order to prevent the opposition from preparing a defense. Third, there&#39;s the cost of waging war against a population--naturally, this comes with plunder, but there&#39;s the risk of not getting a good return on investment and going bankrupt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>walmart has such a huge head start why wouldn&#39;t they just cement their monopoly once the government is gone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If by cement, you mean acquire 100% of the market, that&#39;s extraordinarily improbable. If it keeps serving customers it will retain a large part of the market, but only then.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you don&#39;t even know what a monopoly is? that should be topic #1 for aspiring libertarians. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You assume too much. I didn&#39;t ask what you think a monopoly is because I haven&#39;t encountered the term and its definitions, I asked to get a sense of which definitions you use. The term is supposed to mean 100% market share, when used strictly, but it&#39;s sometimes used to refer to command of a very large market share. For example, late-19th century Standard Oil is commonly referred to as a monopoly, but it never acquired 100% of the market. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a monopoly, since you don&#39;t know, is cornering the market such that the company dictates the conditions of sale rather than the consumer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a different definition from the stricter one on Wikipedia: &quot;A monopoly exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity </p>

<p>Here are the two definitions, which you quoted yourself, so I&#39;m confused as to why you don&#39;t think &quot;monopoly&quot; can be an ambiguous word:</p>

<p>&quot;In economics, a monopoly is a single seller. In law, a monopoly is a business entity that has significant market power, that is, the power, to charge high prices.&quot;</p>

<p>The definition based on law shows how little politicians know of economics. It does not follow that if a company that has significant market power, it will charge high prices. Standard Oil did the opposite. It also doesn&#39;t follow that is a company has the power to charge high prices (all companies do), that consumers will buy the product instead of looking for alternatives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>no, it doesn&#39;t. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not a rebuttal. But maybe you will criticize me for not substantiating my claim enough. A company will lose its monopoly status if it stops serving consumers because there are always alternatives. Substitution, emerging competition, already-established companies that can switch their production to undercut the monopoly, etc. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>no i didn&#39;t. tell me why legislators saw a need to outlaw trusts and monopolies and anti-competitive practices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did legislators see a need to create the Drug War? There were probably some who had good intentions, some who had something to gain.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing enough legislators were converted to the view that government can improve competition. Ironically, government restricts competition all the time, one example is the restriction of foreign trade through tariffs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why do i ask? because we used to have laissez-faire capitalism. it didn&#39;t work. and now you&#39;re proposing we go back to it based on your ignorance of the problems it caused! it&#39;s crazy!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ll have to point me to the time period you&#39;re talking about and why it didn&#39;t work. Should I assume you&#39;re referring to late 20th century US?</p>
