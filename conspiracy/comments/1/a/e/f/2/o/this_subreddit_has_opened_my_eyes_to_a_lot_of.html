But that will take a majority of the population. We have a long way to go and too little time.

    <div class="md"><p>I went through the same feeling when going through my awakening. I was absorbing so much knowledge that I had an overwhelming urge to share it with others. Facebook was a bust, as just about everyone of my so called &quot;friends&quot; had their heads too far up their asses.</p>

<p>I recommend seeking out REAL friends to talk about these things with. People you can trust to say anything around. Right now me and a couple buddies quite regularly have intense talks about our country, the world, and eventually the cosmos and all that is. It feels great to sit and discuss things with people that actually listen, heed your words and ideas instead of turning you down or passing them off as crazy.</p>

<p>As a &quot;conspirator&quot; I know I&#39;ve probably sounded a bit zany explaining chem trails to my family, but I <em>know</em> that our skies aren&#39;t the same as they were. Where I live, it&#39;s been a beautiful blue sky in the morning for days, up until around 8 o clock when planes start dumping that shit and turning the sky into an ugly white haze. Anyone who thinks that&#39;s a natural sky is off their fucking rocker. There <em>never</em> used to be this many ugly, hazy days with literal GRIDS of trails in the sky.</p>

<p>But I digress. The best thing you can do is keep gaining knowledge, and find a group of close friends to share and exchange wisdom with. As far as fighting the evil that grips the world, we have to start with ourselves and &quot;be the change&quot;, so to speak. Good luck and godspeed fellow crusader!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>prepare as much as possible, wake others ( I know it&#39;s tough and I struggle with it day to day, and Ive been awake since &#39;08) stop supporting the system, ie. take your money out of the bank, shop local, support local businesses, learn how to support yourself, be active in your community ( I am amazed to see how few people turn up at city hall meetings where I am located ), if you can, run for local office, devise a means of protecting your family and friends ( I hope it would not come to it, but if history has anything to say, I am wrong in my aspirations ) stock as much food/water/toiletries as possible ( I know, times are tough ). Network with other like minded people, I developed some feeler questions ( opsec and I don&#39;t want all the people around me to think I am crazy all at once, ( you will get that from time to time) ). I found it&#39;s best to bitch about taxes, then ask a mundane question about something off radar (not openly related to being conspiracy related). More often than not, you will find that ( even unknowingly) people are awake, some more than others. Research, if you can&#39;t pose a valid argument, based with facts, then you look like a fool, and make the rest of us as well. Most importantly, don&#39;t think you can run off to the woods and live off the land, unless you already do. It&#39;s much harder than you think. The best medicine is prevention, that&#39;s what we are here for. </p>
