        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A large part of my job working for a computer repair company is having to deal with people, whether face to face or on the phone I deal with many different random people on a daily basis. Usually our conversations don&#39;t span beyond the services we are performing for them or occasional small chat here and there.</p>

<p>A week ago or so a lady came into our store with a computer she needed to have information recovered from from, at first she was reluctant to give much detail as to what the information was, only that it was sensitive to recover for legal purposes regarding her ex-husband. I assumed it was probably CP and she needed it for prosecution purposes.</p>

<p>She came in yesterday to pick up the system and and have the data transferred to a portable drive, since the transfer was going to take a little while we started chatting, as the conversation grew I subtly pushed us onto the topic of the situation with her ex-husband, out of curiosity. She asked me if I had heard of The Illuminati, I told her that I had limited knowledge on the subject and that the only thing I could find was something about &#39;The Law of 13s&#39; which I couldn&#39;t find any verifiable info about itself other than it <em>may</em> be their plan to starve the first world countries, when I told her that she said &quot;ah, yup&quot; as if it was a subject she knew much about..</p>

<p>(<a href="http://i.imgur.com/KBWcnRf.jpg">IMAGE SET ONE</a>)</p>

<p>(<a href="http://i.imgur.com/CYshR98.jpg">IMAGE SET TWO</a>)</p>

<p>(<a href="http://i.imgur.com/JksaUiB.jpg">IMAGE SET THREE</a>)</p>

<p>(<a href="http://i.imgur.com/60E0tOM.jpg">SINGLE DOLLAR BILL</a>)</p>

<p>She asked me if I wanted to see some pictures then she went out to her car and got an envelope of kodak developed photos and laid them out on the table, she then explained to me that her husband was involved in the illuminati and that the &#39;13&#39; in the law of 13s is referring to some sort of &#39;ranking&#39; system within the organization and that all members are numbered from 1 to 13, 13 being the highest ranking.</p>

<p>You can see in the pictures that random lights and distortion of the photos, she said that her husband had her and her daughter pose for the pictures but that when they were taken, there were no lights. She went on to talk about the symbol of the illuminati, the triangle and that the triangle was just 3 lines and that her husband was part of a secret order called the &quot;Robin Hood Initiative&quot; whose symbol is just 3 vertical lines parallel to eachother, much like the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Hz60mNJ.jpg">skrillex logo</a>. Their purpose is to basically overthrow the old way of doing things with a more technologically advanced mindset.</p>

<p>She talked about what the lights in the photos meant, the pictures with the three blue lights are apparently entities, some sort of guardians that her ex-husband was able to communicate with, and he referred to them as &quot;blue man&quot; and that if is chosen he can become the next blue man. </p>

<p>The picture of the dollar she explained to me is some sort of message. Her husband was having a problem with a doctor and he had her deliver this message, to give the dr the dollar with the 3 lines drawn on it and to say &quot;you have snakes in the grass&quot; she said that the dr had a near panic attack and wouldnt even touch the dollar. She continued to explain to me that the organization has ties into the CA power grid and into google, as that is their main mode of communication and transferring information to eachother using &#39;defined search terms&#39; to access areas of google that one wouldn&#39;t be able to access without knowing how to search for them.</p>

<p>Anyways, this is all the information I have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always thought the Illuminati was about secrecy -- if it exists at all.  If the Illuminati is all about secrecy, what are they doing taking pictures of their blue guardians?  And taking pictures that have been developed somewhere -- i.e. WalMart or some photo lab?  People there would have seen the pics, probably not known what they were, but the images are weird enough to draw attention.  Does the Illuminati amuse itself this way, dropping clues, leaving such pictures in the hands of ex-spouses?  Even if these were printed on a home computer, they&#39;re still in the hands of an ex spouse.  And what&#39;s the purpose of taking these photos?  Remembering old times with the blue guardians?  This makes as much sense as the mafia taking pictures of a ceremony where a guy is &quot;made&quot; and having them developed at Walgreens.  I can&#39;t see that happening.  Reminds me of the time I received spam email asking me if I wanted to join a secret society.  Ain&#39;t so secret if you&#39;re spamming to get members.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m curious what the incriminating info/material was that came off the computer.  No mention of that.  These are extraneous pics that woman had in her car. </p>

<p>And if this group is so powerful and terrifying, how did OP get to photograph these images?  I mean, if this group can induce a near-panic in a doctor . . .</p>

<p>The story is interesting, but it doesn&#39;t add up to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No i agree, it doesn&#39;t add up. I don&#39;t know what other photos she had on the computer, we aren&#39;t allowed to look through her files as part of our company privacy policy. She let me take the pictures because they were interesting to me and I asked if I could, she almost had an attitude of wanting to expose more info about her ex-husband. We do however still have her info on our server as it hasn&#39;t auto deleted yet..</p>

Some were clearly trolls, some were clearly just narrow minded. I really feel for the OP if they are being honest. If not, well, this is r/conspiracy and why else are you here but to read fantastic stories that may or my not be true? 
I do have to say the pics are a little bit of a stretch. The one that looks like a penis coming out of the pyramid shape is sort of weird though.</p>
