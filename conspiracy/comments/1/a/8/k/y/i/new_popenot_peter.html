    <div class="md"><p>This is some information that I gleaned from the thread over in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, nothing really interesting though.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bergoglio finished 2nd in the last conclave to Pope Benedict</li>
<li>He&#39;s age 76</li>
<li>He is the 1st South American Pope</li>
<li>Bergoglio is the first Jesuit pope</li>
<li>He has taken the name Pope Francis, which is apparently very important.
It is because he is the first to take an original name in nearly 1000 years, according to the BBC. That is supposed to signal that he is a reformer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The thread over there has some pretty insightful comments.</p>

<p>It&#39;d be funny if the Catholic Church was trying to dodge the prophecy of having the &quot;black skin&quot; man as pope which would bring the end of rome, find it mistranslated, and end up bringing in a man who&#39;s &quot;Black of Heart.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea. Usually that happens. Also that torture thing is wrong, I believe. Wikipedia states otherwise, with sources.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Bergoglio#Relations_with_the_Argentine_government">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Bergoglio#Relations_with_the_Argentine_government</a></p>

<p>On 15 April 2005, a human rights lawyer filed a criminal complaint against Bergoglio, as superior in the Society of Jesus of Argentina, accusing him of involvement in the kidnapping by the Navy in May 1976 (during the military dictatorship) of two Jesuit priests. The priests, Orlando Yorio and Francisco Jalics, were found alive five months later, drugged and semi-nude. Yorio accused Bergoglio of effectively handing them over to the death squads by declining to tell the regime that he endorsed their work. Jalics refused to discuss it after moving into seclusion in a German monastery.</p>

<p>This has got me thinking. Maybe the name Petrus Romanus is not a literal name but rather the...how would you put it? The symbol of the last pope?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Petrus Romanus</em> means Peter of Rome. Peter was the rock on which Jesus built his church. The Jesuits,(of which Pope Francis is and who&#39;s leader is known as the <em>&quot;Black Pope&quot;</em>) swear to live life as Jesus does i.e. going back to the very foundation on which the church was founded. The new pope will bring it back to square-one. You gotta tear down before you rebuild.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Black Pope&quot; is a derogatory nickname given to the Superior General[1] usually by the media (and never used by the Jesuits themselves). The name comes partly from the color of the plain black priest&#39;s cassock, worn by members of the Society, including the Superior General, partly from a past concern (most prominent around the 16th and 17th centuries) amongst Protestant European countries concerning the relative power of the Jesuits within the Roman Catholic Church, and partly because the Superior General is elected for life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Am I the only one who realizes centuries-old practices of dogmatic rituals ARE NOT aligned with the true transhumanist movement?  If these guys are serious about this goal, and about unlocking our path towards All, then they are not very intelligence actualizers, let alone wise observers.  This strategy is just a waste of time.  They could do more for the world and for &#39;rational minds&#39; if they tear down their walls, destroy their church.  I can&#39;t see them doing that, instead I see them prolonging their deformed angels (bishops, order leaders, etc) instead of giving martyrdom to all who seek it.  </p>

<p>They have the power of rituals, that <em>intuitive knowledge</em>, and use it in manipulative ways. (e.g., the ritual of being flock in need of a shepherd, or holding a secret that is punishable by spiritual death if revealed).  But knowledge is best found when All humans are directed towards that cause.</p>

<p>For me the real kicker is this: a transhumanist movement without women?  Give me a break.  </p>

<p>We need to treat these thieves like the dirt they are, and stop giving them coverage in the media, and minutes of our time in conversation.  Let them fade away into irrelevance like they should.  They deserve no more respect than any other liars or criminals.</p>
