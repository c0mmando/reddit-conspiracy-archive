        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Capitalism is based on consumption. Reducing budget deficit in the middle of a crisis only reduces the ability of the masses to consume. Reducing the consumption, small and medium (local) business, who do not have the funds to withstand the shock, fail, while big ones just fire a hell lot of individuals until the crisis pass. </p>

<p>It is then created a huge pool of desperate individuals who now must accept to work for less. It also becomes politically viable to pass laws that would be frowned upon by the working class (reducing benefits, increasing work hours, taking labor rights away, the usual) in normal times. Profits from big players are increased by reducing the wages, increasing the work hours, etc.</p>

<p>Also, it is a little bit difficult to make competitive products in developed countries when you can hire slaves to do the same in China.</p>

<p>Why I think this is not just incompetence? This measure was successfully applied in UK during baroness Thatcher government. Never have capitalists made so much profit before, while the labor force was weakened. They now seek to do the same in other &quot;developed&quot; countries, where wages are too high to maintain profits. </p>

<p>In essence, it is a desirable crisis, moved by the following factors, among others (redacted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_theory">wiki</a> because I am lazy):</p>

<p>1-) Full employment profit squeeze: capital accumulation can pull up the demand for labor power, raising wages. If wages rise &quot;too high,&quot; it hurts the rate of profit;</p>

<p>2-) The tendency of the rate of profit to fall: the accumulation of capital, the general advancement of techniques and scale of production, and the inexorable trend to oligopoly by the victors of capitalist market competition, all involve a general tendency for the degree of capital intensity, i.e., the &quot;organic composition of capital&quot; of production to rise. All else constant, this leads to a fall in the rate of profit;</p>

<p>You can expect corporate merges, wages and labor rights being undermined, high unemployment for some time and record profits. It is a textbook move. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I once heard the Republican Party called the &quot;cheap labor&quot;party.  It&#39;s almost as though they purposely want this to be a third world country. Austerity creates a new level of wage slaves... A former Vice President once wrote an essay about what fascism would look like if it came to America and it was eery.  I would say that we are pretty damn close with our corporate takeover.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking recently about the the demise of the G.I. Bill.  So no more new recruits will be going into the armed forces for 4 years just to earn enough for college will probably diminish the ranks.  My initial thoughts were that they have all they need at the moment and my wife initially thought they&#39;ll go for the draft.  But maybe a higher amount of unemployment will force young people to join the armed forces instead of looking for jobs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a fact that all capitalist nations need to have a percentage of the population unemployed, and to try to maintain a perceived scarcity of jobs.  This ensures wages of the masses can be kept at a reasonable level.  Full employment (less than 1% unemployment) sees wage rises, as can currently be seen in countries like Thailand).  However austerity goes much further.  You introduce austerity to put the whole lot at risk.  Many large organisations will be squeezed so hard that they too &#39;go to the wall&#39;.  It is an aggressive tactic that wipes out middle to large organisations, yet supports small and massive organisations.  The only conclusion for having such measures must be to either force the elimination of minimum wages, or to force a new industry onto the masses.</p>

<p>The consumer age is slowing down quite naturally, we don&#39;t need as much stuff anymore and people have grown tired of it all.  Maybe austerity will force the thinkers amongst us to think that bit harder and come up with a solution.  The USA and Europe don&#39;t want manufacturing to return, those jobs are soul destroying, we now live in the Information Age and service age, let the Chinese sit there for 16 hours a day doing the same monotonous task day in day out, year in, year out for a miserable pittance.  We already spent 200 years doing it, we don&#39;t want those days back!</p>

<p>Anyone using class identities is just enforcing a capitalist view of identity and throwing financial &#39;promise&#39; of a few breadcrumbs to people in exchange for their destroying all the things that make them wealthy (non-financial wealth).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I say capitalists, I am talking about board directors and CEOs of companies like Siemens, Alcoa, Accenture, Exxon, Total SA, JP Morgan, Barclays, etc., making money through financial investments. White collar professionals (managers, certain technical positions) are still &quot;labor&quot;. I mean class identity in that sense. Indeed, anyone that uses non-financial wealth to achieve and maintain material wealth could be said to be part of &quot;labor&quot;.</p>
