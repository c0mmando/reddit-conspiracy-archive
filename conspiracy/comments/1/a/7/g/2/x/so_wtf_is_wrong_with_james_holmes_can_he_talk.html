    <div class="md"><p>Insanity in this context means unable to distinguish between right and wrong.  If he has sufficient mental capacity to understand that his acts were wrong, and he&#39;s capable of understanding the evidence presented against him, he&#39;s fit to stand trial and be convicted.</p>

<p>This is why lunatics like Ted Bundy can&#39;t use the insanity defense. Ted Bundy was pretty insane, but he also clearly knew his actions were wrong and he was capable of defending himself in court. In contrast, Andrea Yates thought she was following god&#39;s orders. She literally believed she was saving her kids from the devil (or at least that&#39;s what the jury concluded).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah like i said, how can he <em>not</em> be insane? Guys like Bundy were insane but knew they were wrong therefore tried to hide it, tried to creep in the shadows, tried to get away with it. What the fuck was this guy doing? What was his endgame?

    <div class="md"><p>Some crazy people have periodic moments of clarity. Andrea Yates is one example: she would have episodes where she&#39;d realize what she&#39;d done and she&#39;d break down emotionally. But most of the time she was still in zombieland or whatever. </p>

<p>Holmes apparently knew he was mentally ill and was fighting it for a few years, so he probably has some delusional periods and some normal periods. He might have been batshit when he was planning to kill all those people, but once the bullets started flying he realized he&#39;d goofed. Being a PhD student with substantial training in neuroscience, he probably understands the symptoms of mental illness well enough to fake out any psychiatrists,  that combined with his history of actual mental illness probably gives him his one and only chance of avoiding the electric chair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it a bit odd that Americans, who are amongst the brightest people on the planet, read conspiracy into just about every tragic event.  I&#39;m with them on 9/11.  However, only as far as the official story is mostly bs.  It&#39;s a sad fact that if you arm a population to the teeth, every so often one of them will go postal and shoot things up a bit.  The USA doesn&#39;t need to stage false flag shootings to push through gun control, all it needs to do is report every single day all the gun crimes that happened across the nation on that day.  After six months of these real stories, mixed in with the next mass shooting which will inevitably happen, the gun control movement would gain massive natural traction.</p>

<p>However saying this, I am against gun control.  It is the single marker of true freedom that the USA has and I believe it should stay that way.  Oh and yes there is a lot of shit your gvt has been involved with and is still involved with.  You should be more worried and more vocal about the things that really matter, like fluoride in your tap water, GM foods, the banking and corporate scandals, the increasing radiation levels, why so many men are developing prostate cancer and so many women develop breast cancer.  Since you&#39;ve given up the booze and cigarettes your life expectancy has got lower!  Something is seriously wrong in your country, but you all get tied up in knots over events nobody can control and not concentrating on the ones you can control.</p>

<p>Also, don&#39;t run away thinking that all your politicians are corrupt, they aren&#39;t.  Send a letter to your congressman voicing your concerns, if they receive a lot with similar complaints they will raise these issues.  You&#39;ll be surprised at just how normal most congressmen/women are, and how many are exactly like you and fed up to the back teeth of the corruption that exists.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How? Perhaps smoke. Or when bullets are flying your way people tend to turn around maybe? That&#39;s beyond the point. What if he did shoot up the place, but it was due to the mind controlling drugs? Also whatever drugs he&#39;s on, I doubt he got from the crack house down the street. Also all of his equipment? Where the fuck did he get that? And just so you know, I&#39;m not claiming this as fact. The only conspiracy I&#39;ll go far enough to say is fact is Chris Dorner, and certain things about 9/11. Because for the most part, if I didn&#39;t see it, then how can you be 100% sure? You can&#39;t really. But as you can see this is something I feel strongly about.</p>

I realize that MKUltra indeed shows one of the darker sides to our government, and one of the few conspiracies which I believe is confirmed, but to say he was completely mind-controlled into mass murder is a bit of a stretch, to say the least.
