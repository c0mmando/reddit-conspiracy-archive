<p>Operation Paperclip was the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) program used to recruit the scientists of Nazi Germany for employment by the United States in the aftermath of World War II (1939–45). It was conducted by the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA), and in the context of the burgeoning Soviet–American Cold War (1945–91), one purpose of Operation Paperclip was to deny German scientific knowledge and expertise to the USSR,[1] the UK,[2] and (divided) Germany itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One word:  Moabites.</p>

<p>The God of Abaraham destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah but old Abe pleaded with God to spare his nephew Lot. Lot&#39;s daughters wouldn&#39;t have sex with a non-Sodomite so they got pregnant by their father, and founded the Moabite and Ammonite nations. </p>

<p>God warned the Israelites to never intermarry with the Moabites but that didn&#39;t stop Boaz.  The story of Ruth and  Boaz is one of the key legends of Freemasonry.  David was their descendant.  All European monarchs claim to rule &quot;Dei gratia&quot;, by grace of God, as descendants of David.  To this day they would rather commit incest or inbreeding  than marry a &quot;commoner&quot; (non-Sodomite).</p>

<p>The ultimate aim of the Moabites who have thoroughly infiltrated the Jews, Christians, and Freemasons, is to &quot;immanentise the eschaton&quot; and bring about a nuclear holocaust as a revenge for the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrrah. </p>

<p>The Moabite conspiracy was a central topic of the late Joseph Ehrlich who ran the securities trading firm of Sender Berl inc.  His securites trading strategy was based on conspiracy theory - predicting the next moves of the elites.  He was a frequent guest  on Rense.com radio.  His theories were formerly published on the Sender Berl website but now  there are just archived articles available, mostly on Rense.com</p>

<p>EDIT: reviewing the rules of this subreddit, i see that there is no racism of any kind allowed so I am on shaky ground with this theory.  Race is a misdirection.  This is about a bloodline.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the more popular conspiracy theorists tend to be attention whores because somehow they make money off of it. For those of us that don&#39;t, however, we have time and the ability to sit back and look at ALL of the facts. Raelism kind of makes sense. Believing in the fact that some of the most influential people in the history of human kind weren&#39;t actually human makes sense. The reason being is because some of these humans could &quot;complete other-worldly&quot; tasks. Like sitting under a tree with no food or water for an extended period of time or changing water into wine.</p>

<p>For those of you wondering what Bohemian Grove is: Bohemian Grove is a 2,700-acre (1,100 ha) campground located at 20601 Bohemian Avenue, in Monte Rio, California, belonging to a private San Francisco-based men&#39;s art club known as the Bohemian Club. In mid-July each year, Bohemian Grove hosts a two-week, three-weekend encampment of some of the most powerful men in the world.[1][2]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I don&#39;t think the Bush administration was directly responsible. I think they used some rogue branch of some military group to carry it out. In fact, it was probably some part of a private corporation... like a defense contractor.

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing I disagree with is the amount of time necessary. I could see a large spool of thermite chord (or some variant there of) being ran right along side existing cabling. That would provide the subterfuge needed to go unnoticed. Hell they could even wrap it right in with some cat 5 cabling and the lay person wouldn&#39;t even know what they were running. Of course there still would need to be a way to control it to ensure that the buildings feel in on themselves like they did. Just ideas I&#39;m throwing out here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, as is well known, the weekend prior to 9/11 the buildings were shut down for &quot;maintenance&quot; for something like 12 hours or so on Saturday or Sunday. Don&#39;t quote me on that, but I know the &quot;maintenance&quot; happened... not positive on the timeframes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same explosives that didn&#39;t make any noise, made the back of the building collapse separately from the opposite front, that no one discovered for the weeks it would take to place the explosives, and that no one has found any evidence for?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but wtc 6 didn&#39;t have fires burn on multiple floors uncontrollably for several hours with no sprinkler systems activated. It wasn&#39;t the brute damage that bought it down. </p>

<p>Look up how the building actually collapsed, it didn&#39;t fall in one piece. Whilst from the front angle it looks like it fell, indeed, from a controlled demolition, the unevenness of the collapse is not one that would be produced by a controlled demolition. Nor is the lack of explosions being heard for half a mile around. </p>

<p>There are no academic journals or research papers with real evidence that the buildings were bought down in that way, and hundreds of papers about the physics of the collapse that make total, scientific, peer reviewed (!) sense. There&#39;s no science to the explosives claim, only speculation and observation. </p>

<p>Because at the end of the day, you and I probably aren&#39;t experts at engineering and physics, but there are people out there who are, and I&#39;d prefer to side with science than YouTube videos. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The explosions could be anything, lift collapses, fire outbreaks from gas leaks, partial structural damage and many more factors. There&#39;s no reason why, if you were demolishing a building, you would allow random explosive charges to detonate down the building. Doesn&#39;t really prove either of our theories. </p>

<p>Yeah sure, this video shows multiple views, (i&#39;ve timestamped the clearest) of the back portion of the building collapsing if you watch the top, before the rest gives way. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=Atbrn4k55lA#t=238s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=Atbrn4k55lA#t=238s</a>
Another video shows a structural analysis of the forces going on inside the tower, which completely agrees with what we see on that day.
Unless of course, you believe the National Institute of Standards and Technology is all a big government operation?? These people are scientists, the people that make the conspiracy videos you watch, aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>As someone in the comments says perfectly: &quot;Why go to a university to get an engineering or physics degree when you can just look at TV footage of the collapse of World Trade Center buildings and become an instant Ph.D!&quot; 
You really think the scientists involved here are &#39;in on it&#39; ??</p>

<p>Well if you believe the thermite/nano thermite theory, you would need large amounts of material to be placed on each of the supports around the building. You would also need to wire these explosives/thermite up, with giant networks of wiring that, if you wanted to keep unnoticeable, really would take weeks to lay down you would have to have them be laid along the lift shafts and air ducts to avoid anyone seeing. You would also need to remove all the CCTV of the days it would take to place. There would be hundreds of people involved in an operation like this, it&#39;s just ridiculous to assume anyone could pull that off. A weekend isn&#39;t long enough, it takes more than that to rig an empty building for demolition let alone a secret, thermite one. </p>

<p>And ah, is this the paper by Steven Jones about the &#39;thermite&#39; he found? The same paper that involves samples being taken from pedestrians off NY&#39;s floor, hand rails, and window sills, about 5 years after the event? By non-scientists? And from one guy who &quot;chose not to give his name&quot;?? There&#39;s no way, scientifically, you can have those samples be trustworthy for reviewal. That&#39;s not reliable in any way.
One sample even contained 0.1% of these &#39;red/gray chips&#39;, which, if indeed was thermite; aluminium and iron oxide, would have caused deaths from poisoning as a kilogram would contain a gram of this toxic shit. 
And also, the thing was &#39;published&#39; and &#39;peer reviewed&#39; from a pretty non-credible journal, that didn&#39;t even ask for the samples themselves. Jones isn&#39;t even allowing other scientists to have access to his samples...
I don&#39;t even want to bother going into the factual inaccuracies about this paper, and yes, I have read it.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant mate, but I just feel strongly about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your conviction but I fear it may be misplaced, friend. I plead for you take a look at the bigger picture and to see it all for what it truly is. The death and wholesale murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent people, many of which are children. Believe what you want about the events of that day, but don&#39;t forget what it has ultimately lead to, and what we all have have lost as humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no I certainly understand what it has lead to, I think the atrocities on that day and the resultant slaughter across Iraq and Afghanistan were unbelievable and people should be bought to tribunals for it, American and UK politicians and further. 
I plead for you to look at the evidence I&#39;ve posted, and be angry at your government for the atrocities they&#39;ve committed abroad and the civil rights they&#39;ve stripped you of, not the destruction of these buildings they had nothing to be with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have we forgotten the <a href="http://investigate911.org/">scientist who took some of the rubble home and had it positively tested for remnants of thermite</a>? I just watched his interview the other day. And there&#39;s plenty of eyewitness testimony to explosions. Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rodriguez">William Rodriguez</a>, and his co-worker <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/9-11-claims-victim-article-1.319564">Kenny Johannemann</a> who mysteriously and abruptly &quot;committed suicide&quot;. They both reported massive explosions in the basement <em>before</em> the tower had even been hit by a plane.</p>
