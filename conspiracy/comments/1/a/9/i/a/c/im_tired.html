    <div class="md"><p>Dear OP:</p>

<p>Many of us have found ourselves at one point or another in your shoes. It is common amongst us who realize that our country is falling due to some purpose that we are ALL unsure of. We develop a need to become the superhero that can save the world. This isn&#39;t a bad thing, but it may lead to detrimental effects on one&#39;s psyche. There are many ways to fix this. The most popular way, I fear, is probably being substance abuse, (working on mine). The best fix is to just get away for a while. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theory is a great way to practice your critical thinking skills, but it can lead to obsession after awhile. Find some outdoor activities, (jogging is great), or indoor activities that promote a healthy mindset. A diet of positive music can&#39;t hurt either. You have to have a healthy mind, one that is unbiased and extremely critical in its approach to understanding the world. Just come back later. Give it a two week break. Allow yourself to disconnect from this reality and find a more peaceful reality. Following that, you may find yourself more easily able to benefit from these type forums. You may even find a purpose to your life. But you need to remember, all good things come through moderation. </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>ventian</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how conspiracies tend to mimic those who make them up isn&#39;t it? You&#39;re dumb as fuck, and so you like to think the people involved in your conspiracies are stupid enough to do this shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ll only ever find yourself in real and genuine relationships with real life people. Start with yourself. The world is a bad place, but it&#39;s a good place too, because we&#39;re still here. The abstract, the ultra-powerful, and all that are on a different level than ours, therefore we feel intimidated by that darkness. But you are not called to change all the darkness to light at once. Others are called with you. You are called to change the darkness in light to and for yourself, then those closest to you. If there are some who won&#39;t listen, turn and talk to someone else. </p>

<p>The world is a shitty place, but it&#39;s really, truly, never been as good as it is today. In the decades, centuries, and millennia before this, people never even questioned their leaders. The dissenters died. Truth was hard to come by. The darkness was so overwhelming; only a tiny fraction saw it for what it was. Now masses, large masses of people are seeing and recognizing the shit for what it is.</p>

<p>You feel frustrated because you face an enemy that has been entrenched for thousands of years or more. But this enemy, the dark nameless force of control and manipulation that we fight with truth and love and hope, is losing ground. You and I are evidence of this. The awake are not going back to sleep, and whenever one falls, ten more take their place. The light comes, and it reveals the depths of darkness we didn&#39;t know before, but do not be fooled; It is the light that is revealing these things.</p>

<p>The only power darkness has over us is the power to present a strong illusion of fear and despair. &quot;Paranoia.&quot; But this demon can be defeated, if you take it one step at a time. See the light and hope in everything. Realize that things can and do get better, even if they look worse for a while before.</p>

<p>Thank you for posting. I love you, and many others do too. Together we can make the world a better place, but it&#39;s only me and you that can do it, not &quot;government&quot; or any other external agency we might put our trust in. Me and you, together, can do it. Me, and you, and every one of the cheerful soldiers of light, can face this darkness, stare it down, and win.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay I think this is a great plan, I think it will work, and everything will be fine.... I hereby want you to implement this plan&quot;.... I want to know who that individual is. </p>

<p>Actually, now that I think about it... I have no idea if these are pictures from the event or not. I don&#39;t even know if this event actually happened. I don&#39;t know if those people were actually there or not. This propaganda apparatus is ridiculous. Eliminate the news channels. Get rid of them. No one needs to watch news. The only form of general (non topical) news needs to be local and regional newspaper.

Now we have to deal with what agencies are monitoring me online, what organizations are gaining my info because the government gives it to them, etc etc. Apathy is the worst way to go, and if the rest of the country sticks with apathy, then I don&#39;t even have 65 years left. I don&#39;t think this country has ten years left before the shit hits the fan and this country is torn apart, or tears itself apart. It matters for that reason alone, who perpetrates what crimes, and the outcome of the aftermath. 
 I can change the world (or at least the world around me) if I try. I can get involved, raise awareness, be obnoxious, or even be evil myself if it meant change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you OP. I have been reading this sub for 4-6 months now. My eyes have been opened to many things. I can&#39;t make sense of any of it. I&#39;m an intelligent person. I have always asked questions and needed to know how things work. I find I&#39;ve come to a point to where all I have are questions with answers I don&#39;t want to know. The questions run deeper though. I&#39;ve gone back and questioned many other things. The most scary of these, for me, is the idea of theism, or Christianity, or lack thereof. (I was raised Christian but have always struggled with it). I implore each of you to take a moment to think about your own mortality/eternity. I have become tired, scared, detached and the substance abuse doesn&#39;t help. I tried breaking away from the sub and stick to just reading politics and worldnews. I feel it&#39;s important to keep up to date with the world around me. These subs haven&#39;t helped lately either. They all blend together now. But I refuse to think ignorance is the best solution! Sure I can take a vacation, live reddit-less for a few weeks. It might help. But the real world is going to be right there waiting for me. And possibly already changed drastically.  I&#39;m caught up in it now. I feel like I&#39;m on the inside looking out into the world stage.  Sometimes I wish I had never smoked pot and found r/conspiracy. 
I&#39;m done with my directionless rant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have felt this way as well, lately. And suddenly, I realized why. Not that I&#39;m paranoid and believe that everything is a conspiracy theory, but in a way, you feeling this way is the ultimate conspiracy on their part. They reveal enough about themselves where we can feel how strong they are, how powerful they are, and it&#39;s <em>designed</em> to make us feel despondent and powerless about what to do in the face of their might. But we are actually very, very powerful. It might be overnight, and many of us will die, or it might be a slow decline over five years, let<code>s say, and many of us will starve, or have to move, or whatever, but the facts remain that their system is corrupt, and it IS indeed eating itself up from within. And they can see this, too, and they are preparing. Just as we saw the government tightening bankruptcy laws because they could see the coming tsunami of student loan and other debt, we also see the rapid militarization of our police departments across the country. Tanks and drones roll back to the USA from Iraq and Afghanistan and their next use will be to kill, enslave and control the population. But each day they wait is a day closer to a world where we won</code>t need them. If you think about it, all they have is money. If we find a different way to exchange goods and services, perhaps using upvotes, karma, or some such other reputation-capture method, we will be closer to freedom. </p>

<p>Please don`t think about death too much. It is inevitable. Please think about where you were before you were born, instead. Your consciousness is a continuum, and only entered their physical world knowing it would be for a brief time. If they happen to have you here, great, but they cannot have your spirit, or your servitude, or your acceptance of their slavery. Continue to live in ways that elevate freedom, choice, and that invest in YOU as a person, and in the person that you will be once you are again outside their short, limited span of existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, on behalf of society,  apologize for your current situation.</p>

<p>Not every will emerge from the rabbit hole in tact. One good way to face the brutality of the world is to make sure your spiritual, mental and physical health /alignment is strong.   If all you eat is fried foods you will not have a healthy body. If all you feed your brain is pain, destruction, failure, fear,  then that&#39;s what your brain becomes.  If you don&#39;t feed your soul, spirit, humanity anything at all it starves, dies and you will have an empty spirit.</p>

<p>Take some time to work on your spirit.  This includes strengthening the mind and learning.</p>

<p>God give me the strength to change the things I can;</p>

<p>Accept the things I can not;</p>

<p>And the wisdom to know the difference.
- Christianity</p>

<p>On the path to enlightenment one must understand and accept :</p>

<p>There is suffering (life is suffering)</p>

<p>There is a cause or reason for suffering -it is attachment /desire </p>

<p>There is a cessation to suffering</p>

<p>The cessation of suffering comes through enlightenment, enlightenment is achieved through the eight fold path (which includes right speech, right thought, right action)</p>

<p>-Buddhism</p>

<p>Take some time to study world religions.  They are all insightful and great examples of how to cope and heal.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, You are conscious and alive. You know about all this now and knowledge is the first step forward. The universe is a great and vast place, do not worry about the dramas of  &quot;men and mice&quot; for they are but a spec, the universal energies tend  always go to equilibrium, to a balance. And  no amount of great evil will prevail indefinitely. Freemason  Circle-jerking to Isis  New world order(Rich douchebags in robes worshiping ancient cults), cannot ruin the great experience of life on this planet and the Universe. It may stifle economies and individuals  for  awhile, but  it  cannot prevail for long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This.</p>

<p>This by far out of every response I have received has reflected the way I feel. The Universe is this grand thing, and we are but a spec. However, I do not feel that balance will always occur in the world of men. That is what scares me the most. No secret societies trouble me as much as the men in them, whether they believe in the rituals and rites they perform, or they simply use the group and power for their own twisted ways. This cycle could be perpetuated by continuously brainwashing, controlling the education, the money... and soon this malicious greed and apathy could become the norm and prevail across the globe, and then if man journeys to the stars, we would only spread that greed further. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world of men is made up of arbitrary and sometimes artificial  systems of trials  and errors. It is limited.  Mankind is not exempt from the laws of nature and the universe, he is bound by them.  Universal balance has always occurred, even in our history, there is no great human army or  power that has not fallen. All past Generations of mankind coupled together are hardly any different or advanced spiritually than each individual  man born in his own brief life. We are at the height of human knowledge thus far, but we know no more than  the guys who built the pyramids. We dress better and move faster. That&#39;s it. Think of the world of men as a baby being continuously born every few decades. It&#39;s  ideas and powers move in short naive cycles of  birth and death. But while you are alive, you are the constant. The thing that remains and retains memory. A constant part of the universe. I hope you find peace in your knowledge.</p>

<p>Edit : add: I hope that  the ultimate goal of knowledge, of understanding this world is to reconcile ourselves with the universal law, and not merely  tribulations of our earthly closet.</p>

I feel the same way you do but what keeps me going is the knowledge that the current trajectory of the world is not sustainable and there will come a time very soon when I will need to be the best person I can be to face whatever it is I am going to have to do.</p>

<p>Find others that feel what you are feeling so it isn&#39;t so hard to deal with by yourself. I am having a hard time doing this; I talk to some people I know about it but I&#39;m still the most &quot;extreme&quot; of my friends. People don&#39;t want to recognize this kind of stuff most of the time. Don&#39;t try to force them.</p>

<p>Brainstorm some small things that will make you feel like you are doing something about it. It can be as simple as handwritten signs stapled to telephone poles. Taking action in little manageable ways will build your courage to do bigger things.</p>

<p>Above all, don&#39;t give up and don&#39;t succumb to violence or hatred. Violence can only be a tool of oppressors. If anyone uses violence it only helps the oppressors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fine for the people that want to do that, but I feel like it&#39;s coming to a point where they are trying to force this onto us. Poor food choices, the lies and misinformation, the violence... I can say my family has stepped up too, the television is rarely ever used. My mother takes a ignore the news approach, while my father is very left, I have to remind him every once in a while, that Obama does some good, but to take it all with a grain of salt. We don&#39;t hear everything that happens, and the media he listens to will keep the division of republicans and democrats alive. </p>

<p>But what good is it, if only a few around you are awake and aware? What happens when it all falls apart? This system is flagrantly a lie, and when it crumbles, what will be behind the curtain? A militant country taking over the world? A nation enslaved to debtors? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>whats good about only a few around me being awake is that those are the people i interact with the most and thats whats important to me. i&#39;m not concerned with the ignorant grocery clerk that asks me about my &quot;health kick&quot; i&#39;m not even sure what the hell that means. i guess the torture they endure when facing the idea of eating an apple instead of snorting chicken fingers must be too much for them but thats their choice and why would you want to be involved with people like that when it does fall apart. if your family doesnt want to directly participate than prepare for them. if they matter to you enough than you would do that anyway. drawing your line in the sand is also an important step to take. ive decided what mine is going to be and thats all i can really plan for. no one knows whats going to happen and honestly i think good will prevail so i dont plan on ever having to act on it.  i guess what i&#39;m saying is decide what side of history you&#39;re going to be on and lighten up until when the time for that comes. worrying about whether or not billions of people are going to rise from ignorance was depressing and not worth it. </p>

I&#39;m not atheist, I&#39;m open to things beyond my understanding and comprehension.</p>

<p>As far as where we are headed... I can see the smoke and the glow of the fires... I can hear the cries of the hungry, the weak, and the poor. I can hear the suffering of the persecuted. I hear the laughter of the ones who lead us down this path, they had us fooled the whole time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s something else that might help you with a different outlook on Jesus and the (adulterated) Bible: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42V8BGBvTk">Alan Watts on Jesus and his Religion</a></p>

<p>In fact, take a day off - a whole day off - and devote it to listening only to the things Alan Watts has to say. Every time I&#39;m feeling anxious, I just tap into a little o&#39; that, and everything pops back into perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s easy to throw away any god that would let a world like this burn. I felt the same so very much since high school and my father kind of made a good point to me about god. He told me &quot; ****** you have to understand that in our belief, god gave us the power of free will. It was the power to decided right from wrong, to choose as we please. He gave us this gift with it in mind that it is purely up to us as humans to choose right no matter what, so we alone, can reach the heights of paradise (or heaven). If god were to interfere whenever he/she saw fit, we would merely be puppets and his greatest creation would not be anymore more then the animals we live with.&quot; This really in a purely logical way, made so much sense to me that I really started to put my faith in god and humanity again. He also added that the world has become and probably always has been; based on power and principalities. Choose to create a world of love, exploration, courtesy, and selflessness, and I promise you your happiness will return ten fold. This shit fucking sucks to see all the time, but unfortunately because it&#39;s the truth it&#39;s not going to go away but what your forgetting is that there really is a lot of good out there. <strong>When the time comes. It will save us all</strong>... or at least those with consciousnesses worth saving. </p>

<p>Edit 1: Also about the animals comment, sometimes I think god put animals on earth for that reason. To be our companions, and to learn from them by the nature of what they are. In their fullest form. </p>
