       <em>
        I am heavily redacting this description because the original quote I attributed to the Pope was not verbatim (as pointed out by dinky-hawker). The dual meaning of his words, however, remain.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       As an atheist, the Malachy prophesies are merely an amusing diversion, but this dual meaning did strike me as odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       His words have been translated by most commentators along the lines of "My brother cardinals have come to the ends of the earth to find a new Bishop of Rome" (a reference to him being the first Latin American Pope).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Italian newspaper
       <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/speciali/esteri/conclave-papa-elezioni2013/2013/03/13/news/fumata_bianca_eletto_il_nuovo_papa-54494392/">
        la Repubblica
       </a>
       states that the exact words were:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Voi sapete che il dovere del Conclave era di dare un Vescovo a Roma. Sembra che i miei fratelli Cardinali sono andati a prenderlo quasi alla fine del mondo, ma siamo qui."
      </p>
      <p>
       Google translates this as:
      </p>
      <p>
       "You know that the duty of the Conclave was to give a bishop in Rome. Seems that my brother Cardinals picked him up
       <strong>
        near the end of the world
       </strong>
       , but we're here."

       For anyone who doesn't know - the Malachy prophecies state that this newly elected pope will be the last ever pope. Possibly due to the end of the world. The prophecies have been pretty heavily debunked but are definitely interesting.

       I think people often forget that just because they do believe in all this stuff, doesn't mean all of us do.
Much like Zionism, they are going to try and push things to happen to make it look like their prophecies are coming true

       "I miei fratelli cardinali sono arrivati sino alla fine del mondo per prendere il nuovo vescovo di Roma"

       the second is an article in Italian.  The first is a copy-paste of this text, and the third is this.

       I'm not convinced that these are the words he used in the first place, muchless the translation.

       That'll tell you what a black pope is and all that.  It's the head of the Jesuit Order.  That's a black pope cuz the jesuit wears black and pope wears white.  It's a symbol, not his skin color.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peter the roman.  Rome is Italy.  People from Italy are called Italian.  So we can say Italian =  Roman.  His parents were from Italy.  He is Italian.  He is Roman.

      <p>
       He chose the name Francis.  Pope Francis I.  Francis of Assissi.  Francis of Assissi born with the name Francesco di Pietro di Bernardone.  Francis of Peter of Bernardone.

       Let me put it in terms of African history for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1988, the Warsaw Pact was a big deal with nuclear weapons and thousands of real physical tanks and planes.  They had Cuban and East German armed forces in Ethiopia.  They tried to take the Ark of the Covenant out of Axum, where it was guarded by an old blind monk armed with a stick.
Now not much happened in the REAL PHYSICAL WORLD, but within a couple of years the communist empire had crumbled and the old blind Ethiopian was still guarding the Ark.

       Because nobody heard it. Just saying. I'm not religious, and if I was I wouldn't be Catholic. But the new Pope was on TV today, and some Imam/Mullah wasn't. We can't comment on things someone may have said, rather we comment on things that were said. THAT being said, I understand where you are coming from, as again, I'm not Catholic.

       I'm not remotely religious either. What is of interest is that the Malachy prophecy exists (even it is a Vatican hoax) and some people believe it.

      <p>
       And consider this. What better way for the Vatican to impress the credulous than manufacture a "prophecy" and then make it come true?

       The source I quoted was actually from the Italian article you found. I've checked and you are correct that the words are not verbatim, and I am going to amend my header accordingly.
       <strong>
        However the sense is exactly the same.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the exact phrase as reported by the Italian paper
       <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/speciali/esteri/conclave-papa-elezioni2013/2013/03/13/news/fumata_bianca_eletto_il_nuovo_papa-54494392/">
        la Repubblica
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Voi sapete che il dovere del Conclave era di dare un Vescovo a Roma. Sembra che i miei fratelli Cardinali sono andati a prenderlo quasi alla fine del mondo, ma siamo qui."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the translation offered by Google:
      </p>
      <p>
       "You know that the duty of the Conclave was to give a bishop in Rome. Seems that my brothers are Cardinals picked him up near the end of the world, but we're here."
