        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I want to call attention to a conspiracy that seldom gets examined, the hat conspiracy. There was a time, not very long ago, when every man wore a hat in public. And I mean every man. Just take a look at <a href="http://www.shorpy.com/node/12251?size=_original#caption">this photo from 1912</a> and you&#39;ll see what I mean. No bare heads in this crowd. Dodge cars were designed so that men could sit in them without removing their hats.</p>

<p>Suddenly, almost overnight, that changed. Suddenly, almost nobody wears a hat. Even in winter, even in the rain, men don&#39;t wear hats.</p>

<p>The social rule went from being an absolute obligation to wear a hat if you were an adult male, to &quot;you can wear a hat if you want but you&#39;ll look like a doofus.&quot; Why? There has to be a reason for this.</p>

<p>I do not buy the often repeated assertion that John F. Kennedy caused men to stop wearing hats by not wearing a hat to his swearing in as president. For one thing, it&#39;s not true (he did wear a hat part of the time); for another, a single man could not cause such a sea-change in fashion.</p>

<p>This mystery is starting to bug me, because I can&#39;t find an answer for it. This isn&#39;t a seasonal change in the width of lapels, this is a massive change. Hats ... no hats. I suspect it may have something to do with improved central heating and the decreased incidence of minor illnesses. Maybe people weren&#39;t as cold as they used to be. Cars had better head. So did buildings. People were outdoors for shorter periods of time. Then again, maybe it was aliens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been a pronounced trend toward erasing gender differences in clothing and toward diminishing all the appurtenances of formality or class hierarchy. The hat was one of the first of the male accessories to disappear. </p>

<p>Look at women&#39;s fashions too. Even in the 1960&#39;s and 1950&#39;s it was almost unheard of for women to wear pants, and certainly not blue jeans. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNmnzwGT4Ic&amp;amp;feature=youtube_gdata">Just look at the kind of dresses women wore as casual clothing in the 1950&#39;s and 60&#39;s in this video</a>, they were designed to emphasize a woman&#39;s figure and to draw sharp distinctions in gender between men and women. All women were dressed in dresses and skirts back then. The thought of dressing in blue jeans and a t-shirt was almost unimaginable for most women until the media started to promote that look in the late 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s.  </p>

<p>Men almost always wore buttoned down shirts with a proper collar. No t-shirts, sweatshirts, and no polo type shirts unless they were actually playing golf or tennis. Suits were also commonplace for professional men; today they are only worn by certain salesmen. Even the blazer and sport jacket are now rarely worn and if they are it is most likely by an older man.</p>

<p>I think this is really part of an agenda to erase gender and class distinctions. Men are encouraged to be more feminine and women are tolerated even if they appear to be butch. Wearing a suit suggests that one is trying a bit too hard to create an impression, as if you are on a job interview or are out to sell something. When women find their way in a workplace they don&#39;t look that different from men. Even professionals like physicians, engineers, and the like often wear relatively casual clothing where suits and sport jackets were once de riguer.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s simply post-modernism.  What changed?  The moon landing (hoax or not) catapulted people into post-modern society.  No longer did people need to dress up for technology (movie theaters and air ports).  People are more casual, and poorer.</p>

<p>Also, at some point, I&#39;d guess accessories went out of style.</p>

<p>Interesting question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well think about the guys that DO wear hats now.  The baseball hat douchebag types.  They all have that little metal button on the top, what is that for and why do the guys that wear hats like this all the time tend to be part of the mindless borg?  The sports idiots that think professional sports is all their is to life.  It seems to be the majority of hat wearers anymore.  Is that little metal button some kind of a receiver that transmits energy into your skull?  Or something similar?  Does it amplify wavelengths? Like I&#39;ve noted the people wearing these hats always seem to be at the bottom end of the awareness/awakeness spectrum.</p>

One old southern general died and a northern general who fought against him went to his funeral and it was a cold wet day.

<p>I really can&#39;t explain it to you why males and females are completely different and perpetuating this scam of pretended equality will bring more problems than solutions.</p>

<p>I really can&#39;t, honest, I tried with many people, but it is like trying to explain to a Marxist why it can&#39;t work in practice or trying to explain to a cannibal why eating human flesh is not appropriate.</p>

<p>Just look at the facts and search for more clues.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Germany you have to seat down to pee as a man.</li>
<li>In Sweden you are a considered a rapist if you don&#39;t use a condom.</li>
</ul>

<p>to add to what I said before:</p>

<ul>
<li>In France Dominique Strauss-Kahn was robbed of the presidency because a very ugly African maid in the US falsely accused him of rape.</li>
<li>In Italy Silvio Berlusconi has probably committed every crime possible under the Sun: corruption,  buying Senators, blackmail, tax evasion, bribery, money laundering, collusion with the Sicilian mafia, he dodged all those trials ALL of them, yet they have processed him now and will almost certainly convict him FOR THE FIRST TIME in his life because he had sex with a 17 year old Moroccan girl named Ruby.</li>
</ul>

<p>The West is an insane Feminist Society just like Saudi Arabia is an insane Patriarchal Society.</p>

<p>we are stupid but we are not Anglos, yet.</p>

<p>The Judges, THREE women, are convicting Berlusconi for sleeping with a 17 year old because they are advancing the Feminist worldview that Anglo-Saxons and Scandinavians are imposing on us, in particular the girl was found out to be a prostitute so they are convicting him for paying a minor for sex, that&#39;s the legal technicality they are using.</p>

<p>With all the crimes that Berlusconi has done convicting him for sleeping with a 17 year old is like convicting Hitler because he ate meat on a Friday as a Catholic.</p>
