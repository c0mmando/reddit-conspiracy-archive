    <div class="md"><p>Hmm looking at your charts.</p>

<p>1: No real difference. Data set too small (a difference of 5 people isn&#39;t enough to see that this is anything strange)</p>

<p>2: This is simple. During elections politicians travel more. If you travel more (By plane for instance) you&#39;re more likely to have a crash.</p>

<p>3: My guess is this is when the most common travel dates are. It isn&#39;t like if you&#39;re trying to kill a politician you have to wait until a certain month.</p>

<p>The rest of them, although look good, mean very little. The low amount of plane and car crashes means that even 1 death creates a huge swing. Too much variance for this to have any confidence variable of any worth. </p>

<p>However you can&#39;t compare one person&#39;s death who dies in a flight to a whole team. That&#39;s not how do you statistics. There&#39;s more chance of a person alone to die (whether its commercial or not) compared to a team. The equivalent of what you were asking is a whole political cabinet dieing, which the only one I can think of that&#39;s even close to that slightly is the one that happened in Poland.(which is suspect)</p>

<p>The chance of an entire team dying in a plane crash is fucking near impossible, mostly because A: Most teams don&#39;t fly together. B: The chance that every single team member is on the plane together when something goes wrong is near the &#39;Never going to happen ever&#39; kind of probability.</p>
