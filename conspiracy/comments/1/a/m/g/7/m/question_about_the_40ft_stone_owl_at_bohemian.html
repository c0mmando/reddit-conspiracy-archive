        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As most people know, at Bohemian Grove there is a 40ft Stone Owl that is used during the &quot;cremation of care&quot; ceremony. An effigy is burned and so on and so forth. Anyway, I believe Alex Jones was the first (could be wrong) to mention that the god &#39;Moloch&#39; (a bull) is sometimes depicted as an owl. Then it seemed that everybody started repeating it and somewhere upon the bullshit is became known as &quot;fact&quot;. However, I&#39;ve yet to find a source that says anything about Moloch (a bull) being depicted as an owl. Which leads me to my question. Can anybody find a (REPUTABLE) source that says that Moloch is sometimes depicted as an owl? </p>

<p>Here is a picture of the owl <a href="http://fedupwithbs.com/bgrovefire.jpg">http://fedupwithbs.com/bgrovefire.jpg</a></p>

<p>Perhaps we can put this misconception to rest, or perhaps I&#39;m wrong. </p>

<p>Thanks guys.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bohemians call this the <em>Cremation of Care</em> ceremony, and the name of the antagonist in the coffin is <em>Dull Care</em>. It turns out the term dull care comes from a 1919 Oliver Hardy short film of that title, in which the police force is more interested in being lazy than in chasing bad guys. They leave the &quot;dull cares&quot; of their day behind them, and enjoy their freedom. The Bohos thus kick off their encampment by metaphorically throwing their &quot;cares of the day&quot; onto the sacrificial pyre. The theatrics of the robes and the ceremony are certainly consistent with the dramatic theme of the camp. The giant owl merely represents knowledge, and it&#39;s been the club&#39;s symbol since its inception.</p>

<p>Moloch, also spelled Molech, is the Hebrew word for king and was mentioned in the Bible as a Canaanite demigod who required child sacrifices. <strong>I couldn&#39;t find any classical references in which Moloch is depicted as an owl, rather he has a human body with the head of a bull. As far as I can tell, any connection between the demigod Moloch and the Bohemians is simply made up by people who are so desperately trying to find something to dislike about them</strong></p>

<p>People have known about Bohemian Grove for far longer than that. People were yapping about it in the 1960s. It was the subject of lawsuits in the 1970s. Nixon spoke about it in the 1970s, too. It was in publications like Spy magazine in the 1980s. By the time Alex Jones got around to it, he was just riding the coattails of existing conspiracy theory culture.</p>

If a person was a freemason, a skull &amp; bones member and a bohemian club member, and they attended meetings regularly, they would be witnessing multiple mock human sacrifice rituals every year. Is that odd to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christians engage in mock cannibalism every Sunday, smear their heads with ash once a year, recreate ritual torture in plays, movies, and so on.</p>

<p>So yes, I think old, goofy rituals are odd in that they&#39;re goofy, overblown and kind of silly.</p>

<p>And no, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re <em>unusual</em> because they&#39;re not. Symbolic rituals have been part of human culture for as long as there has <em>been</em> human culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re also only focusing on one context of the ritual(s). Many of the &quot;human sacrifice&quot; rituals you&#39;re referring to have more to do with being &quot;reborn&quot; rather than the focus being on the sacrifice/death aspect. In the BG/Cremation of Care ritual, they&#39;re focusing more on the aspect of &quot;letting your cares slip away&quot; and leaving all that stress stuff at home and having a good time in a sense. I&#39;m not saying/agreeing on how they&#39;re going about doing it but centralizing your focus on one aspect and none of the others; you&#39;re bound to come to far-reaching and often sinister conclusions.</p>
