       As most people know, at Bohemian Grove there is a 40ft Stone Owl that is used during the "cremation of care" ceremony. An effigy is burned and so on and so forth. Anyway, I believe Alex Jones was the first (could be wrong) to mention that the god 'Moloch' (a bull) is sometimes depicted as an owl. Then it seemed that everybody started repeating it and somewhere upon the bullshit is became known as "fact". However, I've yet to find a source that says anything about Moloch (a bull) being depicted as an owl. Which leads me to my question. Can anybody find a (REPUTABLE) source that says that Moloch is sometimes depicted as an owl?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a picture of the owl

       Perhaps we can put this misconception to rest, or perhaps I'm wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks guys.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Bohemians call this the
        <em>
         Cremation of Care
        </em>
        ceremony, and the name of the antagonist in the coffin is
        <em>
         Dull Care
        </em>
        . It turns out the term dull care comes from a 1919 Oliver Hardy short film of that title, in which the police force is more interested in being lazy than in chasing bad guys. They leave the "dull cares" of their day behind them, and enjoy their freedom. The Bohos thus kick off their encampment by metaphorically throwing their "cares of the day" onto the sacrificial pyre. The theatrics of the robes and the ceremony are certainly consistent with the dramatic theme of the camp. The giant owl merely represents knowledge, and it's been the club's symbol since its inception.
       </p>
       <p>
        Moloch, also spelled Molech, is the Hebrew word for king and was mentioned in the Bible as a Canaanite demigod who required child sacrifices.
        <strong>
         I couldn't find any classical references in which Moloch is depicted as an owl, rather he has a human body with the head of a bull. As far as I can tell, any connection between the demigod Moloch and the Bohemians is simply made up by people who are so desperately trying to find something to dislike about them

       Look at half of the posts (or more) in this sub. Either about him/prison planet or linking to a story which links or refers to one of them. Somebody that entrenched makes me apprehensive. Also, I tend to up-vote anything that promotes open discussion and/or gets people talking; such as your post.

       If you really stop to think about it, if it weren't for Alex Jones, nobody would know about the Bohemian Grove except those who have been attending since the 1800's. Don't you find it odd that they do this in secret and tried to keep it that way?

       People have known about Bohemian Grove for far longer than that. People were yapping about it in the 1960s. It was the subject of lawsuits in the 1970s. Nixon spoke about it in the 1970s, too. It was in publications like Spy magazine in the 1980s. By the time Alex Jones got around to it, he was just riding the coattails of existing conspiracy theory culture.

       It's not that they are on vacation deep in the woods, it's not that it's a boys club, it's not that the mainstream media is still silent about the whole thing, it's the mock human sacrifice that is really the crux of the issue. If a person was a freemason, a skull &amp; bones member and a bohemian club member, and they attended meetings regularly, they would be witnessing multiple mock human sacrifice rituals every year. Is that odd to you?

       Christians engage in mock cannibalism every Sunday, smear their heads with ash once a year, recreate ritual torture in plays, movies, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, I think old, goofy rituals are odd in that they're goofy, overblown and kind of silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I don't think they're
       <em>
        unusual
       </em>
       because they're not. Symbolic rituals have been part of human culture for as long as there has
       <em>
        been
       </em>
       human culture.

       You're also only focusing on one context of the ritual(s). Many of the "human sacrifice" rituals you're referring to have more to do with being "reborn" rather than the focus being on the sacrifice/death aspect. In the BG/Cremation of Care ritual, they're focusing more on the aspect of "letting your cares slip away" and leaving all that stress stuff at home and having a good time in a sense. I'm not saying/agreeing on how they're going about doing it but centralizing your focus on one aspect and none of the others; you're bound to come to far-reaching and often sinister conclusions.

       It looks like some awful comic book depiction of a satanic or pagan ritual or something. If that's how they get down, whatever. People have different tastes. Live and let mock human sacrifice, I say.

       Burning an effigy is technically mock human sacrifice, unless you view it AS an effigy, and not an actual person.

       Great info, but the second article explicitly states the ritual's pagan origins and the Christians are still be pretty strange, in my opinion. I understand your point that many people do this type of ritual. The amount of people that have done something doesn't change my opinion of it, though.

       Maybe, but if you're going to do something as important (especially how important he made it out to be) wouldn't you want to get all your facts straight and not hype it as much as he did? There have been plenty of others who have/attempted to sneak in. I just have a hard time believing A LOT of what this guy has to say, one of the reasons being how it's packaged and delivered to people. It doesn't feel like I'm being informed, more than it feels like I'm being "sold" something.

       I agree. The bombastic style in which Alex Jones presents his information is very suspect. I remember reading about another guy who was caught sneaking in dressed like a ninja of all things.

       I don't/haven't really followed much on the Grove (even though I live not too far away and should). For me I just think it would be like sneaking onto Groom Lake; you're not going to see or hear anything mind-blowing. All that type of stuff is done behind closed (and often guarded and locked) doors. Anything that would blow your hair back would most likely have to come in the form of A/V from a trusted insider.

       King Nimrod of Babylon was associated with a bull, as well as some Euro secret societies used in their symbolism. The Owl is the Demoness Lilith. Most of the Illimunati agenda is deep rooted to biblical times and satanic practices continue to grow in an attempt to hold on before the age of Aquarius starts.

       See I'm just not falling for the whole satanic thing. That word is completely overused. Just because you don't understand it, it doesn't mean its satanic. Christians view WAYY to many things as "evil" and "satanic". Most of those things are pagan in root anyways. I'm not a "new-ager" either but surely we are moving into a new age. And that doesn't mean the anti-christ is coming either. I believe that the bible is meant to be taken figuratively and definitely not literally. 
btw I'm sorry if this post seems harsh. I'm just looking to make discussion :D

       It's understandable and I don't take it as harsh, it's not as much a Christian vs satanism thing. Even parts of the KJV bible are missing words and books even. Anyone in conspiracy theory understands much of the world an history has been altered. An it should be us truth seekers working together to connect the dots.
