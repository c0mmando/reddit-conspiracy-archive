    <div class="md"><p>Nono, just small arms. Really.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of the escalation of force, it&#39;s a good idea to allow a citizenry the <em>same access</em> to the weapons that law enforcement and infantrymen <em>carry.</em> That means assault rifles and handguns, not mounted machine guns, tanks, or nukes. That also means that there&#39;s a certain standard for acquiring these weapons.</p>

<p>This prevents an oppressive government from escalating small conflicts to the point of all-out war. They will always have <em>more</em> small arms, and <em>more</em> people who meet that certain standard of acquisition, sure, but it&#39;s a far cry from bringing a gun to a knife-fight; or worse yet, bringing a gun to a fist-fight. </p>

<p>Also, your quip is what we call a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope">&quot;slippery slope&quot;</a> type of logical fallacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse me for having something relevant to say instead of continuing the pointless circlejerk. I thought I could start up a discussion about something I enjoy that has something to do with the degradation of society. Instead, I&#39;m downvoted by people basically counting. With words.</p>

<p>What a joke.</p>

<p>I am so tired of this bullshit. I take the time to write things I care about and, basically, I&#39;m not brain dead enough in some subreddits. It is painful to guess where/why I&#39;ll be downvoted next time.</p>

<p>Yes, I know I&#39;m over angry and that warrants me being trolled now. <em>sigh</em> Have at it. I&#39;ll even give you more fuel. What I really wanted to say in response to this was: &quot;Open your fucking brain holes, you stupid cunts. Go make a new chain and let the grownups talk next time, alright?&quot; </p>

<p>I have a family member who is part of the DoD and Im not the only one in a similar position. They have 3 million employees and I am sure It would be too easy to report you to one&#39;s own friends and family.</p>

<p>Is violence necessary? Ive already had deep discussions with this relative of mine. If you don&#39;t think so, look at Malcom X alongside MLKjr and the Sikh and Muslim movements alongside Ghandi. History remembers the &quot;positive force&quot; of such movements. But without the leaders willing to do the ditry deeds, success would have never happened.</p>

I was like that once when I was young and thought I had plenty of <em>time</em> to correct things. But in the reality of life, it is all about what family you are born into and what elite contacts you gain relationship. It is a community of the opportunity vs the community of the hazards.</p>

<p>The internet is defiantly a tool but to what ends? And what is peace? Is it a life of servitude for the wicked?</p>

<p>I stand now ready to die. I am tired of being a slave towards legal exploitation. I stand now for a future. I work and breed for the elite amongst us. Fuck them, and fuck anyone, including you, I am too tired and want to die.</p>

<p>Is it time for us to fight? I do not know. I am not a leader, but I pray that there is one I can die for.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I think our enemies are the rich elite. It isn&#39;t so much as a conspiracy but their natural nature to manipulate things. I say this because I know Jews are often blamed for everything but it is invalid and our true enemies are people amongst ourselves. Jews aren&#39;t the only ones blamed but the elite know the method and way towards their abuse towards <em>control</em>.</p>

<p>We are tired of it and you know what? We are going to end you elite controller types all very soon, as brothers, together. This is the main prophetic reality of the 21st century.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why I suggest Bitcoins and Reddit.</p>

<p>Maybe not Reddit per se, but a similar platform. Everyone gets one voice and the same voting power, tie each account to a social security number, flat democracy. We don&#39;t need representatives anymore.</p>

<p>Bitcoins are decentralized, so no entity can exercise control over the system. No bankers necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats what they said with the invention of the printing press. Time and Time again and still there was voilence. Why? Because its in our very nature, all we have done is made a means to gather more suport. Even if you have numbers, they have money. To unite an entire country even the world to rebel is almost impossible. Those with the means of production and control will hold on even if they where to lose. They could buy an army, they can by loyilty even force it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In theory your right. But in reality things dont work out. &quot;Idea&#39;s do not put food on the table&quot;. Even during the french revolution their where those who took the other side. Even after overthrowing the king and replacing it with tyrant.</p>

<p>Even the american revolution some americans sided with the british.</p>

<p>People will side with who ever they want, who benfits them the most. Most of these ideas are for the collective of society. People are selfish we all our selfish or things wouldnt be the way they are today. Take for example the cost of gas. You dont need to be &quot;awkened&quot; to realise your being riped off. So everyone wants and loves the idea to just not drive and stick it to them and bring them down. But we dont, thats because, it hurts the indvidul. See people really only care aboult themselfs.</p>

<p>And who to say that by overthrowing said system that the new one will be better. I hear alot aboult no goverment, self rule, free market. And i feel everyone is forgeting this isnt some fantasy world that we can have that. Some one will gather enough people and form their own goverments. Corrperations will grow and gather and become their own controlling bodies waging wars for resources and man power. What really will change? What really can change.</p>

<p>The proplems of today happened 100 years ago. The same basic proplems have happened through out history. Goverments have come and gone, corrperations have rose and fell. People claim its goverment thats evil and corrupt, goverments are made by people, people are the proplem. To say we arnt is to lie. So technollogy wont fix the proplem.</p>

<p>Look back through history, has anyone ever been free? Are we more free then a roman citizian? Are we more civial, most people would say yes but really nothing has changed at all. We are no more free then any roman, they may have had slaves but so do we. I cant say we are more cival then them however, all we have improved on is our ability to kill each other and we are pretty dam good at it.</p>

<p>TL;DR: In the long run change really dosnt change anything, just continues a cycle of tempory fixes and a cycle of war and revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But today, I think a lot of people would rather side with the revolution than status quo. But the masses NEVER start anything. It&#39;s always a minority that drives social changes. But fuck the masses, who needs them? The struggle for freedom MUST continue even if it is, as you claim, impossible. Even though I don&#39;t think this is unrealistic or impossible.  There have been thousands upon thousands of societies throughout history which have been able to be a part of Nature.</p>

<p>If the planet is still here in 150years, how will those generations look upon us? </p>

<p>Will we be the generation that freed the people or just stood idle by and watched as the planet is going to shits?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My proplem is that alot of people have this idea that massive change is possible. That we can have a govermentless society, some magical free market that wont be explotied. Its based on this q,assumption that everyone is as decent of a person how holds said idea.</p>

<p>Ideas like this hurt real smaller change from happening. People sit around arguing aboult how their therotical idealist system of econemy and world would work. People can dream and they can have ideas but they need their feet planeted on the ground. People seem to leave out humman nature when talking of these things.</p>

<p>Change is possible, small change with in the system by an indvidial. Dont like big oil, find away to improve gas milage. Its possible some one apparently did and sold the patent. But still find away patent it your self.. if you cant share it with the internet.. you cant patent comon knowledge. Dont like paying electric bills invent creat your own way of staying warm and powering your shit. </p>

<p>Sure, the person who does come up with a new power source or next thing will in time become like the rest. You replace said power be it big oil or anything.. it will only be replaced.</p>

<p>Look at. How internet piracey has effected gaming because of it, we now have steam.</p>

<p>This is one of the biggest myths today. NO, you cannot change your consumer habits and change the world. Only through direct action.</p>

<p>No, a group of individuals have a lot more power than a single person.</p>

<p>A nice quote comes to mind when thinking about social change:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you give me a fish, you fed me for a day. If you teach me to fish you have fed me until the river is contaminated and the shoreline is seized for development. But if you teach me to organize then whatever the challenge I can join together with my peers and fashion our own solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What change in our history do you speak of? Being serious Im not trolling.</p>

<p>I have the feeling we are talking aboult different types of change. I look at changes in resent history and see that nothing in the long run has really ever changed at all. The appernce may have changed, systems may have changed forms but we really havnt moved from the same spot.</p>

<p>Here is my point and example (sorry for spelling im at work on phone no spell check.)</p>

<p>Today we are slaves to our debt, bond by work, change is impossible for most because of the debt. One cant improve ones skills and move up with constantly having to pay off debt and expenses to live.</p>

<p>Fuedilism. They where free, they just couldnt leave. Slaves to their lords, bond to the land. To leave ment death.</p>

<p>Collaspe of rome (dark ages) slaves to fear, bond by relgion. </p>

<p>Colinialism- colonies of free men who&#39;s countrys where slaves, exploited native people.</p>

<p>Now lets look at today againc sure some of this stuff isnt done the same way. But its all the same the means of doing so has just changed in appernces. We have puppet states that give us deals so we can have cheaper materials. Slavery still exsistes in its basic forms through out the world. People still ruled by fear. </p>

<p>A group of idvidials i can not see being productive, an indvidial with sheep is much better.</p>

<p>I think you misunderstood my point aboult consumming. By changing the market I ment not changing what you buy. But making the object you purchase obsolelite. </p>

<p>Again I want to use P2P networks. They have changed how certain industries work. At first they fought the pirates, we got thinks like drm, copy protection. Everytime they through one out, it got beat it got cracked. Their drm lost them money. In the end we got things like steam. Even music changed, now you can buy indvidial songs online then whole cds. No one even buys cds anymore.</p>

<p>I still feel an idvidial is much more powerful then the group. Wars have been started by the shoot of a single gun. One mans ambition and lies has moved entire nations. One mans dulusions has spawned countless relgions.</p>

<p>A group of people are simple to stop and idvidial however is much toughter.</p>

<p>Also people involved in many of the big time housing manipulation projects didn&#39;t do anything illegal because of how so many things relating to the stock market and banking industry were deregulated and giving the freedom to manage themselves.  So what, there should be more regulations, laws and criminal monitoring on these corporations?</p>

Some people call him an internet activist, others a drug addicted narcissist who used to troll mentally ill people for fun. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ahkgc/i_am_weev_i_may_be_going_to_prison_under_the/">He did an AMA the day before he was sentenced</a> and it basically turned into a lot of people telling him he&#39;s an asshole and then calling him out for all the terrible shit he and the GNAA and Bantown and ED had done &quot;for the Lulz&quot; (google terms in this comment for more data) and that he was less an activist and more a troll.</p>

<p>Edit: Personally, no way should he be in jail for that length of time considering his &quot;crime&quot; was minor and really had no victims in the traditional sense.  The other stuff makes him a cunt, not a criminal.</p>
