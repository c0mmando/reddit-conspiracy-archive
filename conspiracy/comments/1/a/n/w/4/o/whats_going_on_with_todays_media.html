       So today I get to work and I go to my states newspaper and the first article is about how Adam Lanza, the shooter and Sandy Hooke, used an "AR-15 semiautomatic rifle to kill 26 children and women on December 14th 2012." (Courant.com)
But I read the article the Hartford Courant published the same day and further updated through our the week.
In this article,
       <a href="http://articles.courant.com/2012-12-14/news/hc-police-responding-to-incident-in-newtown-20121214_1_lanza-home-newtown-home-labor-day-parade">
        http://articles.courant.com/2012-12-14/news/hc-police-responding-to-incident-in-newtown-20121214_1_lanza-home-newtown-home-labor-day-parade
       </a>
       , in the 21st paragraph, it states that a .223 caliber rifle was found in his CAR, no where near his person, and that he used a Glock and Sig Sauer pistol to shoot everybody.
This is probably the wrong subreddit for this, and it's probably already been explored but what's going on with the media today? The same newspaper is contradicting itself by publishing something that says he used a rifle and not two pistols... Can somebody shed some light on what's going on?

       Do some research. You'll find that the .223 or (AR-15) was found in the trunk of the car Adam Lanza allegedly used. But why is there no trace of Adam Lanza before 2009? They interviewed his neighbors and people he went to elementary with. No one knew him. This was a false flag attack to get Americans talking about gun control. And now we are using WMD in Syria to prolong the war in the middle east. Wake up people we are moving into a police state.

       There is a trace of Adam Lanza before 2009. Someone here on reddit when to high school, and posted his yearbook photo. Of course, the poster was harassed and called a "shill", which I'm sure you'll call me at some point. Not that any facts will matter to you

       The yearbook you are talking about in question did have Adam Lanza's name in it. However had no picture at all. It said "not photogenic" The facts do matter to me. I don't want to believe that our government would do something like this but with the individual research i've done not to mention hundreds of people on reddit the facts that the news gives just doesnt add up. Also why would Finestein already have the bill banning assault rifles ready the day after the shooting? The gun control debate is just to get Americans riled up and not realize that we are slowly entering another war. Just like the war on drugs during the Vietnam war. Look up operation Northwoods. It was a false flag attack signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to attack Guantanamo Bay so that we would be forced to go to war with Cuba. The only reason this didn't happen is because JFK vetoed it. Our Government isn't looking out for the interests of we the people they are money hungry globalists looking for power.

       Scandal and shooting make for an occupied and fearful populace. It's nothing the media hasn't been engaged in before. The difference is that now it's easier to do because of a 24-hour cycle of information and many more ways to get it out.

       They're not dumb based on the information I already have, and the lack of an article in the paper explaining the fact that the .223 was found on his person. The lack of an article or a previous mention before this didn't prompt me to look it up.

       Not the same day. Today they published the article saying he used an AR and the day it happened they published saying it was a .223 in the car and he used the Glock and Sig.

       Weird. It's almost as if things being reported will change as new information is learned, and that the things we think we know one day will be shown to be incorrect as we learn more.
