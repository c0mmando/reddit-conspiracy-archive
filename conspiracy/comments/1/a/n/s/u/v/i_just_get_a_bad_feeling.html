       I've been into conspiracy theories for the past few years, but I don't think they were ever as real as they are right now.  It just seems like everyday since Sandy Hook, things in America/the world are just getting insane. Between bankers robbing people and North Korea threatening anyone who breathes, I just don't see how this can go on much longer. Does anyone else get the feeling that shit is going down really soon? Like all of these recent issues are leading up to something unprecedented? Not in a typical "stoned conspiracy theorist" kind of way, but in a "look at the facts and even MSM to see that conspiracy is now reality" kind of way.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're going to be a bitch, just don't bother commenting. I want a good discussion with ideas and opinions that can benefit all of us in this community.  We need it now more than ever.  Thanks a bunch for reading!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I never expected such a genuine reply from you guys. Some of these comments have really spoke to me. You guys make me feel like I'm not alone in fighting the good fight, and I appreciate it more than you realize. Thank you. In the end (not to get all lame a mushy) things will unfold as they're meant to. We, as informed/critically thinking citizens, will have a very slight leg up when the metaphorical "shit hits the fan". All we can do is keep up, stay informed, and be ready at a moment's notice to, as Optimus Prime says, "Roll out." Keep it up guys. Please.

       The problem with conspiracy theories these days, is that they more and more end up being, as Michael Ruppert puts it, 'conspiracy fact'. What i like about this sub is that it's not 100% 'conspiracy theory' - a lot of it is just alternative news on world events. There is no 'theory' involved in that. It's a bunch of people taking information and piecing it together. Conspiracy 'theory' is when you talk about satanism and skull &amp; bones and ancient aliens etc, etc. Could it be true? Sure. But it's just a theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current social and economic state of the world isn't a theory. The unjust laws being passed all over the world, aren't theories. The wars are not theories. Energy prices and food shortages and riots and bankers stealing from the people - none of this is theory. It's observable fact. You don't need to be into 'conspiracy theory' to know that things are bad, and getting worse. You need to be able to fucking read. That's it. If you posses that skill, use it, and still think everything is fine and dandy, then you are in denial.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, it's not a case of 'if' something goes seriously wrong now; it's when. And i literally have no idea. All of us here will know when we see it, but what it is, and when it happens? Would take a better man than me to make that call.

       Agree with most of what you say, except that there is no hard and fast line between fact and theory.  I prefer to think in terms of degrees of certainty.  We operate all the time on estimates of how likely something is to be true, based on credible evidence as best we can assess it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How sure am I that 9/11 was not done by 19 twenty-somethings with boxcutters?  100%.  Overwhelming evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       How sure am I that the real Paul McCartney was replaced in 1966?  85%. Less certainty, partly because it happened almost 50 years ago and there isn't as much of a record, partly that I have spent less time researching it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so on.

       Just so I'm clear here, you're saying that you're nearly convinced that Paul McCartney was replaced back in the 1960s? As in, you are close to convinced that the "Paul is Dead" thing is reality?

      <p>
       Yes, that's right.  But not because of clues in the album art, which I've known about since the  "Paul is dead" story broke in 1969.  The clues are interesting and meaningful only
       <strong>
        after
       </strong>
       you have determined the truth through more reliable means.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at lots of pics of "Paul," you'll see that there was only one Paul until August 1966, then there were a few who apparently didn't work out, and for the past 45 years or so there has only been one.
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/PjHdp">
        Look at these pics of the original Paul side by side with some of his replacements.  These are not the same man!
       </a>
       Period.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny:  No one could miss hearing in the early 60s that Paul was every girl's dream man.  But the switch had already been made by the time I reached puberty and could have an opinion on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can remember seeing the replacement and thinking "What's all the shouting about?  He's nothing special."  Decades would pass before I figured it out: the original Paul
       <strong>
        was
       </strong>
       a total dreamboat (to use a 60s term).  But his replacement, while musically talented, lacks Paul's boyish good looks and mega-watt smile.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've been looking so long at pix of his replacement that most people have totally forgotten what Paul McCartney looked like in 1962, 63, 64, 65, and 66.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the time it takes for someone to learn to be a double, I don't think Paul died in a car accident, but was deliberately killed.  Perhaps because he was not willing to promote the drug agenda that was being used to derail the anti-war movement in the US.  After the switch, all the Beatles grew facial hair (to hide plastic surgery scars?) and, at the peak of their fame, they stopped touring.

       If you spend enough time reading the elaborate album art and decoding the clues the conclusion is inescapable. I'm 85% sure as well that he was replaced.

       By this do you mean interpret the clues, because they are ambiguous? If this is the case then how are you certain that your interpretation is correct? It's like biblical code, or Nostradamus quatrains and so on. You can read anything you like into ambiguous information.

       No. It's about every album cover after his death beating down Paul and hinting that he's dead. George Harrison also confessed to it on his death bed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Beatles were incredibly valuable for tax money and national morale. Governments have done worse things for less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go look at all of their album covers and listen to some of their music in detail and it's clear they have "something" to say about Paul.

       Shitty ideas like this discredit most reasonable conspiracies because they can all be lumped together. Paul McCartney was not replaced just because his music changed. Jackoff.

       Good point. The problem with 9/11, is that it is fairly obvious to most people that it didn't go down the way they want us to think, but we'll never be able to fill in
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of the gaps - and that's what everyone who wants to 'debunk' stuff focus on. There is zero doubt in my mind it was planned and executed by some arm of the US and probably Israeli governments, but there's only so much evidence you can present, and if you don't have 100% then you're apparently making wild connections and are a complete nutcase.

       How is satanism a conspiracy when there's video-graphic evidence of Lady Gagas music video director wearing a t-shirt with the church of Satan logo on it?
      </p>
      <p>
       How is satanism and occultism linked to masonry a conspiracy when ALL of these music videos feature extremely morbid themes all containing black and white checkerboard floors and such, goat heads all up in them, and all these artist are always showing just one eye, flashing pyramids, making 666 with their fingers, and etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you even read masonry rhetoric? Do you have any of their books? I do, and on the cover of the book I have there is an emblem in each corner. Each one contains 13 stars, and one of them is the all seeing eye looking down over the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The illuminati means the illuminated and lucifer means light bearer, things they know full well, and when you read their doctrine you come to find out that they actively worship lucifer, they're lucifarians.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - There are literal churches of satanism, I don't think satanism in the music industry and freemasons/illuminati is conspiracy whatsoever, I fully believe it's entirely true. Don't believe me? Find out what Michael Jackson had to say about Tommy Matola the former head of sony, I'm quite positive he's on film calling him "a devil" verbatim. Ask Tia Tequila about the illuminati in the music biz. How about Nicki Minaj on video literally channeling a different person that "lives inside her" called "roman" and growling when she is in that state claiming that roman just wants to destroy everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       There comes a point where all this stuff crosses the line entirely from "maybe it's plausible" to "holy fuck the music industry is controlled by satanists".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not conspiracy, it's fact.

       I think its funny that you project (and maybe even possess) such knowledge on this occult stuff, and still confuse Lucifer for Satan. If you really believe that, most everything you know about the occult is wrong.

       Yeah, sorry, that post really wasn't too helpful. Here is the condensed version: God exists. We call him Abraxas, but that is just a name given to him; it helps distinguish him (the true first God) from the God of today (who we will get to in a minute). Maybe he came into existence, maybe he has always existed, or something in between that we can't comprehend. Regardless, he lived in his world of holy light. He felt compelled to externalize himself, to make consciousness that exists outside himself--Pythagorean and Gnostic philosophies are great at explaining WHY the external consciousness was necessary, but I don't know if I could even explain it coherently, let alone in a short post.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, God/Abraxas begins to create. He creates his first offspring, Lucifer, in his own image. The Angel of Light, The Morning Star, Lux Mundi, Prometheus, etc. He does this so that the two can essentially debate and converse...because consciousness is multifaceted, and no matter how great or divine it still requires other parts of the whole. Lucifer wanted a brother, so Abraxas again "cloned" himself and created Paracletes. A bunch of stuff allegedly happened (how we know this, I have no fucking clue) resulting in Lucifer and Paracletes creating their own "sons" to inhabit the kingdom God had created. Each "son", or angel, bore the resemblance of the "brother" who had created them. The two factions eventually started to feud, and Paracletes + his angels attacked Abraxas, Lucifer, and their angels. Paracletes lost, and was banished from the Divine Kingdom...and banned from ever speaking the Divine Language (long story) ever again. In a last act of defiance, Paracletes essentially says "Let there be light!" and creates our Universe, a much darker universe, to which he was banished. He renames himself Satanel, and establishes himself as the God of our universe. This is why Gnostics say that the God of Christianity and associated religions is in fact the Devil. This also explains why the God portrayed throughout much of the original books of the Bible seems like anything
       <strong>
        but
       </strong>
       a kind and loving God.
      </p>
      <p>
       A sidenote, the historians/philosophers that study this believe that the battle never really ended. The legend of Prometheus is an example of Lucifer crossing to our universe to try to sway humanity towards Abraxas, the true God. You'll notice lots of parallels once you read more and more into it. Some people I've talked to take this New Age "awakening" movement as a sort of ripple effect from Lucifer's various attempts on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Now, take this all with a grain of salt, because I'm clearly not an angel, nor do I know any angels or demigods. But
       </strong>
       this is something I have been interested in for years. I have read lots of Gnostic texts (contemporary and translated ancient texts), lots of Pythagorean theory (which doesn't cover this too much but helps you understand it, and is incredibly fucking fascinating). I've even studied some Luciferian and Satanist stuff, but LOTS of that stuff is, for lack of a better word, mumbo jumbo. I'm sure there is some great Satanist literature and history out there, but it is probably squirrelled away in some rich families vault.....nearly any book us dirty peasants can get our hands on is sensationalized shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there you go. Its a little long, but its as short as I could make it. If you want any books/websites to check out I can post some.

       I am unable to corroborate your interpretation of Gnostic theology (which is not to say that you are wrong.) I have read the Nag Hammadi codex and several other gnostic texts and your description does not match my own understanding of gnostic theology. This article has a handy dandy chart:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.pfrs.org/gnosticism/Gnosticism02.pdf">
        http://www.pfrs.org/gnosticism/Gnosticism02.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you please link to any gnostic source material that details this mythos? Alternately, the Nag Hammadi is searchable at the link below:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/nhsearch.html">
        http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/nhsearch.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course there is sacred-texts.com as well. Gnosticism is a fascinating subject and I am legitimately interested in increasing my understanding, but I also find that it is a regularly "embellished" belief structure as well.

       To say this story is Gnostic in origin is wrong, because like you said it does not very well match up with the Nag Hammadi et al. I was trying to draw parallels to relate to the point that it can be argued that our God is Satan, and to reaffirm that Lucifer is not Satan.

       I suppose I should also mention that, for me personally, it is easier to understand the whole idea as a metaphor rather than a history. The different sides of each human, represented by Lucifer+Satanel, the spark of life and ability to think represented by God, etc. It may help you make sense of the story. It very well
       <strong>
        could

       If a theory,religion or myth doesn't have a parallel or a hint in another myth/religion then someone out there is probably fucking with you.

      <p>
       In your example I find it interesting as it has parallels to what the "Power's that Be" actually believe, espeicialy their worship of Lucifer against the evil "God" which I also think is evil.

      <p>
       BUT even if they believe that, they are still crazy and fucked up and probably willing pawns to some evil higher entity.

       Satanism and Luciferism are still interrelated since its more about its opposition to the christian church or better said it is the other side of the same coin.

       It goes back to what I tell people all the time: "you don't have to believe in something for others to believe it."
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, there's evidence that the rich and powerful on this planet have a belief system divergent from the cultural and societal norms of everywhere else. And this belief system drives their decisions that determine every aspect of life on this planet.

       I like your take on this subject.  Just a few questions, though.  How widespread is this satanism-just executives and the stars?
What are they gaining by doing this?
Aren't they just being weird for attention-to be badass/cool?
Don't they realize satan loses at the end?
Does the devil actually give them anything, or is it lies?
Are they told what it costs them to join in the beginning?
Thank you.  I am curious.  I cannot see satan involved in creativity because I always assumed god inspired that, so wouldn't dwelling on evil sap their minds so they couldn't make music anymore?

       I think it's spread only to the top stars who are just puppets of whatever their agenda happens to be, whether it's convincing people that they're not good enough as humans, to just party and not care about anything else, to only desire acquiring money and sex, and etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are gaining extreme wealth and power, the ability to go where ever and do whatever with little to no impunity. Of course they're just puppets though and whenever the controllers want to get rid of them they "mysteriously die" from a drug overdose or drowning in the bath tub or some other spoon fed bullshit that people believe because "well they're celebrities they party hard it makes sense they died from drugs".
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not just doing it for attention, they're doing it to make everybody conform to the same loose ideals and morals so that they can further control their lives through the decisions they make based on how their media influences them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet they don't care that satan loses at the end even  if they believe it to be true because they're given immense wealth and power which completely blinds them from any and all truth and goodness, which is why most of these people are such obvious pieces of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       As has been stated, they pledge their allegiance to the devil and their reward is immense power and wealth on this planet, otherwise why in the fuck would they do that?
      </p>
      <p>
       They are told what it costs in the beginning, mostly that they have to make a ritual sacrifice. Just look at all the artists and the extremely bizarre circumstances under which they've lost people extremely close to them. There's also that article recently about a rapper who admitted to trying to murder his friend so he could join the illuminati and be successful in the music business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anybody can be creative, being creative isn't an inherently good or bad process, thus you can be creatively good or creatively evil. If the evil is flowing through you and you're creative as fuck, it's probably going to be expressed in some evil manner, just look at serial killers and the creative ways in which they murder, torture, and mutilate people.

       That's only if you go by the book and church they control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan is also an archetype against the church it is opposed and its traditions they represent, so it has the link to creativity in break the bounds of traditions and conformity.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be fair you would find it hard an archetype that doesn't have a link to creativity since creativity is the modus operandi of the universe, it's more about selecting the type of creativity.

       Pretty much. A few nutters spot something in a music video and scream about Satanism/the occult. A few directors try to be edgy and slip in similar stuff. More nutters cry foul.

       issues with the elite would be hilarious if it wasn't so sad. The people convinced that Jay-Z is sending out secret signals for the Illuminati or whateverm, they need help.

       Where do you stand? The condescending way you refer to nutters is a known tactic for shills. Seems like you are only here to talk down the insightful comments and try to degrade a swath of others in the process. The OP asked specifically for no bitch comments. So I ask, in the spirit of beneficial conversation, where do you stand on conspiracies in general?

       Well, I see what he's saying though, I believe very similarly.  I think that they are inciting fear into a group of semi-paranoid people, using old symbols we would discover listening deeply to their music means we aren't figuring out what they are up to.  "Real g's work in silence" -OG. "Believe none of what you hear and half of what you see" (idk who said this first).  So yes; they are using symbolism commonly associated with The Craft yet even among mystics those symbols mean and represent different things to the Masons and to the Jews and to the Ganger Disciples (obviously referring to the six pointed star).  I know for a fact, unfortunately I cannot reveal how(which probably means I boulder even say it) that Masonry is not related to the (IMO: fictitious) Illuminati.  I believe the Illuminati is just a distraction and does not exist beyond our creation.  Is there a higher elite group or "shadow government", absolutly.  Do they understand mysticism and use it to their advantage against the people? Definitely.  Is it satanism or lucifarianism? Is it Jay-Z? Most likely not.  I don't have evidence or proof that Jay-Z is not a member of this elite team; I doubt it though.  You have to remember that they control the media and they don't want us to understand, they send us on false trails and paths of deception.  They may use the same symbols but be projecting them in a way as to appear Satanic(or some variation) yet be using them for their own purposes behind the veil.  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

       Oh i know it exists, same as the skull and bones thing, but to what extent it has an effect on the global agenda and the elite who run it? I think you'd be pushing it to try and make a serious connection. I'm not saying it isn't there, though, just that it definitely falls within the realms of theory at the moment.

       Oh i know they exist dude. It was probably a bad example, but as i mentioned to someone else, the actual influence any of that has is debatable. Sure it's weird, but does it really matter? I wouldn't say so. If these fuckers want to join some club, that's up to them - it's not the club we object to, or the religion they belong to, it's their actions.

       Well if you had read or even skimmed the book you'd realize their actual influence is not debatable it is not tangential, and it really does fucking matter.

       The point i was making is that the fact they belong to the club, in itself, is irrelevant. They can join all the weird clubs they want if they're not corrupt and try to run things in a moral way. It wouldn't worry me in the slightest if they all slaughtered goats in the woods of a weekend, the issue comes when that bullshit encroaches on the rest of the things they do; but again, what the club/society/religion is that they belong to doesn't matter, because they're fucking corrupt scumbags anyway. It's not like AIPAC or The Washington Institute are any different, they just don't have scary names. It's a bunch of people collaborating because they have common aims/goals, and that happens whether you call it Skull and Bones or a board meeting.

       There comes a time when you have to ask yourself the question- "Do I want to be right about this?" because if you're wrong, that means all your theories are dead ends that will never amount to what you claim they will. I feel like a lot of conspiracy theorists (among others) just want to watch the world burn. Maybe because it's exciting and unprecedented, maybe to prove themselves right, maybe because they just hate the world that they're living in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been on both sides of this- wanting to be right and wanting to be wrong. Lately, I see positive change happening in our society. Every day. It's beautiful to me. The past election we saw more women in the Senate than ever before, our first Buddhist Senator (also female), two states legalizing marijuana and several others either decriminalizing it or allowing it for medicinal reasons, and the likes of OWS and conspiracy theorists got a big win with Elizabeth Warren being elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to answer your question, do I get a bad feeling about the future? It depends on what I'm paying attention to. If I'm saturating myself with information from places like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , I feel an overwhelming pessimism. If I shut that out and just see normal people being people, I'm extremely optimistic that whatever the future holds, the people will win. Government operates on death, power and oppression, and the majority of people just want love and freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously there's tons of problems that I'm not touching on,
       <em>
        shit is bad
       </em>
       , but for me to personally move forward, I have to see the beauty. I'm not naive to the suffering of people on this planet, but I just find it hard to see anything but shit when I visit 'conspiracy news' too often.

       I have never wanted to be right about any of what's going on currently.
      </p>
      <p>
       I speak out of an obligation to the truth, and a need to reject what I know in my heart is wrong. I don't want to look back at recent history and have to admit that these people we call our leaders spoke for me, or got over on me because I didn't care or didn't pay attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to be ready to hit the ground running when they turn of the lights on this planet and throw the whole of humanity in the trash. No one WANTS gulags, torture, or tyranny. But that doesn't mean ignoring it will make it go away.

       I agree. The fact that the two presidents of the last decade and a half (roughly) were on the surface polar opposites in party, race, views on corporate power and vision for the future and yet the same things are going on speaks for itself the fact that there is a master plan at work beyond the scope of the information revealed to the masses. Iraq becomes the drone war. Patriot act becomes NDAA. TARP becomes "sequestration". There is only one party: the party of money.

       I can't help but watch in amazement as the Obama admin goes further and further beyond the Bush admin, and yet... There's very little media coverage, there's very little recognition (on the same topics) from "progressives", and how many Americans just seem so completely apathetic to giving a fuck.

       It didn't become real to me until Rand Paul's filibuster and the DHS tank purchases.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reading and studying older 'conspiracy theorists' (Kennedy, Orwell, Huxley, etc) It seemed a lot of people thought 'the end was coming soon', so maybe we are just finally cognizant of it but it actually operates much slower than it seems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, regardless of our timeframe, whether it's 10 months, 10 years, or 10 decades, we need to wake people up if we are going to have any chance. Of course you can build a bomb shelter, stock up on guns and food, but 1. Its probably not going to ever come to that, 2. even if it did, it's one man vs the police and the army; you're fucked either way. Of course, a natural disaster or riots or anything could hit at anytime in which case it is always good to 'be prepared', but anyone who is waiting around to have to fight the government instead of actively trying to prevent violence is not helping the cause (not saying you fall into this category, just speaking generally).
      </p>
      <p>
       As the MSM leaks more and more info, it's easier and easier to wake people up (as most consider the MSM gospel and alternative news to be hogwash); I think we are in a very important transitional time (even if there have been many significant transitional times in our recent past, we are still in one now), and we finally have the possibly only tool for 'salvation': The internet. Our govt is working hard to be able to censor it, and if we  lose it I would say any hope of significant change is probably lost. Whether or not any major tides turn in the next decade, I have a feeling the battle will be won or lost in the decisions about how to go about the internet and CISPA-esque laws.

       Libya, Iran and N.K. are supposed to be the "axis of evil".  They are the nation state equivalent of the old veteran patriot who insist on living his life the old way.  They are mocked and agitated.

       Now why in the hell would we expect Iran and N.K. to voluntarily disarm themselves? Just look at how well it served Libya to cooperate with our demands.

       Meanwhile our "greatest ally" in the Arabian peninsula (Saudi Arabia) freely funds terrorist activity aimed at weakening our influence globally.

       Hell they have already set the stage with all the propaganda necessary to win global support for an uprising in Iran and N.K.  All we hear about is how oppressed the people are by their evil dictators. Just as soon as they abandon their nuclear weapons we can sweep in and "liberate" all those poor people just like we did for poor old Libya.

       I've felt like shit was going to down for a long time now. Maybe that's telling of us who are interested in conspiracy theory though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since 9/11 (I was 18) I have felt there was going to be a massive collapse of the world economy ultimately leading to some type of feudalist system or authoritarian control. I'm not saying I 100% believe that to be the future, but only that cascading events have lead me to feel that this period in history, the transition from democracy to authoritarian/totalitarian control is brief.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is very hard to look around at the happenings in the world and not fear that something wicked, this way comes. The DHS and all that has come with it, the benign resistance to complete financial fraud, the lack of resistance to an administration who is tearing apart rights (ie civil liberties) much faster than the last. The blind eye turned to things such as drones, spying, indefinite detention, and the abuse of executive powers. The obvious corporate takeover of congress and collusion with the state. The fact that grand criminals run the ship, while everyday people watch their rights stripped.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you feel that this world is evolving into something better when the nation whom leads it is devolving right before our eyes?

       You posted a thread like this 2 weeks ago. I told you what I told you and now I see some similar stuff going on. I love how mass consciousness works.

       But, that's not why i'm here. Sure, not all of you are theist, but you can't deny the power that religion holds in our world. The new pope's backgroune, name, lack of number, and type (jesuit) is all so very interesting. It's funny how his inauguration occurred yesterday, right before Obama left for Israel. Biden is also out of the country spending his time in the vatican state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that info, consider the Cyprus situation. Banks stealing money from citizens without so much as a warning. If investors start bank runs, then the EU is toast. The cyprus banks are set to open tomorrow, but I doubt they will open or if they do open, they won't serve the Euro.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soo, if the EU collapses, i'm sure our huge derivative bubble(10x the GDP of the world economy) will be popping any time after that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd be funny if this all went down as obama and biden were out of the country.

And today NASA says we can pray that an impact wont happen but thats our only defense against meteors. It's time to stand up. as cliche as that might sound these days, we need to get organised around an idea that will change this shit. I only wish the idea was more obvious.

       I feel you. The rolling boil has been in the blood of a lot of americans now for a while, and it spreads. Unfortunately too many people are losing their minds right now, over everything. All these financial "meltdowns" robbing the citizens and tax payers. I just can't believe that all these failing corporations insist on being propped up. The government continues to wage war on the rights of the people it is supposed to serve. I feel religion is only another enslavement tool. War on drugs, war on terror, it's beginning to get that too big to be real feel.  The only thing you can do, is take care of yourself, your mind and your body. Be ready for the storm.

       I believe the feeling of something is going to HTF is pervasive amongst those who are aware of what is going on in the world.  However, those who do not pay attention and occasionally watch MSM believes all is well with the world.    It is all a matter of perspective.  And I might add that the further I go down the rabbit hole to discover who is doing what I question the sanity of all involved including myself.  My husband. Will often ask me " ok, you know all of this what can you, we, do about it?" I. Have no answers.

       The population that the earth can support is going to decrease over the next couple of hundred years. We are at the beginning of this period. This is going to cause a lot of pain in various different ways in various different places. In the developing world, many famines. In the developed world, more financial cons.

       Take a deep breath and remember that their shit is exactly that, their shit, you cannot change it, so live your life. There was a movie a long time ago called the day after, I was sitting in school my senior year and I remember feeling like I was having a panic attack about it. My Dad gave me some good advice(something he really sucked at) , he said fuck it, go out and live your life because worrying about it is just wasted time. Change what you can but remember what is going on here, we are all just people that have gathered info together that fits in a puzzle. We figured it out. Now what we do is still go on and live our lives. Live everyday as if it is your last and plan as though you will live forever. Now exhale , now repeat that deep breathing thing, hold it for a bit, and relax and let it all go. You are gonna be ok and so am I.

       I like to think of society, as a whole, like a flywheel or a CD.  It speeds up constantly, little by little.  Things get more complex, information is distributed, our lives seem to speed up as we have more obligations, more access to work, more debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the flywheel analogy gets interesting when you toss in a pebble.  This metaphorical pebble is an event, one that can be tiny compared to society but that hits just the right place.  A chip or a crack develops, society becomes fractured, and because of the speed of things, it disintegrates violently.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would wager that the event happens outside of America.  The only way I can see something starting is a blanket ban on all firearms, I feel (hope) that people would say "fuck you" to the government.  And once a superpower falls into anarchy, other nations are affected as well.  Couple that with the unstable nature of the world today, and you have a scenario where the world as we know it could fall apart.

       Just find like minded people and you'll be okay. 
I live in the city I know there are others who think alike. You just have to find them. It's not the government or even the "terrorists" you'll need to defend yourself against. It's the ifiot neighbors who'll be standing around saying were in America. I'm an American. This can't be happening. 
Study your plants know what's edible. Learn to make makeshift weapons. Because the ending is you'll be a person who is on the go. You won't be able to carry everything you need with you. Knowing what's edible. Knowing how to find clean
Water. Knowing the difference between a plant that stops bleeding and one that can kill you. This is the knowledge that can save you. 
Learn to make things like soap. People will trade for soap or other necessities. Basket weaving. Other useable talents.
       <br/>
       Learn a tradeskill it could save your life or feed you later on.
