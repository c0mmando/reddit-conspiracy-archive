       Nuclear safety engineer here. I specialize in risk analysis of nuclear power plants as my daily work.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened in Fukushima was a combination of old power plants and inadequate defense against this type of external threat. Japanese had prepared for a tsunami of a certain size with a tsunami wall at the site. The size of the wall was based on looking at the earthquake and tsunami data in japan of past 100 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any data before the year 1900 was discarded as unreliable. Anyone in the nuclear risks 'business' knows that this is a huge mistake. Japan even has stone markers centuries old that mark the highest level of tsunami water rise. This kind of 'softer' information (ancient markers, contemporary accounts, old paintings of natural phenomena, even folk tales) is actually utilized in safety analyses of nuclear power plants.
      </p>
      <p>
       They made a huge mistake in assessing the external threats. Professionally I can't understand any other reason for this except somebody wanted to save money by building a smaller wall - and even that is shaky since the cost of any tsunami wall is minor considering it's a 20 billion USD facility with 6 reactors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other factor is that the old nuclear plants whole defensive concept could be penetrated by the tsunami. The redundant systems for providing energy for cooling systems could be taken out the same tsunami (external network + all emergency diesels).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, Fukushima disaster did not kill many people. Around twenty thousand people died in the tsunami. Two died at the power plant, but not due to radioactive releases. If I recall correctly no one has died due to radioactivity. It was a major nuclear disaster ... but outlines (for me at least) that nuclear is still safer than coal.

       Also, this is unabashed bullshit.  I appreciate your comments, but you must realize this is deadly spin.  The Japanese government and TepCo continue to downplay everything, US gov't media maintains its distance, and there are probably still shills on reddit (like Ice-X and his bananas quips).  But news reports out of the area are much more grim.

       Nope, not really. Radiation doses were well documented. The personnel at the site got the most dose and they have three kinds of radiation measurement. Nobody got such high doses that they'd die from radiation sickness, while some workers got high doses up to I think 5% of what would be a lethal dose. I think a few old people died due to the evacuation stress, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't followed american or japanese media on the subject that much. Mostly what I've gathered from presentations at these professional networks, Finnish radiation safety authority and such. With the amount of people from around the world who have worked on this, how well detailed the progress of the accident is .. it's quite unlikely that deaths caused by radiation could've been hidden. Sure, there's spin, the media wants headlines, Greenpeace wants it's share of publicity, Tepco wants to look good, Japanese government wants to turn the nukes back on .. but the truth is there too. I trust the people I know in my profession, but I also realize that it will only seem like an appeal to authority for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake, significant amounts of radioactivity
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       released, and this
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       cause deaths due to cancer. It's harder to say how many exactly, when exactly .. which means that due to the time delay in these things and the fact that 30-50% of people will contract cancer anyway due to other reasons, we will never know exactly how many.
      </p>
      <p>
       In these studies I've seen the numbers range from a couple of dozens to a quarter million over 80 years, depending on whose done it and with what assumptions . . so yeah. Quarter mill is probably way off, considering what Chernobyl caused with 10 times the emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point was that it's still nowhere near as bad as you'd think from all those miles of newspaper articles. The real tragedy was the tsunami, not the nuclear accident.

       So yeah, ok.  The IAEA has been saying "everything is serious, but manageable" while the cores melted into... well, I don't think they even KNOW where the fuel is, do they?
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, TepCo is saying that they can't store all the radioactive waste water and might just have to dump it into the ocean.  Of course they already HAVE done this, which pissed off at least Korea.  There seem to be leaks into the ocean that haven't been fully controlled, and who knows how they're going to keep marine life from migrating in and out of the area.

       Yes, this is what I'm talking about.  Kids are showing very high abnormality rates in thyroid tests, and there are hot spots in playgrounds.  Some of these hot spots may be quite widespread.  And I don't think ANYBODY knows how this will affect food (fish, farming) and water supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think the nuclear industry's line that "we haven't killed many people... YET" is murderously disingenious.  It's a dangerous attempt to make it sound like things are "serious but manageable" until all the execs can cash out, the mobs/lawyers lose attention, and the real death toll kicks in.
      </p>
      <p>
       TEPCO AND THE JAPANESE (US?) GOVERNMENT ARE COVERING UP THE POISONING OF CHILDREN, FOR GODS' SAKES!  Shouldn't we be disgusted?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't fund the line "Trust us, we're the nuke industry" to be convincing, sorry.  They're the selfish pigs that got us into this mess.  Why weren't the executives who profited so much out there on the front lines to stop the disaster?  Instead of the poor Japanese worker-heroes who were recruited/pressured into it?

       Nope, radiation protection people can quite easily tell how it will affect food and water supplies. It either contaminates them or doesn't. People with geiger counters can find out if it's safe or not.

       I actually think it is as honest as you can get. This is, after all, the only industry that would estimate and tell you this kind of information. Coal plants cause many
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       cancer (not to mention other diseases) cases and spread more radiation than nuclear power plants, but they're not going to tell you
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       (Yes, in case you wonder, a normally operating nuclear power plant releases less radioactivity (close to none) than a coal plant, which releases radioactivity due to carbon isotopes).
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to slow progress of the accident and the evacuation of people, there was only limited exposure to radiation. No people have died because of the nuclear disaster yet. Some people
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       get cancer and die because of it. Difficult to estimate how many and when, given the background static on that.

        I don't fund the line "Trust us, we're the nuke industry" to be convincing, sorry. They're the selfish pigs that got us into this mess. Why weren't the executives who profited so much out there on the front lines to stop the disaster? Instead of the poor Japanese worker-heroes who were recruited/pressured into it?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think it was a bit scandalous why the site wasn't prepared for a tsunami this size. As for having executives fighting the disaster on-site, I don't think that would be a good idea. They would've only messed up the work of people who knew what they were doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still I'd like to know where was the Fukushima Daiichi power plant manager in the first 12 hours of the accident?

       I believe GE actually built several of the Fukushima plants.  That's why it's interesting they sent Immelt.  I mean, what did he even DO?  Unless he donned a rad suit and started shoveling, there's no honest need for him there.

       Not direct cause and link because of the small proportion of cancer cases caused by fukushima compared to all cancer cases over several decades. It will be impossible to point at a single cancer case and say if it was definitely caused by Fukushima radiation vs. any of other possible causes.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the statistical link between average population radiation dose and cancer occurrence is well known. So, we can know (in the future when we know how much of the radiation ended up in populace) to a certain degree how many cases, but not which specific cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Radiation has two kinds of health effects: radiation sickness from really high dosage, and random even from very small exposure (which we all get even from natural radon, airplane trips, x-rays, etc..). Very small doses can with some probability cause a cell deformation into cancer. This is about linear in small radiation doses. So there.

       How is that more idiotic? Any underwater release of energy is going to cause some kind of kickback just from the laws of physics. In fact this is exactly how tsunami's naturally form is from an underwater earthquake causing water displacement. A nuclear weapon detonated underwater can cause a tsunami quite easily actually. How exactly am I braindead to point out that it's a feasible possibility?

       Even if exploding a nuclear device under water created the tsunami, it wouldn't replicate the waveform of the associated earthquake. If that was the case, every geologist with access to a seismograph would be calling bullshit.

       Not even CLOSE to what happened in Japan. Not even CLOSE. Orders of magnitude different. I don't give a fuck about some stupid PDF, I'm certain it's full of the same useless, idiotic garbage you're spewing. That fact that it even suggests such an utterly physically and technologically impossible situation is enough for me to know there's nothing worth reading there.

       To create an explosion that size you would need explosives at thermonuclear levels, the s/p/love waves of which would be recorded by seismologists halfway around the world. Are they all in on the conspiracy as well???
Also, the forces involved with real tsunami formation is completely different to a single point explosion of heat and pressure, rather than subduction of plates hundreds of miles wide. It's just impossible, why am I even bothering to reply to this...

       It was a nuke that actually caused the tsunami. The actual earthquake was nowhere near the stated 9+, as proven in the link above.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of documents showing government research into weather control, here is a good example of what they thought about it in the mid 90s:

       From the beginning of his segment on the earthquake, he states the epicenter was 23 miles from the nearest seismograph on the land. That's interesting considering the epicenter was 45 miles off the coast.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with Jim Stone's reasoning about the earthquake is that he's confusing
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale">
        magnitude
       </a>
       with
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercalli_intensity_scale">
        intensity
       </a>
       . Magnitude is the actual measure of the energy released by an earthquake, whereas intensity is the perception of the strength of the earthquake. Intensity depends on the energy of the earthquake, yes, but it is also affected by regional geology which can cause the intensity to vary greatly from place to place. It looks like he's looking at seismometer readings in intensity trying to figure out why they aren't giving him the right numbers in the Richter scale.
       <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/global/shake/c0001xgp/#Instrumental_Intensity">
        Notice on this USGS map of intensity how there are pockets of stronger areas and pockets of weaker areas, yet the energy is still magnitude 9.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at his
       <a href="http://www.jimstonefreelance.com/fukushima1.html">
        website
       </a>
       , I have reason to believe Mr. Stone is talking completely out of his ass with almost zero knowledge of seismology or geophysics. He writes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The following seismograms clearly show epicenters from 3 separate small quakes all occuring simultaneously. This is what would be expected of an attack, rather than a natural occurence.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_wave">
        That is
        <em>
         exactly
        </em>
        what earthquakes look like on seismometers.

       You make good points, but thats pretty far from debunking the entire PDF. What about the rest of the research in the PDF?

       Also--what's more relevant to your initial question you haven't even addressed: the history channel clip and the military paper on controlling the weather. IIRC the U.S. government has patents on technology that influences the weather they have for over a decade.

       Most of what Stone goes on to talk about with regards to the earthquake is how there wasn't enough damage he saw, which can be attributed to strict building codes in Japan after the Kobe earthquake. Much of the focus was on the tsunami damage because it was far more catastrophic than the earthquake damage, partially due to the aforementioned reason. As for the reactor engineering, I'm not a nuclear engineer, so I couldn't say either way. My point is Jim Stone's entire arguement with respect to the earthquake is inherently flawed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I completely forgot about the Air Force document. I looked at it before I looked at the Stone article, but it didn't mention earthquakes so I didn't see the relevance.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the History Channel clip on HAARP: I know next to nothing about HAARP so I wouldn't care to speculate on that either. However, it's the History Channel. Not exactly a bastion of skeptical inquiry of scientific facts.

       What about reactor 4? It was offline for refueling but blew up anyways. These reactors are made of rebar reinforced concrete, and it blew up from the inside out.

       No, no rational thinking person with half a brain would give this kind of ludicrous idea a second thought. It's about as plausible as saying the Martians did it. Would you believe me if I told you that Jello pudding is actually made from an extract they pull from the La Brea tar pits? Hopefully not, because that's almost as stupid an idea as "miniature nuclear devices in a fault." Just because you, or someone else has an idea about something, doesn't automatically mean it deserves respect, or even consideration. Some are just plain moronic and deserve nothing but ridicule. So yeah, your idea is idiotic, get over it.

       Jim Stone needs to investigate a little more.   All large explosions cause mushroom clouds.   A plastic factory exploded a mile outside of the town I live in, and the result was a huge mushroom cloud.  They are not unique to nuclear explosions.   If he got something that simple completely wrong, I trust nothing else of what he says.

       Furthermore, the Kobe quake's epicenter was centered under the mainland, and not out at sea.   It was also much more shallow.  Of course it's going to produce more fallen buildings and structural damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, basic facts that are easily verified...

       As someone who's studying seismology this is absolute bollocks, a tsunami wave is created by a huge amount of solid plate forcing its way up through the ocean to displace several miles of water. A nuclear detonation would simply cause a large, noticeable blast that would vaporise a huge amount of water and cause so little displacement of water that the effects would not be felt by the coastline.
      </p>

       And as for the Kobe earthquake claim, please look up the location of the epicentres and and focus depth of both of those earthquakes and you'll understand the difference. Also read up about Kobe's shit building regulations before the earthquake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Hanshin/Kobe: Depth of 16km and 20km distance from Kobe. Mostly concrete-roofed buildings collapsed,  also it occurring in the night was a huge factor.
2011 Tōhoku: Depth of 32km, over 70km from the mainland of Japan.
      </p>

       It's a testament to the incredible Japanese response to the disaster that so few died, you should be impressed, not suspicious.

       Ok let's just ignore the fact that Japan sits on one of the most earthquake prone tectonic plate boundaries in the world and instantly say that it's a MOTHERFUCKING NUCLEAR BOMB! /s

       I'm glad someone else posted this. Ever since I found his website (through that article actually) i've been checking his site just about daily. Solid gold on the interwebs.
