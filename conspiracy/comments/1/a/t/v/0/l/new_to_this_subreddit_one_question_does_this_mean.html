       Most are.  Some don't want to be.  Some try to say we are nuts.  Overall, this is the best sub to keep pace with news from and for the "awake" people.  The ones who think we are nuts will stand out like stink on crap.

       The term 'awake' is thrown around way too much. There's no 'awake' vs 'sleeping' just different degrees of life experience.
It would help a bit more if you could elaborate what your definition of awake was.

       Better term for what? If you asked joe average if he was awake he would say yes.

       Awake was intended to mean those who understand the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       way the world works?  What exactly does "real" mean?  One person's "awareness of what is 'real'" might be another's "fast asleep".
      </p>
      <p>
       There is indeed a lot of hidden, covert, nefarious shit going on in this world.  That much is absolutely, indubitably true.  There are
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       levels of understanding with regard to just how aware one is of what exactly is going on, however.

       Well, it's not like I'm trying to be continuously difficult here, but what I said above applies to this statement as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say that someone who votes and pays their taxes and punches in and out at a 9-5 and has 2.5 kids and a spouse, sits down and watches the MSM drivel but doesn't "believe
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of it" could be said to have a "decent understanding of how the world is run".
      </p>
      <p>
       That person is, however, practically "completely oblivious" compared to, say, G. Edward Griffin or someone like Jordan Maxwell to use but two examples.

      <p>
       As I imagine some replies on here have already mentioned, some on this subreddit
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       indeed quite a bit more awake than the average person.  Others in this subreddit not so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall it would seem that there are at least more people than average on this subreddit that at least know "something" is terribly awry, and that is at least a start.

       That really makes me sigh and give a beleaguered facepalm because there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       indeed people that are
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       oblivious to just how bad things are...and yet things are SOOO fucking bad.  I wonder just how anyone could be
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       clueless....but I guess some are, unfortunately.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say the folks here
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       generally much more awake than the average person...but even we still have a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       more work to do and a LOT more to study and be aware of because the rabbit hole goes
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       deeper than TPTB have revealed to any of us proles.

       I don't think that anyone her actually understands the way the world works. It's a tough subject.
This sub Reddit is more preoccupied with lunatic conspiracy theories, reptilians and Jew bashing. You won't find much original content here either, but it's fine if you want to skim read headlines.

       There really aren't many people spouting the 4th dimensional reptilian theory in this subreddit. For every one that does there are 10 that decry him. The subreddit is actually far from homogeneous, and has a pretty steady influx of status quo believers flooding in from r/conspiritard to keep discussions lively. There are a few folks who believe that Jews are the great evil, but once again, not the majority.

       The main problem I see with the sub is that a lot of wide eyed hysteria pops in and gets upvoted when something is big in the media like Sandy Hook. All kinds of rumors and speculation get bandied about and parroted that are quite absurd. Then when really bizarre claims are made people who believe it and the rational folks who are seeing the obvious lies start infighting fests that turn into paranoid rage fits and name calling. The percentage split of the BS as a result of useful idiots, controlled opposition and government/corporate infiltration is anyone's guess.  All the while the fixation on the big event that the media is talking about furthers the whole goal of The Powers That Be who had the big media circus to distract from "something else" in the first place.

       There really aren't many people spouting the 4th dimensional reptilian theory in this subreddit. For every one that does there are 10 that decry him. The subreddit is actually far from homogeneous, and has a pretty steady influx of status quo believers flooding in from r/conspiritard to keep discussions lively. There are a few folks who believe that Jews are the great evil, but once again, not the majority.

       The main problem I see with the sub is that a lot of wide eyed hysteria pops in and gets upvoted when something is big in the media like Sandy Hook.

Then when really bizarre claims are made people who believe it and the rational folks who are seeing the obvious lies start infighting fests that turn into paranoid rage fits and name calling. The percentage split of the BS as a result of useful idiots, controlled opposition and government/corporate infiltration is anyone's guess.
