    <div class="md"><p>Congress has had the ability to stop this arms race against Americans for over a decade now -- starting with 9/11. They did nothing to stop the militarization of law enforcement. They did nothing to stop the police state. That is because government sees itself as separate from the people. Until our leaders see that the same executive orders that allow drone strikes and indefinite detention against the citizens can also be used against them -- they will not protect our fundamental rights. If DHS isn&#39;t gearing up for a war against the American public, then they are Obama&#39;s private army. The only other possible target is our own government.</p>

<p>DHS is a paramilitary organization. During a time of budget cuts, they are amassing huge amount of resources while our military gets cut. They are preparing for something. Either it is to use against the American public or a coup. Since they refuse to answer questions from Congress the logical conclusion is. . .?</p>

<p>I literally just asked you what the time frame is.  I haven&#39;t decided anything, I thought my inquiry would bring you to that realization but I guess not.</p>

<p>What in the ever living fuck gave you that idea?  Seriously, don&#39;t respond to me unless you point out something in my posts that states I&#39;m on one side of the fence or the other.  Get your straw-man bullshit out of here or this goes nowhere.</p>

<p>Do I need to link you to the part where I asked you for a time frame or are you capable of going back and reading for yourself?  </p>

<p>Yeah, I said 4 years.  As evidenced by my later inquiry, that wasn&#39;t some set in stone fucking date, it&#39;s just a random time frame I used to make a tongue in cheek comment about your logical gymnastics.  I has absolutely nothing to do with the President&#39;s term, fuck Obama, and fuck the GOP.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to talk about that.  I&#39;m here to talk about why you think it automatically means that they are staging a coup against Congress, and what your time frame for it is.  Justify your logic with facts.  Let&#39;s go.</p>

<p>No way this is total horseshit.  The right is all about individualism, the left is all about collectivism and authoritarianism can only happen with the aid of collectivist mindsets of the people. Hitler could even be considered collectivist left winger based on that alone, yes he was a fascist but that isn&#39;t all that different than communist in terms of how the people are rallied and brought into a hivemind.  </p>

<p>Collectivism is the enemy here, people lumping themselves into groups and being controlled by the supposed leaders of these groups.  That&#39;s why there is &quot;black rights&quot; and &quot;Gay rights&quot; those are collectivist terms, they don&#39;t talk about &quot;individual&quot; rights anymore, just collective rights, which is 100% left wing.  </p>

<p>You should be.</p>

<p>Where do you want me to start? Your misunderstanding of the American left? Your misunderstanding of anarchism? Or the fact that the GOP tends to be <em>more</em> authoritarian than Democrats?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t misunderstand either. American progressivism, the strongest ideology of the American left is about central planning i.e. authoritarian. Anarchy is lack of government. Ill agree with you that there&#39;s a strong influence of progressivism in the GOP, but I&#39;m not in favor of that party either. Although if I had to say which I thought was more dangerous I&#39;d say the dems. 
&quot;law and order&quot; isn&#39;t authoritarian, it&#39;s the very definition of what government is. Then you have to ask yourself how many laws and how much order is justified. Again, I&#39;m no big fan of the GOP, but the democrats want much more control than the GOP.
I don&#39;t like looking at the spectrum as a line anyway, I see it more as a circle. Fascism and communism aren&#39;t polar opposites and shouldn&#39;t be viewed as such. On the contrary, they&#39;re very similar. Fascism is patriotic socialism whereas communism is global in scope. They both share the same basic tenets about governments role. And on the opposite end of those two is anarchy, lack of government. </p>

<p>In Europe, fascists and <em>actual</em> communists (not &quot;state communists&quot;, which is an oxymoron) fought <em>violently</em> against each other (mostly fascists attacking anarcho-communists) in the early 20th century. If they&#39;re the same, why&#39;d this happen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have a full time job. if i am dependent on city government, it is for water, sewer, garbage, police, fire, snow plows, etc. and i pay for every service i use</p>

<p>the right, on the other hand, expects the US military is galavant around the world invading and occupying nations, and killing anyone who dares stand in their way, just so conservatives can have that warm, cozy feeling of killing someone because it makes them feel more safer. </p>

<p>oh, and the best part is, the right doesn&#39;t even want to PAY for their military adventures. </p>

<p>yeah thats right, they BORROW MONEY from COMMUNIST CHINA to fight wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but woe be to anyone to ask a CONSERVATIVE to pony up a little TAX money to pay for the extra <del>&quot;defense&quot;</del> war crimes that they demand.</p>

<p>No, its better to try and pay for wars by giving tax cuts to the rich and stealing Iraq&#39;s oil, Afghanistan&#39;s opium, and &quot;Pallet loads of $100 bills&quot; (google that) from the American Taxpayers. And if those VooDooEconomics solutions fail to produce the intended results, we just kick the can down the road and let someone else&#39;s grandkids pay for it. </p>

<p>you are in an interesting situation where YOUR definitions of words do not match everyone else&#39;s definitions of words.  </p>

<p>on a simple word association test for the words &quot;conformity&quot; and &quot;diversity&quot;, most people would associate the former with conservatism and the latter with liberalism, but don&#39;t take my word for it. here are the wikipedia entries for those two words.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism</a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism</a> </p>

<p>the reason you are CONFUSED about political vocabulary is because fox news, am radio, etc deliberately misinform, conflate, and re-write history, and conservatives fall for it. </p>

<p>on the example of RACISM, a modern conservative would:</p>

<p>deny having any racist inclinations, </p>

<p>deny that conservatism has ever been associated with racism, </p>

<p>tell us that the KKK were all democrats (conveniently neglecting to mention they were &quot;conservative democrats&quot;), </p>

<p>not see southern voter suppression tactics as racially motivated, </p>

<p>try to take credit for the civil rights acts of 1964-1965, </p>

<p>see affirmative actions as a cause of racism,</p>

<p>and believe that trayvon martin deserved to be shot to death by george zimmerman. </p>

<p>if you want to really start to understand America, you&#39;ll have to view it through the lens of the north-south divide aka the mason-dixon line. there are (at least) two completely different &quot;americas&quot;, and there always have been. </p>

<p>following pic illustrates how conservative, racist attitudes get passed down from generation to generation. </p>

<p>(first pic is lynchings / million)</p>

<p><a href="http://d3j5vwomefv46c.cloudfront.net/photos/large/336083389.png">http://d3j5vwomefv46c.cloudfront.net/photos/large/336083389.png</a></p>

<p>if you are from iowa, you should know that modern conservatism is firmly rooted in slave state conservatism, which iowa helped fight against in the civil war. no matter how conservative you think you are, you are living in a northern state where everyone, even the conservatives, are more liberal than their southern peers. </p>

<p>consequently, you get all of the benefits of living in a &quot;liberal paradise&quot;, while being allowed to spew conservative nonsense that your local peers ultimately ignore at the voting booth. </p>

<p>why not move down south, where the local voters agree with your ideas, and have rwnj solidarity in the voting booths? because then you might be forced to live with the consequences of your failed ideas?</p>

<p>here are two maps that illustrate the effects of failed conservative policies </p>

<p>so pack your stuff, get on I-35, and go join your ideological brethren. </p>

<p>i hear they are exceptionally polite down south, all like &quot;yes sir massa sir&quot; n shit. </p>

<p>i sincerely hope it works out. </p>

<p>if not, you are always welcome to come back to the gay marriage mecca of the world! </p>

<p>oh, and GO Ron Paul! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what the fuck.  You are confusing NEO-CONSERVATIVISM with ACTUAL CONSERVATISM.  </p>

<p>And in regards to Ron Paul, I was <em>THERE</em> at the Ames Straw Poll where he was obviously robbed of first place, there were thousands more Ron Paul supporters there than Bachmann.  I caucused for Ron Paul and was a precient leader for his campaign and he won in my county(Black Hawk County). You are seriously confused.  Ron Paul <em>IS</em> right wing.  The small government, non interventionism IS conservatism.  The Neo-cons have hijacked the right this has been blatant for a long time.  </p>

<p>The right is all about individualism.  You are confused about what &quot;right wing&quot; and &quot;collectivism&quot; is.  The Neo-cons utilize collectivism and nationalism to promote an aggressive and irresponsible foreign policy, it is called Jingoism.  </p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with public services handled at a local level, but there is a point of overkill.  Property taxes take up almost half of my mortgage payment that is ridiculous.  That is overkill.  We have less students in the schools than the years before yet the budget has increased.  That is overkill.  I could go on and on.</p>

<p>We&#39;re all human beings scanning for threats in our environment, and then aligning our beliefs with what we see as being threatening. I never read anything mind blowing or thought provoking on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>And this is why we have the problems we do. As long as the people who think this president is a communist outnumber the people who think he should be more liberal, what incentive does a politician whose lively hood is dependent on votes have to be more liberal?</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Obama is a community organizer who worked with the poorest and most marganilzed neighborhoods in Chicago, who came from a single parent home and became a Democrat because it was the team that had a chance of winning that more closely aligned with his world view. If a half black community organizer who was an activist in his youth can&#39;t be the liberal president we want him to be then perhaps it&#39;s time we realize that the president is not a king, and that no president in US history, not even Lincoln, was able to do anything good or progressive without the people behind him.</p>

<p>FDR didn&#39;t give us the new deal. The labor unions did. Lincoln didn&#39;t free the slaves, the abolishinists who had been working close to 50 years on the issue of slavery did. George Washington didn&#39;t create the USA, enlightenment philosophers and revolutionaries meeting in secret and spreading their ideas did. </p>

<p>It&#39;s alright to complain if you participate in the system. If you protest, if you vote. But if you do neither, you have no right to complain. You are part of the problem. </p>

<p>See, here is a fundamental misunderstanding caused by a purposeful obscuring of the facts.</p>

<p>Those &quot;enlightened&quot; individuals were members of the colonial middle class who had wealth and sought to turn the sweeping anger of an impoverished working class against the upper class so that they could, in turn, seize power and wealth for themselves.</p>

<p>The only &quot;enlightened&quot; part of our democracy is the verbage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>indeed, i have pretty much the same story as you. there are a lot of people that are much like us who have similarly figured out the truth within the past few years - really, since 2008 and the (engineered) financial crisis and the (engineered) barack obama cult of personality machine emerged en force. the shocking arrogance of the financial elite coupled with the equally incredibly brazen moves by the obama goon squad have really been a wake-up call for many former &quot;liberals&quot; like us. </p>

<p>i personally know quite a few people who have woken up just like us in this same way. yeah, it&#39;s depressing that so many other people are still so incredibly brainwashed, but our numbers really are slowly growing. every day, the amount of cognitive dissonance required to keep believing in the charade gets heavier and heavier. every individual has a breaking point, and society is made up of individuals - eventually, we will hit critical mass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I consider myself liberal.  Extremely so.  But I think being liberal/Democrat is gonna start going the way being conservative/Republican has already gone.  Party and representatives don&#39;t so much espouse ideals of the constituents so you&#39;re disenfranchised.  Or start leaning third party, which is as effective as being disenfranchised.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not pro-war, though I do believe there are wars worth fighting.  That&#39;s a whole other thing, though.  Torture is stupid.  There a more effective, more humane ways to gather intelligence.  Wall Street needs to calm the fuck down, corporations should pay their taxes and not be allowed a bazillion loopholes and incentives - maybe the world economy wouldn&#39;t be so wonky if they fucking did (lol lobbyists), genetically engineered crops have their place, I assure you, but that place isn&#39;t EVERYWHERE.  </p>

<p>Indefinite detention goes so against the traditional American grain that no one should be cool with it, OPSEC is a thing and has to be respected at times, for a finite period.  Oil companies need to start throwing their money at wind, solar, hydrogen, etc. power.  Maybe find themselves another Tesla if they give a flying fuck about their great-grandkids having billions of dollars. </p>

Take it all with a grain of salt.  The world is huge and there are so many ways to disseminate information, whether it&#39;s true or false.  Just remember, people are shitbags and even if something is 90% real, undisputable, this fucking happened you guys truth, you still gotta watch that 10%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people are brainless zombies stuck in a left-right paradigm. I come from more of a libertarian standpoint and most of my conversations with &#39;hardcore liberals&#39; or &#39;hardcore conservatives&#39; go something like this.
Democrat for example:</p>

<p>Me: &quot;Dude did you hear about the NDAA that Obama put through, it allows for the government to indefinitely detain anyone for any reason without a trial.&quot;</p>

<p>Liberal: &quot;Ya well Bush put the patriot act through, Bush is even worse than Obama.&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;Ya Bush was terrible too, I don&#39;t support him either. The patriot act intrudes on our free speech and rights to privacy.&quot;</p>

<p>Liberal: <em>Can&#39;t comprehend how I could hate both sides. Argument along with all mental functions shut down.</em></p>

<p>It must be so wonderful being one of the non brain dead zombies relying on the written works of Ayn Rand and believing in the non-empircal evidence based Austrian school of economics.  Your wisdom just astounds me. How could I be so blind? </p>

<p>Nevermind that we already had a libertarian president named Herbert Hoover and the social mobility attained by the majority of people in the USA was thanks to the labor movement and FDR and the progressives. </p>

<p>Libertarianism is cool today because none of you are old enough to remember what life was like in the depression.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from Canada. Our conservatives are more liberal than your liberals.</p>

<p>You have to look at things from a more international perspective.</p>

<p>In the US, you have a handful of media conglomerates who share the network of information hubs. That&#39;s your tv, movies, radio, newspapers, publishing houses, and internet.</p>

<p>These companies are largely multinational and they don&#39;t really care about the state of the US as long as they can profit.</p>

<p>They play both sides against each other via partisan wedges. It&#39;s meant to divide &amp; conquer. You keep people split instead of united, you can make a lot of money.</p>

<p>FOX isn&#39;t conservative. They&#39;re corporate. Same with all the other outlets. Bill Maher &amp; HBO, work for Time Warner. John Stewart &amp; Stephen Colbert, work for Viacom. All these networks are in collusion to game the public.</p>

<p>Because of how big they are, they can control the scope of information and ideas shared.</p>

<p>This takes away the public voice, installs the cororate voice, and next thing you know, everyone is buying their shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the secret is small government. Anytime you start up an &quot;agency&quot; of any kind it&#39;s sole purpose will become to grow and make itself unremoveable. I have no problems paying for education, roads, fire departments, police, hospitals, etc. But, I would do it through private industry. Who is more efficient at dealing with money? A private company or the Government? Look at the quality of private schools vs. public.</p>

<p>The only thing the Government should exist for is: national defense, international treaties, issuing money (and maybe ... just maybe... national infrastructure like highways and bridges). Otherwise, I think that all the functions that Government is currently doing could be handled more efficiently by private companies. [This would also create millions of jobs!]</p>

<p>I agree that we need to get money out of politics. Scatter the lobbyists to the wind and eliminate bribery and graft. Elections should be like the UK -- all candidates get like 6 weeks to campaign and have the same budget. All politicians should get a (minimal) fixed salary and be held accountable for all their expenses. You go into politics to serve the public, not get rich. There should also be strict term limits on all politicians.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Public education could be a 1000x better, especially in lower income areas where schools are being shut because there&#39;s no budgets for them.</p>

<p>The US being a capitalist country has this perception that rich private schools or Ivy League universities are the best and worth the insane tuition costs.</p>

<p>You could do better. Wealth distribution and across the board education guidelines can teach kids everywhere the same curricullum. Plus, if textbooks were set up as open sources, teachers groups and other academics can create the content collectively so there&#39;s no bias in the information. Basically wikipedia but with better standards for accuracy.</p>

<p>Health care &amp; private industry is freaking scary. I love my Canadian health care.</p>

<p>With all this stuff, the goal is to have small, efficient governments that are fiscally conservative while providing services that help everyone.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t want sick people in your country. They cost a lot of money. If you keep people healthy, they&#39;re making money. There will always be people who do need resources and help and the system is designed to make sure they get better, or get jobs and stay off welfare or out of hospitals or prisons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I think the media and government <em>purposely</em> turn it into an &quot;us vs them&quot; thing, with everything. It&#39;s to keep the population fighting about menial shit like abortion and gay marriage, while the important stuff they <em>should</em> be talking about come election time is just background noise. Abortion and gay marriage are emotional issues, which is why they&#39;re so effective at dividing people. </p>

<p>From what i can tell, if the media wasn&#39;t spewing bullshit into their heads on a daily basis, most &#39;conservative&#39; Americans would be happy with the freedom to go to the range at the weekend and live their fucking lives. In fact i think that&#39;s what most people want - just to get on with their lives without interference from others. But the media is constantly telling people that everyone is out to get them, that there is danger around every corner, that the conservatives want you to do <em>this</em>, and the libs want to force you to do <em>that</em> - over and over. </p>

<p>I tell you what, if we ever come out of the other side of all this bullshit, i&#39;ll be the first one on the boat to the US.

    <div class="md"><p>Non-liberal or complex? Dumbing down the conversation to heros and villains is just as bad as worshipping a politician in belief that they will solve all our problems. </p>

<p>He has done many liberal things. He has done many conservative things. He is the president of the United States. In a country split almost 50/50 conservative and liberal. </p>

<p>The president is not a dictator and can not act without congress and cannot stay in power without people voting for him and people can&#39;t vote for someone if their message is not heard, etc etc etc.</p>

<p>It might make you feel better to live in a world of absolute evils and absolute goods and an American government where the president can do anything he wants without looking at polling data, without having to go through congress etc etc but that is not the real world. </p>

<p>And I have yet to meet a liberal who worshipos Obama. Maybe some who feel sorry for him or like him as a person but I have never met anyone, or read anythying in any liberal newspaper, or even heard and MSNBC correspondent who has not criticized him when he moves to the right on issues. I do remember people getting death threats after 9/11 like Margaret Cho etc for criticizing Bush and being told that criticism of the president is un-American. I have never seen liberals refuse to criticize this president or blindly follow. </p>

<p>Maybe liberals voted for him for a second time around for various complex reasons. Maybe they didn&#39;t like the idea of another ground war with Iran. Or a conservative supreme court justice tilting the balance even further to the right or someone who would green light the hack and slash Republican budget. You know, because budgets affect real human people living on the margins of society and living in the suburbs. </p>

<p>It&#39;s awesome you&#39;re not a sheeple and see things so clearly that you can be so smug but I would bet you are probably in your late teens to early 20&#39;s and you connect with conspiracies because they make you feel superior to those who don&#39;t. They make you feel like you know things that others don&#39;t.  But 80% of what you read here is just fear mongering for page views. Things to get you riled up and passionate. </p>

<p>So yeah I&#39;m sorry that I&#39;m a sheeple liberal who voted for Obama and that must mean that I have a statue of him in my room and I pray to him everyday for guidance and that I never criticize or get angry or post anything critical of him on Reddit etc. I wish I was smart enough to vote for Ron Paul that cool 80 year old guy with those mind blowing ideas about how if he was president he could fix everything by getting rid of everything. I wish I was smart enough and young enough and lacking in historical perspective to buy his bullshit and comeo n <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and get tons of karma points for showing off how independent minded I am. But alas I&#39;m not. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think this is a ridiculously important point that is just being <em>completely</em> ignored.</p>

<p>Was the left loud and obnoxious during Bush&#39;s two terms? Yes. And justifiably so. Are they less so now? Yes. <em>But there is still plenty of criticism coming from the &quot;left&quot; of Obama.</em> Even from that alleged Obama water-carrier, MSNBC. (Sure, there is a lot of stuff they ignore, and if you are critical of the state from a leftist perspective, tons to be desired, but watch Up on a weekend morning. There is some super critical stuff on there.)</p>

<p>OTOH, I don&#39;t remember all of these principled &quot;libertarians&quot; and &quot;Tea Party&quot; types standing up and complaining when Bush was dramatically expanding the scope of executive power, and bailing out the banks. But the instant the black guy shows up, it&#39;s go time.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen plenty of people who consider themselves &quot;loyal party Democrats&quot; grumble. Maybe in private, but they are grumbling. There are lots and lots and lots of people on the far left who range from upset to furious.</p>

<p>But the option was Mitt Fucking Romney. Jesus Horatio Christ. Democrats would have lined up to vote for Richard Nixon over that guy (who, actually, was further left than Obama is).</p>

<p>I think some people don&#39;t support Obama for legitimate reasons. Others for political reasons. Others because they are racist, and others because it&#39;s cool to be against whoever is in power. </p>

<p>Barring all that when I read criticism of Obama i never see nuance, I always see black and white thinking. The CIA is operating a drones program and he is letting it happen. So that = Obama is an evil droning warlord dictator. Obama isn&#39;t being transparent on issues that could have national security implications = most non-transparent president ever.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, Obama doesn&#39;t start ground war in Syria = Obama is a pussy. </p>

<p>If you believe Obama to be evil you are just as idiotic as the people who &quot;worship&quot; him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it&#39;s true that life isn&#39;t black and white, you have to entertain the idea that maybe, in certain situations, it&#39;s MORE black than white.  Evil exists, corruption exists, greed exists.</p>

<p>I guess the point I&#39;m trying to make is that you&#39;re limiting yourself just as much as the people you&#39;re talking about when you say, &quot;life isn&#39;t black and white&quot;.  Sometimes it is.  Sometimes there are heroes and villains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You forgot that all of these oppressive, violent and often inhumane activities are often in favour by the most religious people. Religion flies planes into buildings. Personally, I think politics is the entertainment division of the military industrial complex (Frank Zappa&#39;s words).</p>

<p>The truth is there is virtually no difference in the politics of the two ends (blue or red) of the American voting spectrum who have any real chance of winning (see <a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org">www.politicalcompass.org</a> for more information). This duality is occurring in Canada too. The conservatives consolidated a decade ago and have been in power ever since. The liberals and socialist party here need to do the same to have a fighting chance. It is interesting to note this duality may be the best way to run a business, long term. For example Coke and Pepsi. They prefer to compete with the devil they know. It is almost impossible for any global player to compete with these two giants today.</p>

<p>This type of government manufactured &quot;mind fuck&quot; propaganda is a growing type of global control mechanism (see <a href="http://youtu.be/cfE-oo7r7RI">http://youtu.be/cfE-oo7r7RI</a> to see this explained) and is the modern day equivalent to slavery. Sadly, humanity has outgrown their need for this control mechanism due to literacy, education, science and the internet; however, most of humanity are not aware of this <strong>yet</strong>.</p>

Most people truly on the left don&#39;t even consider democrats or liberals to even be on the left.  The left is anti-capitalism and the right the opposite.  But then there is the top (authoritarian) and the bottom (libertarian).

    <div class="md"><p>Vote third party next time. Voting &quot;for the lesser evil&quot; is only perpetuating the same behavior. Granted, no third party candidate is going to ever get elected but Obama is a perfect example of how presidents campaign on the controversial issues and then fall in with the &#39;agenda&#39; once they actually get elected. Mccain would have been the same as Obama is now if he got elected. Presidential opinion, even if they WERE benevolent to begin with (which i doubt) doesnt really effect what they end up doing; the billions from the big corps do. Honestly im pretty convinced no repub or demo candidate even gets to nominee without vowing beforehand to protect the monied interests if they get elected. We at least need to show we arent playing the game anymore. And if 3rd party candidates start getting significant support maybe they will start getting more attention and people will realize there ARE more options that red and blue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it led me to seek answers, to educate myself, to seek truth. As my eyes were opened, I began to realize that the actions of the government, however well intentioned, seem to achieve opposite results, even without corruption (though we know how corrupt it is). I disliked the hypocrisy in democrats and republicans, that seemed to have conflicting views. Pro-life but pro-death penalty, A woman&#39;s body is her own to chose abortion, but not to chose to protect her self with a gun, etc. My principles always leaned towards freedom, but I didn&#39;t have a deep understanding why. </p>

<p>I started reading. I learned the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle">Non-agression principle</a>. I suppose I liked it because it was a more unifying idea. I agree with the idea of self ownership. </p>

<p>I started reading about economics, specifically Austrian economics. I came to see the problems with government, taxes, the FED, etc. I came to embrace the free market rather than trust government to know what&#39;s best. </p>

<p>Ah yes, the many progressive initiatives in the US such as the AHCA or &#39;Obamacare&#39; which was really a bill that kowtowed to the big insurance companies enforcing federal fines on anyone who does not buy service from a private sector company.</p>

<p>How very marxist/communist/socialist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, let&#39;s be fair, right? as someone who would describe myself as you would - I agree, for the most part.</p>

<p>But I think there is a significant difference between the language and attitude used by the GOP and the Dems, obviously. I don&#39;t think you&#39;d have to be racist to <em>not</em> support Obama, however, I think only a racist moron could justify supporting <em>Romney</em>. </p>

<p>Whether or not Obama backs up his rhetoric is irrelevant (as is why) to the consideration, given the rhetoric the GOP provides. <em>Should</em> we gut the budget to improve our debt situation to improve the economy, or should we focus on jobs? Anyone that isn&#39;t a disingenuous asshole knows the obvious answer to that question. Yet you have a party whose entire platform is based on such purposeful deceit.</p>

<p>So you can choose the guy that has sensible rhetoric and try and force him towards the policies you want, or you can chose the guy that is obviously lying with a smile on his face. Of course, I&#39;m of the impression that if liberals actually held Obama to even the slightest standard of liberalism, we might see different policies. I agree that most Liberals are too dumb to realize what&#39;s going on, but I don&#39;t think there is actual equivalency between the GOP and the dems, or Obama and any of the GOP.</p>

<p>Why does pointing out that Obama is distinct from the GOP mean I support him? Why would the concepts be mutually exclusive otherwise?</p>

<p>Really - if you can&#39;t do the math to at least understand the differences between Obama and Romney - what kind of false equivalency are you forcing yourself into? Are you supporting a paradigm of objectivity or are you jumping to conclusions based upon the fact that Obama is a democrat? You really don&#39;t seem to understand that I haven&#39;t even pegged him as remotely good, just obviously less retarded than the GOP. Try and think <em>just a little</em>, please. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is one of the things I point out. But if you measure where they match up to their rhetoric, the difference becomes even more obvious. <em>Even if</em> Obama doesn&#39;t match up to his rhetoric a lot.</p>

<p>Romney doesn&#39;t talk a good game? Then why did so many people vote for him?

Romney was a great talker, it just happened to be that the things he says are generally offensive to most of the population. But he really gets straight to the heart of rich white guys. They love his talking. They loved the 47% quote. Heck, you are completely letting Romney&#39;s policies off the hook while pointing out exactly why I&#39;m right. </p>

<p>Romney <em>would</em> do what he said. <em>That&#39;s</em> the problem with him and the GOP. That&#39;s significantly different from campaigning on sensible economic policies that you aren&#39;t able to achieve due to a group of unprecedented legislative impediments. No I&#39;m not making any excuses for Obama&#39;s shortcomings in terms of war policies, of which he is terrible, but the policies still fall short of what Romney actually <em>advocated</em> for. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry that you can&#39;t do math!</p>

<p>No shit. This wasn&#39;t a discussion on whether or not the American people are intelligent.</p>

<p>Never.</p>

<p>Well, not really. Are you going to have a discussion with me or are you just going to post matter-of-factly without even bothering to support your arguments? Obama doesn&#39;t come off as an economic populist, he has been the economically moderate business friendly liberal he always was. But hey - it&#39;s not like I&#39;d expect you to pretend that you are informed. </p>

<p>The majority was anti-Obama. Like Coke vs Pepsi.</p>

<p>Right. But why Romney? If he <em>wasn&#39;t</em> a good speaker, why would an anti-obama fan think he had even the slightest chance of winning? </p>

<p>Oh, so you are saying they actually found some of the policies intriguing? It still doesn&#39;t make sense that you would vote for a guy that had no chance of winning because he was the lesser of two evils, when there were numerous other candidates that were much lesser than the two large evils.

<p>so are you saying that isn&#39;t a list of promises kept by Obama? It&#39;s 13 pages long. What does it matter if he created bureaucracies, that was neither of our points? You simply said that Obama hasn&#39;t kept any of his promises which is an obvious outright lie. Once again, stop mixing up facts with your emotions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>10 times worse? Not to me. I would say some are a little worse in a sense because they think they are &#39;enlightened&#39; for figuring out that everyone has the right to marriage and that women are going to get pregnant and terminate pregnancies regardless of the law, but they only have 1/4th  the story, as does the right . Ive grown a soft spot for republicans because they favor smaller government and (most) have a boner for the constitution, even if i dont agree with some other ideologies. Everyone on r/pol, r/atheism, etc hate on republicans all the time though so i felt it necessary to point out the dumbassery of the liberals as well. But its important to note that the division of the nation is the biggest problem; i dont align with either side and i think if people could just wake up to the fact that were all being played we might actually be able to change something. </p>
