       I used to be a 'liberal', and believed that the GOP was the root of all evil. Now that I am awake, I honestly think the liberals might be dumber than the conservatives. If for nothing else other than
       <em>
        believing
       </em>
       that they are the smartest of the bunch and thus completely closed to any alternative view point; If you don't support Obama it's because you're a greedy bible thumping, gay hating, WBC supporting, Rascist Republican!

       The thing that has been bothering me the most lately is that with all the corporate welfare people still complain about the poorest of poor people who take handouts and blame it on them.

       We just seek to belittle those underneath us when they are the last of our problems and that is really upsetting. There's definitely racist undertones to it too (those damn lazy blacks) /s

       There are only two possible targets. Either it is the American people or DHS is Obama's army and going after our own government. And only then will these self-serving politicians do something about it. But it is probably too late. Why else would the DHS budget grow while the military decreases?

       Congress has had the ability to stop this arms race against Americans for over a decade now -- starting with 9/11. They did nothing to stop the militarization of law enforcement. They did nothing to stop the police state. That is because government sees itself as separate from the people. Until our leaders see that the same executive orders that allow drone strikes and indefinite detention against the citizens can also be used against them -- they will not protect our fundamental rights. If DHS isn't gearing up for a war against the American public, then they are Obama's private army. The only other possible target is our own government.

       Why you've decided this is going to occur in four years is beyond me.  I can see you are still hopelessly trapped in the right vs left paradigm. -
      </p>
      <p>
       DHS is a paramilitary organization. During a time of budget cuts, they are amassing huge amount of resources while our military gets cut. They are preparing for something. Either it is to use against the American public or a coup. Since they refuse to answer questions from Congress the logical conclusion is. . .?

       Oh yeah, I forgot, they are protecting us from terrorists.

        DHS is a paramilitary organization. During a time of budget cuts, they are amassing huge amount of resources. They are preparing for something. Either it is to use against the American public or a coup. Since they refuse to answer questions from Congress the logical conclusion is. . .?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You think the logical conclusion is that they will form a military coup against Congress?!?!  You think that's a logical conclusion?!?!?!  There are some pretty big fucking logical leaps in your theory.

       Again, you decided it was four years. This implies you believe that it us tied to the President's term of office.

       Again, why don't you educate us on why DHS needs all this firepower when we have the strongest military on the planet and we're cutting their budget? If it is logical it should be very easy to explain.

       Yeah, I said 4 years.  As evidenced by my later inquiry, that wasn't some set in stone fucking date, it's just a random time frame I used to make a tongue in cheek comment about your logical gymnastics.  I has absolutely nothing to do with the President's term, fuck Obama, and fuck the GOP.

       I'm not here to talk about that.  I'm here to talk about why you think it automatically means that they are staging a coup against Congress, and what your time frame for it is.  Justify your logic with facts.  Let's go.

       Whatever percentage of the presidential vote that goes to each party gets that percentage of legislative seats. This would greatly hinder American politics as we know it, but it forces legislatures to take into account opinions across the political spectrum and compromise on some issues which in reality,because there are only two parties which are very much similar, doesn't happen often.

       Ohh okay, yeah I know what proportional representation is. I just see it as a hindrance in terms of advancement and change, would be hard to come to a compromise, and I could see most compromises as making everybody feeling unhappy (like the treaty of versailles)

       Whether politicians follow through with it or not I support the platform and what they stand for ideal-wise because it closest aligned with my way of looking at things. If it helps keep Libertarians and Republicans from attaining office that's good because their ideals don't represent mine.

       Basically you are saying that you don't care what they do as long as they tell you what you want to hear. The party platform of the two major parties are almost meaningless when compared with their party members actual voting history.

       Basically what I'm saying is not this. I say I identify with the democratic party platform as it's stated. I didn't say how I vote or what my other interests are. I didn't say I liked a two-party system.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I find a party I like better, I'll join them, but right now there's not an option I like, and I don't think being so wise as to not identify with any party is very wise.

       edit: looking back at my earlier comment does make it appear that I would vote democrat no matter what, and that is not the case.

       Bingo. The two parties fight over social issues, table scraps, and who gets to deliver favors for their financial supporters.  The big issues have already been decided, set in motion, and given the appearance they were  created with oversight and approval.

       I mean ask yourself, with all the money &amp; global power balances there are at stake do you really think those truly in power are going to turn over the big decision making to someone who just won a national popularity contest?  And even then they control who gets to participate in the contest.

       For 95% of people in the U.S., politics is inseparable from sports.  There is only My team and Their team.  Amazing amounts of time, energy, emotion and money somehow get spent on a
       <em>
        completely pointless
       </em>
       charade of emotional entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never mind that "My" team isn't from my area, doesn't care about me, would sell me out in a heartbeat to defect to some other team if it was in their interest..."by F-ing God it's MY team.  If I don't support them blindly, the OTHER team will win!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like spitting every time I hear a very good, intelligent, truly valued friend of mine say that if the Republicans win they'll trash the environment...or if the Democrats win they'll support the terrorists who behead people and kill babies.  You know....whatever Rah-Rah BS is being shouted in the stadium....
      </p>
      <p>
       But I've never found an effective argument or solution.  Either you see the propaganda for what it is, or you live and die by whether your team wins the next home game or playoff...

       No way this is total horseshit.  The right is all about individualism, the left is all about collectivism and authoritarianism can only happen with the aid of collectivist mindsets of the people. Hitler could even be considered collectivist left winger based on that alone, yes he was a fascist but that isn't all that different than communist in terms of how the people are rallied and brought into a hivemind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Collectivism is the enemy here, people lumping themselves into groups and being controlled by the supposed leaders of these groups.  That's why there is "black rights" and "Gay rights" those are collectivist terms, they don't talk about "individual" rights anymore, just collective rights, which is 100% left wing.

       I agree with Jake, your left/right paradigm is the often used European model, between fascism and communism. Europeans accept totalitarianism because it's what they've always known. Even in modern Europe with it's democracies, democracy without checks and balances on government coercion is just another form of totalitarianism.

       The American experiment is/was unique in the sense that our founders voluntarily placed limits on what they could do. The correct left/right paradigm in the USA would therefore be totalitarianism/anarchy.

       I don't misunderstand either. American progressivism, the strongest ideology of the American left is about central planning i.e. authoritarian. Anarchy is lack of government. Ill agree with you that there's a strong influence of progressivism in the GOP, but I'm not in favor of that party either. Although if I had to say which I thought was more dangerous I'd say the dems. 
"law and order" isn't authoritarian, it's the very definition of what government is. Then you have to ask yourself how many laws and how much order is justified. Again, I'm no big fan of the GOP, but the democrats want much more control than the GOP.
I don't like looking at the spectrum as a line anyway, I see it more as a circle. Fascism and communism aren't polar opposites and shouldn't be viewed as such. On the contrary, they're very similar. Fascism is patriotic socialism whereas communism is global in scope. They both share the same basic tenets about governments role. And on the opposite end of those two is anarchy, lack of government.

       The United States puts more people in prison per-capita than any country in the world. The government says "if you do X, we will by means of force remove all of your liberty". The American right continually pushes to
       <em>
        expand
       </em>
       this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversely, those "socialist" left-wing Scandinavian countries have some of the
       <em>
        lowest
       </em>
       incarceration rates in the world, and certainly amongst Western civilizations.

       In Europe, fascists and
       <em>

       </em>
       communists (not "state communists", which is an oxymoron) fought
       <em>
        violently
       </em>
       against each other (mostly fascists attacking anarcho-communists) in the early 20th century. If they're the same, why'd this happen?

       You are basically redefining words in a way that you like, rather than in the way they are commonly understood, in order to fit your worldview.

       you must not have read my post.  Totalitarianism is only possible througjh collectivism.  You need to get the majority of people to
       <em>
        go along
       </em>
       with the regime.  This usually requires the hardcore indoctrination of the youth, which is working well, the amount of Obamabots and retard level automatons in the under 25 bracket is astounding.  I just read a book comparing the Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin regimes and the one overarching similarity was youth indoctrination and collectivism.

       the right, on the other hand, expects the US military is galavant around the world invading and occupying nations, and killing anyone who dares stand in their way, just so conservatives can have that warm, cozy feeling of killing someone because it makes them feel more safer.
      </p>
      <p>
       oh, and the best part is, the right doesn't even want to PAY for their military adventures.

       yeah thats right, they BORROW MONEY from COMMUNIST CHINA to fight wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but woe be to anyone to ask a CONSERVATIVE to pony up a little TAX money to pay for the extra

        "defense"
       </del>
       war crimes that they demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, its better to try and pay for wars by giving tax cuts to the rich and stealing Iraq's oil, Afghanistan's opium, and "Pallet loads of $100 bills" (google that) from the American Taxpayers. And if those VooDooEconomics solutions fail to produce the intended results, we just kick the can down the road and let someone else's grandkids pay for it.

       on a simple word association test for the words "conformity" and "diversity", most people would associate the former with conservatism and the latter with liberalism, but don't take my word for it. here are the wikipedia entries for those two words.

       the reason you are CONFUSED about political vocabulary is because fox news, am radio, etc deliberately misinform, conflate, and re-write history, and conservatives fall for it.

       on the example of RACISM, a modern conservative would:
      </p>
      <p>
       deny having any racist inclinations,
      </p>
      <p>
       deny that conservatism has ever been associated with racism,
      </p>
      <p>
       tell us that the KKK were all democrats (conveniently neglecting to mention they were "conservative democrats"),
      </p>
      <p>
       not see southern voter suppression tactics as racially motivated,
      </p>

       try to take credit for the civil rights acts of 1964-1965,

       if you are from iowa, you should know that modern conservatism is firmly rooted in slave state conservatism, which iowa helped fight against in the civil war. no matter how conservative you think you are, you are living in a northern state where everyone, even the conservatives, are more liberal than their southern peers.
      </p>
      <p>
       consequently, you get all of the benefits of living in a "liberal paradise", while being allowed to spew conservative nonsense that your local peers ultimately ignore at the voting booth.
      </p>
      <p>
       why not move down south, where the local voters agree with your ideas, and have rwnj solidarity in the voting booths? because then you might be forced to live with the consequences of your failed ideas?
      </p>
      <p>
       here are two maps that illustrate the effects of failed conservative policies

       what the fuck.  You are confusing NEO-CONSERVATIVISM with ACTUAL CONSERVATISM.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in regards to Ron Paul, I was
       <em>
        THERE
       </em>
       at the Ames Straw Poll where he was obviously robbed of first place, there were thousands more Ron Paul supporters there than Bachmann.  I caucused for Ron Paul and was a precient leader for his campaign and he won in my county(Black Hawk County). You are seriously confused.  Ron Paul
       <em>
        IS
       </em>
       right wing.  The small government, non interventionism IS conservatism.  The Neo-cons have hijacked the right this has been blatant for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The right is all about individualism.  You are confused about what "right wing" and "collectivism" is.  The Neo-cons utilize collectivism and nationalism to promote an aggressive and irresponsible foreign policy, it is called Jingoism.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing wrong with public services handled at a local level, but there is a point of overkill.  Property taxes take up almost half of my mortgage payment that is ridiculous.  That is overkill.  We have less students in the schools than the years before yet the budget has increased.  That is overkill.  I could go on and on.

There is the authoritarian and libertarian as the up and down.  The people you said were all part of the up (authoritarian) left and right.  The libertarian left and right hardly do anything you mentioned.

       And this is why we have the problems we do. As long as the people who think this president is a communist outnumber the people who think he should be more liberal, what incentive does a politician whose lively hood is dependent on votes have to be more liberal?
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, Obama is a community organizer who worked with the poorest and most marganilzed neighborhoods in Chicago, who came from a single parent home and became a Democrat because it was the team that had a chance of winning that more closely aligned with his world view. If a half black community organizer who was an activist in his youth can't be the liberal president we want him to be then perhaps it's time we realize that the president is not a king, and that no president in US history, not even Lincoln, was able to do anything good or progressive without the people behind him.

       FDR didn't give us the new deal. The labor unions did. Lincoln didn't free the slaves, the abolishinists who had been working close to 50 years on the issue of slavery did. George Washington didn't create the USA, enlightenment philosophers and revolutionaries meeting in secret and spreading their ideas did.

       It's alright to complain if you participate in the system. If you protest, if you vote. But if you do neither, you have no right to complain. You are part of the problem.

       Those "enlightened" individuals were members of the colonial middle class who had wealth and sought to turn the sweeping anger of an impoverished working class against the upper class so that they could, in turn, seize power and wealth for themselves.

       The only "enlightened" part of our democracy is the verbage.

       I do, but like I said if you can trust anyone to accurately report on the us government it is from someone that has no loyality to them. It would be different if the us government never got up to anything shady and RT just made up shit, but they don't have to, they just report the actual news that most us new channels avoid at all costs.

       There have been whispers of the senior editor (?) previously working for Stratfor (CIA company). And Jones just spits a whole lot of opinion and fear mongering with his facts. Ive personally never found him to be factually incorrect but the way he presents his information could use a little less OMG THEYRE TRYING TO KILL US ILLUMINATI DUMB ASS SHEEPLE WAKE UP YOU MORONS.

       You can't sell political media without fear. That goes for left, right, libertarian, and conspiratorial. Otherwise it would just be boring to the majority of people. Funny no one brings up BBC World or Al Jazeera English. Maybe because they report the news in the most boring, straight up way possible?

       This may be true to some extent, but I'm quite sceptical of this argument as well. Truly limited government stops giving over preferential treatment, state privilege, and regulatory capture to corporate sectors. I think this is the ultimate ideal of libertarianism and anarchocapitalism. However, it is difficult to see how we can get to that point from the current status quo.

       So you are suggesting the educational indoctrination is the reason democrats are more gullible than republicans? That makes a lot of sense. This would explain why republicans are so ridiculously paranoid and democrats are so scared and trusting of the state to protect them.

       If you were not a democrat or republican you would understand why that is so fucking ridiculous.

       Simplistic take on the media though I do not necessarily disagree. But Maddow, Chris Hayes, and Melissa Harris Perry are high level. The level of discussion on Up with Chris Hayes, MHP Show, and the level of analysis on Rachel Maddow may be skewed to the left but you cannot accuse them of being low-level propaganda for the masses.

       A system that chooses no winners and losers is inherently harder to corrupt. I love how liberals think that if there isn't this enormous government presence in society everyone will be physically incapable of getting off their asses and doing something collectively about what they think is wrong with the world. It's like you're still in elementary school and you need the school to organize when lunch time is. I bet we could figure it out.

       What I don't think you realize is that "this enormous government presence in society"
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the result of everyone getting off their asses and doing something collectively about what they think is wrong with the world. Labor laws, environmental laws, social programs, progressive taxation, etc. are all the result of very hard-fought popular movements. History, my friend. Learn it.

       Progressive taxation was due to a social movement? You are the one who needs to brush up on your history, please learn how the 16th amendment was passed and please tell me about how the bureaucracy in the executive branch doesn't legislate without popular opinion, I would love to hear that explanation. You have a typical opinion on matters, typical in that it is uneducated.

       indeed, i have pretty much the same story as you. there are a lot of people that are much like us who have similarly figured out the truth within the past few years - really, since 2008 and the (engineered) financial crisis and the (engineered) barack obama cult of personality machine emerged en force. the shocking arrogance of the financial elite coupled with the equally incredibly brazen moves by the obama goon squad have really been a wake-up call for many former "liberals" like us.
      </p>
      <p>
       i personally know quite a few people who have woken up just like us in this same way. yeah, it's depressing that so many other people are still so incredibly brainwashed, but our numbers really are slowly growing. every day, the amount of cognitive dissonance required to keep believing in the charade gets heavier and heavier. every individual has a breaking point, and society is made up of individuals - eventually, we will hit critical mass.

       How in the world did we manage to get Zeitgeist on Youtube for so long? How did we manage to have infowars hosted on the government internet for so long without it imploding??! It's just amazing how awake and smart and knowledgabel we are and how everyone else is just stupid for believing the lamestream media.

       I consider myself liberal.  Extremely so.  But I think being liberal/Democrat is gonna start going the way being conservative/Republican has already gone.  Party and representatives don't so much espouse ideals of the constituents so you're disenfranchised.  Or start leaning third party, which is as effective as being disenfranchised.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not pro-war, though I do believe there are wars worth fighting.  That's a whole other thing, though.  Torture is stupid.  There a more effective, more humane ways to gather intelligence.  Wall Street needs to calm the fuck down, corporations should pay their taxes and not be allowed a bazillion loopholes and incentives - maybe the world economy wouldn't be so wonky if they fucking did (lol lobbyists), genetically engineered crops have their place, I assure you, but that place isn't EVERYWHERE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indefinite detention goes so against the traditional American grain that no one should be cool with it, OPSEC is a thing and has to be respected at times, for a finite period.  Oil companies need to start throwing their money at wind, solar, hydrogen, etc. power.  Maybe find themselves another Tesla if they give a flying fuck about their great-grandkids having billions of dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       And who the fuck knows what is and isn't propaganda anymore?  Unless you're directly involved with something, see it for yourself, it's best to look at everything askance.  Take it all with a grain of salt.  The world is huge and there are so many ways to disseminate information, whether it's true or false.  Just remember, people are shitbags and even if something is 90% real, undisputable, this fucking happened you guys truth, you still gotta watch that 10%.

       I now understand the hidden hand of propaganda (Obama posters) and how I allowed myself to support who I now see as "our dear leader". Seeing Michelle Obama present the entertainment industry's highest award to a CIA propaganda movie, surrounded by human military drones (follow orders like a drone) only shows how deep we've allowed ourselves to be tricked.

       Most people are brainless zombies stuck in a left-right paradigm. I come from more of a libertarian standpoint and most of my conversations with 'hardcore liberals' or 'hardcore conservatives' go something like this.
Democrat for example:
      </p>
      <p>
       Me: "Dude did you hear about the NDAA that Obama put through, it allows for the government to indefinitely detain anyone for any reason without a trial."
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberal: "Ya well Bush put the patriot act through, Bush is even worse than Obama."
      </p>
      <p>
       Me: "Ya Bush was terrible too, I don't support him either. The patriot act intrudes on our free speech and rights to privacy."
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberal:
       <em>
        Can't comprehend how I could hate both sides. Argument along with all mental functions shut down.
       </em>

       Libertarians might be the worst of all, because they pretend that all that matters is drones, NDAA, etc. and not economic policy. Maybe if you talked about economics, you would see why people vote the way they do.

       And that's why they're not popular. People disagree with all of that shit. But Libertarians don't mention their economic beliefs when they're trying to seem appealing to other people. They just talk about the stuff they know people agree with like drones, NDAA, weed legalization, etc.

       Ah yes liberals love drone strikes. We just love love love drone strikes. You can't go online and find any articles out there by any prominent liberals condemning the drone strikes. Nope. Not a single one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure though if you googled "liberals love drone strikes" you'd get thousands of hits! I'm sure the Gaurdian, the most leftist paper out there LOVE the drone strikes. I'm sure if you watched MSNBC you'd hear nothing but Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes talking about how much they love love love the drone strikes. You'd hear no criticism of this administration ever. Nope. Never.

       The left right paradigm is nowhere near as ridiculous as the false equivalency between the left-right ways of thinking. If you're a libertarian, you are not mind-blowing or someone to be worshiped. What you are is intellectually lazy and unable to understand true nuance.

       Yes we liberals are so thick. We couldn't possibly understand the libertarian position. Amazing how the libertarians have it all figured out. Amazing that the Republicans would ever need to use social issues in order to sell libertarian economic policy if libertarian economic policy is so sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       It must be so wonderful being one of the non brain dead zombies relying on the written works of Ayn Rand and believing in the non-empircal evidence based Austrian school of economics.  Your wisdom just astounds me. How could I be so blind?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevermind that we already had a libertarian president named Herbert Hoover and the social mobility attained by the majority of people in the USA was thanks to the labor movement and FDR and the progressives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Libertarianism is cool today because none of you are old enough to remember what life was like in the depression. Your grandparents need to fear the gays and Mexicans to vote Republican because libertarian economic policy was never that appealing to someone who can remember that era or heard about it from their own parents or grandparents.

       With brainful non-zombies like you out there we are sure to repeat history over and over and over again.

       You couldn't possibly be so naive to blame a global economic depression on a single US president. And I would like a explanation of why you seem to believe that a political party that wishes to end a drug war costing us over 9 billion dollars a year and also wishes to drasticly cut down about 700 billion dollar a year defense budget, could possibly be as economically unaware as you claim. The point of my comment was not to uplift the libertarian party, rather it was to exemplify the mindless support that tends to haunt the left-right paradigm of this country.

       I think it's hilarious that people on the right think that people on the left "worship" Obama. The left is very critical and harsh towards Obama and this things you point out, but it only proves that you live in a bubble if you think people on the left are not critical of this shit.

       Yeah, they took their fingers out of their ears and stopped going LALALALALALALA, right after the election was over. It'd be truly impressive if they were critical when it counts on occasion.

       Lol first off all, im not on the right. I voted for obama in 2008. i was a democrat my whole life. However ive awoken in the last few years to the fact that the left and the right are two sides of the same coin, fueled by the monied interests with their differences only being in the superficial matters or both providing blatantly idiotic answers to real problems. Their stances on the real issues--erosion of civil liberties, foreign policy, endless war, the federal reserve, big food/pharma/banks/etc--are identical
      </p>
      <p>
       And its one thing to criticize Obama and another to realize he is Bush with a better speaking voice and darker skin. And even if you do realize this, this post is intended at the tens of millions who dont.

       That's being very generous to the Republican Party, but it's true from a philosophical perspective. From a practical perspective, we are still far better off than we would have been with Romney / McCain. And it pains me to admit that, because I am not an Obama supporter.

       You may think that, but every candidate that pushes a more extreme agenda before becoming POTUS ultimately ends up getting rerouted into the moderate segment, and ultimately serves the interests of the highest bidders.

       There's no way of knowing how we would be if candidate X had been elected president, because Obama supporters certainly never would have dreamt of him catering to the groups that he has,

       And let's get one thing straught: the President has very little real power in government, and even less power in the world of big banks.

       No, I don't think that. That is objective reality. We have decades of proof. Republicans are the outright thieves. They will steal in front of your face. Democrats are there to play the "good guy" to appease the more intelligent masses, but they all work for the same people.

       I agree that history tends to lean that way, but I believe the current economic and government climate has been so thoroughly compromised that the partisan differences have become mere smokescreen to keep the infighting alive and distract everyone from the fact that the duopoly serves to fuck the majority of us over.

       Confirmation bias all over the place today. I'm sure McCain would have appointed Elizabeth Warren to head the Senate Banking committee. What's that? la la la I can't hear you! It sucks when life is more complicated than this silly good vs evil illuminati control all paradigm world view you have there.

       Reality may be more complex than how it is portrayed in the mainstream media, but it is also far more complex than any simplistic conspiracy theory would have you believe.

       President Obama has turned out to he nothing like campaign Obama. I have a feeling McCain would have been the same. Although Obama is definitely a far better puppet than McCain would have been in regards to how reasonable and progressive he seems. Just the fact of being Black alone makes it pretty easy to call you racist for criticizing him. Im sure his ''masters' are pleased.

       The
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       criticisms of Obama haters you've acknowledged here are social conservatism-based ones, as if that's the only reason people oppose right-wing people. You don't acknowledge that there are very good, economic-based reasons why people oppose right-wing people. In a way, that's disingenuous propaganda. And if someone
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       point out that racism is part of it, right-wing people are like "See! That's your only argument and it's wrong!", which is a pure lie. If you were more honest, you would concede that accusations of racism are legitimate and have a place in the dialogue. I don't know how you can admit that racism is a motivation and in the same breath dismiss all accusations out of hand.

       Yeah because you never see anything racist about Obama on the internet and the internet and media is so lacking in criticism of this president. I mean..it's like he never ever ever gets criticized ever. And it's like nobody ever ever says racists things about him ever.

If the masters had that much power I wonder how this could even exist on the internet. Yuo know I didn't have to sign up for anything to read this? Or go through any hurdles. I just logged onto my computer and here I was, on r/conspiracy. The biggest circljerk of self-righteous smugness on the entire internet.

       In the US, you have a handful of media conglomerates who share the network of information hubs. That's your tv, movies, radio, newspapers, publishing houses, and internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       These companies are largely multinational and they don't really care about the state of the US as long as they can profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They play both sides against each other via partisan wedges. It's meant to divide &amp; conquer. You keep people split instead of united, you can make a lot of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       FOX isn't conservative. They're corporate. Same with all the other outlets. Bill Maher &amp; HBO, work for Time Warner. John Stewart &amp; Stephen Colbert, work for Viacom. All these networks are in collusion to game the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of how big they are, they can control the scope of information and ideas shared.
      </p>
      <p>
       This takes away the public voice, installs the cororate voice, and next thing you know, everyone is buying their shit.

       I dont think i made my distinction clear enough. I agree with your statement that everyone thinks they know it all, but it seems generally the republicans have a "belief" based ideology while the liberals have a "scientific" ideology.  thus the liberals think that they are the epitome of logic and reason and anyone who questions them or presents the idea of a conspiracy is an ignorant believer in superstition.

       I think the secret is small government. Anytime you start up an "agency" of any kind it's sole purpose will become to grow and make itself unremoveable. I have no problems paying for education, roads, fire departments, police, hospitals, etc. But, I would do it through private industry. Who is more efficient at dealing with money? A private company or the Government? Look at the quality of private schools vs. public.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing the Government should exist for is: national defense, international treaties, issuing money (and maybe ... just maybe... national infrastructure like highways and bridges). Otherwise, I think that all the functions that Government is currently doing could be handled more efficiently by private companies. [This would also create millions of jobs!]
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that we need to get money out of politics. Scatter the lobbyists to the wind and eliminate bribery and graft. Elections should be like the UK -- all candidates get like 6 weeks to campaign and have the same budget. All politicians should get a (minimal) fixed salary and be held accountable for all their expenses. You go into politics to serve the public, not get rich. There should also be strict term limits on all politicians.

       Public education could be a 1000x better, especially in lower income areas where schools are being shut because there's no budgets for them.

       The US being a capitalist country has this perception that rich private schools or Ivy League universities are the best and worth the insane tuition costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could do better. Wealth distribution and across the board education guidelines can teach kids everywhere the same curricullum. Plus, if textbooks were set up as open sources, teachers groups and other academics can create the content collectively so there's no bias in the information. Basically wikipedia but with better standards for accuracy.

       You don't want sick people in your country. They cost a lot of money. If you keep people healthy, they're making money. There will always be people who do need resources and help and the system is designed to make sure they get better, or get jobs and stay off welfare or out of hospitals or prisons.

       The secret of secrets is monetary reform.  Who controls the printing of money, and how does it get into the hands of the people?  We could have a monetary system controlled and passed through the hands of those at the top (like we have now) or move to a more decentralized system, where various forms of money are created at many different levels.  We'll never be free from corruption as long as an elite class gets privileged access to wealth generation.

       I no longer care about who the leaders are as to it only matters what they do and to me they are all chasing the same goals. More money for them and their puppet masters and more control over the population to exploit people and resources.

       Agreed. I think the media and government
       <em>
        purposely
       </em>
       turn it into an "us vs them" thing, with everything. It's to keep the population fighting about menial shit like abortion and gay marriage, while the important stuff they
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be talking about come election time is just background noise. Abortion and gay marriage are emotional issues, which is why they're so effective at dividing people.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what i can tell, if the media wasn't spewing bullshit into their heads on a daily basis, most 'conservative' Americans would be happy with the freedom to go to the range at the weekend and live their fucking lives. In fact i think that's what most people want - just to get on with their lives without interference from others. But the media is constantly telling people that everyone is out to get them, that there is danger around every corner, that the conservatives want you to do
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       , and the libs want to force you to do
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       - over and over.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tell you what, if we ever come out of the other side of all this bullshit, i'll be the first one on the boat to the US. I wanna live in a small town near some mountains and shoot metal targets all day long, without having to worry about some fuckheads ruining the world for the rest of us. I can dream.

       Name the last war that was worth fighting. We entered ww1, ww2, vietnam, and the iraq war based completely on lies. We had no reason to fight any of those wars. The cold war was simply a pissing contest over who can gain the most nukes; weve been at war for something like 218 years out of 235 as a country. Is it possible that there could be a war worth fighting for? Maybe, big maybe. But none of the wars in the last century could even come near worthy of that maybe.

       The bankers and oil execs know exactly what they are doing. They will milk oil as long as they know they can and then they will move to water (already are actually) or just continue to make us give them money for endless war. Theyre far from stupid, and theyre time will absolutely not come if we continue on the current path.

       It could be argued that US involvement in WW2 worked out well for the allied European forces, but helping them was just a convenient excuse to get into the war, as well as Pearl Harbor of course.

       Honestly, the last war i can think of that was fought for real moral reasons was the revolutionary war. My American history isn't the greatest though, so anyone feel free to correct me.

       I am fairly certain the revolutionary war was the only war worth fighting for. But we were fighting againt tyranny, oppression, and banks. Now we ARE the tyranny, oppression and banks. This country has become the cornerstorne for every thing it fought against 200 years ago. If our founding fathers were alive today, they'd be on a kill list or in gitmo.

       Non-liberal or complex? Dumbing down the conversation to heros and villains is just as bad as worshipping a politician in belief that they will solve all our problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has done many liberal things. He has done many conservative things. He is the president of the United States. In a country split almost 50/50 conservative and liberal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The president is not a dictator and can not act without congress and cannot stay in power without people voting for him and people can't vote for someone if their message is not heard, etc etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might make you feel better to live in a world of absolute evils and absolute goods and an American government where the president can do anything he wants without looking at polling data, without having to go through congress etc etc but that is not the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I have yet to meet a liberal who worshipos Obama. Maybe some who feel sorry for him or like him as a person but I have never met anyone, or read anythying in any liberal newspaper, or even heard and MSNBC correspondent who has not criticized him when he moves to the right on issues. I do remember people getting death threats after 9/11 like Margaret Cho etc for criticizing Bush and being told that criticism of the president is un-American. I have never seen liberals refuse to criticize this president or blindly follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe liberals voted for him for a second time around for various complex reasons. Maybe they didn't like the idea of another ground war with Iran. Or a conservative supreme court justice tilting the balance even further to the right or someone who would green light the hack and slash Republican budget. You know, because budgets affect real human people living on the margins of society and living in the suburbs.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's awesome you're not a sheeple and see things so clearly that you can be so smug but I would bet you are probably in your late teens to early 20's and you connect with conspiracies because they make you feel superior to those who don't. They make you feel like you know things that others don't.  But 80% of what you read here is just fear mongering for page views. Things to get you riled up and passionate.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah I'm sorry that I'm a sheeple liberal who voted for Obama and that must mean that I have a statue of him in my room and I pray to him everyday for guidance and that I never criticize or get angry or post anything critical of him on Reddit etc. I wish I was smart enough to vote for Ron Paul that cool 80 year old guy with those mind blowing ideas about how if he was president he could fix everything by getting rid of everything. I wish I was smart enough and young enough and lacking in historical perspective to buy his bullshit and comeo n

       I think this is a ridiculously important point that is just being
       <em>
        completely
       </em>
       ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was the left loud and obnoxious during Bush's two terms? Yes. And justifiably so. Are they less so now? Yes.
       <em>
        But there is still plenty of criticism coming from the "left" of Obama.
       </em>
       Even from that alleged Obama water-carrier, MSNBC. (Sure, there is a lot of stuff they ignore, and if you are critical of the state from a leftist perspective, tons to be desired, but watch Up on a weekend morning. There is some super critical stuff on there.)
      </p>
      <p>
       OTOH, I don't remember all of these principled "libertarians" and "Tea Party" types standing up and complaining when Bush was dramatically expanding the scope of executive power, and bailing out the banks. But the instant the black guy shows up, it's go time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen plenty of people who consider themselves "loyal party Democrats" grumble. Maybe in private, but they are grumbling. There are lots and lots and lots of people on the far left who range from upset to furious.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the option was Mitt Fucking Romney. Jesus Horatio Christ. Democrats would have lined up to vote for Richard Nixon over that guy (who, actually, was further left than Obama is).

       Also, what you said about liberals being dumber than conservatives... I feel liberals biggest flaw is their arrogance in how dumb conservatives are.When in reality conservatives know how to control people's emotions much better than liberals do.

       Today's Liberals/Democrats in America are right-wing. The Conservatives/Republicans are just farther right. Eventually this constant move to the right will lead to the growth of a newer and stronger left wing party... I hope.

       Freedom from government is a conservative thing i thought. And freedom from banks, I was under the impression that was liberal. Edit- I see what you mean, but take in to cosideration the similarities between Occupy and the Tea party movements. Anti ndaa, and federal reserve. Kinda funny the things both extremes agree on are some of the most pressing issues.

       Small government is still a conservative thing. Your point shows the true hypocrisy of those who claim to be conservatives but really aren't. Social conservatism has been replaced with religious fundamentalism.  The most conservative and the most liberal are for the decriminalization of marijuana for the most part. Colorado and Washington are't the most liberal or conservative states, they have both, yet the both legalized weed because they seem to understand that liberal and conservative ideas can compliment each other when applied correctly.

       This is my point. Just more evidence no movement is without both left and right values. They may have been anti-big government but they share that in common with libertarians. Only when the left and right admit each others strengths and weakness will we finally start to have non partisanship.

       The political philosophy of the so-called "founding fathers" was classical liberalism (esp. Locke), enriched with a good deal of conservative anthropology (Macchiavelli, Hobbes) and a little bit of classical Republicanism.

       As a life-long democrat, I accept that having a moderate Republican in the WH is the best I can get. Obama's a disappointment in many respects because he still, at the end of the day, is a hawk on defense and very friendly to the biggest businesses. But when you look at Cruz and Palin and Ryan and Boehner and McConnell and Perry and the rest of the GOP far right who completely and totally eat sleep breathe and shit service to the Koch brothers and the other .001% who insist on cutting back or even eliminating the minimum wage, destroying labor unions, privatizing social security and the post office, and generally dismantling everything accomplished by the New Deal and the Great Society, I'll take it. Tens of millions of us will take it and that's why he was reelected.

       What's your suggestion for an alternative? Ralph Nader? Ron Paul? In the real world if you want to keep Palin or Ryan or Romney out of the WH, Clinton and Obama are the only way to go. Now you can bitch about that all you want, but it won't change that obvious truth.

       Splitting the Democratic Party rolls out the red carpet for all the Michelle Bachmann's of the world so it can't be done. Dems must hold together and they are. There's clearly a greater chance of the GOP splitting with the business-minded old guard going one way and the so-called movement conservative Christians going another. If they lose again in 2016 and can't grab the Senate, it might just happen.

       Are you sure it's the media or your interpretation of the media? I would love to see an example of the media, the lamestream media, (CNN, ABC, NBC) implying that peopo who don't support Obama are all those things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think some people don't support Obama for legitimate reasons. Others for political reasons. Others because they are racist, and others because it's cool to be against whoever is in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Barring all that when I read criticism of Obama i never see nuance, I always see black and white thinking. The CIA is operating a drones program and he is letting it happen. So that = Obama is an evil droning warlord dictator. Obama isn't being transparent on issues that could have national security implications = most non-transparent president ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, Obama doesn't start ground war in Syria = Obama is a pussy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe Obama to be evil you are just as idiotic as the people who "worship" him.

       Life is not black and white. People are not black and white. Government is not black and white.

       I guess the point I'm trying to make is that you're limiting yourself just as much as the people you're talking about when you say, "life isn't black and white".  Sometimes it is.  Sometimes there are heroes and villains.

       This is ridiculous.  I don't know any liberals who are for all those things.  One or two, maybe, but it varies and there is no consistency.  Most liberals I know are against many if not all of them.

       You forgot that all of these oppressive, violent and often inhumane activities are often in favour by the most religious people. Religion flies planes into buildings. Personally, I think politics is the entertainment division of the military industrial complex (Frank Zappa's words).
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is there is virtually no difference in the politics of the two ends (blue or red) of the American voting spectrum who have any real chance of winning (see
       <a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org">
        www.politicalcompass.org
       </a>
       for more information). This duality is occurring in Canada too. The conservatives consolidated a decade ago and have been in power ever since. The liberals and socialist party here need to do the same to have a fighting chance. It is interesting to note this duality may be the best way to run a business, long term. For example Coke and Pepsi. They prefer to compete with the devil they know. It is almost impossible for any global player to compete with these two giants today.
      </p>
      <p>
       This type of government manufactured "mind fuck" propaganda is a growing type of global control mechanism (see
       <a href="http://youtu.be/cfE-oo7r7RI">
        http://youtu.be/cfE-oo7r7RI
       </a>
       to see this explained) and is the modern day equivalent to slavery. Sadly, humanity has outgrown their need for this control mechanism due to literacy, education, science and the internet; however, most of humanity are not aware of this
       <strong>
        yet

       What you have noticed is both parties have adorned themselves with labels they created.
       <br/>
       Conservative.. nothing conservative about the GOP.   Liberal, as the poster says this is a farce.
       <br/>
       We need to change the dialog, when we talk about these people we need to remove the shroud of their labels and have real conversations, on a national level.

       I think there is a large misunderstanding between what is left and what is right.  There is a lot more than these two super undefined spectrum. Most people truly on the left don't even consider democrats or liberals to even be on the left.  The left is anti-capitalism and the right the opposite.  But then there is the top (authoritarian) and the bottom (libertarian).  I myself are part of the libertarian left, which is the exact opposite of the typical left people think of in Stalin and Mao..etc.

       Vote third party next time. Voting "for the lesser evil" is only perpetuating the same behavior. Granted, no third party candidate is going to ever get elected but Obama is a perfect example of how presidents campaign on the controversial issues and then fall in with the 'agenda' once they actually get elected. Mccain would have been the same as Obama is now if he got elected. Presidential opinion, even if they WERE benevolent to begin with (which i doubt) doesnt really effect what they end up doing; the billions from the big corps do. Honestly im pretty convinced no repub or demo candidate even gets to nominee without vowing beforehand to protect the monied interests if they get elected. We at least need to show we arent playing the game anymore. And if 3rd party candidates start getting significant support maybe they will start getting more attention and people will realize there ARE more options that red and blue.

       The student has become enlightened. Unfortunately you are one of the few to objectively step back and realize what you bought into was mostly a lie. It may be the lesser of two evils in some sense but that is about all one could say positive about the current Democratic party. Honestly, unless you are in the top 1%, we all lose. We keep falling for it though, so we have no one to blame but ourselves.

       I was from the other side, saw liberals and democrats as the same... Then I started to feel like it was deciding whether it hurt less to be run over by a red car or blue car. I then started seeing everyone "party loyal" as statists. 
I started seeing less difference between "classic liberal" and "true conservative".
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, I feel most people are dumb sheeple being led by their favored brand of (party) charisma. I've come to believe, there are likely many "conservatives" that aren't Republican, as there are many "liberals" that aren't really Democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully, gentlemen like Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul standing together on opposite sides of the "fence " made me realize they aren't all the same, though the parties are.

       Because it led me to seek answers, to educate myself, to seek truth. As my eyes were opened, I began to realize that the actions of the government, however well intentioned, seem to achieve opposite results, even without corruption (though we know how corrupt it is). I disliked the hypocrisy in democrats and republicans, that seemed to have conflicting views. Pro-life but pro-death penalty, A woman's body is her own to chose abortion, but not to chose to protect her self with a gun, etc. My principles always leaned towards freedom, but I didn't have a deep understanding why.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started reading. I learned the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle">
        Non-agression principle
       </a>
       . I suppose I liked it because it was a more unifying idea. I agree with the idea of self ownership.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started reading about economics, specifically Austrian economics. I came to see the problems with government, taxes, the FED, etc. I came to embrace the free market rather than trust government to know what's best.

       It saddens me when I see someone like you because y'all think there's only three options. You're either a Democrat, a Republican, or a Libertarian. You see the government as separate from the people. You don't see the logic of social contract theory. You only read Libertarian literature, not things that challenge your beliefs, only things that reinforce them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your beliefs are really worth a damn, they should be able to withstand reading
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Haymarket-Chicago-Movement-Bombing/dp/1400033225">
        this book

        this book
       </a>
       . If you're truly looking for answers, you should read those. You're caught in the triopoly mindset. But there's more than three ways.

       People only care about economics, mattgrimes. I'm really tired of this kind of shitty reasoning from Libertarians, though. We don't have any other options. It's two parties, so people just go with the lesser evil. They're really not that enthusiastic about it.

       If A, B, C, and D are running for office.  Lets say the voting population is 100 people.  Candidate A receives 23 votes.  Candidate B receives 23 votes.  Candidate C receives 23 votes.  Candidate D receives 31 votes.  Candidate D wins but still only representing the ideals of 31% of the U.S. population.

       The problem is that you don't understand how the system can be different so that the situation you describe isn't problematic. In a parliamentary democracy, those candidates would have to form a ruling COALITION, with different groups making concessions in order to agree to work together.

       Of course I have..but we're not talking about other countries.  We're talking about America.  We're different from pretty much every other country in the world in that we are a melting pot.  We have many different cultures and ideals and religions and ethnicities all trying to live together.  That's what makes us the assholes we are.  We all think we're right and we're never really open to compromise.  It just wouldn't work here.

       I also love your "First of all" point that it works in almost every other country in the world.  I don't know your beliefs on universal healthcare, but that too works in just about every other country in the world but you see how well the idiotd in this country are taking to it....

       A melting pot has absolutely nothing to do with it. In a more parliamentary democracy (which we can turn our government into) factions
       <em>
        have

       to compromise or they won't govern. It's as simple as that. It's impossible for multi-party parliamentary democracy to not work. It always works.

       you're a troll-shill, OP didn't say he was a republican...how about a third party or fourth party up in the mix like France's system? is that really too far fetched to believe?...what he mentioned wasn't a conspiracy its the truth, Obama has a poor track record on drone strikes, mishandling the Benghazi hostage crises, and he's still got our boys in Afghanistan. We must continue to criticize our leaders in every capacity; no matter the party. I don't give a fuck if the rainbows-and-lemonade party wins the 2016 election I'm still going to call them out on their fuck-ups, its our job as Americans to keep pushing for TRANSPARENCY; freedom of speech is our RIGHT

       well, let's be fair, right? as someone who would describe myself as you would - I agree, for the most part.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think there is a significant difference between the language and attitude used by the GOP and the Dems, obviously. I don't think you'd have to be racist to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       support Obama, however, I think only a racist moron could justify supporting
       <em>
        Romney
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not Obama backs up his rhetoric is irrelevant (as is why) to the consideration, given the rhetoric the GOP provides.
       <em>
        Should
       </em>
       we gut the budget to improve our debt situation to improve the economy, or should we focus on jobs? Anyone that isn't a disingenuous asshole knows the obvious answer to that question. Yet you have a party whose entire platform is based on such purposeful deceit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can choose the guy that has sensible rhetoric and try and force him towards the policies you want, or you can chose the guy that is obviously lying with a smile on his face. Of course, I'm of the impression that if liberals actually held Obama to even the slightest standard of liberalism, we might see different policies. I agree that most Liberals are too dumb to realize what's going on, but I don't think there is actual equivalency between the GOP and the dems, or Obama and any of the GOP.

       honestly, can you even fucking read?

       Why does pointing out that Obama is distinct from the GOP mean I support him? Why would the concepts be mutually exclusive otherwise?
      </p>
      <p>
       Really - if you can't do the math to at least understand the differences between Obama and Romney - what kind of false equivalency are you forcing yourself into? Are you supporting a paradigm of objectivity or are you jumping to conclusions based upon the fact that Obama is a democrat? You really don't seem to understand that I haven't even pegged him as remotely good, just obviously less retarded than the GOP. Try and think

       Well, you'd do a better job at suggesting how I don't make sense by addressing the example of the economy I've provided.

       Yes, this is one of the things I point out. But if you measure where they match up to their rhetoric, the difference becomes even more obvious.
       <em>
        Even if
       </em>
       Obama doesn't match up to his rhetoric a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is most obvious in the example of the economy that you
       <strong>
        still
       </strong>
       refuse to address. You can't cite your point from evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Romney doesn't talk a good game? Then why did so many people vote for him? If they didn't like Obama, why didn't they vote for any other candidate, seeing as Romney was such a bad talker? Romney was a great talker, it just happened to be that the things he says are generally offensive to most of the population. But he really gets straight to the heart of rich white guys. They love his talking. They loved the 47% quote. Heck, you are completely letting Romney's policies off the hook while pointing out exactly why I'm right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Romney
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       do what he said.
       <em>
        That's
       </em>
       the problem with him and the GOP. That's significantly different from campaigning on sensible economic policies that you aren't able to achieve due to a group of unprecedented legislative impediments. No I'm not making any excuses for Obama's shortcomings in terms of war policies, of which he is terrible, but the policies still fall short of what Romney actually
       <em>
        advocated
       </em>
       for.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry that you can't do math!

       so are you saying that isn't a list of promises kept by Obama? It's 13 pages long. What does it matter if he created bureaucracies, that was neither of our points? You simply said that Obama hasn't kept any of his promises which is an obvious outright lie. Once again, stop mixing up facts with your emotions.

       10 times worse? Not to me. I would say some are a little worse in a sense because they think they are 'enlightened' for figuring out that everyone has the right to marriage and that women are going to get pregnant and terminate pregnancies regardless of the law, but they only have 1/4th  the story, as does the right . Ive grown a soft spot for republicans because they favor smaller government and (most) have a boner for the constitution, even if i dont agree with some other ideologies. Everyone on r/pol, r/atheism, etc hate on republicans all the time though so i felt it necessary to point out the dumbassery of the liberals as well. But its important to note that the division of the nation is the biggest problem; i dont align with either side and i think if people could just wake up to the fact that were all being played we might actually be able to change something.

       A system that chooses no winners and losers is inherently harder to corrupt. I love how liberals think that if there isn't this enormous government presence in society everyone will be physically incapable of getting off their asses and doing something collectively about what they think is wrong with the world. It's like you're still in elementary school and you need the school to organize when lunch time is. I bet we could figure it out.
