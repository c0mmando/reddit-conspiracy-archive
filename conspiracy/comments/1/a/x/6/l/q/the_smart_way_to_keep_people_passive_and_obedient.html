       Just because he doesn't consider such conspiracy theories important, doesn't mean he should be ignored, or is part of the establishment.

       Your narrow focus on injustice extends mainly to American victims. Chomsky is focussed on the injustice that America inflicts on "the unpeople".

       He's pretty strongly against the idea. I think what the commenter is trying to say is that this statement from Chomsky is kinda ironic compared to his closed views on the 9/11 truth movement.

       Chomsky is not shocked by this sort of false flag event, etc.  It's part of his central thesis about how powerful institutions behave.  If you understand what he's talking about you an see that it's really not that important.

       Exactly, I think that he knows that 9/11 is way more than just fishy, but it still really doesn't matter, it's just a one big distraction. Even if it is true that the U.S. government is directly or indirectly involved in 9/11, it would be extremely hard to prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       That deflects away a lot of people's attention to a subject that may very well never be fully exposed as long as the current system is in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, people should focus their attention to the all the problems that are known to be there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainly to the fact that mo matter whether it is caused by malice, stupidity or greed, the people who are currently in power all over the world are by definition extremely incompetent and should be removed as soon as possible. By removed, I mean nothing more than that, removed from their position of power, any further measures are not up to a man to decide.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this context, I would define competence of the world's leaders as the ability to act in the interest of the human kind and the planent in both present time and the future, at that, the majority of them fail, and fail miserably.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, they are incompetent and should be removed, we can't sustain this anymore even if we wanted to.

       I know, that's why I specified the meaning in this case. To put it into simpler words, it doesn't really matter that much whether they are doing that willingly or because they're stupid, the most important thing is the fact that they are doing it wrong.

      <p>
       I actually agree with Chomsky on 9/11 on conspiracy theories in general. His dismissal of 9/11 theories is actually quite eloquent in both reasons and consequences. It comes down to scientific illiteracy of the people involved in disseminating these theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can look at WTC 7 youtube videos for minute details that we can't explain (and once one is explained, just move on to the next one). All the while even if we replicated the whole thing as a
       <em>
        controlled experiment we would not be able to explain everything
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is the case of any empirical experiments of complex enough phenomena. Why do you think people still have to fling cars at concrete obstacles at 40 mph to find out what happens to them? And now people expect a much more complex aircraft strike at a building to be explained completely?
      </p>
      <p>
       If 9/11 was a government op, Chomsky would be the first to say so. He's devoted a large portion of his life to uncover what kind of evil stuff the US operations have done.

       Although I wouldn't put it out of the realms of what elites would stoop to, false flags and the like clearly have occurred it just seems that the populace can be riled up to a necessary degree without going to such extreme lengths.

       Bilderberg isn't even a conspiracy theory anymore. Politicians that attend now openly admit it. Still, nobody has any idea what goes on there because

       They have released some minutes from it, of course looking like normal stuff. Their argument is that they need time outside of the public spotlight to discuss policy, but that is and of itself is a conspiracy. If we truly lived in high income, developed, republic states, then everything elected leaders should be constant supervision of the general public. Any meeting in secrete, between any world leaders, is really unacceptable.

       I've often felt that as politicians struggle to tear down our privacy, so we should have more access to their lives. Corruption would dissipate pretty quickly if we had access to watch the comings and goings of our public servants via internet video. I mean, we pay their salaries, shouldn't we be allowed some nanny cams?

       DING DING DING.  Go with that - it's a fucking winner.

       One of my favorite ideas is to drug test congress.  This has been suggested in various ways numerous times.  It's a winner - push this idea as much as you can.  It's not about making them piss in a cup, although that is fun, it's about demonstrating exactly what you're talking about.  The slippery slope is there and this is a way to draw attention to the issue in a very effective way.

       It's not just unacceptable.  It's illegal.  Politicians cannot meet and discuss matters concerning their positions and the public in secret.  It's really bat shit crazy that the media ignores the situation and the public has little outrage except bitching about it in forums.  I'm guilty of the latter as well.

       Are you kidding? If I was a world leader would I really want every idiotic idea I came up with posted for all to see? Or for people to start thinking that all the shit ideas I came up with, and then later rejected (perhaps with the help/insight of the other leaders) as being shit, to be spread around to the general public as being a good idea?

       There are reasons to discuss things in private, no matter who one is, besides working towards evil and corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I'm not saying Bilderberg isn't evil and corrupt or anything. Hell, I don't know crap about it. I'm just saying that not everyone who wants to hold a private meeting with someone else, or a group of someones, is doing so to work towards the downfall of civilization and thus needs to be exposed for the cretins they are.

       "Here is Bassma Kodmani, seen leaving this year's Bilderberg conference in Chantilly, Virginia."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Kodmani is a member of the executive bureau and head of foreign affairs, Syrian National Council. Kodmani is close to the centre of the SNC power structure, and one of the council's most vocal spokespeople. "No dialogue with the ruling regime is possible. We can only discuss how to move on to a different political system," she declared this week. And here she is, quoted by the newswire AFP: "The next step needs to be a resolution under Chapter VII, which allows for the use of all legitimate means, coercive means, embargo on arms, as well as the use of force to oblige the regime to comply."
      </p>
      <p>
       "This statement translates into the headline "Syrians call for armed peacekeepers" (Australia's Herald Sun). When large-scale international military action is being called for, it seems only reasonable to ask: who exactly is calling for it? We can say, simply, "an official SNC spokesperson," or we can look a little closer."
      </p>
      <p>
       "This year was Kodmani's second Bilderberg. At the 2008 conference, Kodmani was listed as French; by 2012, her Frenchness had fallen away and she was listed simply as "international" – her homeland had become the world of international relations."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Back a few years, in 2005, Kodmani was working for the Ford Foundation in Cairo, where she was director of their governance and international co-operation programme. The Ford Foundation is a vast organisation, headquartered in New York, and Kodmani was already fairly senior. But she was about to jump up a league."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Around this time, in February 2005, US-Syrian relations collapsed, and President Bush recalled his ambassador from Damascus. A lot of opposition projects date from this period. "The US money for Syrian opposition figures began flowing under President George W Bush after he effectively froze political ties with Damascus in 2005," says the Washington Post."
      </p>
      <p>
       "In September 2005, Kodmani was made the executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative (ARI) – a research programme initiated by the powerful US lobby group, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)."
      </p>
      <p>
       "The CFR is an elite US foreign policy thinktank, and the Arab Reform Initiative is described on its website as a "CFR Project" . More specifically, the ARI was initiated by a group within the CFR called the "US/Middle East Project" – a body of senior diplomats, intelligence officers and financiers, the stated aim of which is to undertake regional "policy analysis" in order "to prevent conflict and promote stability". The US/Middle East Project pursues these goals under the guidance of an international board chaired by General (Ret.) Brent Scowcroft."

       Read the full article for the greater context. Its astonishing how a small, well organised group of people can start a war in a country. You get the whole gang mentioned in this article from Kissinger to Richard Perle and William Kristol and more of the same people you see when you actually look into things.

       The only thing interesting about Bilderberg is that it is organization that likely subverts the democratic processes in countries like the US.  Chomsky argues and proves repeatedly that this is par for the course.  It's not remarkable - merely sensational.  And the sensational aspects are highlighted for reasons demonstrated in Chomsky's texts regarding media manipulation.

       Right, this is exactly what Chomsky does. He calls both the CIA and CFR "nothing organizations." He sided with the completely bullshit Warren Commission that there was no conspiracy to assassinate JFK' to do that you have to be either stupid or lying, and Chomsky is certainly not stupid. He's brilliant at drawing progressives away from looking at the "over-the-line" conspiracies that would wake people up to seeing how trul evil the peop n political power are- 9/11, JFK assassination, CIA involvement in the drug trade. He says, "There's absolutely no evidence for any of this, and even if there were it would damage the Left to bring it out." How does that even make sense? It's disengenuous. This isn't just "one thing." It's the events that expose high-level U.S. intelligence to be
       <em>
        Nazis,
       </em>
       which is what they are. Chomsky deftly changes the topic to "institutionalism"; i.e. the institutions are corrupt; it doesn't matter who fills them. He's a snake. We should be more critical. Furthermore, Chomsky's linguistics career was very anti-humanist, and would have been more sharply critiqued from progressives if not for Chomsky's ostensibly left-wing politics.

       Nope, that's an accepted part of the spectrum and that's where the lively debate he talks about occurs.  You're playing the required game as much as the people who believe the official version.

       Give me an example of a statement of 9/11 that's out of the acceptable spectrum then.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me that Chomsky quote means that politicians and the public have been manipulated and coerced into talking about issues without addressing  the heart and true causes of them. In other words the overlap between acceptable public opinion/discourse surrounding a certain issue and speech that substantively addresses and works to create a solution is very small, in some cases nonexistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leaves us in a position where the inertia of the establishment continues to take us further and further from real solutions.

       This. The paranoia of believing that every single opinion is somehow manufactured by the elites is destructive to the truth and real debate. Not everything is a malicious conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This quote is really about the controlled talking points and brainwashing in the mainstream media, not so much about the world of independent media outlets. You only need to control the majority of opinions to dominate society.

       I understand exactly what you are saying but this.... is an entirely different branch of knowledge and philosophy. What you outlined is an extremely common "spiritual" principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is exploring how consciousness influences and is manifested in material reality. Which is something that greatly interests me (and I believe this inherent connectedness makes a lot of stuff possible mainstream science has yet to recognize).
      </p>
      <p>
       But we're talking abut political issues... I think that power structures in general need to, lets see how do I say it, not crowd out people who are open to these principles.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: So what I could say is, an idea outside the acceptable spectrum includes knowledge of the consciousness influence. An idea is acceptable if it operates as if this influence isn't real (it is) and that's how it perpetuates faulty power structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just my take on it. It's one I actually agree with.

       There is enough evidence for human consciousness directly affecting the 3D reality we find ourselves in but I will put forward something that's even further outside the acceptable spectrum which would be something like this:
The universe, given it can be a highly elaborate 'computer' simulation (as some scientists are now studying to find out if that's the true nature of Reality), has outside influence on events within it and events such as those that happened on 9/11 happened as a result of programs that were installed/initiated for some purpose that is currently beyond us.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just an example to illustrate that even the movement for 9/11 truth is operating within a sort of limiting spectrum with regards to the wider horizon of Reality that we as humans are only beginning to scratch the surface of. With 7 billion people on the planet and many of them still believing it was created by sky gods it's not difficult to see why we can't come to some basic agreement as to what Reality is, where/how it originates, and what is the purpose of it all, if any.

       i get worked up when people talk about gay rights and marijuana legalization like they're the most important issues.  while they're certainly more important issues than who kim kardashian is fucking this week or what emma stone wore to the oscars, they're not as important as the
       <em>
        REAL
       </em>
       issues... why do we let the FED print our money and loan it to us?  why do we support everything Israel does?  Why do we want to invade Iran?  why are we still at war with iraq and afghanistan?  why did Obama pass the NDAA and extend the PATRIOT act?  why does the DHS need 1.6 billion rounds of hollow point ammo?  why do they need 2,600 light armored tanks?  what's up with building 7?  bilderberg?  the CFR?
      </p>
      <p>
       these are questions that NEED to be asked, and these are the questions that get almost no attention from the mainstream media, Fox or MSNBC alike.

       Building 7 is another building that collpased due to being next to two burning towers, catching fire itself. Usually thrown around by the 'BUT IT WAS ALL EXPLOSIVEWISASDKL' parts of the 9/11 theory.

       sorry, I mean 'Truthers' care to explain why the hell the government would feel the need to blow down a smaller building that nobody cares about. Did 'EVIL AND EIVILZCOSADFAJSDLKFMa'  buy too much explosive, so decided to 'Fuck it, we'l blow something else down as well just for the hell of it!'.

       In the interests of intellectual honesty, you might want to look purely at the evidence, and avoid speculation about "why" or "who", as these questions cannot be answered reliably at this point. Evidence however cannot be refuted.
I highly recommend following up with experts on the issue of Building 7 and the collapse of the towers:

       A: It's a youtube link. Frankly with the amount of shit youtube links this subreddit posts, I'm not even going to bother looking at it. If there's a text version fully sourced and the like then maybe I will.
      </p>
      <p>
       B: The Why and Who are just as important in this kind of situation. The number of possible answers for such a situation is infinite. For instance it could have been caused by me brushing my teeth, which angered the tiny race of aliens that control the moon, who attacked the WTC in retaliation by crashing into it with a unicorn.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that the why is just as important, and where 9/11 falls short so many times. Why would the government spend the additional resources and complexity to destroy a building that has ZERO advantages. It wasn't like the American public was all like 'Well before Building 7 fell I was all like... Meh, but now we should go invade everyone!.'

       I don't have to prove shit, I know that Bilderberg exists. Wearechange has done numerous interviews of attendees and they all openly admit to attending. Building 7 went down like a controlled demolition. If you are seriously dumb enough to not acknowledge that these things exist, you are shutting out reality.

       My favorite fluoride theory doesn't involve pseudoscience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluoride is not a mind control agent, but it is an industrial waste product that the aluminum industry lobbied to get added to the water. They turned an expensive to dispose of waste product that was classified as an environmental toxin into a profitable revenue stream. Diluted in low concentrations, it doesn't cause any major health problem.

I have not researched this topic a lot but I would think that something that originally has negative health effects for humans would build up over time in our "low dose concentrations" why do people automatically think that just because something is "safe in low doses" should be in all of our water?

       I didn't say it should be in our water. I didn't say it doesn't cause any problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just trying to stick with the facts. All of the studies that have documented evidence about negative effects of consuming fluoride, such as bone fluorosis, have shown that these problems are not observed at very low concentrations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Major heath problems
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       show up at higher concentrations. And yes, that should be cause for concern and additional long-term studies.

       It might not cause serious problems at very low concentrations but we are exposed to it everyday. tap water used for cooking, shower, toothpaste and so on. we are talking decades of exposure here. It can't possibly not have an effect on human health.

       If Fluoride had major health benefits there is no way it would be added to the water at virtually zero cost.

       It just doesn't make sense in a capitalist society like the US to do something so benevolent.

       lol what a goofball.   You're no different than religious people who like to throw around the word "science" because they think it gives them credability, without actually knowing the signifigance of it.
  So do people like u who hear about things that fall outside their monkey conditioning; "science doesn't say these things r bad",  when in fact u very likely have no clue what science says on these issues.

       Scientific evidence supports the idea that fluoride leads to lower IQs, but fewer cavaties. There is no evidence supporting the chemtrail theory, other than photos of clouds. There has been no readings of barium or aluminium, (or any other of the supposed chemicals poisoning us).

       If you point out the fact that Jews are wildly overrepresented in politics, finance, and the media, you're an anti-semite according to all "right thinking" people.

       boards, and 90% of the content is accusing religious people of being hate filled bigots, or anything that is anti-religious in nature. Anytime a religious person try to defend themselves they get downvoted to oblivioin.
      </p>
      <p>
       So being the open-minded person I am I go to the Islamic boards and Christian boards, and these people are actually talking about stuff... it's not a circle-jerk. I didn't see anything hateful or bigoted. Rather ironic... anyways that was just my rant...

       Maybe, and it is very hard to do on Reddit, let's get back to square one, people just downvote with respect to the opinion in the first place, which is deeply wrong already. Votes should measure insight&lt;-&gt;spam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously though, I don't think Reddit want to keep this idea, they want market of opinions and not discussion, for instance, this subreddit is
       <em>
        very hard
       </em>
       to control, they won't feel a thing if this subreddit vanishes.

       Here's one for you: the US government knew about the 9/11 attacks in advace and used it to their advantage. rumsfield was on camera on 9/10 stating the pentagon was missing 2.3 trillion dollars. The next day, a plane conviently crashes into accounting wing of the pentagon building... however the government still has to do something about these terrorists. So they flex a bicep and send troops overseas, thinking a war with cave-dwelling goat herders would end within a year.

       Not all information is created equal. I could type random gibberish and that would not be as helpful to your or anyone's understanding of anything as if I were to put forth my honest opinion of a situation.

       We can't possibly take in everything, anyway. We filter things down to what is most useful. And hope that others learn the things we don't have time to know.

       Socialist or Libertarian, i would argue that both our ideologies are outside of this spectrum, but still so opposed to each other that we will see the other side as part of it. This is why a revolution would fail, lots of angry people, angry over the same stuff (drones, DHS, 911 whether an inside job or just abused as a cause, crony capitalism) but we see different solutions and would just as soon fight each other once the establishment is gone. Too much division. Both are called crazy and extreme by the mainstream, i would argue that socialists probably have slightly more mainstream support, but its irrelevant. We could knock the current shit down then peacefully form 2 systems side by side, splitting the country/world, highly unlikely though, people would get power hungry. AnCap here if you hadnt figured it out already.

       Angry people are not the kind of people who can lead a revolution. Anger is just an emotion that has no power. People have to suffer a lot more before there's even a chance of revolution because revolution is the final choice. For a successful revolution (as in, one that brings some actual change, not necessarily one where the rebels win), enough of the rebels must care more about their ideals than their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, it's definitely not likely that you could split two systems side by side with completely different ideals. That's just not how the tribal mind works, unfortunately. They have to be much more isolated than that.

       I disagree about the anger, peoples ideals being destroyed makes them angry, but not pure anger. Reasoned, meaningful, directed anger that is controlled to some degree by rationality. My point was mainly that the would be revolutionaries are too split ideologically either way. Only way it would happen is if one side became popular enough on its own to cause it, many of the users of this sub, for example, might be willing in theory but just too much division. You would have to get a huge percentage of the nation behind one ideolgical banner, not going to happen imo. At least in the next 10 years or so. Not willing to guess beyond that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways i think the anger you are speaking of is a few radicals blowing up a building or two, which could only hurt any real chance of one happening, so yeah unrestrained stupid anger isnt enough.

       Even talk of building 7 or Bilderberg is allowable because it reinforces the power structure.  As far as gvts and big money are concerned, as long as you accept that they are in charge, it enables them to get away with more and more.  There is nothing discussed in today's general society that is not within the extreme limits set.  Even in the realms of science, philosophy and belief thoughts are limited.  For instance, string theory, this is a popular theory for the Big Bang.  The Big Bang part of this theory states that when two universes come into contact with each other, another universe is created.  So far not one person has said "okay, so where did the two universes that made ours come from, and which was the first one and how did that exist?"
      </p>
      <p>
       By far the best is the so called use of logic in determining there is no God.  Okay, so let's use logic.  At the very start of the universe was a Big Bang, if this Big Bang did not have the precise energy that was emitted the universe would be very different and you would not exist, also if the very first particles that combined to become this planet had not combined at exactly the time they combined this planet would be different and you would not exist, this goes for every particle that helped this planet come into being, all must have happened precisely as it did, else you would not exist.  Then all the chemicals that make up this planet would have to have been precisely the same and came into being precisely when they did, a mere second out of synch and the planet would be different and you would not exist.  Next the life forms, from the very first single called creature that was yours and my deepest ancestor must have came into being at exactly the time it did, every split and cell death of the billions and billions of these single called creatures must have followed the exact, precise pattern, all cell deaths and deformities must have followed in the precise order that followed or life would be very different and you would not exist.  The evolution of this species into all the others, including couplings with exactly the same creatures at precisely the same time must have occurred else you would not exist.  For all of this to happen is mind boggling, but the real smoking gun is this, if all of this happened what are the real chances of your one shot at existence being right now?  Why not two trillion years in the future?  If you use logic for your own existence you have to conclude that your existing at all is illogical therefore you don't exist, you aren't reading this and you never will exist.  Or, the only other logical explanation would be that you always exist.
      </p>

       We are always encouraged to behave 'in the box', if are forced to believe there is both an earthly higher power I.e. governments, secret societies that control all earthly politics, and either no other power (such as a god) or a god that also has rules and regulations.  We are never told that this higher power is in fact ourselves, that truly it is us that wield the greatest power, if we all wanted rid of gvts, banks, money etc we would get rid of it.  Obama might be okay, but I know men in my local bar who could take him in a fight, in fact I think I could probably give him a good beating.  So, he is far from the most powerful man in the world.  We allow him to be!

       This is long..... I was going to write about red shift, blue shift and einsteinium physics and the ramifications which is also very interesting and never, not ever, properly addressed.  Quickly, Einstien's theories equate to none of us having free will and every event from the beginning of time to the end is already set, the most frightening thing about this is he did the math to back it up.

       In contrast to Chomsky, here's a piece by Michael Parenti that shows what an honest progressive writer whose emphasis is not on "conspiracies" thinks about the JFK assassination, etc. He directly attacks Chomsky and effectively calls him a liar, which he is. Parenti didn't choose to spend his time researching these events that implicate U.S. intelligence as Nazis, but he he didn't spread a bunch of lies about them, and he acknowledges their validity. Chomsky, meanwhile, is a liar. It's worth a read:

       u got it backwards, Judaism can be cconsidered evil, Zionism not so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       nothin wrong with Zionism, believing your ethnic group needs a homeland is a semi rational thought.
Believing you are Gods chosen, destined to rule the world, because  a distant ancestor wrestled an angel 3000 years ago, is batshit crazy

       Yea, Christians never thought they were the chosen people, due to some whore getting knocked up and 'claiming' she was a virgin right? Christians then wouldn't take that story and use it as a way to try and get people to do what they want right? Right?

       I think we don't need to lump in race or ethnicity,  at all though, when discussing power and self-interest.

       A minority of people with the majority of power is the problem. The fact that these powerful people are zionist jews is barely relevant.

       My point is that people who are calling you out on political correctness have not denied or condoned the evil things that those bankers have done at all. This issue has nothing to do with a spectrum of debate, it has to do with not lumping more people in with these high-level bankers because people get offended when you associate them with those horrible men.

       Your responses to anything about Israel/Jews/Zionism are as textbook and formulaic as those from the other side of the argument and you've been just as well conditioned to give a quantifiable response.  Both sides of the argument are defined with "approved" talking points and if you go off your "sides" message you get just as rapidly downvoted as those who don't subscribe to that side of the argument in the first place.
      </p>

       You are missing the point of Chomsky's argument, either wilfully or because you're unable to go beyond your own confirmation bias; which is that the arguments you are making against the official politically correct bullshit ideals are as much part of the controlled narrative as the ideals themselves.

       This is exactly how so-called 'science' works. It's not really science, it's what is accepted by scientists. Not the same thing at all. For example, you can discuss Dawinism and anything within evolution but if you question Dawinism itself (or global warming) you will get shit thrown at you.

       Actually, this is how bureaucracies work. Scientists have to work on new things within conservative settings in order to retain funding. That doesn't mean that they don't do good work, but it does mean that if you have a completely different idea, you'll probably not be the one to get recognition for it (IF it is correct) because it'll take another twenty years for someone to re-discover it in a setting when other scientists can accept it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sad that it has to be like this because there are more crackpots than geniuses. Any peer-reviewed kind of thing will have this effect of navigating specific fields of exploration.

       Yes calling Chomsky what he is, is trolling. Moron, he describes himself as a Libertarian Socialist. Which is idiotic on its face. But what the hell do you think a Socialist is? You moron.. Idiots like you and people who upvote you, is proof enough that society is indeed dumbing itself down....

       Actually, Libertarian Socialism was the
       <em>
        first
       </em>
       kind of Libertarianism. Libertarianism and Anarcho-Capitalism are considered a contradiction because people who are against government are traditionally against wealthy landowning businessmen as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ideas that Socialism = Oppression and Capitalism = Freedom are inventions of this very opinion-spectrum limit Chomsky is talking about.

       So many people forget that socialism and ultimately communism was derived from democracy. Democracy (and the republic) gave representation to the people. Socialism grows directly from this.

       He's pretty strongly against the idea. I think what the commenter is trying to say is that this statement from Chomsky is kinda ironic compared to his closed views on the 9/11 truth movement.

       They have released some minutes from it, of course looking like normal stuff. Their argument is that they need time outside of the public spotlight to discuss policy, but that is and of itself is a conspiracy. If we truly lived in high income, developed, republic states, then everything elected leaders should be constant supervision of the general public. Any meeting in secrete, between any world leaders, is really unacceptable.

I have not researched this topic a lot but I would think that something that originally has negative health effects for humans would build up over time in our "low dose concentrations" why do people automatically think that just because something is "safe in low doses" should be in all of our water?

      <p>
       "Here is Bassma Kodmani, seen leaving this year's Bilderberg conference in Chantilly, Virginia."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Kodmani is a member of the executive bureau and head of foreign affairs, Syrian National Council. Kodmani is close to the centre of the SNC power structure, and one of the council's most vocal spokespeople. "No dialogue with the ruling regime is possible. We can only discuss how to move on to a different political system," she declared this week. And here she is, quoted by the newswire AFP: "The next step needs to be a resolution under Chapter VII, which allows for the use of all legitimate means, coercive means, embargo on arms, as well as the use of force to oblige the regime to comply."
      </p>
      <p>
       "This statement translates into the headline "Syrians call for armed peacekeepers" (Australia's Herald Sun). When large-scale international military action is being called for, it seems only reasonable to ask: who exactly is calling for it? We can say, simply, "an official SNC spokesperson," or we can look a little closer."
      </p>
      <p>
       "This year was Kodmani's second Bilderberg. At the 2008 conference, Kodmani was listed as French; by 2012, her Frenchness had fallen away and she was listed simply as "international" – her homeland had become the world of international relations."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Back a few years, in 2005, Kodmani was working for the Ford Foundation in Cairo, where she was director of their governance and international co-operation programme. The Ford Foundation is a vast organisation, headquartered in New York, and Kodmani was already fairly senior. But she was about to jump up a league."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Around this time, in February 2005, US-Syrian relations collapsed, and President Bush recalled his ambassador from Damascus. A lot of opposition projects date from this period. "The US money for Syrian opposition figures began flowing under President George W Bush after he effectively froze political ties with Damascus in 2005," says the Washington Post."
      </p>
      <p>
       "In September 2005, Kodmani was made the executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative (ARI) – a research programme initiated by the powerful US lobby group, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)."
      </p>
      <p>
       "The CFR is an elite US foreign policy thinktank, and the Arab Reform Initiative is described on its website as a "CFR Project" . More specifically, the ARI was initiated by a group within the CFR called the "US/Middle East Project" – a body of senior diplomats, intelligence officers and financiers, the stated aim of which is to undertake regional "policy analysis" in order "to prevent conflict and promote stability". The US/Middle East Project pursues these goals under the guidance of an international board chaired by General (Ret.) Brent Scowcroft."

       Read the full article for the greater context. Its astonishing how a small, well organised group of people can start a war in a country. You get the whole gang mentioned in this article from Kissinger to Richard Perle and William Kristol and more of the same people you see when you actually look into things.

       In the interests of intellectual honesty, you might want to look purely at the evidence, and avoid speculation about "why" or "who", as these questions cannot be answered reliably at this point. Evidence however cannot be refuted.
I highly recommend following up with experts on the issue of Building 7 and the collapse of the towers:

       The only thing interesting about Bilderberg is that it is organization that likely subverts the democratic processes in countries like the US.  Chomsky argues and proves repeatedly that this is par for the course.  It's not remarkable - merely sensational.  And the sensational aspects are highlighted for reasons demonstrated in Chomsky's texts regarding media manipulation.

       Here's one for you: the US government knew about the 9/11 attacks in advace and used it to their advantage. rumsfield was on camera on 9/10 stating the pentagon was missing 2.3 trillion dollars. The next day, a plane conviently crashes into accounting wing of the pentagon building... however the government still has to do something about these terrorists. So they flex a bicep and send troops overseas, thinking a war with cave-dwelling goat herders would end within a year.

      <p>
       I actually agree with Chomsky on 9/11 on conspiracy theories in general. His dismissal of 9/11 theories is actually quite eloquent in both reasons and consequences. It comes down to scientific illiteracy of the people involved in disseminating these theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can look at WTC 7 youtube videos for minute details that we can't explain (and once one is explained, just move on to the next one). All the while even if we replicated the whole thing as a
       <em>
        controlled experiment we would not be able to explain everything
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is the case of any empirical experiments of complex enough phenomena. Why do you think people still have to fling cars at concrete obstacles at 40 mph to find out what happens to them? And now people expect a much more complex aircraft strike at a building to be explained completely?
      </p>
      <p>
       If 9/11 was a government op, Chomsky would be the first to say so. He's devoted a large portion of his life to uncover what kind of evil stuff the US operations have done.
