    <div class="md"><p>As far as I can tell, this list is complete fiction. There never has been a Rothschild bank of Berlin. There was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Moses_Sieff">Israel Moses Sieff</a>, but he was British, and not a banker.</p>

<p>The structure of the Federal Reserve system is sort of complex, but it wouldn&#39;t be easy for any small group of people to dominate it.
The <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System</a> is a federal agency with around 2,000 employees. The 7 governors are appointed by the President of the United States and approved by the Senate.</p>

<p>The 12 regional regional Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs) are corporations
that mix public and private control. The stock of Reserve Banks is owned
by the member banks in each region.  All federally-chartered banks and
those state-chartered banks that are also members are required to own
stock in their Federal Reserve Bank. The Federal Reserve tells each
member bank how must stock it must buy, based on the bank&#39;s balance
sheet.  The member banks are paid dividends based on this stock, but the stock cannot be traded and does not give the banks control over the regional FRBs.</p>

<p>Each regional FRB has 9 directors.  3 are chosen directly by Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve (the federal agency).  The member banks
pick the other 6 directors and only 3 of them can be bankers.  The
voting is not proportional to the number of shares earned, but the
member banks are divided into groups depending on their capitalization
and, within the group, the member banks get two votes each.</p>

<p>Most of the important <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/">monetary policy decisisions</a> are made either by the BOG directly or by the Federal Open Market Committee, which is made up of seven members of the BOG and five presidents of the regional FRBs (always including the New York FRB).</p>

<p>Besides setting the terms under which the regional FRBs can lend money, the BOG exercise other direct control over the regional FRBs, including approval of annual budget, large capital expenditures, and veto power over the directors&#39; choice of president and vice-president.</p>

<p>After paying a dividend to the member banks (6% of the value of the stock that the member bank holds), all profits from the Federal Reserve System go to the federal government. Last year the Federal Reserve <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/11/business/economy/fed-returns-77-billion-in-profits-to-treasury.html">gave the government 77 billion dollars</a>. The year before it was even more: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/business/economy/23fed.html">$79 billion (out of $82 billion in total profit)</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, I&#39;m confused. The Federal government orders an audit, of the independent-from-the-federal-government Federal reserve, using the treasury department, an agency of the federal government.</p>

<p>And the document is called an <strong>Audit</strong> report:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/ig/Audit%20Reports%20and%20Testimonies/OIG13031.pdf">http://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/ig/Audit%20Reports%20and%20Testimonies/OIG13031.pdf</a></p>

<p>And you&#39;re what, upset that the word &quot;report&quot; is in there?</p>

<p>As for your link:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Fed used trillions of dollars to stabilize the economy when the housing bubble burst and credit markets froze.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What would you have done? If the effort is to restore confidence in the banking system how does making public which banks are weakest help that effort?</p>

<p>Thats much more likely than splc employees going to an obscure subreddit to get to their website.</p>

<p>Im not saying there arent people that support the splc on that sub, because there undoubtedly are, but its not likely that anyone would use that link sub to get the the splc if they were an employee (or shill)- they would have it bookmarked or cached.</p>

<p>It&#39;s disingenuous to call that a direct link. Its tenuous at best</p>

<p>Sure let&#39;s say every single penny of profit earned is given back to the feds.</p>

<p>Then where does it go? Probably to pay out on T-bills and Treasury Bonds, of which the Federal Reserve is a major purchaser. Or maybe to piss away on military drones, tanks, DHS/FBI/CIA salaries perhaps? Honestly there is no reason to defend the current system because it is rotten to the core. </p>

<p>The intermixing and exchanges between our Federal Government and their private bank is very suspicious, and even further that the Fed has never had a public audit. </p>

You could have named just about any other major financial city in Western Europe and  you would have been good, but Amsterdam is not one.  Even still the Warburg Bank is a relatively small investment bank.</p></li>
<li><p>Lehman Brothers Bank of New York.  In case you haven&#39;t followed the news in the past decade, Lehman Bros went bankrupt in 2008.  It no longer exists.  It&#39;s former assets were divided between Barclays (without question not &quot;jewish&quot;) and Nomura (unless there is a secret cabal of Jewish Bankers that emigrated to Japan centuries ago, I think we are safe calling it not &quot;jewish&quot;)</p></li>
<li><p>Chase Manhattan Bank of New York.  Since 2000, it has been JP Morgan Chase.  It is a combo of 3 primary banks.  Chase National (founded by John Thompson, not Jewish), Bank of Manhattan (founded by Aaron Burr, not Jewish), and JP Morgan (found by George Peabody, not Jewish, and JS Morgan, not Jewish).</p></li>
<li><p>Kuhn, Loeb Bank.  It was taken over by Lehman Bros in the 1970&#39;s.  See what happened to Lehman Bros.</p></li>

<p>Try a little harder next time.  With the separation of Kuhn, Loeb and Lehman, it shows that this &quot;information&quot; is at the very minimum 30-40 years old and far more likely just complete and utter bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So wait... You see something some anonymous person wrote on a message board from some weird Pakistani political party four and a half years ago and think that this counts as an objective source?  Not only this, but when others point out to you that most of the banks on this list DON&#39;T EVEN FUCKING EXIST, you don&#39;t stop and consider the fact that maybe the source you are citing is complete nonsense?  You do realize that &quot;legislative sessions&quot; are generally public affairs, and well documented and easily accessible, yes?  Do you think it was a floor debate?  A committee hearing?  Some other forum for testimony?  How much effort did you put into verifying these claims before repeating them as fact?  Do you just presume everything you read on message boards affiliated with the political parties of dilettante cricket players is true?  </p>

<p>Note that none of these questions is rhetorical. I&#39;m now curious as to your thought process, the exact architecture of your stupidity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I believe, in brevity, that each of the banks (I thought there were 12?) that comprise the Fed Bank have an elected representative that meet, in person semi-regularly, but also via teleconference, etc., led by the current chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke. </p>

<p>Through what they call &quot;open market operations,&quot; selling t-bills and bonds, controlling our supply of foreign and domestic currency, etc., they (attempt) to control inflation and deflation. Additionally, by controlling the rate at which banks can borrow money and how much money banks must have on hand at any given time, they indirectly control the lending rates for businesses and everyday consumers.</p>

<p>Now, I haven&#39;t taken a Fed Econ class since Alan Greenspan was in charge, but as the saying <del>goes</del> went:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The struggle to control the wealth of America by the European banks has been going on since the since the dawn of the republic.  They lost the first two battles but won the last one in 1913.  They learned their lessons and Federal Reserve (by law) does not have to pass a vote to recharter as the previous incarnations and can only be dissolved by an act of Congress.   </p>

<p>An edifying glimpse into the history of this struggle is <a href="http://millercenter.org/scripps/archive/speeches/detail/3636">Andrew Jackson&#39;s veto of the bill to recharter the Second Bank of the United States</a>. The Second Bank of the United States (like the Federal Reserve) was the previous incarnation of the central bank, probably by some of the same interests. In it, he rails against its partial foreign ownership as something akin to being invaded and equally dangerous to the security of the country. </p>

<p>I consider it an ironic posthumous &quot;fuck you&quot; that Jackson&#39;s face is on the twenty dollar bill, a bank note of the same type central bank that he managed to kill 80 years prior.  </p>

Accuse anyone who says anything negative about Jews of trying to imply that all Jews everywhere are guilty of something. It&#39;s absurd, but it seems to work with many people, as a disinformation device. Those who use it are completely cynical -- they don&#39;t care what is being said, they only wish to paint the person criticizing any Jew for any crime as Antisemitic.
