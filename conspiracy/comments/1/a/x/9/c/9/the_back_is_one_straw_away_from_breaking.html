    <div class="md"><p>i have a few ideas about why our generation might change the world.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the internet. We grew up during the wild west of the internet. This connection with different people around the world, I think, creates a more open mindset. I remember how friendly people were in chat rooms back then. I think growing up with this sort of communication makes us want to talk rather than to fight.</p></li>
<li><p>video games. This idea is kind of out there but bear with me. I think video games have increased our problem solving skills. It takes a lot of brain power to play these games, hand-eye coordination, spatial awareness, muscle reflex, reflex to sound and sight, problem solving, teamwork and communication etc... They are exercises for the brain. I have a feeling that these games are underlying factors into our ongoing evolution.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I feel like our generation just thinks differently than our parents. We are more open to different people, more empathetic. Of course not all of us are like this, but those that are are more willing to change things. </p>

<p>I still say what I said, however.  We are not doing enough.

<p>Dorner is the result, brought on by this system.</p>

<p>Certainly.  Agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are all Dorner</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although this is, in one sense, true, in another sense, we are <em>not in the least even A LITTLE BIT</em> like Dorner in the sense that we&#39;re not doing shit about all this corruption.  It&#39;s one thing to &quot;fight the power&quot; by agreeing with someone like Dorner and screaming &quot;Yeah!&quot; from behind your television, sitting on a couch, eating a bag of potato chips, and quite another thing to, like Dorner did, actually GET THE FUCK <em>UP</em> and actually try to <em>do</em> something about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here saying that we should all get up and be violent and start shooting - hell I much prefer Gandhi&#39;s approach through non violently demonstration and action - but we have to do <em>something</em> more than what we&#39;ve been doing up to this point because, as has been said before, those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution
inevitable.</p>

<p>And we&#39;re approaching the point of inevitability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Correct.  Remove the base and everything comes down, but the tip has set up the entire system practically to indoctrinate the base to believe that they are nothing but dependent upon the tip.</p>

<p>and most of the base believes it in one way or the other.  The base, in other words, is not very self sufficient.  And those elements of the base that <em>are</em> self sufficient - or at least begin showing the signs of self sufficiency - the tip destroys in front of the rest of the base so that no other areas of the base attempt to do the same.</p>

<p>The battle is uphill, and most of the base is convinced they belong there, so it&#39;s certainly difficult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 should be view as a utter failure. A failure of the trust we once had in our government. A failure in doing what is &quot;right&quot;, a failure in choosing profit over people. 9/11 was a success in showing the general populous how far the government, or at least those in power, is willing to go. Willing to call a controlled demolition a terrorists attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  Actually there <em>isn&#39;t</em> a lot of evidence for terrorists actually being <em>responsible</em> for 911 or anything really happening on American soil.  The evidence, if anything, points to - as you yourself implied here - a puppet master (be that the American government, Israel/Mossad, or whoever) that were either <em>themselves</em> directly responsible for the acts or who were complicit and <em>enabling</em> of those agents who they hired to commit the act.</p>

<p>As such, the evidence is not that there is a...</p>

<p>Actually wait a minute.  You know what?  Something just occurred to me after re-reading your initial comment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but what if it was a real terrorist attack that slipped under our radar?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that I think about it, you&#39;re actually at least partially correct in this question.</p>

<p>A <em>real</em> terrorist attack <em>did</em>, in fact, take place.</p>

<p>That terrorist, however, was not who you (who we) were told it was.  The terrorist was a bit closer to home than that.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right that it was (is) indeed a terrorist, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Correct.  Remove the base and everything comes down, but the tip has set up the entire system practically to indoctrinate the base to believe that they are nothing but dependent upon the tip.</p>

<p>and most of the base believes it in one way or the other.  The base, in other words, is not very self sufficient.  And those elements of the base that <em>are</em> self sufficient - or at least begin showing the signs of self sufficiency - the tip destroys in front of the rest of the base so that no other areas of the base attempt to do the same.</p>

<p>The battle is uphill, and most of the base is convinced they belong there, so it&#39;s certainly difficult.</p>
