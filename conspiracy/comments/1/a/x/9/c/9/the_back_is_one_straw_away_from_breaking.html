       The poor are getting poorer, the middle is getting poorer. Our freedoms are being stripped away under the false reason of safety/security. Globally we are in "debt" to the tune of $40trillion ($40,000,000,000,000), but who are we in debt too?

       So what then, destroy all Jews, is that what your are implying.  All I see in your posts is Jew this, Jew that. You are broken record falling into the old paradigm of hating a group of people because of their leadership.  Would it blow your mind if I told you there were people above the Jews pulling the strings.

       I don't know man.... I feel every day we're slowly having our dignity as human beings stripped away by our "leaders". I feel as if it's almost impossible to even turn the tides. If you don't mind me asking, what so you see in our current generation that might help change the way things are now?

       i have a few ideas about why our generation might change the world.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         the internet. We grew up during the wild west of the internet. This connection with different people around the world, I think, creates a more open mindset. I remember how friendly people were in chat rooms back then. I think growing up with this sort of communication makes us want to talk rather than to fight.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         video games. This idea is kind of out there but bear with me. I think video games have increased our problem solving skills. It takes a lot of brain power to play these games, hand-eye coordination, spatial awareness, muscle reflex, reflex to sound and sight, problem solving, teamwork and communication etc... They are exercises for the brain. I have a feeling that these games are underlying factors into our ongoing evolution.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I feel like our generation just thinks differently than our parents. We are more open to different people, more empathetic. Of course not all of us are like this, but those that are are more willing to change things.

       I still say what I said, however.  We are not doing enough.  It's difficult to try to be a "one person army", and I think almost everyone is afraid of what happened to Dorner, but I do think that if more of us were like him, this government would be quite a bit more willing to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       be as bad and manipulative as it is.

       like Dorner in the sense that we're not doing shit about all this corruption.  It's one thing to "fight the power" by agreeing with someone like Dorner and screaming "Yeah!" from behind your television, sitting on a couch, eating a bag of potato chips, and quite another thing to, like Dorner did, actually GET THE FUCK
       <em>

       I'm not here saying that we should all get up and be violent and start shooting - hell I much prefer Gandhi's approach through non violently demonstration and action - but we have to do
       <em>
        something

       more than what we've been doing up to this point because, as has been said before, those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution
inevitable.

       And we're approaching the point of inevitability.

       Yes.  Correct.  Remove the base and everything comes down, but the tip has set up the entire system practically to indoctrinate the base to believe that they are nothing but dependent upon the tip.
      </p>
      <p>
       and most of the base believes it in one way or the other.  The base, in other words, is not very self sufficient.  And those elements of the base that
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       self sufficient - or at least begin showing the signs of self sufficiency - the tip destroys in front of the rest of the base so that no other areas of the base attempt to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       The battle is uphill, and most of the base is convinced they belong there, so it's certainly difficult.

       yes. When the idea was first put forward that the sun, not the earth, is the center of our solar system. It was met with ridicule disbelief and persecution. But after it was accepted as truth. We must pass threw these steps before the truth is accepted.

       9/11 should be view as a utter failure. A failure of the trust we once had in our government. A failure in doing what is "right", a failure in choosing profit over people. 9/11 was a success in showing the general populous how far the government, or at least those in power, is willing to go. Willing to call a controlled demolition a terrorists attack.

       No.  Actually there

       Actually wait a minute.  You know what?  Something just occurred to me after re-reading your initial comment.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        but what if it was a real terrorist attack that slipped under our radar?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now that I think about it, you're actually at least partially correct in this question.
      </p>
      <p>
       A
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       terrorist attack
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       , in fact, take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       That terrorist, however, was not who you (who we) were told it was.  The terrorist was a bit closer to home than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right that it was (is) indeed a terrorist, however.

       The Berlin Wall's collapse and the "collapse" of the WTC that kicked off a 10 year invasion are not even remotely the same thing. One actually symbolized the collapse of an empire by its loss of control in one of its puppet states, and the other was a false flag event to start an entire war campaign.

       Kudos to VC., but there are other things that lastet (meta)physically, like the streets, grids and routes; the borders and trade relations, as well as the law and types of money they created. Vatican City/greater Area of Rome is also a geograpjical entity, so there is a natural state in the area.

       Yes.  Correct.  Remove the base and everything comes down, but the tip has set up the entire system practically to indoctrinate the base to believe that they are nothing but dependent upon the tip.
      </p>
      <p>
       and most of the base believes it in one way or the other.  The base, in other words, is not very self sufficient.  And those elements of the base that
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       self sufficient - or at least begin showing the signs of self sufficiency - the tip destroys in front of the rest of the base so that no other areas of the base attempt to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       The battle is uphill, and most of the base is convinced they belong there, so it's certainly difficult.
