<p>I&#39;m not waiting for a landmark moment or the MSM to announce that the official be all end all has commenced. </p>

<p>The way I see it, it&#39;s not a black or white thing...it&#39;s a big grey space where shit is hitting the fan at the pace it needs to. </p>

<p>Cycles of good things and bad things are simultaneous and constant. I tend to think there&#39;s a leaning towards not so good things at the moment. </p>

<p>Just my two cents, I tend to actively keep my perspective flexible...to me perspective is on of the few actual powerful things we&#39;re in control of humans. Perspective aka belief shifts the tides of human behaviors. </p>

<p>People have been saying stuff almost exactly like this since at least the 1960s. It&#39;s right around the corner, people are waking up, change is coming, etc. In the 1980s, loads of conspiracy aficionados thought it would all blow up by the 1990s. In the 1990s, it was right around the corner. In the early 2000s, people were starting to wake up.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same old stuff year after year. The same platitudes will be offered 10 years from now, and 20, and 30.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hyperinflation always leads to getting behind, most people have to fight for the pay raises and they always lose ground. The middle class in america have been shrinking for a long time. &quot;What makes me say that&quot; ? The fact that I have done it. Dave Ramsey recommends it, there is no peace like not worrying if the markets crash or I lose my job yada yada, when its paid for you don&#39;t worry. Sure you have to keep the lights and heat on and pay the personal prop taxes but those are minimal compared to that big ass housepayment that everyone struggles with. The old guys I know that remember when all this shit went down about 80 years ago said be completely in debt with the banks so they have to bail you out or be comepletely out of debt. Everyone that was in the middle back then got taken down. Precisely what happened in 08. Land grabs that is what happened people lost their homes so be out of debt and live a happier life. That buy on a 30 and invest the difference is a crock of shit in my mind. Because at anytime they want they can jerk the rug out from under the stock market . I have guys I work with that are not living as well as they did in 1990 making 20 grand a years and today they make 60 grand a year back then the debt was 2.6 trillion and now without the sequester the debt limit is up to 18.5 trillion , do you see the math there? That is how diluted the money is .</p>

He farmed that land up till 1955 when my great grandfather died. My boss also told me stories that he ggrandpa pritchard told him, so yes it goes back pretty damn far. My grandma who lives in avondale is now 90, I lost track and honestly thought she was on 83-84 ,its been a long while since I went and seen her. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You offer a best case scenario.  If a hyperinflation scenario does in fact come true and if your wages rise with it, then being in debt would actually be nice but being out of debt still wouldn&#39;t really hurt you.</p>

<p>In just about any other scenario, you want to be out of debt, though.  If money is tight (and a huge variety of economic issues can cause that to happen), then the last thing you want is for your home to be foreclosed on or something.  What if you lose your job or take a severe pay cut during the next economic crises?  I had to take furlough days the year before last, but fortunately I didn&#39;t have to take enough to hurt me too badly.  What if the government just decides to steal a bunch of your money, like in the Cyprus situation?  You don&#39;t want to be worrying about how to make your loan payments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Cyprus was/is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory">black swan event</a>. Never before have the banksters just taken the deposits directly out of the accounts. </p>

<p>Yes, the Cypress government has voted it down, but remember the US Congress also said no initially to the TARP funds and the banksters threatened martial law and a total stock market crash so ,against the wishes of the public, Congress gave them the money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll try to explain the best I can what I&#39;ve been thinking about lately because english is not my first language:</p>

<p>To answer your question: Never. I think you will never see &quot;shit hit the fan&quot; or &quot;everyting going down&quot; as you say. I honestly think this is a common misconception or something that people are looking forward as inevitable but it will never happen as some are expecting. Crises certainly come and go but these come in the form of localized crises. So for example if one day shit hits the fan in the US and some sort of civil war erupts on American soil, it doesn&#39;t mean that will happen globally and most certainly there will be places around the world enjoying peaceful times.</p>

<p>Let me give you and example from the past. Imagine this is 1938 and we have the internet and we have been talking about recent events in <a href="/r/consipracy">/r/consipracy</a> and the rise of Hitler and Nazism in Germany. By the time WWII starts, I&#39;m sure most of the people here would say things like: &quot;ok so this is when shit hits the fan&quot;. While WWII was certainly a catastrophic event that affected millions of people and devastated the infrastructure of several countries (specially European), the world went on after the war ended, and in fact reinforced the tendecy of globalization, cooperation between countries, new international institutions were born, and so on.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is that I see a lot of people here expecting the so called police state to come one day  and enslave us all, or that one day WWIII will start with a global nuclear holocaust of Terminator proportions to fuck everything up. We&#39;re definetly getting closer to these two (specially the first one) but we have to keep in mind that these changes come little by little, and by little I don&#39;t mean years, these guys think in decades and possibly generations. They won&#39;t rush things up, it&#39;s too risky to make shit hit the fan globally. Some sort of order must be kept in times of crises in the form of global institutions or whatever that will come to fix things up once wars, social unrest, or whatever emerge.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Shit will probably never hit the fan as some are expecting. Crises must be kept localized and some sort of order must be preserved at all times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to approach this really really really really <em>really</em> wisely and just relax, pace yourself, and try to think like someone or something, even though they are your enemy, far more methodical and efficient than you. Put yourself in the &quot;powers that be&quot;&#39;s position. They have been in charge of so much - and the collapse, especially considering it will be of financial origins, will be no different. We must be wiser than them, and only then, will we have a microcosm of a chance to turn their plan on them and against them. What will be the purpose of the collapse? Can someone benefit from a collapse? Who will benefit? How will they benefit? Who will be the ones they benefit off of? What will be the cost of their benefit? What is the event&#39;s purpose? How will it play out? If we can discern its purpose, we can design a rough trajectory of its end goal. If we have that, we can devise a way to stop it dead in its tracks. But only if there are enough of us.</p>

<p>We must prepare.</p>

<p>P.S.: I don&#39;t <em>think</em> it will be this year but it will be very soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People can make estimates, but the truth is no one really fucking knows whats going on. Sure we can build blocks and blocks upon conspiracies trying to figure out whats going on in the world with some grandeur illusion that all the power are beset against us. Or how a economical collapse will put the world back into the dark ages, but we just don&#39;t fucking know whats going to happen next,</p>

<p>However most of us can agree that in the coming years nothing is going to get better, we haven&#39;t even hit the tipping point of a depression, the worst has yet to come.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cannot make any future predictions with certainty. Too many doomsayers and false prophets. All signs point to such, but so many times in the past nothing has happened. The best plan is to be prepared to survive on your own without the help of anyone except your family, and even then that might not happen. Just always be ready, vigilant, and hope it never comes. Prepare your children the same way for such, so that they are prepared after your eventual mortal death. Even if they think you are a kook at least you tried to help them. After that it&#39;s on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The next big even will be 3/22. God told me during the Super Bowl. (Well, He told me before the Super Bowl that He would show me something during the game.) I&#39;ve also been told that the half-dark stadium for 33 minutes (game had 13:22 left on the clock during that time. Google 13:22 and 322) and it resumed play at 9:11pm will have been a harbinger after 3/22, which by the way is 47 days after Super Bowl 47. The syncronicity of these numbers and the corresponding Bible verses are no coincidence. The Architect of the matrix/universe uses these kinds of &quot;coincidences&quot; to send messages to His children and send warnings to the rest. The next big event will either be tomorrow (with 3/22 being the first day of our &quot;new world&quot;) or it will actually happen on 3/22. FYI, the Verichip is supposed to be mandatory by 3/22, according to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The Georgia Guidestones will celebrate its 30th birthday on 3/22. (I wonder how much closer to 500 million we&#39;ll be.) When God told me to get out my Bible—after more than 10 years in a box in the closet—and open it up to the last thing I read/highlighted, it was Matthew 13:22. I told all my friends/family about the verse. They mostly scoffed. It was 2 weeks before the Super Bowl. God told me to tell the same friends/family about His promise to reveal something during the game. A billion people watched the lights go out in the entire stadium, half of which came back on in 3 minutes, with 13:22 left on the clock. My friends aren&#39;t scoffing anymore. </p>

<p>That proves absolutely nothing. Over the whole surface area of Earth, estimates are  18,000 to 84,000 meteorites per year.</p>

<p>I wonder how much closer to 500 million we&#39;ll be</p>

<p>The population has actually increased, nothing happened and mass extinction didn&#39;t occur.</p>

<p>Too bad your mythological deity didn&#39;t teach you the difference between a meteor and a comet.</p>
