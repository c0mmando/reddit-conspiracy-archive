<p>Exactly... it&#39;s not hard. My grandfather who was a depression era man would never buy a damn thing if he could make it himself. He&#39;d make rope, bullets, crutches, pickles, jigs and whatever else. I don&#39;t make ammo but based on my memories of sitting next to him all the time while he did his work I&#39;m actually fairly certain I could be trained up in a hour or less if I had the tools. And I&#39;m no special case. Ditzy cheerleaders could be turning them out in 2.</p>

<p>Why are top training target suppliers for the government supplying <strong>the likes of the DHS</strong> with “non-traditional threat” targets of children, pregnant women, mothers in playgrounds, and elderly American gun owners unless there is a demand for such items?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off...I am not sticking up for the DHS here, I am just explaining the logic behind hollow point (HP) vs full metal jacket (FMJ). HP in handguns- Hollow points are said to reduce collateral damage. This is because when you shoot someone/something with a HP, on impact it will &#39;mushroom&#39; out, reducing the chance of shooting through someone/thing and hitting an innocent person. When a HP enters someones flesh the bullet expands greatly, causing massive internal damage. This is why they are against the Geneva conventions in warfare, but allowed in law enforcement/personal protection. </p>

<p>Long rifles- HP ammo is primarily used by snipers. This is because the hollow point on lets say a 7.62 mm is actually like as small as a needle. This tiny hollow tip in the bullet causes the air in front of the round while it&#39;s flying in the air to expand. This creates an air pocket in front of the projectile which increases the accuracy. These types of HP are allowed by the Geneva conventions to be used by snipers in warfare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apart from the reason they&#39;re banned is because they suck ass at killing things and only leave wounds, which at the time of the treaties was seen as a &#39;bad&#39; thing.</p>
