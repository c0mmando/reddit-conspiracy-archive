    <div class="md"><p>The jury&#39;s been in dude. GMO&#39;s are bad news for health and environment and they represent a broken agricultural system that is depleting the topsoil, killing the seas, ruining the farmers [not to mention the suicides], and robbing the land of thousands of years of organic balance. Or do you prefer fearmongering?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Source?</p>

<p>Please note, the following do not count as sources</p>

<p>1: Any website with the name including the words: organic, natural.</p>

<p>2: News pages. You may use news pages to find sources, but any opinion piece or news page does not count as a source in itself.</p>

<p>3: That GM causes cancer study by that French guy. Seriously that study was so bad even anti-GMO people distanced themselves from it. I can explain why it&#39;s terrible, but just a warning that it doesn&#39;t count as a source.</p>

<p>Things that may count as a source:</p>

<p>1: Peer reviewed studies containing stats. Extra points if it&#39;s in a impartial or respected organization/journal.</p>

<p>2: Statistical analysis of various data through the ages, including data from before and after the point that GMO started becoming commercially available. (1994 if I remember). </p>

<p>3: Preferably all data should be put in context. For instance the 300,000  Indian farmers who have committed suicide since 1995 should be put in the context of</p>

<p>A: The farmer suicide rate had been climbing before that point (starting in 1990)</p>

<p>B: GM cotton was only available in 2002 in India</p>

<p>C: There are 1.2 Billion people in India, with over 50% of the population belonging to farmers.</p>

<p>D: The average country suicide rate is 10.3 Out of 100K or 12K a year, even among none farmers.</p>

<p>I look forwards to seeing this evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only countries that are doing so are Europe. And they aren&#39;t banning them, they just never allowed them.</p>

<p>The main reason Europe is doing it is because France has a huge amount of influence. France&#39;s agriculture is heavily subsidised by the government, and the major beneficiaries of said agreement don&#39;t want Americans intruding on their turf.</p>

<p>And I counter with a simpler statement: If GMO are dangerous, why has there been no increase in pro-GMO countries of various illnesses when compared with anti-GMO countries?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your idea of a &quot;legitimate&quot; source is someone who gets their money from Monsanto, ADM, or the feds and that information is only as available to us as the media and academia [and by proxy the state] see fit. </p>

<p>This information is available should you choose to educate yourself. All numbers and statistics can be manipulated towards an agenda. Ask yourself the question age old question - Qui Bono? Who Benefits?</p>

<p>The bottom line is you can&#39;t become healthy when you eat things that aren&#39;t healthy. There are studies that show conclusively that grass fed beef is better nutritionally than feedlot beef fed a steady diet of antibiotic slime and number 2 corn in close confinement with their neighbors. You&#39;ve probably seen Food Inc. or any of the other shocking exposes of the food industry. Roundup causes lyphoma and they spray it all over the roundup-ready corn and soybeans. The crops themselves are made mostly of natural gas and petroleum via the synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. As for the dead zones in the Pacific northwest and the gulf of mexico, again a cursory google search will tell all. Watersheds are contaminated [everything from birth control to ag chemicals]. Aquifers are shrinking [irresponsible water use]. Soil is being depleted [no soil life, soil tilled to death, annual soil losses expected by USDA]. The honeybees are dying [neonicitinoids]. All for cheap junk food - that along with ag and oil subsidies and welfare - keeps the poor out of the streets</p>

<p>Since the green revolution began we have lost an area of arable land the size of India and China combined.</p>

<p>If you want to know the some of the proposed solutions, check out Geoff Lawton, Masanobu Fukuoka, and Joel Salatin. We don&#39;t need gene manipulation, automation, and subjugation of nature. All of the tools are here for sustainable, peaceful, and healthy development of people and technology without petroleum by working with nature to our mutual benefit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahhhm the good old &#39;THERE&#39;S NO EVIDENCE BECAUSE EVERYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH ME IS A CORRUPT SHRILL MAN!!!&#39;</p>

<p>Sadly we here in the house of &#39;Not being a retard&#39; and &#39;Having an IQ above 20&#39; like actual evidence for claims and not mindless ramblings.</p>

<p>Because here&#39;s the thing. There&#39;s no evidence (That I&#39;ve found) that GMo cause any environmental or health issues. Thousands of studies from all over the world in various sectors. For this to be a conspiracy, you&#39;d need to:</p>

<p>Pay off everyone who works in the genetic engineering industries.
Pay off everyone in the medical industry.
Pay off everyone everyone involved with stats keeping (So you can hide GMO killing everyone)
Considering the number of universities and organizations that have done tests, pay off basically every professor of every university even mildly related to health and biotechnology.</p>

<p>Basically, you&#39;re suggesting that &#39;ALL SCIENTISTS WORLDWIDE ARE EVIL AND CORRUPT&#39;, that there isn&#39;t a single good soul among all these people, and a company that isn&#39;t even in the top 200 can afford to bribe all these people.</p>

<p>Honestly if they have that kind of money and power to burn, they might as well just outright invade and buy the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t know that the head of the FDA is a Monsanto executive? Or that the head of the treasury is a Goldman Sachs exec?</p>

<p>I guess Europe&#39;s outright ban is the product of superstition? I think not.</p>

<p>Come on dude! Wake the fuck up!</p>

<p>Big Pharma has a vested interest in suppressing natural cheap cures [exhibit A, Marijuana].</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying all scientists are evil and corrupt. I&#39;m saying money talks. Monopoly powers talk. Goldman Sachs and Monsanto talk, and they have amazing influence in this country between USDA, Dept. of Treasury, monopoly power, too big to fail/jail, and money printing FED lending free money to speculative investment banks. You can&#39;t deny it. It&#39;s all over the news. LIBOR, HSBC, JPMorgan, Monsanto.</p>

<p>So instead of attacking the messenger, maybe you should do a little research and cut the childish bullshit.</p>

<p>With all sovereign nations in debt to seemingly no one, and quadrillions of dollars in a shadow derivatives market, someone might just step up and buy the world. The money&#39;s had to go somewhere - or is it that the concept of money created as debt is inherently a ponzi scheme? Either way, you&#39;re bought and paid for already. A human resource that gets his food in a box on a shelf and prays to his new gods for having the grace to give him his Orville Redenbacher and McDonalds. Amen!</p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely naive and the lack of substance in both of your posts proves it. The first is unsubstantiated and the second is hearsay, hyperbole, and personal attacks. Everything I said can be substantiated. You can check yourself because I couldn&#39;t give a fuck if your ignorant ass sucks down more coke and cheetos. It&#39;s your life. Just don&#39;t come around here like you&#39;re an authority on jack shit. Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I know those facts. They are conflicts of interests suggesting corruption, by products of your terrible american system. However, they have nothing to do with this discussion, which is the safety of GMO&#39;s. Last time I checked nothing you mentioned there has the slighted to do with anything we&#39;re talking about...</p>

<p>We&#39;re not talking about the banks being corrupt (fake surprise now!), or about the american system being bad. We&#39;re talking about the fact that world wide there are ZERO sources or studies that suggest GMOs are bad, and countless against that idea. So do me a favour, stop taking meth and focus back onto the actual argument.</p>

<p>As for Europe... it&#39;s a mixture of French corruption (France has an internal monopoly they don&#39;t want Americans to intrude on) and yes, fear and superstition. People are stupid. Scientifically the EU themselves have basically found no evidence to support their decision, and only continued to do so to avoid rocking the boat:</p>

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/fp7/kbbe/docs/a-decade-of-eu-funded-gmo-research_en.pdf">ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/fp7/kbbe/docs/a-decade-of-eu-funded-gmo-research_en.pdf</a></p>

<p>And everything you&#39;ve said is either unsubstantiated (Third paragraph down of your first post, unless you&#39;re going to give scientific sources for this) or going off on some rant about the banks/monstano which has NOTHING to do with this discussion.</p>

<p>In the mean time, all I&#39;ve done is A: Ask for sources, and B: Call you out when you spout rubbish without sources of your own. I don&#39;t claim I&#39;m an authority, but I probably know more about this subject then you do due to your evident lack of research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure bub. Monopoly on non-patented seeds. Right. The banks have everything to do with this. They are the people in charge of spreading the dough around for the massive research projects at Monsanto, whom spends more than 3 million dollars a day. Check the financials. The seeds are patented - meaning the farms crops cannot be reseeded without risk of massive suit. Several cooperatives have been sued here for hundreds of millions. It&#39;s part of the drive by companies like monsanto to consolidate agriculture by putting small farmers out of business and covering their asses on the regulatory side. Get it yet?</p>

<p>I gave you too much credit. You called me out with unsourced &quot;facts&quot; in the first place. You don&#39;t know shit about how things work in America. Apparently you can&#39;t even use google properly!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just ... stop. Just, seriously, stop.</p>

<p>People should be able to choose whether or not they&#39;re eating GMO food. Period. End of story. That&#39;s all folks.</p>

<p>If someone doesn&#39;t want to consume GMO for ANY REASON WHATSOEVER, they should have the option to make that choice.</p>

<p>Monsanto does not want anyone to have that option. Ever. They&#39;ve made that perfectly clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if I don&#39;t want to consume food created through radiative mutagenesis?  Because of my personal choice now I am able to force companies to label all bananas and oranges with a scary, uninformative, and danger-implying label of &quot;WARNING: CREATED THROUGH RADIATIVE MUTAGENESIS&quot;?</p>

<p>The whole point is that there&#39;s no reason GM technology should be unsafe, just as there is no reason that radiative mutagenesis is unsafe.  Labeling it with a warning label implies some sort of danger or caution, which would persuade uninformed buyers away from purchasing the food because of the implication of danger.</p>

<p>Can I request that all organic foods be labeled as, &quot;WARNING: CREATED THROUGH ARCHAIC FARMING PRACTICES WHICH IGNORE THE LAST 100 YEARS OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGICAL AND SAFETY ADVANCEMENTS&quot;?  No, I can&#39;t, because it&#39;s a misleading and unnecessary label with an ultimate goal of just reducing sales of organic foods.  It&#39;s not a populist issue of my free choice; it&#39;s an issue of health, safety, and economy.  For these issues we defer to health experts, who have near-unanimously ruled in favor of the safety of GM crops, radiative mutagenesis, and organic farming practices.</p>

People should be able to choose food that was created through archaic farming practices which ignore the last 100 years of &quot;agricultural techonological and safety advances.&quot;</p>

<p>People should be able to choose whatever the frick kind of food they want to eat, period. No matter what. End of story. That&#39;s all folks.</p>

<p>The VAST majority of these advances do NOT work &quot;with&quot; nature, but against it, in an effort to control it and kill it and manipulate it. It is not the only way to farm, nor is it the only way to eat healthy food (please look into the people mentioned above - Joel Salatin, Geoff Lawton, Masanobu Fukuoka). They&#39;ve contemplated working WITH nature instead of against it.</p>

<p>There is SO much evidence to support the fact that our so-called technological and safety advances have actually sapped the nutritional value and actual safety of the food we eat. </p>

<p>But we can argue that until the cows come home, because you&#39;re passionately invested in your opinion and I am passionately invested in mine (which probably means we&#39;re both completely ignorantly wrong).</p>

<p>So in the end, my original statement stands:</p>

<p>People should be able to choose the methods through which their food was grown. If they don&#39;t want GMO, they should be able to make that choice. Period.</p>

<p>And, again, Monsanto doesn&#39;t want that choice to exist. Monsanto wants to force all farmers (unlawfully and often through coercion) to use their seeds. And at the behest of Monsanto, the government is constantly making moves and threats to remove the people&#39;s ability to grow their own food.</p>

<p>Which is the most evil thing (The. Most. Evil. Thing.) an authority can impart on another being. Stripping their ability to feed themselves the food they choose. Which is really the remedy to NOT choosing GMO, to knowing what your food is and where it came from. Grow it yourself, until the government says you can&#39;t and Monsanto seeds are the only ones you have access to. </p>

<p>You know, because people like you forced the door wide open for them, even though millions of people begged for it to close.</p>

<p>But, hey? At least fascism will prove you right, right? Because without any other options available, we&#39;ll only be left looking at the world we created via GMO. No contrast, no truth. It&#39;ll be heaven on earth for your Very Important And Correct Opinion.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s going to be a ton of useless, uninformative, and scary labels on every single food for every single possible reason you can imagine.  That&#39;s the point; there&#39;s no reason to single out GM than any other part in the process.  There&#39;s not enough space on food packaging to label every single part of the process.  If there&#39;s no scientific evidence that a part of that process causes any harm, then there&#39;s no reason to stick it on a label without labeling everything else too.  You&#39;ve missed the point entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have any idea how easy it would be for Monsanto or anyone else to nip a study in the butt before they could get all the processes done that you require as evidence? And you need money to do science. Do you think Monsanto or our government would pay for people to prove that GMOs are harmful? If they are so benevolent and great, why are they banned in most countries? If they are so great why did Monsanto spend 2.4 million dollars to defeat prop 37 in California? If they were so great and benevolent, why is Monsanto the only one allowed to confirm this? You can &#39;debunk&#39; studies all you want but you cannot deny that Monsanto makes it nearly impossible to prove them in either direction. Do you really think theyd do this if they had nothing to hide?</p>

<p>Please note, the following do not count as sources</p>

<p>1: Any website with the name including the words: organic, natural.</p>

<p>2: News pages. You may use news pages to find sources, but any opinion piece or news page does not count as a source in itself.</p>

<p>3: That GM causes cancer study by that French guy. Seriously that study was so bad even anti-GMO people distanced themselves from it. I can explain why it&#39;s terrible, but just a warning that it doesn&#39;t count as a source.</p>

<p>Things that may count as a source:</p>

<p>1: Peer reviewed studies containing stats. Extra points if it&#39;s in a impartial or respected organization/journal.</p>

<p>2: Statistical analysis of various data through the ages, including data from before and after the point that GMO started becoming commercially available. (1994 if I remember). </p>

<p>3: Preferably all data should be put in context. For instance the 300,000  Indian farmers who have committed suicide since 1995 should be put in the context of</p>

<p>A: The farmer suicide rate had been climbing before that point (starting in 1990)</p>

<p>B: GM cotton was only available in 2002 in India</p>

<p>C: There are 1.2 Billion people in India, with over 50% of the population belonging to farmers.</p>

<p>D: The average country suicide rate is 10.3 Out of 100K or 12K a year, even among none farmers.</p>

<p>I look forwards to seeing this evidence. </p>
