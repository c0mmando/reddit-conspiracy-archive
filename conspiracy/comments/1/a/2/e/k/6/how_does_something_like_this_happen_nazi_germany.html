        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Nazi Germany contributed so many &quot;world firsts&quot; that it is mind boggling. No other time period or country in human history can equal the amount of technological advancements that one country produced in only 12 years.</p>

<p>How does something like this happen? As a history buff, I am just fascinated by how the Nazis were so damn efficient and creative enough to produce all of this. </p>

<ul>
<li>World&#39;s first civilian Jet plane (Heinkel 178)</li>
<li>World&#39;s first military Jet fighter plane (Messerschmidt 262)</li>
<li>World&#39;s first Jet powered Bomber plane (Arado Ar 234)</li>
<li>World&#39;s first Cancer research centers (yes, Hitler wanted to cure Cancer)</li>
<li>World&#39;s first programmable computer (Z1)</li>
<li>World&#39;s first live television broadcast</li>
<li>World&#39;s first large scale television broadcast</li>
<li>World&#39;s first microwave oven</li>
<li>Discovery of Nuclear Fission</li>
<li>World&#39;s first Nuclear energy project</li>
<li>World&#39;s first modern Sewage treatment plants (we use the same techniques invented by them)</li>
<li>World&#39;s first electron microscope</li>
<li>World&#39;s first rocket</li>
<li>World&#39;s first Assault rifle (STG-44. every single assault rifle made today is based on the Nazi design. After the war, Russians based the AK-47 on it)</li>
<li>World&#39;s first guided torpedo&#39;s</li>
<li>World&#39;s first highway system (Autobahns)</li>
<li>World&#39;s first Guided Missile</li>
<li>World&#39;s first long range, Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)</li>
<li>World&#39;s first short range ballistic missile</li>
<li>World&#39;s first manned rocket flight (in a Ba 349 Natter)</li>
<li>World&#39;s first air-to-air missile</li>
<li>World&#39;s first air-to-ground missile</li>
<li>World&#39;s first anti-tank RPG (Panzerfaust)</li>
<li>World&#39;s first magnetic tape recordings (Allied forces during WW2 were confused as to how Nazi officer broadcasts were all around Europe at same time)</li>
<li>World&#39;s first Rocket Powered Fighter plane</li>
<li>World&#39;s first sub-orbital Space Flight</li>
<li>World&#39;s first MANPAD, manned portable air defense system, the Fliegerfaust</li>
<li>World&#39;s first modern Submarine, which is to say, a submarine capable of operating completely submerged</li>
<li>World&#39;s first Night vision (ZG 1229 Vampir, attached to STG-44&#39;s, world&#39;s first assault rifles)</li>
<li>World&#39;s first Cruise missile</li>
</ul>

<p>I am tired now, the list is LONGER than this. Can you believe this? In only 12 years. I didn&#39;t even continue listing everything because I&#39;ll be here all night.</p>

<p>I think these results were made possible by the application of a free market economy, combined with a structured ethical and moral system that placed emphasis on education, family, child rearing, physical fitness, and the respect for not only the individual but for the nation. Essentially, people were motivated not only to work and invent for their own benefit, but also for the benefit of the greater German Reich. This was most likely the greatest nation the world has ever seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to check facts at random here that I suspect to be wrong, and so far you&#39;re doing very badly.</p>

<p>Italy created the first highway.  The first nuclear pile was in the United States, as was the first nuclear power generation.</p>

<p>No one knows when the first rocket was set off but the Chinese were using rockets against the Mongols in 1232 - or the father of modern rocketry was the Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky.</p>

<p>Many of your claims are true - so why did you taint your article with these lies?  My theory - you can&#39;t tell the difference.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>&quot;These results&quot;??  Like the Nazis got good results?</p>

<p>Ever visited Germany (I live there part of the year) or read a history book? I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t care a damn about the people who were slaughtered in the camps (you should visit them sometime, really!) but do you have any idea what tremendous havoc was by the war to Germans alone?  </p>

<p>You know, it&#39;s not that people endlessly post all this anti-semitic and pro-Nazi crap, or even that they have to make up stuff to do so - it&#39;s that it gets all these upvotes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nazi Germany and imperial Japan are what is possible when a people throws off their bankster parasites; but then said parasites used their other hosts to murder tens of millions of people on all sides to get back on them, and created a mythology to blame it on the Germans and Japanese themselves to insure it would not happen again. If you don&#39;t believe me, just look at the <em>axis of evil</em> they are trumping up entirely with lies today; none of them have a private central bank.</p>

<p>You do realize the only reason dumb japanese  made a play for that sumatran oil because Zhukov punked their land forces and slaughtered 45,000 of their best troops at Khalkhin Gol in 1939,  right? Pearl Harbor was a desperate move, as Yamamoto pointed out at the time. The war was basically over for them after a hobbled US Navy gaped their carrier fleet at midway.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the Japanese  people, truth took a long time to sink into the upper echelons of the imperial government. This may be due in part to the fact that Japanese officials who expressed skepticism toward the war effort were routinely assassinated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people talking about the murder of millions happening.</p>

<p>As for the rest:</p>

<p>Persecution of <del>Homosexuals</del> the culture of Heterosexuality cause it involves races procreating.  Silly I know but only a few percent of people are homosexual.</p>

<p><del>Sinti&amp;Roma</del> Ethnic prosecution of everyone else not understanding why separate groups should have a dual status</p>

<p>Persecution of the disabled - Well Democracies did that and lots of other eugenics and lobotomizing stuff longer so this is not just a Nazi thing</p>

<p>Violent oppression of people with opposing views - Everybody else does the same.</p>

<p>The systematic murder of millions of Jews - No one believes them (though millions would have died as a result of war).</p>

<p>A racist ideology based on pseudo-science - All ideologies are based on pseudo-science.  The Nazis just chose one. </p>

<p>Banning of degenerate art (so basically everything modern and avantgarde) - The banning of free speech by democracies.  Not. One. Native. Population. On. Earth. Has. Ever. Supported. Migrants. For Example. And. That. Culture. (the. real. culture.) Is. Always. Suppressed. </p>

<p>Removal of democratic institutions - Democratic institutions are removed by Republics too.</p>

<p>Removal of individual rights, most notably freedom of speach, and physical integrity - Ditto</p>

<p>Removal of the legal state (Rechtsstaat)</p>

<p>Forcing almost every cutting edge/avantgarde/non-orthodox thinker or artist into exile  - they&#39;re all hypocrites and just get pissed when people point it out.</p>

<p>Viewing other groups of people, especially Slavs, as non-worthy, inferior human beings without human rights - Again not a Nazi thing.  Most other peoples governments (not so much the people themselves) thought the same.  Look at what Stalin did to the Poles.  That is what the Germans thought he was going to do to them.  Why some Poles, even after everything the Germans did in Poland, <em>still</em> sided with the Germans against the &#39;Slavs&#39; in the east.</p>

<p>Effectively removing personal opinions through propaganda, manipulation and fear  - every Government did that and does that.</p>

<p>Brainwashing people starting at the age of 10 - here come the social services to save the day!</p>

<p>Installing a police state - these are just repeats</p>

<p>Forcing a patriarchic role model on women - the majority of women do not want their crappy slave labour jobs they want the families and being around other women who have families with children themselves that comes with Patriarchy.  The only reason there is no &#39;patriarchy&#39; isn&#39;t anything to do with feminism.  It is to do with cheap slave labour.  </p>

<p>Installing a fascist corporatocracy - Unlike Democracies?  Did 1% of Germans own 30 or 40% of their countries money?</p>

<p>Committing countless war crimes - All democracies do that too. And communists.</p>

<p>Starting the (probably) most gruesome conflict in the history of mankind</p>

<p>Except it was the arms manufacturers of Britain and the US that spent a decade building up the German and Soviet military.  Aftter destroying Russias economy with funding the communist revoloution and destroying Germanies with the treaty of Verseilles.</p>

<p>Fact is the Nazis offered the allies before the war the chance to receive all Jewish people (all the room that the allies - unlike Germany - had in their empires and dominions I guess) and the allies turned them down.  The French marched to German borders after encouraging the Poles to stand up to Hitler as untrustworthy after the Nazis had sent out a few feelers for an alliance with the Poles - or at least their British allies encouraged them - and then they stopped.  Having whipped up the hostilities they stood back and did nothing.    The Germans after all had an alliance with almost every country in central and eastern Europe so they might have done something better than war with them.  After the French stopped it was 4 years before the British got to Germany.  Didn&#39;t actually ever reach Poland of course - the Commies got that. </p>

<p>I think something like 8 out of 10 people killed in the war were Soviets. All the arms built up by the allies just meant that the Germans and soviets were fighting it out between themselves with the result of millions of deaths because there was nothing the allies could do but build up arms - corporatism.  And the allies likely knew that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well. That&#39;s just how our minds conceive such things because we have been slowly programmed to disregard such ideas and claims. Put yourself in the position of Hitler...if you found something like that...it would be to your advantage to not tell other governments..but let&#39;s be honest..he was a puppet and if he did indeed find something..whoever held the strings would surely make it seem as improbable as possible that hollow earth is existing beneath us. Admiral Byrd comes to mind. You have probably researched that too. There are some interesting Third Reich documents detailing what they found and in them discusses their inner earth discovery...as to the authenticity I am not sure. But lies built this empire we live in and I am sure we are not short on being lied to as what is above and below us. </p>
