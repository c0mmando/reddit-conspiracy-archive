<p>It&#39;s the same shit as Democratic Underground where the Obama disinfo shills pay mods to give them favorable treatment and delete unwanted threads.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there&#39;s another front-page article in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that says almost 40% of people polled think Obama is WORSE than Bush on civil liberties.  (Did I get that right?)</p>

<p>It&#39;s disgusting because they don&#39;t actually think anybody really believes the pap they massage to the front page.  They&#39;re just trying to keep us human beings from working together to change the government.</p>

<p>As in, if people could use social media without obstruction by shills, we&#39;d figure out we agree on a lot of stuff, and we&#39;d start changing things.</p>

<p>Instead, we have a fake government, fake reddit, and fake freedoms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This place isn&#39;t exactly troll free but you&#39;re way more free to make what comments you like without it being removed.

    <div class="md"><p>The flip side of that is that if we are ever going to get out of here, we&#39;re going to have to learn to cut through the BS.  Know what is good and what is bad, and have our own guiding principles.</p>

<p>Shills are pretty much the opposite of that, so having them around makes the message stronger.  That&#39;s why the shills mainly stick to unfair playing fields where the mods are corrupt.</p>

<p>Bullies don&#39;t like fair play, but they don&#39;t understand themselves enough to know WHY they fear a level playing field.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. So if indeed all the popular social channels are compromised by shills and astroturfers, by what metric can we accurately measure true dissatisfaction with the current political model? If controlled opposition is the name of the game, how can we confidently discuss the ideas for change necessary if all avenues for public discourse have been poisoned, blocked or directed? Perhaps it truly is baby steps. Perhaps only one more media circus-laden event is all we need for people to raise an eyebrow and exclaim &#39;Hang on. Something&#39;s not right here.&#39; One more Dorner, one more Sandy Hook, one more Aurora, one more SOPA, one more Kony, one more Columbine, one more Waco, one more Iran Contra, one more Northwoods, one more Gulf of Tonkin...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Social change is partly chaotic.  Who knows when it will happen or what it will look like?  If anything starts the ball rolling, it might be slow-moving (demographic change) or unexpected (tipping point).</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the propaganda teams have to keep increasing pressure and taking away rights.  If they don&#39;t clamp down, something will change.  If they do clamp down, the pressure builds.</p>

<p>Forced disinformation is about the most treasonous thing I can think of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I find it somewhat disheartening to learn that some of the biggest social movements of the last 100 years (<a href="http://rense.com/general21/hw.htm">feminism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">Black Rights</a>) had most likely been co-opted or infiltrated by the government in some way. If they don&#39;t clamp down with any grassroots movement that may destabilise them then something would definitely change. If only they could find a way to call protectors of the US constitution <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/08/opinion/la-ed-patriot-groups-splc-report-20130308">enemy combatants</a>...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the solution is to keep talking in terms of right and wrong.  Our lives are not &quot;just business.&quot;  Genocide is wrong.  Taking care of those who need help is right.</p>

<p>Government and corporations really avoid the language of ethics.  The media want to take it out of our vocabulary.  The scariest politicians are those who use ethics to get elected, then warp the meaning.  (Pretty much any recent president.  Famous clergy are scary too.)</p>

<p>If we have a healthy social conscience, good things will happen.  Don&#39;t let the propagandists take it away.  (Or rather, recapture it from them.)  That also helps against infiltration and all the other nasty little shill tricks.  When it comes to right and wrong, they are vulnerable and they got nothing, because they are empty.</p>
