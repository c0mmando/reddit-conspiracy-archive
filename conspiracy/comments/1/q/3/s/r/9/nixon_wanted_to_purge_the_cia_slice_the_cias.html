<p>Nixon fired Richard Helms on Nov. 20, 1972 but allowed Helms to stay on until March 1973. On Nov. 21, Nixon appointed his own man to the CIA--James Schlesinger, and told him to &quot;Get rid of the clowns. What use are they? They&#39;ve got 40,000 people over there reading newspapers.&quot;</p>

<p>Schlesinger then sent out a memo at the Agency part of which read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have ordered all senior operating officials of this Agency to report to me immediately on any activities now going on, or that have gone on in the past, which might be construed to be outside the legislative charter of this Agency.</p>

<p>I hereby direct every person presently employed by CIA to report to me on any such activities of which he has knowledge. I invite all ex-employees to do the same. Anyone who has such knowledge should call...and say that he wishes to tell me about &quot;activities outside CIA&#39;s charter.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The program was successfully kept secret until 1971, when the Citizens&#39; Commission to Investigate the FBI <strong>burglarized</strong> an FBI field office in Media, Pennsylvania, took several dossiers, and exposed the program by passing this information to news agencies. Many news organizations initially refused to publish the information. Within the year, Director J. Edgar Hoover declared that the centralized COINTELPRO was over, and that all future counterintelligence operations would be handled on a case-by-case basis.[26][27]</p>

<p>Further documents were revealed in the course of separate lawsuits filed against the FBI by NBC correspondent Carl Stern, the Socialist Workers Party, and a number of other groups. A major investigation was launched in 1976 by the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities of the United States Senate, commonly referred to as the &quot;Church Committee&quot; for its chairman, Senator Frank Church of Idaho. However, many documents are speculated to have remained unreleased, and many released documents have been partly, or entirely, redacted.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO</a></p>

<p>so we&#39;d know NOTHING about this if it wasn&#39;t for the actions of the CCI...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FACE IT: every chance Americans have had to see behind the Secret Government--JFK Assassination, Watergate, Church Committee, Iran-Contra--the investigations have NOT revealed the TRUTH to the public. Instead they went behind closed doors to hide the TRUTH--then LOCKED the evidence up in a box for 50+ years to &quot;protect&quot; us...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Odd....Prescot Bush, great pappy Bush, tailored Nixon into power. His own son, George Bush directed the CIA and probably had JFK killed. Nixon wanted the left&#39;s CIA disbanded while the Right&#39;s CIA got put in place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nixon&#39;s rise took place in the 40&#39;s during the &quot;red scare&quot;...strange that Jack Ruby worked for Nixon during this time...Nixon thought the CIA fed info to JFK before they debated on tv in 1960...behind the scenes, JFK&#39;s dad may have made deals to keep the directors of the FBI &amp; CIA in place before the election</p>

<p>after Nixon resigned as president--Gerald Ford installed GHW Bush as &quot;the first civilian&quot; director of the CIA...(Jimmy Carter then fired him one year later).</p>
