       This is quite a large project but I think it could help solve conspiracies and bring our ideas into the mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if we created a system of checks and balances for researching conspiracies? Kind of like our government has legislative, judicial, and executive branches.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically you would have a few different subreddits all working together towards the same end goal. Sifting through the vast number of various conspiracy theories and discovering the truth behind the events taking place, strengthening the arguments using verifiable facts, and presenting those arguments to the non-conspiracy community in a no-nonsense, non-alarmist way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it like the digestive process of the human body. The mouth takes in all the input, breaking down everything into easier to digest pieces. The stomach then breaks down this material into its key components, getting to the real information provided. Then the small intestine takes this information and provides the essential elements to the whole of the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need the mouth. We need the front line people willing to consider every angle, even the absurd ones. Think of each member of the 'mouth' subreddit as taste buds and teeth. Rejecting the poisonous bullshit and things that can't be chewed up enough to swallow.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also need the stomach to say even though the mouth thought it was sweet, we just swallowed antifreeze and need to send it back. This subreddit also has to dig deep down in the research and break down conspiracies. We need to get to the heart of the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we also need the small intestine section that transforms this information into something people can absorb and not just let it pass through without any thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please consider and even criticize this idea. I want to debate it. I want to help create a system of checks and balances that streamlines the process of taking crazy talk that happens to be true and turning it into an undeniable argument that can be spread to the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't like that system? Great, how could it be better?

       There's too much corruption and personal prejudice on an individual and emotional basis for this to work in my opinion.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         This planet has off world intelligent beings around and
         <em>
          on
         </em>
         it now and today.
        </p>

       <li>
        <p>
         Bigfoot
         <em>
          exists
         </em>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Pyramid at Giza was built either by ETs or by a society of humanoid creatures
         <em>
          vastly
         </em>
         more advanced than we are today.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Free energy
         <em>
          already
         </em>
         exists.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is a secret society on this planet manipulating much of what is happening on it and is greatly responsible for much of the worst things that happen here.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Christianity and Jesus are both hoaxes created by ancient manipulative societies in order to maintain control over the subservient masses.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       These and other things that many have already sworn are verifiable truths are subjects that even more people will likely go to their deaths vehemently denying almost regardless of what kind of evidence you show them.  It becomes
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       difficult to bring many truths out into the light of day when there is not only very strong opposition from TPTB nefariously keeping a lot of information down and away from the understanding of the people, but when the people
       <em>
        themselves
       </em>
       work almost just as hard to keep themselves ignorant, blind, and in the dark.  More often than not, they will react with very real violence and vehemence if and when anyone comes out that tells them differently - that tells them the things they've grown up believing are true...actually
       <em>
        aren't
       </em>
       true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too much brainwashing in most of us, it seems.

       I agree with your post, most people are just so blissfully ignorant, theyll dismiss thisbproject altogether. But, there are some people, much like myself when i first became hungry for info on conspiracies, that would appreciate the end result of this project. It woukd be very hard, agreed. But pointless?

       I think many people go in
       <em>
        thinking
       </em>
       they hunger for the real truth, but when they find out that this real truth might shatter some of their long held beliefs - beliefs whose credence is also closely tied to the love they have for their mothers and fathers and others who
       <em>
        taught
       </em>
       them those very beliefs from birth - then many of these people not only freak out and find their very identity as a human being challenged - something which usually scares the living shit out of them enough to cause them to simply give up the search - but they also end up finding out that some of the biggest critics and exponents against them that they'll come across will be THE VERY PEOPLE WHO
       <em>
        RAISED
       </em>
       THEM and who they love.
      </p>
      <p>
       That will DEFINITELY be enough to cause a lot of people who initially started the search for real truth with great gusto and enthusiasm to eventually say "Aw fuck this." and simply stop and give up the search.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm not saying this is the case with you at all.  What I am saying is that this is the case with many others though, so I can understand how many are kept in line.  They may
       <em>
        begin
       </em>
       searching, but eventually many find that the closer they get to the truth, the further they go from their friends and neighbors and loved ones and family members, etc, etc...and that simply scares them too much to continue and they end up going right back to the comfortable ignorance they were in before instead of going toward the harsh truth and end up inconveniencing themselves possibly for the rest of their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is to say most people prefer comfortable ignorance to harsh, discomforting truth.
      </p>

      <p>
       I certainly don't think it's pointless...but I personally think that people on an individual basis can simply continue to do their critical examination work and question the world they/we live in and that will go a long was as well.  I wouldn't be unwilling to get behind a project like OP mentioned, but - again - I
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       think there is a bit too much ignorance and darkness on this planet right now to make that idea get off the ground without a lot a LOT of work.

       Yea, unfortunately the majority of people cant handle the truth. Im lucky enough to be in an incredibly openminded family. I can dish conspiracies out to them, and even though they dont believe most of them, they still speculate, and they still ask question and try and get explanations. My stepfather, a devout catholic who i have much respect for, has even engaged in deep conversations about the validity of his faith and of the church. But, im one of the lucky ones, growing up in this kind of atmospbere where yiu ask questions and decide for yourself what youll believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand most people dont have that. So i guess the target audience will bebquite small, relative to the majority of the population.. but, i imagine there are enough "closet" conspiracy theorists out there thst this will be worth the undertaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       If nothing else, it will deepen my own understanding in the process, and expose me to theories that are out there that i might not be aware of yet...

       Well, that's correct, but I think it's even more accurate to say that there are forces/groups on this planet that make it so extremely difficult for most people to handle the truth that - understandably - most people choose to simply give up the search since it's made so difficult to get to it.

       But...we don't really need any particular group for this to happen, no?  We can do this on our own simply by continuing to search and be open minded, inquisitive, and critical about the information we come across.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, for example,
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1py8n1/bigfoot_footage_stabilized_xpost_for_rgifs/cd9jyw1">
        try the information here on for size
       </a>
       .  I just
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       recently came across this, but it has absolutely riveted me with its validity and with the professionalism of its study.  It's a subject that most consider "fake" or "wives tales" or whatever, and although it may not have to do with "government/PTB conspiracies" per se, it's definitely a subject that people are looked upon as being "not right in the head" for giving credit to.  None the less, the information I've recently come across is, again, very, very difficult to invalidate or refute - yet it would still take a very critical yet open minded person to understand it.

       Humor aside, i will do more research on this, but im already decided on the issue. I dont see why they cant exist, and i believe that they might. But, im not going to tell people that they exist for certain until one is trapped (i realize how sad that sounded...)  And some DNA is taken and logged. But, nonetheless, i will await scientific confirmation, however long that may take.

       Eh we dont "need" it, but it helps. You can play chess by yourself, too. But its funner when you have someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to the conspiracy theories, not only is it more entertaining, but you get more exposure to more ideas in less time with more viewpoints. The idea is similar to scientific journals that are peer-reviewed prior to publishing. Not only is the information going to be of better quality, but there will be more of it, when more individuals are involved. Necessary? Not really. But it helps.

       I don't know about and can't/won't speak for anyone else, but I'm definitely not doing any of these things for "fun".  I research these things to get a better idea about what's really going on in the world around me - which gives me a better idea about myself.  "Fun" can sometimes be an incidental part of the process, but it is only just that.  This is serious inquiry for my part.

      <p>
       Also, I understand what you mentioned regarding exposure, etc as it regards certain things, but one must also be very careful with the sources that are regarded as "valid".  Take the vaunted "peer reviewed journal" system as one example.  Hell take science in general as an example.  Scientific validity has ultimately been shown to play a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       distant second fiddle to moneyed interests.  That is to say that people give way too much credit to whether something came out in a peer reviewed journal or not - and base their regard for the subject at hand on
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       - having
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       idea whatsoever that the prj system itself is often just as rife with
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/17/science/rise-in-scientific-journal-retractions-prompts-calls-for-reform.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;">

        anything else

       .  The prj system should be

       source of info...definitely not "the" source, however.

       You're right that people brainwash themselves and don't want to see the truth. I have experienced that first hand with family members. I know the mountain that I'm suggesting we climb is monumental, but I think it is worth it. It is at least worth trying, even if we fail. Is there a better way to set up the system?

       I feel that work on an
       <em>
        individual
       </em>
       basis seems to be the way to possibly go.  I think setting up a communal organization isn't a horrible idea, but we should just realize that it will be besieged and attacked from all sides and it will be VERY difficult to overcome a lot of the attacks since a lot of those attacks will come from the "scientific" sector - that sector that most people genuflect before with blind, unthinking, religious fervor; that sector a great deal of whose ignorance is actually backed up by and supported by a multi-billion dollar establishment intent upon keeping the status quo
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       the way it is - an establishment that doesn't at all tend to tolerate any new or novel or paradigm-changing event, knowledge, or technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we set up "one" organization with the modus operandi you discussed in your OP, then it might be all the easier to simply topple it because it will give those with an ax to grind a focal point to target their negative energy.  If, on the other hand, we had a diffuse system or organization where everyone was simply an equal contributing member and everyone had the ability to check and cross check each other, etc, then that might be a lot more difficult to topple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted what I've just described here is simply a community not entirely dissimilar to what exists already here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ...but I wouldn't be opposed to having another, better one started as well - as this one has been pretty heavily infiltrated and undermined too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So is there a better way to set up a system?  Well, I don't think the problem is with the system's set up.  I think the problem is with the system's
       <em>
        members
       </em>
       .  Like, I would say, pretty much any government, the problem of whether it functions well or not is almost never with the governmental system itself, but with the individuals that are running it.  If you have honorable people involved, then almost any system will work well.  Unfortunately, we live on a planet that is the cosmic equivalent of a 6th or 7th grade junior middle school somewhere in the galactic boonies of the Milky Way.  We are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       very smart here on this planet, and there are simply too many of us that are just idiot...people that, as they say, just want to "watch the world burn".  Such a stupid, stupid mentality, to be sure, but there are, unfortunately, definitely people like that one this planet.  It's very difficult to function properly with so many like that here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a difficult time thinking of a system that could work properly without eventually being overrun by idiots.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subreddit is a good example.  Too many shills and trolls here.  Makes constructive information difficult to come by.  Still possible, but very difficult.  Then there's the alternative sub that got put up -
       <a href="/r/conspiracytruth">
        /r/conspiracytruth
       </a>
       or something.  It's a good subreddit, and is an invite-only sub - which is good.  I found that the users there really were/are interested in not shilling or trolling and ARE interested in looking for the truth regardless of how crazy it might sound.  Problem is with that sub is that there are not that many people there, so the discussion isn't actually as constant and searching as the discussion here in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is indeed difficult to find a system that works yet is not corrupted by morons. :/

       I am taken back to a saying about education.
there are two kinds.
that which is given to a man.
and that which he gives himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       what you propose sounds like the ancient Greek debates. the problem is that much of what it take for a man or woman to make up ones mind comes from a place outside of a debate. it is the experience of a soul that gives that soul direction.
I myself am studying about how the Talmud is the basis of all the laws that we live under. it is my errors in study that led me to this conclusion, as well as my successes. the whole of my experience has directed me to this conclusion. but to try to explain it to someone would take me a lot of time and effort. with the outcome still being one of uncertainty as the recipient could reject everything I have to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fear that the process would be mired in picking nits and resemble a bunch of baboons arguing as a congress and never coming to a conclusion. and that would be without trolls and shills deflecting arguments away from the conclusions that they don't want you to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       confusion is what you do not have when you work alone, granted objectivity suffers. but that is why places like this are so important so that we may pound out our own research to come to the true edge of the sword of truth that we all seek.

       I understand your concern. But we have to come up with a way to avoid the trolls and shills, which i know is inevitable. The difference will be in how we will moderate it. Like an invite only sub, at least at first, for people who have proven themselves to be openminded and at least consider ideas they think is bogus. Most of the shilling/trolling issues are with people who believe a particular theory to be ridiculous, and instead of explaining why, they just argue and bullshit and dis eachother.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is possible to consider ideas you dont think are plausible, without believing in them. But i guess the main point is, we want people who can constructively disagree, rather than disrupt the project with flooding threads about how someone is stupid..
      </p>
      <p>
       This, of course, is the beginning process. Once the foundation is laid down, itll be easier and more open. At least, we hope so.

       the truth is like picking mushrooms. you have got to get out there and get in the news environment (reddit), then you got to get your hands dirty (wade through the trolls, shills, and flooders) and then your eyes get better and your able to find the truth better after you get in the environment, and getting your hands dirty.

       Dole only grows one kind of mushroom, because that is the only one they know how to grow. and that is what you get at the supermarket.

       Im actually an amateur mycologist (self described--limited experience/knowledge) so i appreciate your analogy. I actually go out from time to time just to see what i can find. If there is shroom ive never seen, i pick it and attempt to identify through spore prints, etc. This applies literally, and metaphorically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive been here awhile (not a long time, but, long enough, i think), and i agree with your comment about the trained eye. The more time you put in identifying a specimen (posts) the better you get at filtering.

       You're right. It is a lot like the Allegory of the Cave. How do you convince someone that the real world is outside the cave and not the shadows they see on the wall? I know it seems difficult but I believe it can be done. Imagine a chain of people, all holding hands, leading to the outside world. Those who have already adjusted to the light would lead the way and the chain connects all the down in to the cave to anyone willing to grab on and take that first step.

       I believe that knowledge is more spiritual than that. there seems to be a tipping point. that once reached the whole crowd gets it. I feel sorry for the Japanese solder that had spent years and years at war in isolation only to find out that the war is long sense over. that will be those that are at the bottom of the proverbial cave. but once truth is of value to everyone then it will be like leaving the hate that is racism, equality is truth and we must let the development grow into us. and as that does we will then have to accept more truth, more reality. we suffer from entertainmentitis, it is easily cured by truth.

       You seem motivated enough. Keep going. You need a name for this system that's accurate and not crazy sounding. Also you'll need to exclude a lot of people. I'd say version 1 would be inviting people to a members only sub and brainstorm from there. You'll probably want to grab people from multiple areas to compile various skills. One group would be researchers, one would be creators of content like YouTube videos, etc. also probably a few people versed in public relations.

       Here's another idea. Set up a website with a forum. The forum will be a secondary feature of the site. The primary feature would be a massive list of the most common conspiracy theories-clickable links. You click the link and it says "is conspiracy X true?" Then you go though the entire amount of data and best arguments, then at the end it gets a rating. "Yes, probably, possibly, no."
      </p>
      <p>
       If you include a lot of historical proven conspiracies, like MKULTRA and operation northwoods, people get the idea in their head that conspiracies actually do happen. So when you talk about 9/11, you'll reference operation northwoods so that people have a historical perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could also include claims that aren't necessarily known as "conspiracies," like "did Obama promise X and not deliver?"

       Wow, i was gonna disagree with your rating suggestion, but then i noticed your point. Its kind of like mindgames, you condition the reader into correlating the word conspiracy with possibly true, rather than crackpot or delusion. Nice.

       Unfortunately, that is how the world works. If you want to get anything done, you have to spoon feed (most) people the information and be a little manipulative about it. The good thing is that some of us are well versed in psychology and advertising.

       I love the idea, even though it woukd take alot of honest people, and alot of work. It done properly, this would be something i believe woukd be necessary and helpful. But, we have to be careful:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Rejecting the poisonous bullshit
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is probably the most important step. We cant have people refusing to put shit in their mouth because it tastes bad. Sometimes, things that taste like shit are actually really healthy (Okra, for example). And some people are allergic to peanuts, while others are not. Point is, i think "The Mouth" should try to "eat" everything, and let "The Stomach" decide whether or not to regurgitate it. The mouths job shoukd be to feed the system, bullshit and all. Afterall, being openminded to even the absurd ideas is what we are about. We cant dismiss even stupid ideas without trying to digest its ingredients first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, this is a good start to the infrastructure of this project. There are three main bodies you mentioned here:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Mouth"
"The Stomach" 
"The Small Intestines"
      </p>
      <p>
       The mouth should gather different conspiracies. This subreddit should limit repetitive posts, and concentrate the masses towards a few threads on any given topic. This woukd ensure that a comprehensive discussion could take place without spreading the involved too thin. In these limited amount of posts for each topic, all the data and claims could more easily be compiled.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stomach, then, could take these topics and compiled ideas, and first should break them down to the main points, the main claims. Narrowing down the amount of posts for each topic, and presenting the claims in a paraphrased manner, bulleted paragraphs would be simplest. Then, research could be made on these claims, and the findings presented and compiled into ONE post per topic. This would make it easier for the small intestine to rewrite into legible status.
      </p>
      <p>
       The small intestine would then be able to locate each research findings post, and rewrite the conclusions in a presentable form, again, into one thread per topic. The reason i think one thread/post per topic is necessary is, if we are tobmake things more easily digestable, we cant have it diluted amongst a bunch of articles. Then people would only be getting half truths or, even worse, stop their research on these topics because they dont want to go to thirty different posts to read about one conspiracy. Making things easier to read is making things easier to digest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think i went pretty in depth here, and maybe this helps as a starting point for the logistics for this project. Let me know if you want help making this project a reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also want to note that there should be a fourth body involved, to serve as the checks and balances. For instance, it coukd he an oversight subreddit dedicated to only the three previous subreddits, where the moderators/visitors could audit the conclusions from the stomach, bringing questionable findings into a deeper conclusion, and providing the researchers a chance to cite their findings, and explain how they came to the conclusions. This subreddit coukd also double check the grammar and spelling mistakes from the small intestines to make sure its more palatable. And, it could serve the mouth by acting as a flagger to stop repetitive posts... Like a moderator subreddit, i guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, ettiquette woukd be needed for each of the bodies. For instance, for the stomach, each conclusion would need the citations, like a bibliography, so that the oversight sub can double or triple check the authenticity of the conclusions. And each conclusion shoukd be written in a certain format, for instance. Ill provide an example for all of this...

       THE MOUTH: 9/11 Conspiracy--The US Government was involved with the demolition of the twin towers. From the nanothermite evidence, NORADs incompetency, the freefall rate of decension the towers fell, etc.etc. 
(*This is where much of the discussion and debates woukd take place)
      </p>
      <p>
       THE STOMACH: CLAIM--Evidence for Thermite--Jet fuel burns around 800-1200℉, with a Max around 1800℉ in controlled burns, while steel begins to melt around 2,500℉. However, there are reports that the jet fuel couldve weakened the steel supports "just enough" to cause them to buckle and collapse.

       THE INTESTINES: Some theories state that 9/11 was an inside job, orchestrated by our government in order to start the war on terrorism, and to keep the people in fear so that they will accept otherwise unpalatable legislation, such as those attributed to the NSA spying program. They use certain facts to make claims on their behalf, such as jet fuel cannot melt the steel columns efficiently enough to cause such a dramatic collapse of the towers. In this example, jet fuel burns, at its hottest in controlled setting, around 1800℉, while steel begins to melt at around 2,500℉......

       Sorry, this is an incredibly long comment, but i do like this idea for a project. I hope i was helpful, and like i said, lemme know if you want help getting this rollin....
