    <div class="md"><p>GMO&#39;s endanger our food safety - over 90% of our corn in America is GMO.  What were to happen if something afflicted our GMO crops?  Also, the monocropping that goes along with GMO&#39;s destroys the soil.  Also GMO&#39;s create super weeds which have become resistant to many of the pesticides used and they are now considering using the stronger stuff (used in agent orange).  Also, the terminator seeds are antithetical when considering food-security.  It does no one, any good (except Monsanto/Dupont etc) to copyright and develop seeds that cannot create an abundance of more seeds.  Nature is abundant, one seed can make a plant with thousands of seeds to grow next year.  These are all major reasons without discussing one point in regards to health concerns.  There has not been any longterm studies (besides the lambasted one which was &gt;3 months that showed indefinitely, tumor growths etc) to show that GMO&#39;s are safe.</p>

<p>Biodiversity is a problem but it is not unique to GMOs. Conventional strains are just as susceptible.</p>

<p>Do you have a source for this?</p>

<p>Terminator seeds were developed and patented but they have never been sold. They are not commercially available.</p>

All jokes aside, it doesn&#39;t take a scientist to realize that just like these big corporations fixed cigarette studies to the point where cigarettes were considered good for your lungs and endurance.. The same thing could be happening here, and I say &quot;could&quot; just to keep an open mind, I think most intelligent people who have studied history or have a bit of common sense and logical thinking know the truth about this topic. Animal studies show it, the obesity, diabetes, and many other health problems that are drastically on the rise in the past 20 years are a clear indication of that. 
We are Guinea pigs, and we are playing Russian roulette with our own health and life. 
If <a href="http://www.responsibletechnology.org/article-gmo-soy-linked-to-sterility">this</a> study is any indication as to some of the side effects of certain GMO products, and these potentially devastating side effects don&#39;t even show for a few generations... Anyway, please don&#39;t bother trying to discredit what I just said, I don&#39;t give a fuck about anyone else&#39;s opinion on the topic, I can luckily afford organic food and I grow my own.. I don&#39;t see why I need to eat that shit when I can just as easily not. I only take calculated risks and this isn&#39;t one of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;It is expected that people die from anything at least one time, they can&#39;t run tests that will guarantee you 100% harmless results from their food ingestion. Just to show you, a woman died last year just from eating a [organic apple](blahblah.com), thousands of babies die from milk poisoning every year and some people even die from alergies alone.</p>

<p>So now that we have the damage of organic food on display why would people still choose GMO products? Very simple, it&#39;s cheaper and lasts longer, two very important aspects for the food consumerism. As far as I see, GMO may not be safer than organic food but it sure is better.&quot;</p>

<h1>_</h1>

<p>That sums about everything that I have read in GMO defensive texts. Still, I will always choose organic over GMO, fuck food eugenics, the fact that they are spending a shit ton of money to make people buy their products shows how desperate they are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see the point. If a lady chokes on an apple, dies from excessive sulfuryl fluoride residue on the apple, or dies from an allergic reaction from the apple, that doesn&#39;t negate the safety for the general population. Whether GMO corn causes an increase in any disease over the lifetime of a human <em>compared to organic and compared to conventional corn</em> should be relatively easy to figure out. I would settle for a 5 year chimpanzee study that was corroborated with several labs not funded by special interests. A short rat study doesn&#39;t prove anything except that you will probably survive the diet for a few years if you scale it up to humans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. I think you&#39;re missing the point. It&#39;s extremely easy to genetically engineer poisonous food. That&#39;s why some gmos never made it to maket. </p>

<p>2) There are studies on various food items that are not GMO. You&#39;ll see that if you dive into nutrition a bit. </p>

<p>3) gmos are the new food. We should take our time when introducing new types of food, first triple checking for safety. There is nothing wrong with waiting 10 years for a proper study. We&#39;ve had many generations to notice any weird side effects from certain foods. For instance: eating too much seafood causes mercury poisoning. </p>

<p>4) A corporation involved with pushing poisonous products to market in the past should be scrutinized more heavily, which is what we are doing. They, along with other food/chemical corporations, pushed DDT on us and poisoned the entire world. If you trust them, I feel bad for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it is no food is 100% safe. There is always a chance that you are allergic and don&#39;t know it, or it&#39;s been contaminated by poor sanitation standards or even hybridization(through natural crossbreeding of strains of the same species) that causes genetic malformations. You can never be sure that your food is 100% safe.</p>

<p>Lets also not forget that we&#39;ve been messing with plant genetics through hybridization for 100s of years already without the aid of scientifically based genetic engineering. What we know now as corn on the cob doesn&#39;t even remotely resemble the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn#Origin">original corn</a>. The original corn was much more similar to popcorn; hard and dense. We selected artificially for corn that was soft, sweet with large kernels. If you don&#39;t like corn lets talk about carrots. Initially <a href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/history1.html">carrots were gross</a> and used for medicinal purposes. It wasn&#39;t until they had been cultivated that they were considered palatable. Even then carrots were small. Only after thousands of years of cross breeding did we get the super delicious carrots we have now. You could say similar things about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato#Mesoamerica">tomatoes</a>. Scientifically based genetic engineering is simply skipping the time necessary to create better versions of things we already have.</p>

<p>If you like organic food that&#39;s fine but it&#39;s unfair to ignore that these are all genetically modified foods. There is no reason for the panic. The reason there are no good studies is because these new strains haven&#39;t been around long enough to determine how safe they are. People haven&#39;t eaten enough of them for a long enough period of time to make any conclusions. This is in contrast to our current hybrids that have existed for 1000s of years which we know are(mostly) safe. In 100 years it may prove that they are very dangerous but until there is enough data it&#39;s not reasonable to draw any conclusions.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that you should be forced or coerced into eating GMOs if you don&#39;t want and it is completely fair to ask that they are labeled. It&#39;s your right to know exactly what you are eating but I think it&#39;s a better idea to not spread panic and discuss these things with a level head and analysis based on science and logic. If you ask me for my opinion I don&#39;t think GMOs are harmful. This belief is based on the logic I presented above. There are more important things to be worrying about in my mind, like the <a href="http://qz.com/144761/more-americans-die-each-year-from-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria-than-aids-and-theres-no-new-drugs-coming/">impending loss of efficacy</a> in antibiotics or the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/opinion/18koeppel.html?_r=0">extinction of the banana</a> because of the lack in genetic diversity(caused by hybridization and the over use of one cultivar). </p>

<p>I also think you are going about having a reasonable discussion in a very distasteful way. Calling people retards and accusing them of being shills before even receiving the information you are seeking makes you look like a loon and doesn&#39;t help your side at all. You aren&#39;t wrong to request evidence but you are wrong to do it in a seriously dickish way.</p>

<p>Of course this has happened. And of course when it has happened, it has been proven. Show me the proof that GMOs are harmful. If you say things that are negative about GMOs, but cannot provide any proof of your assertion, then yes, you are a crackpot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BT/cry has been used since the late 60&#39;s. The only new development is that GMO plants can now produce it themselves rather than wait for the farmer to sprinkle it on their leaves. Don&#39;t you think if it was a toxic poison we would have noticed sometime in the last 40+ years? </p>

<p>The advantage of GMO engineering over traditional use of foliar BT is that there are actually a multitude of cry proteins expressed by BT and genetic engineering allows us to use them selectively to target certain organisms while minimizing impact on others. Cry proteins work by messing with insects&#39; digestive tracts. Of course it&#39;s preferable to kill just corn borers and leave other harmless insects alone. </p>

<p>Spraying bacillus thuringiensis on your crop is an <a href="http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs144p2_044600.pdf">accepted form of organic pesticide</a> and has been used for a long time in both conventional and organic farming. </p>

<p>In other words, if cry proteins are toxic, they are not very toxic, and the issue has very little to do with GMOs considering that use of the same BT proteins both outdates GMOs by several decades and is still used in organic farming. If anything, crops genetically modified to express specific cry traits have less impact on non-targeted species overall than do non-GMO crops that are just dusted with BT, which is the alternative.</p>

<p>By the way, you should read <a href="http://informahealthcare.com/doi/full/10.3109/10408444.2013.842956">this article</a> in Critical Reviews in Toxicology which refutes that study you cited and points out all its methodological flaws. I know you will just dismiss it without considering it however, since its coauthors include Monsanto and Bayer scientists.</p>

<p>The gmo produces proteins from foreign organisms. The pusztai study showed that gmo produced proteins are different than the original proteins.</p>

<p>I really have no idea what you mean by this. Different how? Do you really mean that every time scientists genetically engineer an organism to produce a certain protein, that they ALWAYS FAIL? That they always end up with an organism that produces SOME OTHER PROTEIN? Why would it be &quot;different?&quot; Different, how? </p>

<p>I reviewed <a href="http://stopogm.net/files/Ewen.pdf">the Pusztai study</a> that I&#39;m sure you&#39;re referencing, and I didn&#39;t see anything in there that said anything to the effect of &quot;gmo produced proteins are different than the original proteins. What it says is that the subject of the study was potatoes that had been genetically modified to express GNA lectin, and the researchers measure the levels of the GNA lectin. I see nowhere that says that the potatoes actually did not contain GNA lectin but actually contained some &quot;different&quot; protein. Can you help me out?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seralini study used bt corn which is most definitely bacillus thuringiensis</p>

<p>No, he did not use bt corn. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512005637">Read his actual article.</a> Do you see BT mentioned anywhere in it? No, you do not, because it was a study of nk603 corn, which is a RoundUp Ready corn. There&#39;s a big difference between introducing a gene which creates a built-in pesticide and introducing a gene which makes the plant resistant to broad-leaf herbicide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re aware that standard practice is funding a bunch of studies and then picking the ones you want to publish, right? Also outsourcing the studies to companies who conduct the trials over seas, out of sight. Also, there is a good reason that the FDA is in bed with Monsanto. That isn&#39;t even argued, that&#39;s just a fact. </p>

<p>Also, any published studies that find harmful effects from lifetime rat studies are &quot;bad science,&quot; but 90 day trials by Monsanto are &quot;scientifically sound.&quot; <a href="http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/1896115">http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/1896115</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s just a giant reputation game. If someone disagrees with big industry, they aren&#39;t credible. If your study will make Monsanto money, you&#39;re a smart good scientist. </p>

I&#39;m going to give you a million dollars to falsify a study, a million which is chump change to me because I stand to make billions off of your &quot;conclusive study&quot; that GMO is safe. Catch my drift? Your study will conclude that they are safe. Oh, and I want it to be well-structured, statistically valid, properly controlled, peer-reviewed, yadda yadda yadda... make it happen.
