    <div class="md"><p>I was unaware that a few people in this sub speak for everyone, it works both ways. When people say Jews, they expand further and seem to think all of them are a problem. It&#39;s the same when people say Muslims. Some people think that every single Muslim is a suicide bomber when it&#39;s quite clear that&#39;s not the case. </p>

<p>Have people seen the Jews against Zionism organisations? Not every person who is a Jew is involved in a conspiracy. Zionists are extremists and will go to the same lengths as Muslim extremists to fulfil their twisted ideologies, they just do it differently. One straps a bomb to themselves and blows people up, the other infiltrates policy and let&#39;s others do the dirty work. It&#39;s clear that Israel has a huge influence on US foreign policy, you don&#39;t need to be a conspiracy theorists to see that and to verify it.</p>

<p>Because of the old anti-Semitic accusations, the real verified influence gets brushed to the side and called anti-Semitic. The people who claim &#39;it&#39;s the Jews&#39; are not helping one bit by making yourselves and the rest of us appear to be anti-Semitic.</p>

<p>So if if is &#39;the Jews&#39; I&#39;m going to have to see evidence that all Jews hold the same beliefs or do you think that it&#39;s possibly a group of people who have a twisted view on the world see fit to make it how they want it, no matter what&#39;s in the way of that?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t tar everyone with the same brush because it makes you look like an idiot. And the way anti-Semitism is abused by some people only makes it easier for them to cry foul and bury the evidence. I&#39;m also suspicious of people on this sub who relentlessly post about it being &#39;the Jews&#39; because it damages credibility. Being able to pull the race card on less than savvy people still works and it&#39;s an old trick.</p>

<p>Well, not all Zionists are extremists either. Zionism is just the belief that there should be a Jewish homeland. It doesn&#39;t necessarily mean support for the current state of Israel and the way it does things. </p>

<p>You can still be a &quot;Zionist&quot; and believe that the current state of Israel should be transformed into a &quot;co-homeland&quot; for Jews and Palestinians, including the Palestinians and their descendants who were displaced/expelled in 1948, with equal rights for all, separation of church and state, and reparations/development to help remedy the effects of decades of what I call the &quot;reservation state.&quot; This would be a form of the &quot;one state solution.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, just a tangent. I agree with most of the rest of what you said. </p>

<p>People, can&#39;t you see that the Zionist shills are using the &quot;slippery slope&quot; argument to their advantage, by turning it around on itself?

<p>Don&#39;t criticize people, criticize ideas. Take the time to learn things like the facts that not all Jews are Zionists, not all Israelis are Jews, and that because the Knesset has a proportional representation system, there is a huge diversity of political positions expressed in Israeli politics. There are entire far-right political parties in Israel that have actually been banned because they are racist and genocidal (Kach). Israel also has a far-left. There are Israelis that advocate a one-state solution based on equality. Does Ted Cruz speak for all Americans? Does Dennis Kucinich? Does George W. Bush? Does Jimmy Carter?</p>

<p>Lumping &quot;Israel,&quot; &quot;Israeli politics,&quot; &quot;Jews,&quot; &quot;Zionists&quot; and everybody who you might label as a member or involved in any of those things all together is ignorance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that supposed to be an argument? OK, so Jews sometimes prey on other Jews. That does not mean that as a tribe they don&#39;t all prey on non-Jews. The entire structure of Jewish society is based on the assumption that Jews will manipulate and profit from non-Jews by any means necessary, including fraud and deceit. It&#39;s been that way since the Dark Ages. Can we say that Ashkenazi Jews are worse than Sephardic Jews? Yes, I&#39;m willing to acknowledge that they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes? The bastard grandson of a Rothschild used to murder however many were actually killed in the death camps, the Rothschilds fund and create a &quot;Jewish&quot; nation and now they slaughter any actual Jewish blood lineage they can get their hands on, whether it&#39;s the 500,000 Safartic Jewish children, or the Palestinians every single day.</p>

<p>The Ashkenazi&#39;s aren&#39;t even &quot;Jew&quot; by blood, they are Khazarians who converted to Judaism in the 12th century; unless they&#39;ve intermarried with Safartic Jews or certain Arab/Persian families.  The Palestianians are more &quot;Jew&quot; by blood than the Ashkenazi as they all share blood lineage with Ishmael the half brother of Isaac the two children of Abraham.</p>

<p>When you look at the &quot;Jews&quot; who are trying to control and influence the planet over 95% of them, including the Rothschilds come from this poison lineage.  The Bible even refers to them in revelation as the &quot;Synagogue of Satan&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews used to be one European community. Sephardic Jews are descended of the Jews that were exiled from Spain and Portugal in the 1490s. Sephardic Jews don&#39;t have any closer genetic relationship to the Israelites of the bible than the Ashkenazi. Yes, there have been communities of Jews that did live in the Middle East and Israel continuously since antiquity, and yes, they are also deemed to be &quot;Sephardic&quot; but they are very small in number. Most Sephardic Jew are descended from the European exiles of the Iberian peninsula. </p>

<p>The Ethiopian Jews on the other hand may have diverged longer ago than that. Geneticists and historians are still trying to figure it out. They were definitely there in the 9th century. If they are converts as some think, the conversion happene very long ago and there must have been a lot of intermarriage because they have definite genetic links. The fact that they consider different books to be canonical implies that they split before the Septuagint translation and before the Masoretic corrections.</p>

However, I know I read something about the Zionist movement being a political move and that many &quot;Ashkenazi Jewish&quot; people were not related but adopted the title as part of a Zionist political power move.</p>

<p>Edit: I forgot to add that modern Israeli apartheid/racism against Israeli resident Jews of black/Ethiopian descent reflects that Israel is political, not an actual religious home for all Jewish people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right that Jews have been very literate for a long time. And a lot of Jewish writings end up surviving for a long time because disposal of documents containing the name of God is difficult. They end up stored in genizot like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_Geniza">Cairo Genizah</a></p>

<p>But at the same time, we know Jews engaged in a lot of revisionism and redaction in the middle ages with the TaNakh. There is a lot of evidence that some parts of the Masoretic text are &quot;wrong&quot; when you compare them to the Septuagint, the Targum of Onkelos and the Samaritan texts. </p>

<p>Even earlier than that, it is pretty obvious that the Torah was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_hypothesis">cobbled together from four distinct sources.</a> Who did that, when did they do it, and why? It may have happened at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Assembly">Great Assembly</a></p>

<p>My personal opinion is that Ezra was real and that he did it. He was not a high priest, but he was priest-scribe. My opinion is that what happened is that during the Babylonian exile, the four distinct traditions were first written down, partially based on an oral history, and partially based on interests of people in power, like the priest class. Then Ezra combined them when he returned to Jerusalem. Read Nehemiah 8. Ezra &quot;reads the law&quot; (law = Torah) and everybody acts like they&#39;ve never heard it before. Particularly in 8:13 it seems like nobody has ever heard of the holiday of Sukkot before. </p>

<p>This is all very suspicious. The story of Ezra-Nehemiah is everybody returning from the exile, being punished for/purged of intermarriage, and acting like they&#39;ve never heard the Torah before. There is no archaelogical evidence that the Jews ever lived in Egypt. There is no archaelogical evidence that there was a first temple (but of course the second temple was real.) </p>

<p>Even if you accept the literal narrative of the Books of Moses, God gave the entire Torah to Moses. That&#39;s when it was first written down according to the Bible. Now, if you believe &quot;God gave&quot; the Torah to Moses, then maybe the history before Moses is correct. But if that&#39;s not the case, then Moses made it up/wrote down oral history. Nobody, even Orthodox Jews, claim anything was written down in the time of Abraham and his sons. </p>

<p>Ancient peoples across the world made up historical fictions to explain the world around them and their neighbors. When it comes to the non-supernatural parts of the Books of Moses, I do not give them much credence.</p>
