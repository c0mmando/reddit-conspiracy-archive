       I replied in a thread about cancer cures that soursop and thc oil has shown promise in the field of cancer treatment. Was swiftly banned by somebody and did not get an explanation as to why.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought reddit was more open and mature about discussing all alternatives on any topic, guess I was wrong.

       I hold a couple copyrights. Before I could get them I first had to come up with the idea of what it was I was going to put the copyright on. You can't put a copyright on thin air.  Something that involves original thought can be given a copy right.

       My guess is that the mods didn't consider your answer to be "legitimate and/or widely accepted". Which of course it's not. Diet, natural supplements, and positive thinking doesn't beat cancer! Don't be stupid! Big pharma prevents cancer! Medical dependency cures everything! What you think I take ginseng, bilberry and eyebright to improve my eyesight naturally? Homie get outta here! I take them so I can look stupid in front of Dr. McPrescribesalot.

       Just because an answer isn't legitimate doesn't mean he should be banned from the entire subreddit. I think he got banned because he violated the reddit T&amp;C. It states your not allowed to give medical advise on reddit even though everyone does anyway.

       was banned for violating the rules of the subreddit and for violating the sitewide restriction on offering medical advice.
      </p>
      <p>
       He posted the following in a top-level comment reply to
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1q76kg/eli5why_do_i_see_articles_daily_practically/">
        this submission

       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What about soursop and thc oil?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The subreddit rules state that top-level comments are restricted to explanations, and writing a comment that simply lists two substances, one of which is not recognized as a cancer treatment, and the other which is recognized for its ability to treat cancer side-effects (and is in no way recognized as a
       <em>
        cure
       </em>
       for cancer, as was the topic) is in direct violation of that rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       He asked why in modmail and responded very reasonably, and we were about to lift the ban before we spotted this thread in his overview. The ban will now remain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just thought I'd toss that out there before this turns into more than it needs to be. Another participant in this thread is threatening to cause problems as well.

       We will expose your bullshit censorship. I myself will make 20 accounts tomorrow and show people in ELI5 your censorship and that cancer cures do exist. You cannot stop us and your completely unjustified bullshit bans only motivate us more. Fuck you, your mods, your censorship, and your blind allegiance to idiotic unjust policies.

       there may not be people that claim to be scientists, but there are scientists on these subs, I am sure that no one will bat an eye to the simple question "What about soursop and thc oil?". although I am sure you will get up votes.

       Don't be surprised. It's pretty obvious cannabis is a hot button issue and quickly shot down. I mean OBVIOUSLY cannabis is a cure for all sorts of cancer but there are so many people on the webs just waiting to debunk deny and destroy any argument on it.

       Because they LIE to you and suppress the cures they find when they can't control it and make an assload of money off of curing you from diseases that are primarily caused by environmental factors which they completely avoid addressing.

       IE: They are scam artists, I mean look at that long winded BS 'top' comment from a 'scientist'.  This is explain it like I'm 5 not convolute it so I can't understand.
