    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/explainlikeimfive">/r/explainlikeimfive</a> mod here.</p>

<p><a href="/u/kittenhormones">/u/kittenhormones</a> was banned for violating the rules of the subreddit and for violating the sitewide restriction on offering medical advice.</p>

<p>He posted the following in a top-level comment reply to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1q76kg/eli5why_do_i_see_articles_daily_practically/">this submission</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about soursop and thc oil?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The subreddit rules state that top-level comments are restricted to explanations, and writing a comment that simply lists two substances, one of which is not recognized as a cancer treatment, and the other which is recognized for its ability to treat cancer side-effects (and is in no way recognized as a <em>cure</em> for cancer, as was the topic) is in direct violation of that rule.</p>

<p>He asked why in modmail and responded very reasonably, and we were about to lift the ban before we spotted this thread in his overview. The ban will now remain.</p>

<p>Just thought I&#39;d toss that out there before this turns into more than it needs to be. Another participant in this thread is threatening to cause problems as well.</p>

<p>Because they LIE to you and suppress the cures they find when they can&#39;t control it and make an assload of money off of curing you from diseases that are primarily caused by environmental factors which they completely avoid addressing.</p>
