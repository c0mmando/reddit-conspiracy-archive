        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">563</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-11-12 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/lovelustus.html">lovelustus</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I wrote a short essay/thingy called &quot;A generation consumed by sadness. The ramblings of a 27 year old.&quot; a few days ago and i was absolutely amazed by the response i received, these kinds of conversations need to be nurtured, instead we have them halted by a number of external sources (shills, deletion, vote rigging, user targeting, mass bot down voting).</p>

<p>This is unacceptable and i think it&#39;s against our own best interests to use a social network owned by <strong>Condé Nast</strong>, if you&#39;re trying to eat only sustainable food from local markets in hopes of stimulating the economy you wouldn&#39;t buy food at wallmart would you? So it seems rather ridiculous that we are using the wallmart of social networks to invoke some kind of systemic change.</p>

<p>So i&#39;ve taken it upon myself to use my talents to build a community free of all this bullshit, not only that but i think i can improve vastly on the design, user interactions and content discovery. I&#39;ve worked on apps/sites for pandora.com, espn, absolute vodka, nike, shopsavvy, ustream and renren just to name a few, my reason for telling you this isn&#39;t to brag or boast but to promote the quality and thoughtfulness of the community i&#39;ve begun building, this won&#39;t be some cookie cutter wordpress or druple blog. This is going to be a fully functioning reddit replacement for us.</p>

<p>Now with all of that said, let&#39;s start a discussion on what features we wan&#39;t for our community. I&#39;ll list a few below that i&#39;ve already started to build/design. Remember this is your community, i&#39;m open for anything as long as the community is behind it.</p>

<p><strong>Features thus far.</strong></p>

<p><strong>• No vote rigging.</strong></p>

<p><strong>• Democratically voted mods and mod elections.</strong></p>

<p><strong>• Democratically voted mod impeachment for abuse of any kind.</strong></p>

<p><strong>• No content manipulation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>• No shills (this is a challenge but i think i have a few options for this).</strong></p>

<p><strong>• Simple responsive design that works properly on all devices.</strong></p>

<p><strong>• User profiles with messaging system and follow functions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>• facebook / twitter / pinterest / email authentication (sign up and login).</strong></p>

<p><strong>• IP blocking and some pretty solid security features.</strong></p>

<p><strong>• Video and image hosting (no need for IMGUR and youtube uploading)</strong></p>

<p><strong>• protest and activism planning system that&#39;s completely private</strong></p>

<p><strong>• Verified accounts for both trusted users and shills, if you&#39;re verified as a shill you have limited privileges and restricted voting abilities.</strong></p>

<p>No feature idea is stupid and i&#39;m not opposed to paying out of pocket for devo help for certain features, the above features are features i know that i can personally build.</p>

<p><strong>Importent</strong> If advertising is ever sold on the site the profits are to be used on one of two things, PAYING MODS (yes i want to pay mods, i think this should help keep our site honest) and building new site features (ios/android app)</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> I&#39;m once again shocked by all the insanely positive feedback from our community and all the people reaching out to help is heartwarming. These comments are only adding to this overwhelming force pushing me to build this site and stimulate the community, we all need to be the change we seek.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you want a beta invite and once i get a little further on the build i&#39;ll send you an invite.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to respond to everyone of you, i&#39;m at the office so apologies for late responses. <strong>also please stop privately messaging me, i want everything to be completely candid and transparent through out this project. So please just comment on this post</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> The community has spoken, i&#39;m not going to use disqus for the comment engine. Thanks for the input guys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think defining the word &quot;shill&quot; would be a big first step. Calling someone a &quot;paid shill&quot; or even just a shill is one of the most intellectually dishonest  things you can do in an argument or discussion. Without some sort of verifiable proof that the accused is actually a paid shill, it is a meaningless accusation whose sole purpose is to shut down discourse.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any story with a record number of upvotes should never be allowed to be deleted, because obviously the hivemind likes it, controversial or not. Maybe at worst, have them relocated to a holding sub category where the discussion can continue or voted to the proper sub. I&#39;ve been reading about so many top stories being removed on what seemed like false technicalities.</p>

<p>Also, i&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s a good or bad thing that science and technology subs get raped by politically motivated stories. Sometimes I just want happy news about technology, but when the govt is up to something, the only thing in there are political stories on how the govt is fucking us, which I know already... </p>

<p>Also, maybe a way to filter stories in a sub per user, for example in the science sub, i&#39;m sick of seeings anything biology, i&#39;m all up for possible cancer and disease advances, but it&#39;s just not what i&#39;m into. Or internet piracy stories in technology, I&#39;m over it, it used to be fun in there until the govts started this censorship shit and all i ever saw was stories about losing my inet freedoms. I get it, we beed to be aware, but sometimes I just want happy news.</p>

<p>I GOT IT, have a happy/depressing option. All news that is about higher taxes, people dying, govt giving it to us up the ass, rich people taking our money, bombs over bagdad, can be filtered with a click of a button and cise versa for happy news. Let people vit if it&#39;s happy/depressing. I&#39;ll get my real world depressing news when I&#39;m ready, or watch mainstream media, but sometimes I just want to see a story about a coala bear being born or something happy and enlightening...</p>

<p>Make sure to come out with a killer slien blue style app or else I&#39;ll probablt never use your site :)</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>So would it be a matter of greater anonymity? Or greater transparency? Since I&#39;m clued out on how people manage to do it in the first place maybe these are dumb questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love your idea and goals. </p>

<p>One thought: <strong>Consider doing away with downvoting</strong>.</p>

<p>Why? Downvoting is effectively censorship, and is extremely prone to abuse. It is one of the biggest tools used by organized groups with an agenda to prevent articles / comments that <strong>they</strong> disapprove of from being seen by everyone.</p>

<p>I understand the reasoning behind downvoting, but personally I never downvote. If I like/agree with and article/post, I&#39;ll upvote. If I disagree, I&#39;ll leave it be - or post a rebuttal.</p>

<p>Downvoting is often used as a <em>coward&#39;s tool</em> to censor speech without justifying criticism, or offering an alternative viewpoint.</p>

<p>$.02</p>

<p>(Curious to see how many downvotes *<em>this</em> post gets)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was more the power submitter thing or whatever they called it. Removing the downvote only exacerbated that problem because the users also felt their ability to counter it was removed. I&#39;d be a fan of no downvote because it completely removes the ability of downvote brigades coming along and attempting to hide controversial submissions. It&#39;s a form of censorship and and we need none of that. The downvotes should stay for comments though.  </p>

<p>Do you think it should be the same way in politics? Unlimited up-votes AND down-votes, wherein down-votes <strong>cancel out</strong> up-votes and vice versa?</p>

<p>Revolutionary.</p>

<p>Imagine a four-way race for mayor where the candidates - John, Paul, George and Ringo - are all close in the running: You up-vote John (you <em>love</em> John!); down-vote Paul and Ringo (you <em>HATE</em> Paul and Ringo!) and cast no vote at all for George... because... <em>meh?</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anything helps and as i established above any and all investments/donations/contributions are to go directly back into the site or into the mods pockets. (i&#39;m never going to be a mod)</p>

<p>I would absolutely love to have enough time and resource to build a feature rich site with an iphone/ipad/android app, every future contribution brings us closure to that goal.</p>

<p>The thought of even a single individual donating to this project is worthy of some emotion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes this is my background and i&#39;m currently working as a creative director in san francisco (i can tell you for who via private message or email i can also send portfolio/resume links), i have 8 years of experience with some of the biggest startups and advertising agencies in the bay area / silicone valley.</p>

<p>I&#39;m serious enough to spend, so far $286 out of pocket on server costs, url and a few library assets (this number is obviously going to grow with scale and feature builds). i&#39;ve also been up EVERY night till about 4am working on this on top of working 8 hour days and i&#39;ve halted my two startup projects to free up my bandwidth for this project.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to poke at your interest, the site is now feature complete, i&#39;m grinding through the CSS, collecting and resolving bugs and making a promotional video. After all these items are complete i&#39;ll be pushing the site live. (i&#39;ll have this all finished by the weekend but i&#39;m planning on launching it on monday or tuesday)</p>

<p>I&#39;m beyond excited to release this and i just wanted to let you know that i truly appreciate your interest in this project, it&#39;s very easy to stay up every night from 3-5am when you&#39;re building something for such a supportive community. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend rethinking some of the basic assumptions about how this sort of site should be designed. Here are some of my thoughts:</p>

<p>It&#39;s great that anyone can easily create an account and participate on reddit. But it&#39;s bad that every account has equal influence on everyone else, except when moderators or admins take explicit action. The ability to use votes to influence specific other users should be earned, not given automatically. Or at least it should be possible to ignore the input of other users. By default each other user&#39;s vote should have a low or zero weight, and each user can choose which users&#39; votes they want to give greater weight to. </p>

<p>With this sort of approach the site does not need moderators. Let each user be their own moderator, using their own judgement along with the input of other users they respect. Most will choose to ignore spammers and trolls, but this would not be required. </p>

<p>Under this system, each user would have a different submission rankings, unlike reddit where at any given moment the rankings for each subreddit are the same for all users. </p>

<p>I wrote this out quickly. If you find these ideas interesting let me know and I can clarify. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How could we implement checks and balances of power in a website? I like this idea a lot, just to make it as free of corruption as possible measures have to be taken. How about Admins cannot be moderators, since if they&#39;re full-fledged staff it might not be possible to democratically elect them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m absolutely onboard with that, i&#39;ve already commented a few times saying that i have no intention of becoming a mod, allowing the owners of a site to also moderate it is just asking for a conflict of interest.</p>

<p>Not allowing admins to become mods paired with mod elections and impeachments might be the perfect cocktail for a corruption free community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if you could have subscribe-able (or ignorable) mods.   That way if you start getting a sense that a mod is promoting an agenda and suppressing info you just uncheck them and their moderation no longer has any effect on what you&#39;re seeing.</p>

<p>Conversely if you start to trust the good sense of certain users you can elect them as your own personal mods and let them filter out the nonsense.   So if user <em>blartybort123</em> thinks it&#39;s trash then I don&#39;t want to bother reading it.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve definitely come to the right place for support, best of luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some observations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Democratically electing mods etc sounds good, BUT I think you might run into the problem of finding quality mods. Basically mods do their modding because of the sense of power they get. If you have democratically elected mods and impeachment (and assuming this actually works) then you are decreasing the amount of power the mod has. With decreased power, then I think many would be mods won&#39;t bother. Why would anyone want to be a mod if all he can do is follow the rules and really not be able to <del>be an asshole</del> exercise power (seriously!). However, paying mods might circumvent this issue but then you open another can of worms.</p></li>
<li><p>fb/twitter/pinterest etc. logins. If this is the only option then count me out as a user. I never use sites that only have these options. I want to be able to be anonymous and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the only one. Reddits system for this is perfect, no fuss. I don&#39;t use Spotify for this reason. I don&#39;t want to risk that a comment I make on your site suddenly finds its way to my FB feed. Anonymity fosters honesty and candidness, there are also downsides though, but generally sites that don&#39;t have anonymity don&#39;t have as many comments and not the same quality.</p></li>
<li><p>IP blocking. You can not assume that an IP address can be used to identify a single user, so blocking based on IP is dangerous. Basically an IP address <em>often</em> can identify a single user but you can sometimes have 1000s of users behind a single IP address. Many small internet providers often do this because there is not enough IP addresses in the world so people have to share. Often a whole company with 100s of employees is behind a single (or a few) IP addresses, a whole college dorm can be behind a single one and so on. Even a family is usually behind a single IP address, and you might end up blocking 3 siblings in that family when only 1 has been &#39;bad&#39;. </p></li>
<li><p>No vote rigging. How will you accomplish this? Even with FB logins you can&#39;t because it is possible to buy 1000s of fake FB users for as low as 5$. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Good luck with it though, it&#39;s a good initiative!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope it works. And is as good as Reddit used to be. I hope there&#39;s anonymous posting and different communities like subreddits are here.</p>

<p>I know I have looked at other replacements and some of them just seem to be a scam for collecting emails and info. (I&#39;ve never verified my email even for Reddit.)</p>

<p>But I&#39;m looking forward to participating and supporting. My biggest worry is that if it works it will rapidly become too expensive to maintain. I know I tried to get Go1dfish, who is a programmer, to do something similar, but the potential costs deterred him. If it works you need to get some core users to help with server costs. I will do what I can, which will be a little but not nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really appreciate that you acknowledge the fact that owning a site/application is rather expensive. Luckily for us i&#39;ve been in this industry for 12 years and i&#39;ve accumulated a lot of business contacts, i know a couple startups with extra servers/racks and i&#39;ve already reached out to them, on top of that i have a pretty solid strategy for scaling this project so i&#39;m ready for literally anything (any amount of traffic)</p>

<p>If for whatever reason we did scale to that point just know that this is my baby and i rather shut off my servers than accept VC or seed from bad people. </p>

<p>It already works better than reddit and the design, functionality and mobile responsiveness blows reddit out of the water (plus i&#39;ve already started designing for an android/IOS app). Just keep in mind i&#39;m only one person with a limited amount of start up capital (i&#39;m funding this myself) so people shouldn&#39;t expect reddit speeds / page loads when we get slammed with users. But reddit makes most major sites look slow so that shouldn&#39;t be an issue, the site is still insanely fast and almost everything is ajax / ropo cached.</p>

<p>No shills (this is a challenge but i think i have a few options for this).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need counter shills. They are the ones pretending to be users, pretending to be shills, so they can plan with other shills, then 30 accounts get banned. Now compare that to where we are here, now.</p>

<p>Seems like an awfully closed group. How could we trust one another? Honestly, we can&#39;t. So we should probably have the content available to all, but posting content limited to specific accounts. </p>

<p>Shills will have to be identified as quickly as possible, but how? Disagreement with another is not proof of such, we&#39;d need some sort of guidelines from you for identifying such a threat.</p>

<p>Who would host this site for you, or would you run the box yourself?</p>

<p>I want to have 3 different account types that are earned through ongoing community interactions.

<p>There are because they require nothing in order to form, beyond 2 interested parties. But we can&#39;t be in &quot;find a shill&quot; mode and expect there to be an ordered discussion. As you point out, that is the most common occurrence of &quot;shilling&quot; as I&#39;ve seen it. That&#39;s why:</p>

<p>Disagreement with another is not proof of such, we&#39;d need some sort of guidelines from you for identifying such a threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This may be hard to implement (I&#39;m not a fancy computer guy like you) but what about a system where you can send accounts &quot;trophies&quot; from the community like: &quot;Helpful&quot; &quot;Informative&quot; &quot;Friendly&quot; &quot;Conversationalist&quot; &quot;Story Teller&quot; &quot;Funny&quot; Etc.

<p>It&#39;d be like Karma but more personalized.</p>

<p>Users then could chose to display their trophies next to their user name or give them special borders/skins/fonts when they post? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love the idea, but the only thing I will say is about your assertion that we shouldn&#39;t use the wallmart of social media.  </p>

<p>The problem is that yours is unlikely to have anywhere near the population of Reddit for quite some time.  And when it does, based on the premise, it&#39;s likely you&#39;re going to get a lot of like minded people there, which is good, but you&#39;re going to do a lot of preaching to the choir. </p>

<p>A place like Reddit has people from no political bent to every direction of political bent.  It also just has such a huge population that you&#39;re going to get info out to way more people.</p>

<p>I&#39;m totally behind your idea, and I will be one of your first members.  But I think we all need to continue to go on Reddit and Facebook and other large communities to spread the word to those who wouldn&#39;t normally hear it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/timetostartanew/comments/1lnhpk/brainstorming/">http://www.reddit.com/r/timetostartanew/comments/1lnhpk/brainstorming/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will echo the desire to see karma go away, at least in any sort of visible or persistent manner.
This might be an unpopular sentiment, but I strongly believe that the community should be pay to participate. Not a large amount, a one-time charge of a dollar or two should be enough to get the desired effect. The idea is to make it fairly painless to join the community and participate, but prohibitive to exert influence through bots and the like. Being banned would actually matter. Users buying accounts would require that moderation would have to be fair and transparent, necessary to a thriving online community in any case. For users that require anonymity, bitcoin could be an option. I think this would encourage a community of thoughtful participation.</p>

<p>You could have the community democratically decide on a few different worthy causes, and then members could choose which one they wanted their money to go to when they signed up.
Relatedly, the same process could be applied to any ad revenue the community generated(beyond what was required to pay for hosting/bandwidth). I think this would have a few knock-on benefits, the first being that people would be encourage to use the community more, as they would be aware that their ad-impressions were paying for solar water desalinators in africa or cancer research or whatever, which should make people feel less guilty for redditing the day away. Secondly, by making the community a philanthropic instead of for-profit enterprise, you remove the monetary incentive for corruption. (On the organization side, at least. People looking to drive traffic will still have plenty of incentive to do so.) Lastly, and most nebulously, I think that making philanthropy a part of the bedrock of the community would really help to foster a culture that feels empowered to effect positive change in the world.
To my mind, the aspect of reddit that I find most unpleasant is the constant defeatism and apathy. While I would love to be a member of content aggregation/discussion community that made the world a better place just through its use as an entertainment outlet, what I really hunger for is a community and platform that could come up with some novel means of improving our collective lives.</p>

<p>Would you be open to some experimental revenue generating methods outside of advertising? I&#39;ve had a concept bouncing in my head for a while that I think could be best applied to a discussion based community.</p>

<p>I do believe there&#39;s a way to motivate users to fund the site themselves, without overtly asking for funding.</p>

<p>A lot of what I&#39;m thinking about has to do with liquifying Karma, or Reputation as currency. </p>

<p>I&#39;d really love to participate as a beta, if possible.  I enjoy the actual debate and not have to sift through trollish posts, which always happens in such a large community.</p>

<p>And I have moderated some difficult sites successfully (as well as figured out how to deal with bad elements on some unmoderated sites), so I know how to participate when the right controls are in place.</p>

<p>Yeah, all of the above for me.</p>

<p>Also, if you haven&#39;t thought about it, the best way to prevent vote rigging is to just not allow down voting, that way when someone disagrees they actually have to participate which forces a dialogue on the issue.</p>

<p>I think it would be cool if the voting system was based on trends. Like each post starts with 3 stars, each vote calculating the average, with the star moving from 1 star to 5 stars, but not more or less.</p>

<p>So we won&#39;t have negative votes, it would go to one star, but the post will still be visible. </p>

<p>Second: there&#39;s a reason not many sites host images and videos directly on their site... I&#39;ll point you to 4chan. I think the owner has to deal with the FBI at least once a month, maybe 2, from the illegal things posted there... Because the images are also HOSTED there. It&#39;s safer and less of a headache to use external sites. But you&#39;ll figure this out soon enough</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may want to consider a distributed web system instead, where the content links are hosted in a P2P fashion.  You would still have a main domain, but anyone can run a local mirror of the site.  This would save on bandwidth, and you could build advanced logic that would allow more refined filtering.  Basically each user would be able to determine the filters or subscribe to multiple filters to help select the best content.  That way downvoting only impacts that user and the users who subscribe or follow his voting.  Those searching for the truth would be more apt at filtering out the shills that don&#39;t contributed to their endever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been having issues with the voting system on Reddit for awhile. I would love to have a different way to rate what I see. Say what I really feel. Either a rating system for the submissions, or getting rid of comment voting altogether. For links, maybe like a poll... One option should definitely be &quot;Repost&quot;, haha... Up and down is just too black and white. If you down vote something on the front page, it doesn&#39;t make a dent. At that point you try to comment to explain why and get down voted yourself. The current system is a good way to make trolls less visible but it is horrible in smaller subreddits. A good example is any sub for a TV show. The majority will post picture of the shows actors, having nothing to do with the show, and when you mention that it doesn&#39;t really belong there, you get down voted because &quot;it&#39;s cute&quot; or some other bs. </p>

<p>Anyways, best of luck! I can&#39;t wait to try out the new site, and I&#39;d love to be a beta tester/poster. I think I&#39;m in the mood for a change.</p>

<p>The rules must be very simple, it will be prohibited to make denigratory comments and annoying other serious posters about the OP topic, unless somebody is able to demonstrate with scientifical evidences that the theory is implausible / impossible to be progressed into exposition. </p>

<p>And of course all the Conspiracy theories posted must be plausible according to logic, and physically possible to exist.

<p>Ads to pay mods? Mods should not be laid at all, and you should avoid ads and ALL third party contributionn.</p>

<p>You have a great idea, and a lot of ambition and thats good. I encourage you further articulate the exact, mechanical priblem you are yrying to solve and solve that. Be careful how you word your requirements because it shapes your thought. In this regard, &quot;activism&quot; or &quot;vote rigging&quot; are vague and hard to solve problems. What is &quot;content manipulation&quot; and how would you prevent it? Isny manipulating or changing or contributing content the whole point? Now we have to consider what is objectivity in the first place, and that has nothing to do with building a web app.</p>

<p>I just feel it necessary to warn you because your hope and your effort is likely to be wasted if you start building too soon. Think Diaspora.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.</p>

<p>Do you think it should be the same way in politics? Unlimited up-votes AND down-votes, wherein down-votes <strong>cancel out</strong> up-votes and vice versa?</p>

<p>Revolutionary.</p>

<p>Imagine a four-way race for mayor where the candidates - John, Paul, George and Ringo - are all close in the running: You up-vote John (you <em>love</em> John!); down-vote Paul and Ringo (you <em>HATE</em> Paul and Ringo!) and cast no vote at all for George... because... <em>meh?</em></p>

<p>Interesting concept. I say we try it for 2014.</p>

<p>There are because they require nothing in order to form, beyond 2 interested parties. But we can&#39;t be in &quot;find a shill&quot; mode and expect there to be an ordered discussion. As you point out, that is the most common occurrence of &quot;shilling&quot; as I&#39;ve seen it. That&#39;s why:</p>

<p>Disagreement with another is not proof of such, we&#39;d need some sort of guidelines from you for identifying such a threat.</p>
