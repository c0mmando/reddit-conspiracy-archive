<p>but you guys.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKkRDMil0bw">this?</a></p>

<p>it has almost 70 upvotes with 10 down in the past 9 hours on this subreddit. look at the comments. the usernames. how sincere does it feel? </p>

<p>continue to do research on these different topics throughout reddit and youtube. it doesn&#39;t stop here. </p>

<p>does nothing bother you anymore? or have you all just stopped caring?</p>

<p>or did they makes us all stop caring?</p>

<p>i&#39;m not even sure i can believe in myself anymore because i&#39;m sitting here.</p>

<p>and i&#39;m scared.</p>

<p>Then we ask our interviewee: &quot;Since you say you are not a socialist but you feel the country is being socialized, why don&#39;t you do something about it?&quot; His response will rim: &quot;I&#39;m only one person. Besides it&#39;s inevitable. You can&#39;t fight city hall, heh, heh, heh.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t you know that the boys down at city hall are doing everything they can to convince you of that? How effectively can you oppose anything if you feel your opposition is futile? Giving your opponent the idea that defending himself is futile is as old as warfare itself. In about 500 B. C. the Chinese war lord-philosopher Sun Tsu stated, &quot;Supreme excellence in warfare lies in the destruction of your enemy&#39;s will to resist in advance of perceptible hostilities.&quot; We call it &quot;psy war&quot; or psychological warfare today. In poker, it is called &quot;running a good bluff.&quot; The principle is the same.</p>

<p>Seeing as this has managed to muster up a good 9 comments in 50 minutes... I think the key is more discussion threads on the new queue.</p>

<p>Not saying this and other subreddits haven&#39;t been the subject of attacks by shills and suspicious post deleting, but remember to take a balanced approach to life. Hunched over a keyboard, wallowing in fear, paranoia and distrust is what most of those in power LIKE a population to be, instead of living, interacting, and yes, propagating ideas and opinions, not to the choir of the net but to their fellow neighbors and family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, don&#39;t be afraid. :) Everything changes, nothing lasts forever. And that is a good thing. Most things get corrupted over time. Here on Earth, everything has a life cycle. People, plants, religions, machines, even civilizations. They rise, peak and then begin to decay. Of course, everything that came and went before helped to provide for and create all of the wonderful new things. That is something we can always count on: something new will always fill the void, nature abhors a vacuum. And as tiny pieces of this whole natural system, we adapt to an increasingly chaotic, ever-changing environment so seamlessly, with a passion and excitement that can and does change worlds, &quot;what&#39;s next!? Gimme more!&quot;. After all, we are the products of millions of years of the best adapters and survivors. We don&#39;t want to wear our childhood clothing into adulthood - in the same way, we really don&#39;t want to keep doing things the way we&#39;ve been doing them for ever and ever. Humans are naturally refreshed and rejuvenated when something new, bigger and better comes along, and it always will. Awakened individuals rarely go back to sleep, open the cage and that bird will fly free forevermore! Also, when people &quot;wake up&quot;, they don&#39;t depend on public forums for guidance nearly as much, that could be a factor in what you are indeed witnessing on the internet lately. Don&#39;t worry, everything is well and getting weller. </p>
