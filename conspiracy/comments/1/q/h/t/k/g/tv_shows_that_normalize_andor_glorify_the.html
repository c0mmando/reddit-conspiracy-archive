        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed a lot of obvious pro NSA propaganda written into a couple of TV shows I watch, and I feel it&#39;s an attempt to condition us to accept the mass spying going on today. In both series,  they show all &quot;the good&quot; the tech can be used for in fighting &quot;terrorists&quot; and dangerous criminals, and often demonstrates agents bending the rules in a situation for the &quot;greater good&quot;. There&#39;s a strong focus on &quot;trust the government- we have your best interest at heart&quot; and that often means violating your rights. It shows the high level spooks just trying to do the right thing and sometimes doing the right thing involves stepping around the law and due process. The two shows I&#39;m referring to are Blacklist and Marvel&#39;s Agents of Shield. </p>

<p>On last night&#39;s Blacklist episode,  the villain is the head of a group of hacker protestors who wear masks and make videos with voice altering technology threatening the establishment ... sound familiar?  Well they blow up airplanes and kill people and must be stopped by the good guy feds. The episode reeked of making Anonymous look like terrorists as well as the occupy movement. The shows make all the surveillance tools look so cool and we see the narrative of how the government protects us from the ever present terrorist threats. Both shows have had parts dramatizing a willingness of characters to be chipped for tracking.  Both shows have a theme that illustrates pro NWO thinking. I have to seriously question the writing on these shows ...has anyone else noticed this on these or other recent or past TV shows?</p>

<p>While interrogating a suspect, one of the characters said something snarky like &quot;You better fess up to this, or we&#39;ll put you in Guantanamo! I hear those force-feedings are good fun!&quot; Another gem was them using NDAA as a dialogue-device to coerce a suspect to give up info. </p>

<p>Real creepy stuff if you ask me. These are both serious issues regarding individual rights, and the casual disregard is unsettling. And it just goes <em>woosh!</em> over most everyone&#39;s head. </p>

Technically,  yes, the main characters are not gov.  employees anymore, but it still demonstrates the idea that spying on the public can be used to save citizens from perils, of which they are completely unaware. In other words, the practice of collecting raw data on all citizens has merit as long as its in the right hands. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agents of Shield is definately designed to paint the government in a good light. Heres a quick description of the show:</p>

<p>The lead member of a &quot;radical&quot; anti-establishment organization called The Rising Tide is recruited into a government job where she learns, one episode at a time, Shield aren&#39;t bad guys, they&#39;re just misunderstood, and yes, they really do need a lot of power to stop bad guys (Which they do all the time/that is their job). The main character often learns that full cooperation and trust in shield is the correct course of action after realizing the error of her ways. OP is right; they often do violate the rights of people, but its ok, they&#39;re the super secret super responsible government agency and they do those things because they &quot;have to.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m watching it because I really like Joss Wheadon, but the messages are really obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not my beef with the show. &quot;Realism&quot; in visual storytelling doesn&#39;t have to equate with &quot;events as they would happen in real life,&quot; but with an artistic rearrangement of events based in reality. The Sopranos and Breaking Bad are considered realistic shows even though the lives and events of their characters lives are fantastical. I&#39;d call The Wire hyper-realism, because the social conditions and violence depicted closely mirrored the actual realities of the drug trade in america.</p>

<p><strong>[spoilers]</strong> But Homeland is just straight up out there. I didn&#39;t watch it but I heard the second season ends with the CIA HQ getting blown up, assumedly by the sitting congressman/Al-qaeda spy double agent protagonist. That&#39;s bonkers. And it makes it even a little more insidious that they do a good job with Brody&#39;s motivation, how a person could find Islam, be exposed to the horrors from an occupied peoples perspective, and ultimately subscribe to Jihad. It&#39;s a perpetuation, not of simple stereotypes, but of a vast constructed perception of &quot;the enemy&quot; in it&#39;s many possible forms.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a well written show, I wouldn&#39;t begrudge anyone liking it, but ultimately I think it&#39;s the show that CBS wants to give the people. Whether people know it&#39;s fiction or not, that type of long-form story telling gets into out collective consciousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although the purpose of a TV commercial is to sell you something, it can often be very entertaining to watch. Conversely, the purpose of a TV program is to entertain, but can also be selling you something. If you see a TV character drinking a coke, you could rationalize it as a very common act and not take anything more from it.  However, most viewers today realize that it was &quot;product placement&quot; and very deliberate. Just like a message can be slipped into a plot. Product placement is effective without ever discussing the product benefits. It works on another level. I don&#39;t think you can easily dismiss  everything you see on a TV show as just for the purpose of entertainment, all the time. We should recognize it when it happens just like spotting an apple logo and knowing someone paid good money for you to see that instead of a Microsoft logo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strike back.  This show is still going on, but basically glorifies a totally secret group that goes around fighting &quot;the terrorists&quot; by any means available.  They torture and all the rest.</p>

<p>The biggest connection I&#39;ve seen is that the main &quot;bad guy&quot; is from Syria who is able to pair up with ANYONE, including the IRA to go and terrorize the world.  They cover all the usual places that harbor terror, and portray them all as against the &quot;british&quot; or in one instance, a banker funding the bad guys who is upset his own father helped the &quot;british empire&quot;.  Always against the brits and everything they&#39;ve done.  The bad guys do all the most horrible stuff while ignoring the &quot;good guys&quot; who do the same or worse.  They justify it through the usual rah, rah we&#39;re the righteous and do no harm and always for the right reasons.  Etc. etc.</p>

<p>They have all the most amazing usual spy tools available to spy and watch all their targets, but in one episode &quot;Hezbolah&quot; was able to &quot;jam their visuals&quot; in order to get away with something sneaky and ambush the main crew.  Such a load.</p>

<p>It is pure propaganda appealing to the usual mindless sex and violence the American public eat up.  Soft core sex scenes and lesbian shit too.  All nice to look at but its just candy for the ignorant.</p>

<p>Propaganda/programming through entertainment, it works for now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too, find that the message is very heavy handed in these series in compared to most I&#39;ve spent any time watching. It follows that the propaganda would get more blatant considering the stripping of people&#39;s rights and freedoms, and being straight lied to is also so upfront and in plain view these days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys already listed the big ones that I would&#39;ve said- </p>

<p>NCIS is some of the most obvious propaganda on American television</p>

<p>Person of Interest and Agents of Shield both utilize that &quot;rogue element&quot; of total information awareness so that the good guys can fight a sinister threat.  The Dark Knight did the same thing.</p>

<p>Homeland/24 are pretty obvious pentagon propaganda.</p>

<p>Law and Order even takes real cases and misrepresents them to make it more of a black and white good guy/bad guy dichotomy.  The SVU episode - Authority, which was based around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_search_prank_call_scam">Strip Search Prank Call Scam</a> really blew me away.  It&#39;s also a very interesting case when you realize how the guy was caught irl. <a href="http://lawandorder.wikia.com/wiki/Authority">http://lawandorder.wikia.com/wiki/Authority</a>  </p>

<p>Most special agent shows have some nerd hacker on the squad who has WAY too much access to information. Criminal Minds is another one.</p>

<p>I feel like CBS and CNN are both tied more directly to the agency than the other networks which are more closely affiliated to political parties.  So I decided to take look at CBS new line up to find a new show that would fit our discussion here.</p>

<p>This is what I found: <a href="http://www.cbs.com/shows/intelligence/">Intelligence</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>INTELLIGENCE stars Josh Holloway as a high-tech intelligence operative enhanced with a super-computer microchip in his brain. With this implant, Gabriel is the first human ever to be connected directly into the global information grid. He can hack into any data center and access key intel in the fight to protect the United States from its enemies.</p>
