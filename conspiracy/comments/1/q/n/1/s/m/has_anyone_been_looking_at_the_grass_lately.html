        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Western North Carolina here.  Has anyone seen thin filaments/fibers all over grassy surfaces lately?  Like, I understand spiderwebs as an explanation, but these long, thin fibers (that look <strong>exactly</strong> like spider webs) cover the <em>entire</em> surface of the grass.  Additionally, they&#39;re normally only visible when the sun is rising or setting, and you really need to be looking for them to see them.  Has anyone else noticed this?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Was asked to take pictures, so I did.  It appears as if they&#39;re not showing up in any of the pictures, except slightly in the second to last picture you can see a couple.  <a href="http://imgur.com/a/pTuRc">Here</a> is the album.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello fellas. I got this one. Turfgrass is my life. 100 percent. Went to school to get a turfgrass management degree, it&#39;s a real thing. 4 year bachelor of science degree. I work on golf courses and have for years. I distrust the federal govt as much as the next guy here but these are arthropod creations. Either spiders or webworms. Spiders and more specifically spiderlings can &quot;fly&quot; by letting out long thin strands of web and letting the breeze take them where it may. They can travel many miles and get pretty far up in the air too. They do this so mommy and daddy spider don&#39;t eat them. Angle of sun shows different amounts of detail throughout the day</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh really. Seems to me op could have simply googled this instead of putting it up here as a &quot;conspiracy&quot; and would have found it to be from migratory spiders. Soon as I read ops discription its all I could think. I live in southern arizona far from where there stypes of spiders are common and I&#39;ve seen them. I shall be back with a link if you insist but part of being a critical thinker is doing your own research not just trusting what is thrown at you.</p>

<p>it doesn&#39;t prove that they aren&#39;t spraying something as there are a lot of other indications as well that they are but it seems the &quot;species of spiders fly on strands the shoot out so these might be the landed strands&quot; is plausible</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do lots of perennial gardening and see stuff like what you are describing all the time. It very well could be spiders migrating or it could be something that is being sprayed. I also see lots of strange things happening to the leaves of trees and plants here in Michigan, after days of chemtrail spraying. This summer and last, we had holes burned through leaves and strange clear crystalline drops on fallen leaves. The crystalline spots turned a golden color after a few days and actually grew larger. The leaves themselves were a dark black and fell from otherwise healthy treetops. I took pictures of chemtrails almost every day for a couple of years but have pretty much given up getting anyone to pay attention to this. It&#39;s kind of like the Fukushima radiation problem. Most of this country is pretending like it&#39;s not happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>either brownbottle is remembering the name wrong and they weren&#39;t called angel tears or they are making something up because i can&#39;t find anything in quick online search about what angel tears supposedly are, there would be some conspiracy posts about them or some &quot;chemtrail debunking posts&quot; if it was a known substance called angel tears</p>

<p>eta this article that someone else here posted about mystery filaments falling from the sky says that some people have speculated they are spider webs or &quot;angel hair&quot;</p>
