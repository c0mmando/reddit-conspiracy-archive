      <p>
       I am an avid user of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . AVID. somewhat bemused by my obsession. Im fairly normal in most ways. I brush my teeth once, not twice a day. I enjoy a drink, and music, and I find myself magnetised to a box in my house that displays whatever information (filth or otherwise) whenever I want. 
 I'm of the generation that sort of wandered on to the internet, kicking an empty tin of coke along the street, waiting for something to happen, then saw a new complex that was being built and then sort of wandered in. 
I never wondered really. I was about 10 when it arrived, and not once did I say ''what is this new realm of understanding that lies before me?, How can I utilise this great abstract technological instrument to my benefit?".  Of course I didn't, I was fucking ten, and I just accepted it. And just like an impressionable, stupid preteen-teen, I sort of just saw it as MSN and  typing tits on google image. 
 Id'e like to say that I understand it now , but I think in understanding my naivety at that impressionable age, and understanding that I'm still that impressionable teen, inexperienced and learning in a new(er) age, that Im dealing with a social complexity that cannot be understood whilst existing within the paradigm.
 My mind has come awash with information in the last 8 years of using the likes of Wikipedia, Facebook, Google and most recently (and comprehensibly) Reddit.com and its all been a bit of a whirlwind. It's fair to say , I know more than I did before, when information was passed on that archaic stuff known as paper (sometimes even recycled!), but its equally fair to say , Im more fucking confused than I have ever been. 
  Its axiomatic that when one increases the diversity of where he/she receives his/her information, the more they will utter that effortless but profound word, why?
  Its never been more apparent than now. 'Why?' is the only important question. It's what brought us all to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . 'How' is generally what I get now when coming here. 'what'? and 'who'? . All the time. But 'Why'? I forgot about why and fell for the 'hows' and 'whats' and 'who's' after the first week or two of being here. I got obsessed with the detail. Hooked on knowledge. KNowledge that all proved to be arbitrary, and whats more , weaponised by the ones who seek to deceive us. You are in a swamp of misinformation and you know it. 
  You don't know what to believe because your rational self is too busy arguing about and sorting the 'who's' and 'whats' and 'hows' and all the while you come here to sponge up as much disjointed information/disinformation as possible to either eventually spout off to the nearest person at hand who won't hit you or worse,  yourself, as you walk around still asking that question why?
 This is what the power's that be (who we all know and all can agree on) want. They want you to be distracted by unimportant detail so that  you miss the structural problems that exist within the power structure. 
You felt something was wrong before you came here. And no matter what you hear on this each day passing about what impending doom you must worry about next, you will still come back wanting more answers. But to get to 'why', you have to look past the detail. You know enough because you feel the sense of injustice. You know that when you find it hard to get a job that pays your bills and when that job has no comprehensible relationship to reality that you've joined the game. And thats all it is. A terrible game.
   you are losing. And you will every time. And when you lose, your depressed, and when you're depressed, your vulnerable , and when you are vulnerable , you are easily manipulated, and considering that we have already worked out we live on what can only be explained as a human farm, we can conclude that herd mentality will ensue , thereby perpetuating the situation of apathy and helplessness. 
  This however is a community, and has provided me with tonnes of information to re-conclude my pre-existing thoughts/dispositions. I also get to read great articles written by independent writers who have a real passion for getting a message across, but due to the constant feed of disinformation that tries to split and deceive us as a collective humanist group, I implore and more so, dare you to ask the more profound questions, the real questions that lie at the foundations of this whole structure. And ignore the hearsay. we are all here for the same reason. We know the corruption, we know the lies. we need no more proof. Proof is what they want from US. 
We can continue cementing ourselves down the proverbial rabbit hole, or we can exult in the fact that we have seen and understood the profound collective spiritual change we know is within us, the breaking of chains to a demonic social and economic structure, and the reintegration with our inherent oneness. All that needs shared is our means of expressing beauty,intellect, creativity and togetherness amongst ourselves. The faster we can get our fellow brothers and sisters to wake up to this fact, will make all the difference. We won't do that with a continuous spiral or integrated information/misinformation, leading to a ''divide and conquer'' scenario. 
We might as well not wake up unless we get out of bed...

       Could only get through about a third or half of the wall of text - sorry - but the fact of the matter is that the statement in the OP is not even NEARLY accurate or correct.  The rabbit hold leads to a

        dead end?

       That's what you've gotten out of your searching so far?

       Well...I don't want to judge someone solely on their age.  I know that when I was 18, although I didn't know the things I know now, I'd say I had not a horrible grasp on certain critical things.

       I think you might have the incorrect meaning or application of the term "rabbit hole" here.  You don't want to be helped
       <em>
        out
       </em>
       of the rabbit hole.  You want to be helped
       <em>
        in
       </em>
       it.  You want to go IN it and see where it leads.  The rabbit hole is a metaphor for the hidden meaning behind the external and superficial aspects of existence most of us get indoctrinated into believing is ALL THERE IS.  The "proverbial rabbit hole" shows you that there is a LOT more going on than what we've been brain washed into believing is only the case.  Therefore, and as such, you want to be helped IN TO the rabbit hole - not out of it.

       Okay.  I'm a bit confused.  Not saying that this site doesn't have good info in it.  It very well might.  I'm saying that I kind of have no idea what it actually is.  What is it?  Explain to me like I'm five...
      </p>
      <p>
       The "main" page of it says this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That description of what the site is about honestly sounds a tad bit over my pay rate, as it went a little "whoosh" over my head.  I don't pretend to know much of anything about programming.  Even so, what are you saying is the relation that this site and web programming have to the rabbit hole?
      </p>

       Should have noted that I was agreeing with you and encouraging OP to learn about reddit formatting...HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really goofed here.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Markdown" is what reddit uses in their formatting and I pulled that link from below my comment box. Couldn't read OP's wall of text and sucked at my reply/comment, utterly!
      </p>
      <p>
       The rabbit hole is not for the weak willed, the weak kneed and perhaps those, like the OP,  should avoid; as they lean towards absolute peace.

      <p>
       A little confused about this last part though.  Who are you saying "lean toward absolute peace"?  Those who would do better to avoid the rabbit hole?  If so, I would offer that the only way toward true peace involves understanding
       <em>
        truth
       </em>
       - and one has a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       difficult time understanding truth
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       looking down into the rabbit hole.

       There are those that throw up there hands and declare nothing can be done so they're inclined to do nothing. Then some might react to any negative, rejecting that influence, while attempting to find a positive solution that precludes them from being overwhelmed or influenced by the negative, so they intuitively focus on the positive energy naturally.

       That seems like not a horrible step in a good/decent direction.  I'm personally the type that would much prefer to be burned to cinders in the fires of truth than to wade for

       I agree, but I also feel that such very much also applies to us as well in comparison to others who may be even much further along and more deeply aware than we ourselves might be.  One person's "knowledgeable expert" is another person's "rank neophyte".  It all depends upon who you place them along side and compare them to.

       Man , I've learned loads of this shit.  I can study it all day every day, but I can see it, I have a deeper understanding than I had. I've also moved on from this stuff. You must realise that there are a lot of people who come on here, who are immediately overwhelmed but the information thats here and therefore disregard it, or worse, buy into everything thats posted. Thats why we have Alex Jones. Thats why we have these flashy conspiracy news presenters who are in fact Zionist actors whose job is to mislead. 
You also must realise that no matter how much you learn, you're still naive, and with that realisation, you can move forward more cautiously.

       Sorry, Was hammered last night when I stumbled on to r/conspiracy. The lack of paragraphs is enough to make anyone turn away. (therefore i really appreciate your attempt)
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying that it doesn't have its uses knowing this stuff, and learning more etc. I have learned plenty being on here, but as i have stated, you have no way of filtering this information/misinformation maze. So I am urging people to remember what is important. That we awaken other people.
  Maybe its just my personal experience, but when you try and talk to people who don't know shit about this stuff, they tend to either be dismissive immediately (often the ones with the most interest in politics/history) or listen for a while , but then say ''but why would they do that?''.  This realisation led me to restructure how I approach the topic, because really, this is not a hobby or some separatist topic, it isn't some sort of esoteric club in itself. It's a movement in the way we think. I want the message to spread far, wide and fast , and I don't want these things to alienate people, so a broader understanding of the whole picture seems important. 
  If I'm not clearing this up for you I apologise. I think though that while we can get a lot of useful information here, we can get a lot of shit (probably what you're thinking of this haha) and the misinformation obscures the good. 
Things I think we should focus on
1.Educating people on power structures/previous Empires and the factors leading to their demise
2. Breaking the walls down/awakening using existential reasoning. 
3. helping people learn that fundamentally , the more you know, the more you learn you don't know. 
4. Trying to counter the whole isolating of ideas through terms used to segregate (conspiracy theorist etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think as concerned individuals, questioning individuals and as an organism, we can help these ideas spread fast once people are in the correct frame of mind to accept them. 
People are unaware of their entitlements as humans born of this planet, because as it turns out , people are 'ideas' creatures and readily adopt ideas if handed down from a supposed authority. It is very important that we break down that very concept. Authority has to be granted by the people, and if we are all better critical thinkers, we'll be far better at changing things.

       How can one awaken another if they themselves are still asleep though?  It's the blind leading the blind that way.  One must work on THEMSELVES and make sure that their

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Important messages tend often NOT to spread quickly though - especially if they are messages that require people to change a decent portion of their established world view (which many messages in this subreddit justifiably
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       ).  One's wanting that type of message to spread "quickly" might ensure that it actually doesn't get spread
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       .  A broader understanding of the whole picture IS indeed very important.  That broader understanding sometimes helps one understand, however, that it's a bit difficult to try to "force" anyone into understanding a truth that they might be entirely unwilling to accept.  That is part of the reason why it is of even greater importance to make sure and just educated YOURSELF and make sure that YOUR level of information is solid.  If your own level of knowledge is solid, then you will have a better chance of knowing what you're talking about when you DO begin to speak...and THAT'S when others will begin to listen...but they must do so of their
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       accord and not because you're being too heavy handed about trying to get them to listen to you.  It has to be because they themselves are at a point where they are ready to understand things on their own and they
       <em>
        seek out
       </em>
       the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The job of those individuals that have an idea of what's going on, therefore, is not to try to convince others of anything, but to simply put the information out their, understanding that many WILL end up rejecting the message.  Those that are ready to receive it, however, will come forward - but not because they're forced.  They'll come forward because the message speaks to them on its own.

      <p>
       The fact of the matter, however, is that humans AREN'T "entitled".  They/we are no more entitled than any other being on this planet - and THAT'S the problem...a huge, huge problem.  Human beings feel a sense of entitlement that entirely negates the worth and entitlement of so many OTHER creatures - and hell, of EACH OTHER - to such an extent that for anyone to
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       humans to be "aware of their entitlement" threatens everything on this planet even more than things already are.  I would say not that humans should be aware "of their entitlements".  They/we should be aware of the fact that we are all one family - and by "we" I don't just mean humans.  I mean
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       creatures great and small - and, as such, we should ALL have entitlements.  We should work toward elevating everything and everyone.  Easier said than done, but valid nonetheless.

       Agreed...but most of us are a lot further away from being valid critical thinkers than we would like to think.

       You don't appear to be saying anything coherent. Is this intentional? Are you trolling here? If not, you should learn to express yourself more concisely, and to use paragraph breaks.

       I was hammered drunk last nite after an Irish trad session. I apologize for my lack of coherence. Ill summarise.
  We are all well intentioned individuals who all share the same quality. We are dissatisfied with the status quo and we have thus found our way to information that allows us to confirm and understand these inherent wrongs. This is great and the more people, the better. However we also are running a huge risk of being mislead. And many of us I fear have been. 
All I am saying is that we must be careful and understand ourselves before getting too bogged down in every story. I also think that to get the message to the wider community, outside r/conspiracy, we should think about the driving factors that lead humans to be so apathetic when hearing of these terrible injustices. And we have to help people unlearn a lot. Because a lot of this information is deep, deep shit and its important to have the right frame of mind to deal with it.

       Sorry, Was hammered last night when I stumbled on to r/conspiracy. The lack of paragraphs is enough to make anyone turn away. (therefore i really appreciate your attempt)
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying that it doesn't have its uses knowing this stuff, and learning more etc. I have learned plenty being on here, but as i have stated, you have no way of filtering this information/misinformation maze. So I am urging people to remember what is important. That we awaken other people.
  Maybe its just my personal experience, but when you try and talk to people who don't know shit about this stuff, they tend to either be dismissive immediately (often the ones with the most interest in politics/history) or listen for a while , but then say ''but why would they do that?''.  This realisation led me to restructure how I approach the topic, because really, this is not a hobby or some separatist topic, it isn't some sort of esoteric club in itself. It's a movement in the way we think. I want the message to spread far, wide and fast , and I don't want these things to alienate people, so a broader understanding of the whole picture seems important. 
  If I'm not clearing this up for you I apologise. I think though that while we can get a lot of useful information here, we can get a lot of shit (probably what you're thinking of this haha) and the misinformation obscures the good. 
Things I think we should focus on
1.Educating people on power structures/previous Empires and the factors leading to their demise
2. Breaking the walls down/awakening using existential reasoning. 
3. helping people learn that fundamentally , the more you know, the more you learn you don't know. 
4. Trying to counter the whole isolating of ideas through terms used to segregate (conspiracy theorist etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think as concerned individuals, questioning individuals and as an organism, we can help these ideas spread fast once people are in the correct frame of mind to accept them. 
People are unaware of their entitlements as humans born of this planet, because as it turns out , people are 'ideas' creatures and readily adopt ideas if handed down from a supposed authority. It is very important that we break down that very concept. Authority has to be granted by the people, and if we are all better critical thinkers, we'll be far better at changing things.
