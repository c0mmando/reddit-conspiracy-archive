<p>I will be posting various conspiracies from history, a short description of each, and mainstream sources (Wikipedia mostly, seeing as non mainstream sources are usually considered &quot;crazy conspiracy websites&quot;). </p>

<p>Operation Snow White was the Church of Scientology&#39;s internal name for a major criminal conspiracy during the 1970s to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder L. Ron Hubbard. This project included a series of infiltrations and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, as well as private organizations critical of Scientology, carried out by Church members, in more than 30 countries. It was the single largest infiltration of the United States government in history with up to 5,000 covert agents.</p>

<p>Hubbard suffered further ill-health, including chronic pancreatitis, during his residence at Whispering Winds. He suffered a stroke on January 17, 1986, and died a week later. His body was cremated following an autopsy and the ashes were scattered at sea. <strong>Scientology leaders announced that his body had become an impediment to his work and that he had decided to &quot;drop his body&quot; to continue his research on another planet,having &quot;learned how to do it without a body&quot;.</strong></p>

<p>What I find even more terrifying is the fact that this could be done on a much larger, much more covert scale given more money and more time. Operation Snow White just shows that its possible and that people should stop denying that everything is truly hidden from the populous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think that the church of Scientology might have stolen tapes of tom cruise and perhaps John travolta having rough sex with under age boys in this or subsequent raids. There is a man in England, or he has fled England now actually, but he claims that as a child actor in london he would attend parties with politicians and in this one case Tom cruise. Apparently Tom cruise took a fellow aspiring child actor into a bedroom and they heard loud screaming and sex noises.. </p>

<p>A 15-year-old girl named “Nayirah” testified before the U.S. Congress that she had seen Iraqi soldiers pulling Kuwaiti babies from incubators, causing them to die. The testimony helped gain major public support for the 1991 Gulf War, but — despite protests that the dispute of this story was itself a conspiracy theory — it was later discovered that the testimony was false. The public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton, which was in the employ of Citizens for a Free Kuwait, had arranged the testimony.  It turned out that she had taken acting lessons on request of the CIA and was actually the niece of a major politician in Kuwait.</p>

<p>On August 2, 1964, three North Vietnamese torpedo boats attacked a US destroyer, the USS Maddox. The boats reportedly fired torpedoes at the US ship in international waters in the Gulf of Tonkin, about thirty miles off the Vietnam coast. On August 4, the US Navy reported another unprovoked attack on the USS Maddox and the USS Turner Joy._Within hours, President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered a retaliatory strike. As the bases for North Vietnamese torpedo boats were bombed, Johnson went on TV and told America: &quot;Repeated acts of violence against the armed forces of the United States must be met not only with alert defense, but with a positive reply. That reply is being given as I speak tonight.&quot; The next day, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara assured Capital Hill that the Maddox had only been &quot;carrying out a routine mission of the type we carry out all over the world at all times.&quot; McNamara said the two boats were in no way involved with recent South Vietnamese boat raids against North Vietnamese targets.</p>

False flag would imply that the US Navy shot at or sabotaged its own ships and blamed it on Vietnam. In reality, they were shooting at ghosts and radar signals that turned out to be inaccurate. The White House basically ignored the cautions that the attack might not actually have happened. 
I&#39;m not saying the gov&#39;t was totally clean on this one, but accuracy is crucial. It wasn&#39;t a false flag attack. </p>

<p>As far as today&#39;s celebrity culture goes, if they&#39;re not part of the program, there are a lot of someones who go through a lot of effort to make people <em>think</em> they are. Today&#39;s culture is rife with symbolism, and I have to think it&#39;s partially because of how much is going on, and also partially the accompanying whitewash to throw people off the scent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, the symbolism is blatant and everywhere.  The question is who&#39;s putting it there, how organized is it, and what are their objectives.</p>

<p>The conflict I always have is this: assuming this is as widespread and nefarious as I often fear (and as it appears to be to any sane, open-minded person), how is it that none of the big celebrities have come out and said anything about it (I&#39;m talking Satanic pedophile sex rings, corrupting the minds of the country, MKULTRA-controlled celebrity beta kittens, etc.)?

    <div class="md"><p>First, consider the kind of person it takes to <em>want</em> to be a celebrity and have the ability to carry it through. </p>

<p>Second, there&#39;s plenty of shady murders in Hollywood to be able to point to a culture of death that you sign on to when you get your contract. Very important, very powerful people managing their empires will do unscrupulous things if they know they can get away with it. Hollywood and Washington D.C. are a lot alike. </p>

<p>Third, you&#39;re asking people who&#39;s entire career is predicated on image to sacrifice that to be mocked in the media and then risk death, injury, and/or financial ruin. It&#39;s kind of a raw deal for celebrities, even if they want to talk. They would have to be okay with giving up their very plush lives, and they&#39;d have to accept that if they do, there&#39;s a very good chance it won&#39;t make a difference. Especially stateside. </p>

<p>There&#39;s been some of the higher level pedophile ring exposures in the news globally, but here in the US, it&#39;s very hush hush because of who&#39;s traditionally involved. </p>

<p>So how does someone who&#39;s entire identity is made by and dependent on the system they want to destroy come to terms with that and make a choice that&#39;s, for all intents and purposes, against their best interests?</p>

<p>And Americans think celebrities are rich because they&#39;re <em>important</em>. Hah. </p>

<p>From the hundreds (arguably thousands?) of &quot;household names&quot;, wouldn&#39;t you expect one of their consciences to get the better of them later in life or something?

    <div class="md"><p>Why are we waiting on celebrities, is what I&#39;ve been asking for YEARS? </p>

<p>The American people THEMSELVES are apathetic to the hot mess they&#39;ve found themselves in as a collective society. We are run by psychopaths bent on making each one of us play their little games, and Americans (alleged occupiers of the Land Of The Free And The Home Of The Brave) shrug their shoulders, play their role, and secretly wish for a superhero savior to come on the scene that they can all get behind. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s the story of why Americans still vote, but I digress. </p>

<p>It is up to each and every one of us to do our part in the silent rebellion, no matter how trivial or small-scale it may be. And that is because the true battlefront is our KIDS minds and THEIR KIDS minds. What we tell them about the world and how it works shapes the future. </p>

<p>And the only people I see telling the kids anything these days are all on the television. That&#39;s bad news, and we need to start being a counter-force to the propaganda that spews forth daily. </p>

<p>Because if we&#39;re waiting on celebrities to do anything that doesn&#39;t first benefit them, we&#39;ve already lost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you.  The next war won&#39;t be fought on a battlefield, it&#39;s being waged right now.  It&#39;s a war on consciousness itself - on truth itself.  I&#39;ve become very aware of that fact over the last year or two.</p>

<p>I try to do my part to spread awareness, peacefulness, truth, freedom - but I&#39;m only one person.  More often than not I&#39;m met with derision, disbelief, apathy, anger.  People truly just <em>don&#39;t care</em> and those that do react with fear, skepticism (it can&#39;t <strong>possibly</strong> be as bad as you say it is..), even anger.</p>

<p>I agree with you that we shouldn&#39;t be <em>waiting</em> on celebrities but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not <em>hoping</em> that one, some, or all of them (along with everyone else in the world) will come around eventually and help us (people like you and I) out.  It&#39;s lonely out here in this sea of sharks trying to muddy the waters.</p>

<p>In any event, I&#39;m here, my mind is my own, and I&#39;m not going anywhere.  I&#39;ll keep speaking my mind without fear for as long as I&#39;m able to and I can only hope that others will do the same.  Truth wins out in the end, I believe that.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s lonely. </p>

<p>You have to remember that you can only speak the truth you know. How you stay close to the truth is that you stay hungry for it, and remain open to new information. </p>

<p>Also keep in mind, when talking to other people; maybe they&#39;re not ready to hear what you have to say. Maybe you&#39;re just the 6th person to mention an idea they won&#39;t accept until they hear it the 9th time. Accept that everyone has a different walk from you, and that you can only reach those that are ready to learn, with ears to hear. This mindset is the winning one, and it can be hard. But it&#39;s rewarding when you find others that can renew your dedication to understanding and enlightenment. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why <em>I&#39;m</em> still here. Maybe it will help you too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point about &quot;maybe they just aren&#39;t ready yet&quot;, it&#39;s just so hard for me to fathom how anyone could, for instance, look into 9/11 for an hour (probably less) and not come away from it <em>knowing</em> that something (really many things) about the official story isn&#39;t (and aren&#39;t) right.</p>

<p>And yet there are still people today who deny the truths that are staring them right in the face every second of every day just because it&#39;s uncomfortable for them.

<p>As far as staying open to new information, I was actually just talking to someone else on here a little while ago and I was reminded of the Socrates quote (paraphrased): &quot;I know that I know nothing.&quot;  That&#39;s how I stay open-minded to all things, no matter how &quot;crazy&quot;.  So many things have been kept from us, so many unsolved mysteries of the world, so many contradictions in quantum physics and religion, etc.  How can anyone really claim to <strong>KNOW</strong> any absolute truths with any certainty?

<p>I used to work late shift in a firm with a few other guys. And we&#39;d get real bored and theorize on everything. Myself and another guy were the &#39;conspiracy nuts&#39;, and we&#39;d get really effing out there with conceptualizing the Great Work some nights. </p>

<p>One of the other guys was an ex-Marine, ex-Cop. He started off real skeptical about our theories, and because we wouldn&#39;t shut up, he&#39;d start researching what we were saying to prove us wrong. Sometimes he did, sometimes he had to admit we were on to something. </p>

<p>After a long shift of going round robin on 9/11, he dropped on us one of the most profound insights into the American psyche I&#39;ve ever personally witnessed, and he&#39;ll forgive me for paraphrasing;</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So let&#39;s say you guys are right, and the government did it or let it happen. That changes everything I know, everything I&#39;ve ever sworn to. That means everything I know about life in America is a lie. That means that I shouldn&#39;t be here right now talking to you guys about it, that I should be figuring out how to pack up my kids and my wife and get the hell out of town. That means I need to be securing supplies, tilling land, and cleaning guns. That means I have to change everything. And that means I have to be SURE that you&#39;re right. Because I can&#39;t change my whole life on a theory.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn&#39;t fault him for that stance, and neither should you. There are a lot of Americans for whom the current system works <em>well enough</em>. They hope if they keep their heads down, go along to get along, and pay their taxes, they can expect these problems with our country to right themselves. </p>

<p>The problem is that is exactly what the power structure is counting on, complicit apathy. It&#39;s not for everyone to rebel, but it is for all Americans to be informed and aware of what is being done in their names to their neighbor and to the world. Your role in history is your own, you cannot force others to choose theirs. But it is part of your job to understand why someone else might choose a different path, and also to decide when to pursue them with the truth and when to leave them to their fate. </p>

<p>On a final note, that same ex-Marine, ex-Cop eventually admitted to us that his dream was to move to the northwoods to hunt Bigfoot, and last I heard, he was working on opening up his own Survival Goods shop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great anecdote, man - thanks for sharing.  I&#39;ve honestly never considered it from that perspective and I have to say, in some ways, it makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>It was a slow progression even for myself but, at a certain point, it just starts to become obvious that there&#39;s something more going on.  I&#39;ll give an anecdote of my own: around the time when I was first getting into this stuff (the Aurora shooting was the first time I ever watched the news and was like, &quot;hmm.. that doesn&#39;t add up at all), I brought up the Bilderberg group among some friends over a few beers and their reactions were weird enough that I had to dig deeper.  None of them had ever heard of it before yet they seemed to just instinctively have an aversion to talking about it.  They got all uncomfortable and kept trying to change the subject or downplay it to the point that I began to question, &quot;Why is it so hard for them to even <em>consider</em> the implications of this?&quot;</p>

<p>I think most people do realize that something about this world is just a little <em>off</em> - something isn&#39;t right - so why isn&#39;t anyone doing anything about it?  Hell, why isn&#39;t anyone even <em>talking</em> about it?</p>

<p>And the answer I came to and keep coming back to is: <strong>fear</strong>.  Fear of death, fear of the unknown, fear of darkness, fear of evil, fear of truth.  It all comes back to fear.</p>

<p>Again, not sure exactly where I&#39;m going with this - it&#39;s just rare finding someone on here who&#39;s actually willing to discuss these things.  More often than not I find myself banging my head against a wall with people whose only interest is in refuting everything I say regardless of its merit.</p>

<p>Fear is the order of the day. If you still watch the television, you won&#39;t even notice, you&#39;ve become so used to it. But all day long it&#39;s FEAR. Learn about the 5 foods that are killing you, today in Syria - civil war and how it affects you at home, is Obama the Anti-Christ, the War On Christmas, look at what those people have that you don&#39;t have, and any number of leading drug and drugs posing as foodstuffs ads. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right on the money, there&#39;s an entire infrastructure in place to keep Americans scared. And it&#39;s working. </p>

<p>Which is why it&#39;s important for people who seek the truth to remain a patient polished stone in the river of lies, so that when someone seeks a warm dry spot from which to gain perspective, you can be ready. </p>

Most of them end up dead, but also you have to remember that they could possibly be under mind-control and don&#39;t even realize what they are doing.

    <div class="md"><p>1953: Operation Ajax</p>

<p>Operation Ajax was the plan successfully executed by the CIA to overthrow the democratically-elected Iranian government of Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq, in 1953.</p>

<p>The target was not an oppressive Soviet puppet but a democratically elected government whose populist ideology and nationalist fervor threatened Western economic and geopolitical interests. The CIA&#39;s covert intervention—codenamed TPAJAX—preserved the Shah&#39;s power and protected Western control of a hugely lucrative oil infrastructure. It also transformed a turbulent constitutional monarchy into an absolutist kingship and induced a succession of unintended consequences at least as far ahead as the Islamic revolution of 1979</p>

<p>Project MKUltra is the code name of an illegal U.S. government human research operation experimenting in the behavioral engineering of humans through the CIA&#39;s Scientific Intelligence Division. The program engaged in many illegal activities; in particular it used unwitting U.S. and Canadian citizens as its test subjects, which led to controversy regarding its legitimacy. MKUltra involved the use of many methodologies to manipulate people&#39;s mental states and alter brain functions, including the surreptitious administration of drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as various forms of torture.</p>

<p>Queen Lili&#39;uokalani was selected as the successor to King Kalākaua by Kalākaua upon his election in 1874. During her brother&#39;s reign the monarchy was left impotent by the Bayonet Constitution of 1887. In 1893, American businessmen organized in response to an attempt by Lili&#39;uokalani to subvert the 1887 constitution, and took over the government of the Kingdom of Hawai&#39;i. American troops aboard the USS Boston landed in Honolulu to protect American lives and property, while Sanford B. Dole and Lorrin A. Thurston&#39;s Committee of Safety, a 13 member council of businessmen, organized the Honolulu Rifles to depose Queen Lili&#39;uokalani. The overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii it&#39;s subsequent annexation, the Spanish American war, and American policy in The Philippines after the war are sometimes cited as examples of American imperialism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>American imperialism is absolutely a thing. Right from the days where Americans rejected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Proclamation_of_1763">King George&#39;s proclamation</a> of not crossing the Appalachian mountains to the occupation of the Philippines. </p>

<p>The only difference is whereas many other former imperial powers (such as Britain, France) accept their histories the US is often the only nation to implicitly reject any notions of imperialism or anything bad ever. </p>

<p>Which is why this thread itself is just American historical events that are called &quot;conspiracies which are true&quot;. They would just be historical events if the US actually admitted its history like everyone else. </p>

It was not some crazy theory put forth by a conspiracy theorist with zero evidence, it was a plan approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Anyone can make any assumptions of what became of the plans post-rejection but that doesn&#39;t make it truth.  Yes, it is very noteworthy (and scary) that the Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously approved the operation, but clarifying that this particular event didn&#39;t actually occur is important.  </p>

<p>If you want to be taken seriously and not labelled a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;, it means all of the information you try to spread needs to be accurate and truthful.  If you expose 99 truths about the gov&#39;t and propose 1 lie (essentially propaganda in the other direction), you&#39;re immediately losing credibility on the 99 truths which is something we sure as hell don&#39;t need and can&#39;t afford right now in trying to expose the truth to more citizens.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1932: The Business Plot</p>

<p>The Business Plot was an alleged political conspiracy in 1933. Retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler claimed that wealthy businessmen were plotting to create a fascist veterans&#39; organization and use it in a coup d&#39;état to overthrow President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt, with Butler as leader of that organization. In 1934, Butler testified to the Special Committee on Un-American Activities Congressional committee (the &quot;McCormack-Dickstein Committee&quot;) on these claims.[1] In the opinion of the committee, these allegations were credible.[2] No one was prosecuted.</p>

<p>While historians have questioned whether or not a coup was actually close to execution, most agree that some sort of &quot;wild scheme&quot; was contemplated and discussed.</p>

<p>Chicago’s business community had also been organizing, with the Citizens Committee on Public Expenditures (CCPE) as the result. With the support of the CCPE, the banks had consistently refused to lend any more money to the hard pressed Chicago schools. It was essentially a banker’s coup with even the CCPE admitting they had “taken charge”. But even after their downtown offices were wrecked, the banks continued to arrogantly set school policy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1763: Small pox infected blankets given to Native Americans</p>

<p>In response to the 1763 uprising known as Pontiac&#39;s Rebellion, Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst suggested using smallpox as a weapon for ending the rebellion. In a series of letters to his subordinate Colonel Henry Bouquet, the two men discussed the possibility of infecting the attacking Indians with smallpox through gifts of blankets that had been exposed to the disease. Apparently unbeknownst to both Amherst and Bouquet, the commander at Fort Pitt had already attempted this very tactic. Although Amherst&#39;s name is usually connected with this germ warfare because he was the overall commander and because of his correspondence with Bouquet, evidence appears to indicate that the attempt was made without Amherst&#39;s prior knowledge.</p>

Like Acoustic Kitty isn&#39;t really a &quot;conspiracy&quot; just a poor attempt as international espionage.  The Stargate Project was just secret research into remote viewing.  Conspiracy, to me, implies cooperation amongst a nations leaders to fool their constituents.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1950s:Operation Mockingbird </p>

<p>Operation Mockingbird was a secret campaign by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to influence media. Begun in the 1950s, it was initially organized by Cord Meyer and Allen W. Dulles, it was later led by Frank Wisner after Dulles became the head of the CIA. The organization recruited leading American journalists into a network to help present the CIA&#39;s views, and funded some student and cultural organizations, and magazines as fronts. As it developed, it also worked to influence foreign media and political campaigns, in addition to activities by other operating units of the CIA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1963: Assassination of John F. Kennedy</p>

<p>The circumstances surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963 spawned suspicions of a conspiracy. 
Subsequent official investigations confirmed most of the conclusions of the Warren Commission. However, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy, with &quot;...a high probability that two gunmen fired at [the] President.&quot; No person or organization was identified by the HSCA as being a co-conspirator of Oswald. Most current theories put forth a criminal conspiracy involving parties as varied as the CIA, the mafia, anti-Castro Cuban exile groups, the military industrial complex, sitting Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Cuban President Fidel Castro, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, the KGB, or some combination of those entities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The killing of kennedy is less interesting than the story of how Kennedy became president in the first place, as a pawn of his father Joe Kennedy.
Joe robbed banks from the inside, using inside information, a bit of extortion,and funds stolen from his relatives to buy his first bank. He bought more banks and diversified into RKO (one guy wouldn&#39;t sell so he had him framed for rape), real estate and alcohol during and after prohibition. He bankrolled FDR&#39;s campaign and later came close to running against him, but decided he&#39;d use his sons instead. When Jack sank his pt boat Joe pulled strings so he got a medal and a movie instead of a court-martial.  He bought jack a pulitzer. Later he bought him the west virginia primary as a result of which which he got enough primary delagates to beat LBJ&#39;s convention delagates.   </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleiwitz_incident">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleiwitz_incident</a></p>

<p>From the wiki:</p>

<p>&quot;The Gleiwitz incident was a staged attack by Nazi forces posing as Poles on 31 August 1939, against the German radio station Sender Gleiwitz in Gleiwitz, Upper Silesia, Germany (since 1945: Gliwice, Poland) on the eve of World War II in Europe.</p>

<p>This provocation was the best-known of several actions in Operation Himmler, a series of unconventional operations undertaken by the SS in order to serve specific propaganda goals of Nazi Germany at the outbreak of the war. It was intended to create the appearance of Polish aggression against Germany in order to justify the subsequent invasion of Poland.&quot;</p>

<p>Documents obtained in 2012 reveal that the government did indeed directly collaborate with Corporate America to infiltrate and eventually shut down Occupy protests nationwide. Coordination occurred through the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_Security_Alliance_Council">Domestic Security Alliance Council</a>&quot;. <a href="http://www.justiceonline.org/commentary/fbi-files-ows.html">According to the Partnership for Civil Justice</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Documents released show coordination between the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and corporate America. They include a report by the Domestic Security Alliance Council (DSAC), described by the federal government as “a strategic partnership between the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the private sector,” discussing the OWS protests at the West Coast ports to “raise awareness concerning this type of criminal activity.” The DSAC report shows the nature of secret collaboration between American intelligence agencies and their corporate clients - the document contains a “handling notice” that the information is “meant for use primarily within the corporate security community. Such messages shall not be released in either written or oral form to the media, the general public or other personnel…” (The DSAC document was also obtained by the Northern California ACLU which has sought local FBI surveillance files.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve in Richmond appears to have had personnel surveilling OWS planning. They were in contact with the FBI in Richmond to “pass on information regarding the movement known as occupy Wall Street.” There were repeated communications “to pass on updates of the events and decisions made during the small rallies and the following information received from the Capital Police Intelligence Unit through JTTF (Joint Terrorism Task Force).”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Jackson, Mississippi division of the FBI attended a meeting of the Bank Security Group in Biloxi, MS with multiple private banks and the Biloxi Police Department, in which they discussed an announced protest for “National Bad Bank Sit-In-Day” on December 7, 2011.</p>

<p>German Army (Heer) officers General Friedrich Olbricht, Major General Henning von Tresckow, and Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg modified the plan with the intention of using it to take control of German cities, disarm the SS, and arrest the Nazi leadership once Hitler had been assassinated in the July 20 Plot. Hitler&#39;s death (as opposed to his arrest) was required to free German soldiers from their oath of loyalty to him (Reichswehreid). After lengthy preparation, the plot was carried out in 1944, but failed.</p>

<p>An attempt by a group of provincial English Catholic extremists to kill King James I of England, his family, and most of the Protestant aristocracy in one attack by blowing up the Houses of Parliament during the State Opening. Guy Fawkes Day is named after one of the (lesser) conspirators and is celebrated with fireworks.

<p>The Lavon Affair refers to a failed Israeli covert operation, code named Operation Susannah, conducted in Egypt in the Summer of 1954. As part of the false flag operation,[1] a group of Egyptian Jews were recruited by Israeli military intelligence for plans to plant bombs inside Egyptian, American and British-owned civilian targets, cinema, library and American educational center. The attacks were to be blamed on the Muslim Brotherhood, Egyptian Communists, &quot;unspecified malcontents&quot; or &quot;local nationalists&quot; with the aim of creating a climate of sufficient violence and instability to induce the British government to retain its occupying troops in Egypt&#39;s Suez Canal zone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1973-1974+: Project Azorian - Glomar Explorer</p>

<p>Howard Hughes, at the behest of the CIA built a ship with the singular, secret purpose of retrieving a sunken Russian Sub intact.  The cover story for this was specialized mineral extractions from the bottom of the ocean.  The sub reportedly broke up before making it to the surface during the retrieval attempt.  I have always assumed this was just further cover and that in fact they did get the sub.  One interesting aspect of this is that Russian ships disguised as trawlers and commercial boats, were monitoring the Glomar Explorer&#39;s actions during the operation.  They didn&#39;t buy the cover of mineral exploration story.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomar_Explorer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomar_Explorer</a></p>

<p>Editorializing:</p>

<p>One my favorites because as a child I was into planes and worshiped Howard Hughes.  It&#39;s also an example of why you can&#39;t get to the bottom of really ANY of these rabbit-holes.  There are some things that are just too &#39;big&#39; to keep completely in the dark, so some kind of &#39;legit&#39; and believable purpose that people are more willing to swallow is put forward most notably NASA, Nuclear Power plants and the US Wehrmacht (yeah, I just went there - you think Shock and Awe is any different kind of PR than Blitzkreig?) and if a conspiracy comes out later, I generally bet on that being planned, further cover for the true purpose.  UFOlogists and Benghazi, I&#39;m looking at you.  We are in a Global Nash Equilibrium where all participants act in the most unpredictable fashion possible.  Keep sending spies to retrieve some information, over and over, hopefully getting killed in the attempts - when we&#39;ve already got the information, or it comes from an informant we are trying to protect - &quot;The US must not have this information yet, they keep trying to get it - or maybe that&#39;s what they want us to believe, so better act like that information is important to us and protect it, even though it&#39;s just a cookie recipe.&quot;  It&#39;s rabbit-holes all the way down ;)</p>

<p>Also, it indicates (to me anyways) that failures are just cover for the successes - for instance The Biz Plot already mentioned here - I don&#39;t think it failed or even just took longer to implement - best-guess is that it had succeeded before the time Butler came forward, and they approached Butler knowing he would &#39;expose&#39; it and it would appear to have failed, it maybe just had a slightly different character than they &#39;revealed&#39; to Butler.  Certainly our history the last century would indicate The Biz Plot&#39;s resounding success 100+ years ago.</p>

<p>In this light, it is somewhat ironic that the Glomar Explorer was later refitted to do actual marine mining operations.  Yyyyyyeeeeaaaah...sounds legit!</p>

<p>According to a Memphis jury’s verdict on December 8, 1999, in the wrongful death lawsuit of the King family versus Loyd Jowers “and other unknown co-conspirators,” Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated by a conspiracy that included agencies of his own government. Almost 32 years after King’s murder at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis on April 4, 1968, a court extended the circle of responsibility for the assassination beyond the late scapegoat James Earl Ray to the United States government. </p>

<p>On December 12, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security conducted raids on six Swift meatpacking factories in the midwestern US. Its agents illegally searched and detained all workers at the Swift factories, eventually kidnapping many of them and sending them to detention camps in faraway locations.</p>

<p>The detained workers were not allowed to speak with lawyers and could not call their family members. Many were deported. Some children returned home from school that day to find that both of their parents were simply missing.</p>

<p>The Swift Company knew these raids were coming, have coordinated in advance with the Department of Homeland Security to allow them on this day. On DHS orders, Swift kept the raids a secret and allowed these workers to be abused and deported. </p>

<p>In 1894 Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer in the French army, was convicted of treason. Dreyfus was innocent; the conviction rested on false documents, and perjured testimony. When officials realized this they attempted a cover up. The writer Émile Zola exposed the affair. Dreyfus was released in 1899.</p>

<p>&quot;The Affair from 1894 to 1906 divided France deeply and lastingly into two opposing camps: the pro-Army, mostly Catholic &quot;anti-Dreyfusards&quot; who generally lost the initiative to the anticlerical, pro-republican Dreyfusards. It embittered French politics and allowed the radicals to come to power.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kennedy fired the director of the CIA for the Bay of Pigs incident (which I think kennedy didn&#39;t want to happen OR couldn&#39;t control), he fired other key leaders of the CIA, and stripped power from the CIA and moved it to the department of defense so he could better control it. The CIA was in deep with the mafia who Robert was engaging in an unprecedented legal war (with mafia related arrests and convictions going up like 1100% during Kennedy&#39;s presidency.) And I remember reading that Johnson was in on this too, he was somehow involved and disliked Kennedy. Eventually Johnson made the Warren commission and hired many of the people kennedy fired to lead it. The entire thing just reaks of conspiracy. I think this was the first time that the global elite realized they could kill the president and get away from it, and ever since then the Oval Office has been owned by the CIA, and any hope of an actual Democracy (what we have now is a Plutocracy) died with the assassination.</p>

<p>Jacobo Arbenz Guzman was a popular democratically elected president who attempted to move Guatemala out of feudalism through reform of education and land ownership. His &quot;Decree 900&quot; would have allowed peasants to farm unused land owned by the country&#39;s landowning oligarchs—and by the United Fruit Company, tied financially to both John Foster and Allen Dulles, heads of the State Department and CIA respectively.</p>

<p>Establishing a pattern that would repeat throughout the Western Hemisphere (and indeed, the world), the US began working to subvert the Guatemalan government. A key part of the strategy was to shift loyalties within the military, offering power to officers who would participate in a coup and threatening the armed forces as a whole with an arms embargo not to be lifted until Arbenz was overthrown.</p>

<p>The final decapitation of the government was the result of psychological warfare, not military victory. While the US-backed &quot;rebel&quot; force failed to defeat even the peasants on Guatemala&#39;s border, the CIA-controlled radio stations announced the defeat of the Guatemalan army and the conquest of the countryside by the rebel army. CIA plans bombed Guatemala City. President Arbenz resigned and left the country, thinking this would be the only way to avoid more bloodshed.</p>

<p>The result was decades of brutal military rule and violence against indigenous Guatemalans. Land reform other policies were rolled back. The US military backed the Guatemalan generals, and the CIA set up its own police organization to monitor and kill dissidents. The events which took place were falsified by a CIA operation known as PBHISTORY. The United Fruit Company hired Edward Bernays, father of modern propaganda, to whitewash their involvement.</p>

The &#39;tradition&#39; of diamond engagement rings started in the 1930&#39;s with the diamond industry (De Beers) and their campaign to create a demand for them, thus upping their profits and since DeBeers holds a monopoly on gemstone quality diamonds, enabled them to jack up the price on a rather common stone. By lending expensive diamond jewelry to movie stars, who the general public tends to want to copy, the demand increased even more. Thus the &#39;tradition&#39; of the diamond engagement ring was manufactured. Until then, an engagement ring stone could be any gemstone... From there, millions of dollars of worthless diamonds are bought sold and traded- funding radical military of terrorists all over Africa.

<p>The Reichstag Fire of 1933, in which the German Parliament building was burned down, is often cited as an example of a false flag attack, though historians still dispute the evidence. Officially, Marinus van der Lubbe, a Dutch Communist, was found at the scene of the fire and blamed for the attack. This led to the Nazis ruthlessly suppressing their Communist rivals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Order of Nine Angles &quot;represent a dangerous and extreme form of Satanism&quot; and first attracted public attention during the 1980s and 1990s after being mentioned in books detailing fascist Satanism. Presently, the ONA is organized around clandestine cells (which it calls &quot;traditional nexions&quot;) and around what it calls &quot;sinister tribes&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;ONA-inspired activities, led by protagonist David Myatt, managed to enter the scene of grand politics and the global &#39;War On Terror&#39;, because of several foiled terror plots in Europe that can be linked to Myatt&#39;s writings&quot;.</p>

<p>The King David Hotel bombing was an attack carried out on July 22, 1946 by the right-wing Zionist underground organization the Irgun on the British administrative headquarters for Palestine, which was housed in the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. 91 people of various nationalities were killed and 46 were injured.</p>

<p>In the plan, Irgun men, disguised as Arabs, except for Gideon, the leader, who would be dressed as one of the hotel&#39;s distinctive Sudanese waiters, would enter the building through a basement service entrance carrying the explosives concealed in milk cans. The cans were to be placed by the main columns supporting the wing where the majority of the offices used by the British authorities were located.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think because the original r/conspiracy users were more focused towards a kind of &quot;conspiracy theory role-play&quot;, where they discussed Bigfoot, lochness, and lots of &quot;fringe&quot; theories for fun. But now that abuses by the US and other governments are becoming so publicized, there has been a shift with users more focused on serious discussion, since there isn&#39;t really any other subreddit where they can discuss it without censorship. So when this crowd sees mediocre posts like folded dollar bills, they wonder why people would care about them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but it&#39;s become a colloquialism that anything that&#39;s a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; isn&#39;t based on reality.</p>

<p>That has largely to do with a PR campaign undertaken by the CIA to demonize free thought by labeling it as a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;.</p>

<p>A theory by itself can exist as a theory without necessarily being <em>proven</em>.</p>

<p>My point is that a &quot;conspiracy&quot; doesn&#39;t &quot;turn out&quot; to be true. The definition of a conspiracy is that it <em>does</em> exist already. Conspiracy <em>theories</em> however, can later be proven to be true.</p>

<p>Silly semantics :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well if we are talking about science...say a few buildings falling down, we are talking science. If we are talking science, scientific terms should be used. A theory in philosophy is a hypothesis in science, a premise.
Stupid philosophers caused this, and propogandists seeking to hide the truth, cemented it.</p>

<p>I understood your point and thought the same when I read the title. But I do have a priblem with the term as I have friends who think they can avoid hard discussions by saying &quot;Oh thats just a conspiracy theory&quot;, dolts!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was the SEALs fault. They did such a good job raiding into north vietnam, </p>

<p>By 1963, the Vietnamese LDNN was starting to meet success within their missions. Operating American-provided, Norwegian-built “Nasty” class fast patrol boats out of Da Nang, the LDNN were able to make several raids against North Vietnamese targets. On 31 July, the Nastys were used on a mission to destroy a radio transmitter on the island of Hon Nieu. Using 88mm mortar on the night of 3 August, they shelled the radar site at Cape Vinh Son.</p>

<p>Due to the immense firepower of the 88mm recoilless, the North Vietnamese believed the large guns of an U.S. Naval ship were bombarding them. Under this assumption, NVA gunboats made a daylight attack on the USS Maddox, which was cruising off the North Vietnamese coastline, intercepting radio transmissions. This and a second attack later the same day on the USS Turner Joy came to be known as The Gulf of Tonkin Incident.</p>

<p>Now that you have exposed this nefarious plot, what now? What is the end-game, what is the resolution to this?</p>

<p>The ability to ferret out that the governments of every country do things in secret, designed to weaken their opposition (real or perceived) is recognized and agreed. But now that it you by your efforts have brought to light their plans and designs what do you expect to occur?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t find a link to the actual court case. It goes to a &quot;page not found&quot;. </p>

<p>In one of the articles though, it says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In acknowledging Hannah&#39;s injuries, the government said vaccines aggravated an unknown mitochondrial disorder Hannah had which didn&#39;t &quot;cause&quot; her autism, but &quot;resulted&quot; in it. It&#39;s unknown how many other children have similar undiagnosed mitochondrial disorder. All other autism &quot;test cases&quot; have been defeated at trial. Approximately 4,800 are awaiting disposition in federal vaccine court. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like her case was a very unique, and specific event? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The killing of kennedy is less interesting than the story of how Kennedy became president in the first place, as a pawn of his father Joe Kennedy.
Joe robbed banks from the inside, using inside information, a bit of extortion,and funds stolen from his relatives to buy his first bank. He bought more banks and diversified into RKO (one guy wouldn&#39;t sell so he had him framed for rape), real estate and alcohol during and after prohibition. He bankrolled FDR&#39;s campaign and later came close to running against him, but decided he&#39;d use his sons instead. When Jack sank his pt boat Joe pulled strings so he got a medal and a movie instead of a court-martial.  He bought jack a pulitzer. Later he bought him the west virginia primary as a result of which which he got enough primary delagates to beat LBJ&#39;s convention delagates.   </p>
