        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Alex Jones has run several stories in the past week about reddit restricting some sources such as <a href="http://www.infowars.com/has-reddit-banned-almost-all-alternative-media/">his site</a>.</p>

<p>So what I wonder is why doesn&#39;t he do an IAMA? If what he claims is true it should be the perfect way to reach a huge number of people and &quot;wake them up&quot;.</p>

<p>He claims he has information the mainstream media won&#39;t share that proves all sorts of things, from cancer viruses in the vaccines to 9/11 being an &quot;inside job&quot;. He further claims the mainstream media covers these things up and lies when they report about him.</p>

<p>So why not do an IAMA? He can pick and choose his questions and present his evidence in writing in a way that can&#39;t be mis-represented.  If he really does have some hidden truth, and he really does want to share it, wouldn&#39;t this be the place to do it?</p>

<p>Of course if he&#39;s afraid he can&#39;t defend his claims then it wouldn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, I consider myself an educated, scientifically literate person. I would dearly like to see the proof of the cancer viruses in the vaccines, how the twin towers falling defied the laws of physics, how the government sprays us day and night with chem trails. </p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to be convinced. Also if he has facts on his side that&#39;s hard to argue with. Once people see that he is posting hard facts that he can back up, there won&#39;t be much room for argument.</p>

<p>Anyhow he constantly talks about how him and his family are in physical danger from his work, how he&#39;s willing to die for his cause. So if he can put his life on the line why can&#39;t he risk a messy IAMA on reddit?</p>

<p>In fact bad behavior on reddit&#39;s part would be a God send for him. He could point to it and say &quot;look at how the brain washed sheepole refuse to debate fairly&quot;. </p>

<p>As long as he has truth on his side he should be okay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am totally with you on the conspiracy stuff. I have questions that need answers also.</p>

<p>But from what I have seen from Alex, he gets a kick out of yelling and screaming. I saw him on Piers Morgan...he loses it. Utterly loses his shit, but that is what gets him recognition.</p>

<p>I think doing an ama, where it is written text responses won&#39;t offer him the platform he needs. He needs to yell and shout...hard to do that (well maybe he could do the ama IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the point I&#39;m trying to make is he claims to have proof of a wide variety of things. He claims if you don&#39;t believe him you aren&#39;t &quot;awake&quot;. He claims the media covers up these facts he has. He tells people constantly to check out what he says and &quot;do your research&quot;. </p>

<p>So I admit I can&#39;t find the proof he is talking about. Everything I find shows him to be wildly exaggerating or out right wrong.</p>

<p>This seems to me to be the perfect venue to settle the issue. If his claims are true here is a place to present them in writing. I am willing to be convinced and I am willing to say I am wrong. Surely there are others like me? Why would he not want to reach this audience?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I&#39;ve actually researched everything I mentioned and many other subjects on my own. What I am saying is I have never been able to find any proof of these claims. </p>

<p>So obviously I can&#39;t find it. Jones claims to have it, so why shouldn&#39;t I ask? If I&#39;m being sprayed by chem trails and injected with cancer viruses to be soft killed I&#39;d like to know.</p>

<p>Anyhow what&#39;s the point of having a radio show to tell people things if you aren&#39;t willing to tell people things? Are you saying Jones is right but the proof is a secret?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have looked at information from A&amp;E for 9/11 truth. They are not &quot;all those architects and engineers&quot; however. Check the bios of the people singing, by their standards I could sign and I don&#39;t agree (nor do I work as an engineer or architect), so I guess that counteracts at least one of them. But the point is A&amp;E is just a name, the signees are not required to be either.</p>

<p>But what does that have to do with Alex smiting reddit with his terrifying torpedo of truth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;ll be the first to admit I don&#39;t know the probabilities for buildings collapsing after a plane crash  and a fire. This person claims to know them, so yes I would like to see them.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the point of calculating the probabilities, finding that it was very unlikely, and then being un-willing to show your proof?</p>

<p>When you ask: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s the probability that the aircraft hit the towers at the exact points required for that to happen?</p>

<p>I assume you have some information about said probabilities. Or did you just guess?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See I don&#39;t understand that attitude. He has evidence of horrible things hidden by the government and other powerful forces. He has evidence that innocent men women and children are being killed by these forces. He gets so upset by this that he regularly breaks down in tears on the air.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s a forum where he can prevent this evidence and show that he is telling the truth. He can prove the danger we are in once and for all. </p>

<p>But he can&#39;t do it because people might be rude to him? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that but I was simply stating that not everyone famous feels the need to answer reddits questions. I mean, we all know how his AMA would go. He would get raped by the left-wing brainwashed masses that are on reddit. In other words, he won&#39;t do an AMA because he isn&#39;t as dumb as people think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So he has facts and truth but he can&#39;t present them to any audience that might not immediately agree with him?</p>

<p>Honestly I think it&#39;s more like he doesn&#39;t have facts or the ability to argue a point of view intelligently. If you listen to his past interviews as soon as he is questioned on anything he starts shouting or changes the subject. </p>

<p>He can&#39;t do an AMA because he would have to show us all this proof he has, and it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>You know I&#39;ve brought that up on his site and people get really pissed. In theory his followers should be the most critical of him since he claims they should &quot;do their research&quot; and verify what he says.</p>

<p>I often wonder if he is just cynical to the point that he lies to them and laughs at their gullibility, or if he has some mental defect that makes him able to believe himself even when he is lying? </p>

<p>The best I can come up with is, a little from column A and a little from column B.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I listen to Jones six days a week. It&#39;s become a habit. Much of what he says is right on the money, and he&#39;s the only person, or almost the only person, talking about it. Some of what he says is whacko, and indicates a degree of paranoia on his part. He&#39;s a very mixed bag of nuts. He can say stuff that is little short of brilliant, and the go into a tantrum that would make a three-year old proud.</p>

<p>I think the Rolling Stone article on him got it right when they called him &quot;incoherent&quot;. That&#39;s what he is. His thoughts are all scattered and broken up, and he has trouble finishing a sentence, or a complete thought. He bounces from one subject to another like a monkey on crack.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see Alex Jones do an IAMA here. It would be great. But I doubt he will do it unless someone close to him tells him it would be good publicity. He&#39;s probably not even aware of Reddit. I&#39;ve heard him mention Facebook and Twitter all the time, but never Reddit.</p>
