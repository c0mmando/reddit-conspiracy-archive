       Alex Jones has run several stories in the past week about reddit restricting some sources such as
       <a href="http://www.infowars.com/has-reddit-banned-almost-all-alternative-media/">
        his site
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So what I wonder is why doesn't he do an IAMA? If what he claims is true it should be the perfect way to reach a huge number of people and "wake them up".
      </p>
      <p>
       He claims he has information the mainstream media won't share that proves all sorts of things, from cancer viruses in the vaccines to 9/11 being an "inside job". He further claims the mainstream media covers these things up and lies when they report about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why not do an IAMA? He can pick and choose his questions and present his evidence in writing in a way that can't be mis-represented.  If he really does have some hidden truth, and he really does want to share it, wouldn't this be the place to do it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course if he's afraid he can't defend his claims then it wouldn't.

       I don't know, I consider myself an educated, scientifically literate person. I would dearly like to see the proof of the cancer viruses in the vaccines, how the twin towers falling defied the laws of physics, how the government sprays us day and night with chem trails.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm willing to be convinced. Also if he has facts on his side that's hard to argue with. Once people see that he is posting hard facts that he can back up, there won't be much room for argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow he constantly talks about how him and his family are in physical danger from his work, how he's willing to die for his cause. So if he can put his life on the line why can't he risk a messy IAMA on reddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact bad behavior on reddit's part would be a God send for him. He could point to it and say "look at how the brain washed sheepole refuse to debate fairly".
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as he has truth on his side he should be okay.

       I am totally with you on the conspiracy stuff. I have questions that need answers also.
      </p>
      <p>
       But from what I have seen from Alex, he gets a kick out of yelling and screaming. I saw him on Piers Morgan...he loses it. Utterly loses his shit, but that is what gets him recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think doing an ama, where it is written text responses won't offer him the platform he needs. He needs to yell and shout...hard to do that (well maybe he could do the ama IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS!

       Well the point I'm trying to make is he claims to have proof of a wide variety of things. He claims if you don't believe him you aren't "awake". He claims the media covers up these facts he has. He tells people constantly to check out what he says and "do your research".
      </p>
      <p>
       So I admit I can't find the proof he is talking about. Everything I find shows him to be wildly exaggerating or out right wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems to me to be the perfect venue to settle the issue. If his claims are true here is a place to present them in writing. I am willing to be convinced and I am willing to say I am wrong. Surely there are others like me? Why would he not want to reach this audience?

       What proof do you need beyond the videos of the buildings collapsing? The statistical probability of 3 buildings falling so neatly would be insane. What's the probability that the aircraft hit the towers at the exact points required for that to happen?

       I don't know what the probability would be. But I have studied probability a little, so if you show me the equations you have showing it is not probable I would certainly look at them and offer an opinion.

       No I've actually researched everything I mentioned and many other subjects on my own. What I am saying is I have never been able to find any proof of these claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       So obviously I can't find it. Jones claims to have it, so why shouldn't I ask? If I'm being sprayed by chem trails and injected with cancer viruses to be soft killed I'd like to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow what's the point of having a radio show to tell people things if you aren't willing to tell people things? Are you saying Jones is right but the proof is a secret?

       I have looked at information from A&amp;E for 9/11 truth. They are not "all those architects and engineers" however. Check the bios of the people singing, by their standards I could sign and I don't agree (nor do I work as an engineer or architect), so I guess that counteracts at least one of them. But the point is A&amp;E is just a name, the signees are not required to be either.

       Well I'll be the first to admit I don't know the probabilities for buildings collapsing after a plane crash  and a fire. This person claims to know them, so yes I would like to see them.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the point of calculating the probabilities, finding that it was very unlikely, and then being un-willing to show your proof?

       </p>

       Did you know that in order to build a skyscraper in NYC you must have demolition plans prepared before construction?
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time the only solution the architects had were small nuclear warheads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think demolitions progressed splendidly in the interim, and nukes were no longer needed, just food for thought.

       No it isn't. He says things but he can't be asked things,except rarely when he takes a call.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard him say countless things that are flat our wrong on the air, I'm talking fact, not interpretation. There's no way to point that out, or if he has some additional facts that I can't find he never presents them.

       He is just another sensationalist with his own agenda. To continue and allow him to be apart of this community is only doing more harm than help. He is one of the many reasons "conspiracy theorist" get such a bad name. Follow the money and you can see he has little to do with our fight. He and Michael Moore are the same  essentially. They might force some to think outside of the box they have grown up in but go about it in the wrong way causing more problems then actually helping the cause.

       Why does everyone think he's a shill? He's not even the first by a long shot to scream about the crap he does. He has made a place for himself, sure, but it's not like the market isn't saturated with someone else to sell bullshit if he's not doing it. I bet he's as much of a fucking joke to the hundreds of billionaires on this planet let alone the trillionaires (you know who) above them as he is to plenty of people here.

       See I don't understand that attitude. He has evidence of horrible things hidden by the government and other powerful forces. He has evidence that innocent men women and children are being killed by these forces. He gets so upset by this that he regularly breaks down in tears on the air.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here's a forum where he can prevent this evidence and show that he is telling the truth. He can prove the danger we are in once and for all.

       But he can't do it because people might be rude to him?

       I understand that but I was simply stating that not everyone famous feels the need to answer reddits questions. I mean, we all know how his AMA would go. He would get raped by the left-wing brainwashed masses that are on reddit. In other words, he won't do an AMA because he isn't as dumb as people think.

       So he has facts and truth but he can't present them to any audience that might not immediately agree with him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I think it's more like he doesn't have facts or the ability to argue a point of view intelligently. If you listen to his past interviews as soon as he is questioned on anything he starts shouting or changes the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       He can't do an AMA because he would have to show us all this proof he has, and it doesn't exist.

       Alex Jones was exposed as a minor Mason in some silly sub-Masonic lodge. He's the Rush Limbaugh for the Doomsday Prepper set. It's his job to say all the stuff he does. He's said so much stuff wrong and people give him a free pass. Said there'd be martial law about 5 times in past 10 years. Said Bush would be elected a third term, due to some
       <em>

       You know I've brought that up on his site and people get really pissed. In theory his followers should be the most critical of him since he claims they should "do their research" and verify what he says.

       People just want to hear what they already think. Confirmation bias. Plus they assume he's legit and right more than wrong so forgive him or even completely gloss over or delude themselves that he's never been wrong. See also religious extremists and cults etc. They clutch at straws.

       He already has a worldwide platform on youtube and infowars.com, he doesnt need the exposure so that wouldn't motivate him...maybe he's aware of the nefarious agents controlling reddit and he wants no part of it.

       Jones does numerous appearances on other television shows, for the publicity. If he did come here, it would be for the same reason -- publicity. He's in business.

       I think the problem is it would be writing. It's one thing to say "Just Google cancer viruses in the vaccines" knowing it will lead your followers where you want.

       It's something else again to say "here's my proof and I'm ready to defend it".

       Man.  an IAMA on reddit.  I wonder how all the pro obama voters would react to that one.  Would prob. be negatively voted.

       But like in a libel suit, truth is an absolute defense. People can be hostile all they want, but if he sticks to the facts and shows the truth that he has, what could happen? People will get hurt feelings about it and call him names on the internet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if everyone is hostile and he responds with facts he will forever be able to point to the IAMA as proof he's right and his detractors are rude idiots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe Jone's claims? If so don't you want to see him prove himself and embarrass the sheep?

       I listen to Jones six days a week. It's become a habit. Much of what he says is right on the money, and he's the only person, or almost the only person, talking about it. Some of what he says is whacko, and indicates a degree of paranoia on his part. He's a very mixed bag of nuts. He can say stuff that is little short of brilliant, and the go into a tantrum that would make a three-year old proud.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the Rolling Stone article on him got it right when they called him "incoherent". That's what he is. His thoughts are all scattered and broken up, and he has trouble finishing a sentence, or a complete thought. He bounces from one subject to another like a monkey on crack.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to see Alex Jones do an IAMA here. It would be great. But I doubt he will do it unless someone close to him tells him it would be good publicity. He's probably not even aware of Reddit. I've heard him mention Facebook and Twitter all the time, but never Reddit.

       I've never heard a story from Alex that turned out to be true that wasn't all over a dozen different news sources before he got it. I have heard many un truths repeated over and over again.
