       Then Bill Young dies the very next day from a back injury he suffered in 1970. His condition turned for the worse over night

       A back injury from 1970 that turned over night.... 2 days after the mk ultra stenographer incident....a day after fox news reports his death???

       edit - I re-watched the house floor c-span video

       Even if it's not the same guy, the death and false report of Bill Young is a very strong indicator of a possible assignation/cover-up. Even if unrelated to the stenographer, it's still very significant. Good work!

       The size of the forehead/the disparity between hairlines and the seemingly substantial gap in age leads me to believe it is not. The man in the CSPAN video also seems to have a narrower, sharper. He does, certainly, have more hair, a more distinct hairline and hair parting.

       The news articles indicate he was actually at the hospital. The only other thing I can think of to make this plausible is if he left the hospital without alerting any news agencies. However, that seems unlikely.

       Where is the stenographer now? Also, those representatives who were there know exactly who that man was. Why aren't they saying anything? We still do not have a complete accounting of what she said, even though the microphone records everything said at those sessions. Where is the transcript of that session?

       The guy was 83.  He was in the hospital for two weeks before he died so he wasn't on the floor of the House when this incident happened.

       The pics you link to are very blurry and low quality but I don't see any resemblance beyond the grey hair.

       if we had higher quality pics we would know who the guy is. But we don't so here we sit in out basement trying to put the pieces together. This was my attempt.

       I'm not saying this is fact...just it is some odd coincidences and it is happening right inside the government.

       This story gives me the fucking creeps. If you haven't watched the video check out the way Diane walks (robotically), they call her "Holly" near the elevator &amp; a woman guides her path up to the stand after Bill Young says something briefly to her

       At 54:03, Stenographer A makes eye contact with Stenographer B as she is walking up, and projects a short becoming smile up to her. When Sten A pulls out her ear piece as Sten B is rearranging the equipment in front of her, she has a sad and drawn defeated facial expression looking down toward the floor or cables, etc. It looks as if the man in gray then leans forward and asks her something to the effect of, "everything alright?". It also looks pretty clear that she then responds to him by leaning forward and saying something very close to, "why, what do you mean?", with a sort of tired-of-it-all demeanor.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, the man responds to her in either an animated or scolding fashion (head is cocking up and down a bit). This response from him seems to prompt her to get up, as if it was the straw that broke the camels back, and heads for the podium. The guy (sitting with the woman) behind her also caught a whiff of what the man said to her and the subsequent reaction as she stood up. I am aware that Sten A may have overheard what the man and woman sitting behind her were up to earlier in the session. So, the gray suit guy's comments combined with whatever BS she just witnessed or overheard was maybe all she could take. One out of a few theories, I realize.

       while this particular event did not amount to much (although who knows what has happened to the stenographer) the fact that mysterious mkultra type shit can happen on the floor of your government, during a vote, should cause you to at least worry about it, if not investigate it further.

       It's quite simple. If this were to be proved a staged event then there would have to be a motive. It's the motive for the staging that we would be interested in.

       Maybe she learned of something she wasn't really supposed to know, so they drugged the shit out of her to make her look like some sort of lunatic.    It seems crazy to think that the CIA knows exactly how much of what substances are needed to erase your memories, drive you insane etc., if they hadn't done those twisted evil experiments a few hours from where I live here in Canada I might not believe it.

       The fact that fox news reported it a day early is what makes this so fishy for me.  That and the fact that he was moving pretty damn well for someone who died of a back injury 2 days later (if that was him of course.)
      </p>
      <p>
       However, every article I've read said he was in the hospital for 2 weeks prior to death, and was frail needed a wheelchair in his final years.

       Whoever the man is, he said something to this woman to where she immediately stood and walked to the podium to unleash whatever she did.

       It's a simple question to find out who it was and what they might have said to possibly instigate the event.  Maybe she just flipped, maybe it was nothing but nothing is off the table at these levels so it would be interesting to find out for sure, don't you think?

       The conspiracy has yet to be found if legit or not.  That's why we're here.  Speculate and possibly solve it.

      <p>
       It's okay if you're not interested!  You don't have to participate if you don't think it's worth your time.

       Im going to stop you right now because that is anti-intellectual nonsense. If you watch the video it actually involves the people
       <em>
        behind
       </em>
       the stenographer, and their conversation. She overheard something they said and then got up and did what she did. You people get hung up on the most ridiculous shit.

       if you were going to use an operative to deliver a message to activate a woman to do your bidding, you would use someone who didn't look out of place.  This guy fits in and probably not the first time he has done this in plain view.  She looks and reacts to him not like you would the first time someone talks to you, so there was a trusting history there.
