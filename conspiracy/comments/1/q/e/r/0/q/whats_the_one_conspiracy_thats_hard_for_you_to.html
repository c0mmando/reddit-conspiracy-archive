       Lizard people is false. But people believe it because Icke said it. Icke believes it because TPTB wanted to discredit him and got people to tell him that they saw shape-shifting lizards.

       Due to the infinite size of the universe, and the odds you describe regarding life in said universe, isn't also nearly infinitely impossible for two intelligent life forms to ever meet in that vastness?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not being facetious, it would seem that if there is other intelligent life out in the infinite universe, even if it is plentiful, will be so isolated by distance that the time to travel between the too could be infinite, even at the speed of light. Life is likely, but intelligent life, close enough to meet up with is not so much.

       Sure... I imagine that one could envision many possible scenarios that might fit your hypothesis, but beyond that type of inter-system colonization, as the distances between the heavenly bodies get greater, I think that sort of possibility becomes less and less likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, I view that more as colonization instead of the first contact between two distinct alien lifeforms from separate worlds at a distance to each other. The next closest star is light years from our sun, and the likelihood of life in that system is not high.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe that life is out there, but I think that it is more likely that we could possibly get in contact via radio communication, but the expense of resources to meet face to face make that near zero chance of ever happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think SciFi media makes us get a false sense of our capabilities in space travel. The distance, the radiation, so many factors... It would take the commitment of an entire planet to make a spacecraft able to make that trip. Think about the actual size of all of our space programs on the planet put together so far, and all their accomplishments, and then think about all the costs in relation. All the gold on this planet would not be able to cover the costs of a manned mission to Alpha Centari or any where similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't even get me started into the scope of the creation of the ships... Have to be made in orbit, because the size/mass could use so much fuel on takeoff. 1000's of shipbuilders in orbit, but where do they live, where do the materials come from? Ahhh...
      </p>
      <p>
       Best of luck, but I just don't see it happening, as much as you or I want it to be.

       I have often wondered if Icke was trying to use a metaphor for the behavior of those in power, and described it so fantastically and unreal in order to not get sued.
      </p>
      <p>
       By calling out the "lizards" to sue him in his books for the things he says they actually did, they individual would have to deal with the "lizard" side of things in court. It poisons his own well, and allows the information about their actions to get published.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also likely that he is batshit crazy, and truly believes they shapehift. But I agree, it is a good metaphor for the traits of those in power. It is also notable, that the power hungry behavior of those in control likely is rooted in the "reptile" brain, and not from the more compassionate "mammal" parts of the brain.

       The New Testament.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a collation of fictional accounts of the adventures of a half-man, half-god messiah figure in Roman occupied Judaea. Despite the fact that there is no reliable evidence for the existence of this desert demi-god outside of the New Testament, millions of people today still believe Jesus was a real person and that the New Testament is the literal word of God. Unbelievable isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy, which has existed for nearly two millennia, is perpetuated by organisations called Churches, of which the Roman Catholic Church is by far the most powerful. The aims of the conspirators who run these churches is control of the masses, and the acquisition of wealth and power.

       It is an undisputed fact agreed by 99% of historians that Jesus was, in fact real. The historical accounts absolutely exist outside of the New Testament. You should do more thorough research.

       Yours is a common reaction, but I know much more about the subject of a "historical Jesus" than you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only academics who claim that Jesus was a real person are "biblical scholars". These charlatans are not historians - they have a vested interest (their careers) in perpetuating the idea that Jesus was a real person.
      </p>
      <p>
       No real historian claims that "Jesus of Nazareth" was a historical figure, because there is no historical evidence to that effect. If he was a real person, performing miracles, accepted as "king of the Jews" by his contemporaries and crucified by the Romans, then the Romans would have made some record of his existence. They did not. And neither did Hebrew, or Aramaic chroniclers. In fact NOBODY who was alive at the time that Jesus was supposedly alive, made any record of his existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first, very vague mention of a figure called Jesus, comes from the Roman scribe Josephus, many decades after Jesus was supposedly crucified.

       How many qualifiers are you going to use to negate from what is determined to be historical evidence? You might as well just come out and say, "If I wasn't there, than it didn't happen."

       mmhmm... For a proclaimed scholar, do you not know of the undisputed historical evidence of the accurate record of the Bible itself? You know about the 12 disciples? The books of Mathew, Mark, Luke, or John? Who disputes the letters to the Corinthian's from Paul? Who disputes the historical evidence of their lives? Those people are the 'NOBODIES" that you speak of. And they left a historical account of Jesus' life.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for historical accuracy of Jesus:
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost all historical critics agree, that a historical figure named Jesus taught throughout the Galilean countryside c. 30 CE, was believed by his followers to have performed supernatural acts, and was sentenced to death by the Romans possibly for insurrection.

       I wasn't joking when I said I knew more about this subject than you. The 12 disciples were mere appendages to the myth of Jesus of Nazareth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of the four Apostles (Evangelists), three were not even eye-witnesses. Only Matthew claims to have been one of Jesus's supposed 12 disciples. However, the Gospels were all written in Greek and Matthew would have been at best a semi-literate speaker of Aramaic. Not surprisingly, most biblical scholars struggle to explain this particular conundrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look there isn't much point debating this issue. I know there is no historical evidence of Jesus being a real figure, and you believe what you believe. If any contemporaneous evidence of a historical Jesus is ever discovered, I will change my opinion in a heartbeat. It seems to me that you are too invested in your beliefs to want to seek the truth.

       yes, no negative can be proven. without the ability to prove it means that it cannot exist in the realm of the scientific need for proof. no data exists to date that could support the existence of a negative.

       Mathematical negatives are taught to create cognitive dissonance in the mind. they sure are not supported in science, my opinion but supported by science.

       I'm still confused about the link between "all current policy regarding climate change is awful and we should be worried", which I strongly agree with, and "all scientific conclusions regarding anthropogenic changes in our atmosphere are completely bunk", since I tend to believe peer reviewed studies over YouTube videos. There's definitely a conspiracy here, but to me it's about policy and not the data itself. I argued this the other day and I have a better understanding of the opposing viewpoint now, but I'm still lost on half of it

       if your body is 1 maybe 2 degrees over normal your doctor might tell you it's the time of day or not to worry if it doesn't stay that way ... but if over time your temperature remains 1 to 2 degrees above normal it is a sign of something systemic being wrong ... at least 1 to 2 degrees above recorded norms is what we're seeing in the climate data and the temperatures continue to climb with current projections saying it could be as much as 4 - 10 degrees F warmer over the next 30 - 100 years
      </p>
      <p>
       the global climate system is unbelievably vast but the data sets are clear and have been for a very long time - human inputs into the climate system since industrialization when we began pouring untold tons of soot, CO2 and other pollution into our atmosphere have upset the ratio of gases leading to the warming
      </p>
      <p>
       even Mt. Pinatubo's eruption (largest of the 20th Century) only slowed the warming for a couple of years (the sulfur particulates reflected sunlight back into space) ... the sun seems to be going through an historic low during its solar maximum and some solar scientists thing we might be headed to a new solar minimum but even this will only slow the rise in temperatures and the overall effects of warming - if there is a new solar minimum we'll get a 30-80 year break ... the minimum doesn't kick in then the warming continues apace
      </p>
      <p>
       the ocean is a vast cold-sink - holding overall temperatures of the entire climate system in check because the majority of the water is very cold but recent studies show that even the deepest water in the ocean is now warming - and that took a very long time to happen
      </p>
      <p>
       we may find out that it was 1980 or 1960 or even 1900 was the year that tipped the balance to runaway warming, but it is real and it's too late to do anything about it except to stop making it worse

       As I said elsewhere here, religious dogma as a control mechanism is what people are getting at, and they miss the question you are going for in the OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think you are too far off though in what you are saying. The religious leaders that teach creationism have to know somehow that they are being ridiculous with some of the ways they try to support their beliefs in the face of scientific and historical evidence (Things like the written History of China being older than the entire universe from some Christian viewpoints). That faith in something does not have to be blind, and by holding steadfast to such a narrow viewpoint, it does their religion a disservice.

       I think where the confusion is with the understanding of your OP, where you asked for conspiracies that you find hard for people to believe in...
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, you have a few answers about specific religions. Those posters are coming from the view point that religion itself is a conspiracy of control. That in the cases of like Mormonism, these individuals don't understand how the followers believe the legend/back story they are told/given in order to submit to the control of the religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think it is just a bit of misunderstanding by some of the posters as to what your question was. There are many conspiracies (not theories) involving religions doing whatever they can to maintain their control, but your are correct in asserting that the individuals missed the mark in regard to what the OP was asking.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side note, there are many different aspects of Mormonism that are questioned by non-believers. Some involved the supposed space angel Moroni, and the stories of Jesus in the New World. Others involve the practice of polygamy, and its rationale beyond a control mechanism of the believers. I am no scholar of Mormonism, but it is my understanding that some believe it to be a bastardization of Christianity with a heavy influence from Free Masonry. Hopefully, this will help you to look for better explanations of the supposed Mormon "conspiracy", and make decisions for yourself.

       That's understandable, I guess some of the historical details could be considered conspiratorial along with a mixture of masonic rites, apparent strict control and some levels of secrecy.  I just had not heard of a direct sort of conspiracy, like in recent days I just learned of the Church of Scientology's organized infiltration of government agencies to remove documents that were negative of the church.

       Got you... yeah, nothing I know of that is anywhere near the level of conspiracy that the Scientologists are on.
      </p>
