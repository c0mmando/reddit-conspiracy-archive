<p><em>&quot;Ruiu said he arrived at the theory about badBIOS&#39;s high-frequency networking capability after observing encrypted data packets being sent to and from an infected laptop that had no obvious network connection with—but was in close proximity to—another badBIOS-infected computer. The packets were transmitted even when the laptop had its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth cards removed. Ruiu also disconnected the machine&#39;s power cord so it ran only on battery to rule out the possibility that it was receiving signals over the electrical connection. Even then, forensic tools showed the packets continued to flow over the airgapped machine. Then, when Ruiu removed the internal speaker and microphone connected to the airgapped machine, the packets suddenly stopped.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Yes, but at no point did the find payloads that targeted anything besides Iranian centrifuges. The virus is very effective at spreading itself, but it&#39;s only actual malicious capability is to crash the centrifuge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand what the term modular means in this instance as most code is essentially modular. </p>

<p>Stuxnet has been captured and analyzed for years, and no such code was found. So I don&#39;t think <strong>you</strong> understand what modularity means in this context.</p>

<p>Shit dude, you are going to bother to suggest I don&#39;t know what modular means when you are using the word &#39;system&#39; in such a useless fashion? What systems do you mean??? Stuxnet ALREADY contains the code to handle compromising a variety of different windows systems used in SCADA, <strong>however</strong>, Stuxnet&#39;s final payload <strong>only</strong> contains code to break a certain centrifuge by compromising a certain piece of software. It does not contain code that remotely updates such payloads. So I think you should try and understand what the fuck modular means in this context before suggesting others do the same. </p>

<p>It infects any pc, but it only contains code to maliciously attack a certain centrifuge, the rest of the code is only used to ensure that it spreads as effectively as possible. </p>

<p>You might want to do more research before you suggest other people don&#39;t know what they are talking about. Stuxnet was found all over the world before it was known that it even targeted Iranian systems. So your point on it being discovered in Russia is entirely moot as it&#39;s existed in Russia since it&#39;s inception. <strong>In fact</strong>, the current theory on how Iran was infected was by a Russian consultant that was infected via a flash drive. So really, please do some fucking research!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because how do you get a virus to attack a centrifuge that exists in one location <strong>that you can&#39;t access</strong>? You write a virus that spreads as wildly as possible. That&#39;s what stuxnet does. However, the <strong>only</strong> time stuxnet ever tries to do <em>anything</em> that isn&#39;t spreading is attack the SCADA manager for the siemens centrifuge. </p>

<p>Like, this information has been known for years at this point. It was widely known when stuxnet was first discovered that it was a tool designed to spread widely and attack in a limited fashion. You have to spread a really wide net to catch the kind of fish the US and Israel were looking for. Stuxnet has been found <strong>all</strong> over the world <strong>for years</strong>, in every case it only ever tries to attack the siemens scada system used for a specific centrifuge model.</p>

<p>Maybe a better approach for you to take is to demonstrate where in the publicly available code stuxnet does anything besides benignly spread or attack the siemens centrigure. </p>

<p>No one said stuxnet wasn&#39;t great at spreading itself, in fact, it&#39;s really fucking good at that. No analysis would deny such a fact. However, you won&#39;t find the code to update it&#39;s most precious payload, or change the program&#39;s objective, as the code doesn&#39;t exist. No one is saying that you couldn&#39;t take stuxnet and re-tool it with a more vicious payload, however, it wouldn&#39;t really be stuxnet anymore. And it hasn&#39;t been seen. And what you do see is not what you say it is, so maybe you should do some more research or find something to discuss that you can comprehend.</p>

<p>Well, more or less the same thing as it was a certain type of centrifuge known only to be in use in Iran due to it&#39;s excessive age</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the &quot;modular&quot; point is that they could easily create different strains with different final payloads. So yes, the current captured one <em>only</em> targets a specific type of device.

<p>Sure the worm itself doesn&#39;t phone home/update payloads dynamically, but it would be rather easy to create a clone with a different task. That&#39;s the point here, the transport layer is done... it&#39;s trivial to change what the target is based on demand now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but that is a design consistent with most other viruses, and software <em>in general</em>. What differentiates stuxnet from other viruses is that it&#39;s an incredibly elaborate way to break a centrifuge. Not that it&#39;s modular. Code is inherently modular, that&#39;s why they call portions of code &#39;modules&#39;. </p>

<p>No one ever questioned if it would be easy to create a stuxnet variant. Considering that you can download the code yourself, it&#39;s really not an impossible task. This is a significant difference from what people think in that it&#39;s not something unique to stuxnet at all. That&#39;s just how software works. </p>

<p>And, no you can&#39;t change it &#39;on demand&#39;. That&#39;s the whole point. You must create an entirely new variant and spread it again. That&#39;s significantly different from a virus that can acquire new payloads <em>on the fly</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That could easily be modified and with the virulence of the worm itself, made to destroy just about anything with a vulnerability (meaning just about everything).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look, if you want to learn about computer security, you should. Because your statement suggests you don&#39;t know anything about how stuxnet actually works or how malware works in general. Stuxnet only contains vulnerabilities for windows systems that could run SCADA software, so no OSX and no Linux, nor does it contain code to infect any of the embedded systems that exist. So to suggest it can &#39;destroy&#39; just about &#39;anything&#39; with a &#39;vulnerability&#39; couldn&#39;t be a more <strong>inaccurate</strong> statement. </p>

<p>Even if it could infect systems besides windows, the way it destroys the centrifuge is by modifying the computer controlled parameters of the SCADA systems. So you can&#39;t just run a command on a windows machine that would make it explode. You could possibly fuck with the battery in the laptop, but already, the battery is managed by it&#39;s <em>own</em> operating system. And unlike plug and play general use SCADA systems, your batteries OS is specifically designed so that it can&#39;t be <em>made</em> to explode via code. This isn&#39;t to suggest that it&#39;s not possible to try and still mess up a battery in a critical fashion, but that your battery doesn&#39;t offer the OS the option to &#39;dangerously overcharge&#39; or &#39;increase rotational speed&#39;, like the SCADA system controlling the iranian centrifuges do. </p>

<p>Your statement is entirely pointless, because yes, it&#39;s theoretically possible to write software that could compromise a given system, however that has <em>entirely nothing to do with stuxnet</em>. That was true before stuxnet, and it&#39;s still true now. Stuxnet did nothing to change it. You are just sharing populous ignorance for how malware <em>actually works</em>.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve decompiled functions named in Hebrew, so once again, I don&#39;t think you know what you are talking about. Didn&#39;t see the NYTimes report on an anonymous US general admitting it was a join operation between the US and Israel?</p>

<p>The payload being encrypted doesn&#39;t matter when you can run the virus in a virtual environment and see exactly what it does anyway. I don&#39;t know where you get your information from, but how do you think security analysts determined it worked on siemens centrifuges? By plugging in hardware that only exists in Iran?? Sure!</p>

<p>Yes, flame is a precursor to stuxnet? Your point being? You don&#39;t seem to get the fact that all code is modular and stuxnet isn&#39;t some sort of meta ultra virus that&#39;s reprogrammable on the fly. You can compile your own virus based off of stuxnet right now, so really - what the fuck is your point?? Malware authors don&#39;t because stuxnet is widely known at this point and signatures against it have been developed for years. </p>

<p>Cybercriminals don&#39;t write software that spreads like stuxnet because it&#39;s too obvious. It has nothing to do with stuxnet being superior or superlative in any fashion relating to it&#39;s design. You are suggesting that this virus has capabilities that it doesn&#39;t, and it&#39;s based off your total ignorance with regards to words like &#39;modularity&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless im mistaken, it was not a US general claimimg ownership, it was a piece of shit Israeli commander.  Reseaechers can attempt to see what functions the code performs, but they cannot and did not decrypt the core payload.  What did Einstein say again?  And I&#39;m paraphrasing here, but if you can&#39;t explain something succinctly, you don&#39;t understand it well enough.  Its interesting to see your &#39;War and Peace&#39; explanations here.  Much of the codebase is similar.  And using a Stuxnet variant to capture information is not only reasonable, but has been done.  The cyber warfare here against civillian infrastructre is criminal and an act of war.  Releasing this into the wild was a completely reckless act.  Russia should seek damages.  Or inflict damages.  Either way, perfectly reasonable.</p>

<p>What are you trying to say about virus/worm authors being able to compile attacks based off the atuxnet code?  It doesn&#39;t work like that.  To compile executable code, the source is required.  You possess a very shallow understanding of how this works.  Rootkits are becoming more and more common, and minor tweaks to the code are how authors temporarily get around identification.

    <div class="md"><p>If you run a virus in a virtual environment you can tell exactly what it does as it is interacting with <em>your</em> system. You control the processor, the memory, the system calls. You can fake responses to see how the program will react. To be honest, it&#39;s clear you don&#39;t know shit about malware.</p>

<p>In your own words it&#39;s not a variant as it is a predecessor. You clearly don&#39;t know what you are talking about because all it is doing on Russia&#39;s systems is nothing. The virus spreads and looks for siemens centrifuges, that&#39;s it. If you don&#39;t have a siemens centrifuge it&#39;s not going to do anything to your computer. Regardless of what you don&#39;t understand about flame, stuxnet isn&#39;t what you claim it is. It doesn&#39;t change in the wild. It&#39;s release into the wild has nothing to do with flame. They are different pieces of software based off a similar codebase. I&#39;m not sure why you have to make dramatic suggestions about stuxnet&#39;s nature when it is obvious that any organization developing weaponized code would source functions from a centralized codebase.</p>

<p>Do you know what a decompiler is? I&#39;m serious now. It&#39;s nice that you are willing to explain to me how software development works, but you clearly don&#39;t know what the fuck you are talking about. There are a variety of ways to detect the various different types of malware, yes, signatures are one of them. I pointed out how useless signature based detection is, so I&#39;m not sure what you think your point is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m arguing that stuxnet doesn&#39;t do what you claim. Flat and simple. </p>

<p>The shared codebase is irrelevant, it was your point that stuxnet and flame are related and therefore must always be capable of the same thing at any given point. How do you know checks were included prior to the code? What sort of checks are you talking about? Malware analysts look for this stuff all the time, the US and Israel aren&#39;t the only entities that look for signs of a test-lab environment. However, you will find that the analysis of stuxnet does not reveal such lengthy measures taken for an attack like you describe. Snooping tools are quiet - stuxnet is the opposite of that. You use the best tool for the job, not the tool that you have because some asshole on the internet thinks it can do anything. </p>

<p>The idea that stuxnet is a snooping tool just isn&#39;t there. You don&#39;t have the proof and all conventional analysis disagrees with you. You can decompile encrypted functions as they must be decrypted in order to be used. This is why analysis must be undertaken with multiple techniques. Running the program in a controlled environment combined with technical deconstructive tools is the way to go. Do you think after all these years that analysts haven&#39;t noticed stuxnet&#39;s outbound connections? They have, and none of them are consistent with the behaviors you assign to the program.</p>

<p>Sure, if you&#39;d prefer to think I work in tech support, that&#39;s great. You are the one that takes two days to google what a decompiler does and otherwise argues nonsense points, like &quot;it doesn&#39;t have to be a virtual environment&quot;. No one said it did, your response is nonsense. It&#39;s commonly done in a virtual environment because it&#39;s easy. It&#39;s certainly not the only way large firms analyzed the tool.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re woefully incorrect</p>

<p>I think you are just really confused. But seeing as how you think stuxnet is some sort of &#39;magical computer program that can do whatever it wants because the gubmint made it&#39;, you might be a little more than <em>just</em> confused.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not some sort of variant developed on the fly. It&#39;s a predecessor even. </p>

<p>Stuxnet isn&#39;t an information stealing tool. It&#39;s a virus designed to deliver a payload targeting a certain SCADA device. Obviously, like with any other piece of software, it&#39;s possible to select useful functions and use them in other bits of software. That&#39;s basically the heart of software development. So, it&#39;s amusing that you&#39;ve figured out that the code is related in that they are developed by the same people, but it doesn&#39;t support your suggestion that stuxnet is some sort of meta-virus that can be retooled into anything to attack anything. </p>
