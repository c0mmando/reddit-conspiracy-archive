       I don't think Alex Jones is a patsy, shill or what have you. I think he really cares about what he does; passion can turn you batshit insane. That said, he comes off as a lunatic sometimes, and is thus an easy target. I hate how he fear mongers, it isn't helpful. He does enough damage that he doesn't need to be a patsy or shill. The elites probably just watch and laugh

       Alex Jones once claimed that Arabs run Hollywood. The guy is either an imbecile or a shill who blatantly spreads disinformation.

       Yup. He was outed as not credible. He lasted fairly long without raising suspicions and getting caught. He doesn't care, he's probably a millionaire many times over now.

       I agree. Personally, I've always felt Alex Jones is completely insane. Consider how he always has to reassure and reiterate that he is not a fearmonger, yet every single ad he plays revolves around how the earth is about to explode, and how this nifty little device he endorses will help avert your assured demise.

       I've had a hard time ever believing Alex Jones and what he has said. Same with Coast to Coast, I think they're both in place to majorly spread dis/misinformation. Some radio show hosts and podcasters are hard to listen to because you can clearly see/hear their agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I enjoy listening to Rogan, mostly because the topic varies depending on the guest.. and I watch the "Stuff They Don't Want You to Know" podcast because it basically shovels some information/opinion/conjecture into a quick &lt;5 minute presentation, enough that if it is interesting, I will then research further on the topic.

       I think Alex Jones spreads more fear in one youtube upload then the U.S. military does in a year. I always try and keep one thing in mind the, no one can say for sure what the ruling powers of the world truly want. I can say I do know one thing they want you to live in fear. When you don't buy milk or water because you think they are trying to kill you with it when you don't go for a hike because you think the air has stuff in it when you stay at home and lock your doors they win.

       I heard this months back, I still watch Alex Jones from time to time. Honestly it is down right amusing to see him in his act (some say its the way he is) It's scary you can find clips of him screaming some random weird stuff like "WAKE UP SOLDIER"  if you look for the biased videos about him being a agent provocateur.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy is always boasting 5 million dollars, it seems like he is more interested in the money (Federal Reserve Printed notes) his company makes then actually waking up people. I mean look how much time and money he put into the "infowars shop.com" "Free infowars bumper sticker with your magazine so you can wake the NWO" "Buy all my stuff before the world ends"

       People get really angry when you attack their Alex idol. It took me a while to see his game. With nonsensical banter like "The answer to 1984 is 1776" basically what you begin to notice is he offers no solution, only fear. The NWO are perfectly aware they will have to take a bunch of us out, that is why they are training their useful idiots to take down us useless eaters. Either one dies it's a win-win for them.

       I stopped listening to AJ a while back. Who knows what the guys agenda is, if the agenda is even his.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way to go about any conspiracy topic is to assess all information, regardless of source, and then later distill the information based on what coheres to 'actual' reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       AJ just says the same shit over and over again, and it's hard to listen to it because you're asking to be informed of something new.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other problem is that he's just trying to fill time for his show, so what people get is so diluted with pointless rants and distractions from the topic at hand that nothing ever actually gets addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex's purpose seems to be to keep the people pacified with so much information that they just shut down, and believe that because he's talking about it, something is actually being accomplished.

       So if someone fakes a voice to put on an act you're OK with that? That's pretty odd. He's a public persona, his appearance, or more specifically the changes and congruences of it to what he's saying are important in determining credibility. For example if one were to start talking about junk foods and health but they're fat and unhealthy themselves most people tune out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't mention his weight or appearance, sheesh. Read properly. Some else mentioned that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Huh? Hmm you're shilling or deluded to excuse it as just a "show". People listen to this stuff and treat it as news and truth not entertainment. That's the excuse Rush Limbaugh reverts to "Oh I'm joking I didn't mean to call them nappy headed hoes or sluts, I'm an entertainer not a news radio jockey", that's lawyer and PR plausible deniability speak for not owning up to responsibilities. When they're called out they turn around and say it wasn't serious, it is the fault of the humourless.

       Right, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart is just all fake, despite topping polls as being one of the most trustworthy news "shows". So if it was called Alex Jones Report you would listen to it? LOL. No one knows health? You're so funny. The truth is just some generic pixilated concept so why bother with it? Enjoy your Big Mac, fries and Diet Coke.

       Never really feel attacked on Reddit, not sure I have actually. I ignore the silly trolls. It's more exacerbation maybe.

      <p>
       I assume a lot. :-P  That's cool you grow your own food. Do you barter or just deal in cash only? Good for you. Funny how you thought I cared about how people live. We're talking about Alex Jone's credibility and why he's got none. Love your hypocrisy about how I need to stop but then you do exactly that by filing out advice like you're some wise old guru of the Midwest. :-P
      </p>
      <p>
       Opinions? Everybody got one, however assertions are different. Your dismissal out of hand about a news DJ conspiracy theorists credibility is a bit odd. You're in denial, that's fine, bit it's dangerous.when it happens often. Maybe you're taking the high road and being.like Buddha by not worrying about it, but my theory that these.McVeigh, LAX TSA nuts believed the crap that Alex Jones spews and freak out and do dangerous things like they did. And AH just takes in the money and glory and isn't accountable? Where is the justice in that? They knowingly lie and ferment this fear and paranoia and you're OK with that? It's not a world I'm OK with to allow cowards like AJ to froth up a group of armed people to "do a 1776 to the 1984". That's trolling and counterproductive. Brings in real martial law which he's been predicting will happen dozens of times and been wrong dozens of times. And people still listen to him?

       Fourth language? That's awesome. You have great command of English. Fair enough to just torrent for entertainment. Makes sense now. Most resistors are American. AJ tends to apply more to America and formatting up revolt in the USA, which doesn't affect you LOL.

       Oh I do.  I think he's off the mark all the time, but I just don't see how he benefits the CIA.  He makes people distrust them and pretty much everyone in power.  I'm not an AJ fanboy but I have seen better evidence for 9/11 being a Mossad op than AJ being CIA.

       He points the finger at the puppet, and not the puppet masters. Look to the think tanks, the cfr, the bilderbergs, the trilateral commission, the committee of 300, the knights of malta, the Jesuits and zionists, the club of Rome, the royal institute of international affairs

       I genuinely believe the real Alex Jones is dead.  The one on the radio is a MSM shill replacement that doesn't sound or look anything like the real one.

       AJ is so fat he doesn't look at all like how he used to.

       Saying he's a shill replacement is pretty extreme though. Got anything that backs that up? I dont mean sources, anything anecdotal that helps reaffirm your beliefs?

       This is from the author of this post: "How am I being naive, man?
I wouldn't say i'm being weird about taking what im prescribed either. I do take them. Except I take them off and on because a few months back I went through horrible withdrawals when I was taking them regularly. Brain zaps, head buzzing, the whole 9 yards."
      </p>
      <p>
       He is obviously seeing things and hearing things, and worst of all he is crazy without the drugs and with the drugs, now he is a crazy junkie hooked on prescription drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry that you are mentally retarded, you've been a victim of all the chemicals in the food and even water, so now you are batshit crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only retarded people would be obsessed with AJ or any other individual speaking about anything. I mean from all the MSM propaganda, to be obsessed with AJ who even if he was a shill covers more truth than MSM combined in a decade, that to me is really sad to see someone with your mental problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope you get well, hope you can somehow get the mental retardation off.

       Wow dude, you sure as hell went to the extreme to smear my character. I have chronic back pain, I am searching for something that will allow me to live a functioning life. I am not addicted to any substances.

       If that makes me mentally unstable, you surely need to get YOUR head checked.
