        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was at an airport in the US, and was running to catch my plane, trying to make a connection that was already running late.  Seeing nobody at the gate, I opened a door, thinking it was OK since it was still in the boarding time.  This proved to be blatantly NOT OKAY.  I realize this was stupid, and someone should have probably said &quot;Hey, that&#39;s stupid&quot; and I would have stopped.</p>

<p>Instead, though, I had a TSA officer literally running down the hall yelling for me to get down.  I wasn&#39;t allowed to move until told, and I was informed I was being detained.  Within minutes, a team of 3 cops were there, tearing through my carry on luggage.  I suffer from Major Depression, and am being medicated for the disorder.  One of the police asked me if I was taking crazy meds.  I asked why it mattered.  I was informed I was being noncooperative.  This is when it got really interesting.</p>

<p>The female officer called for backup.  I had a pressing engagement I had to make it to and while being polite, started crying, and asked why they were taking it to this extent.  I tried treating for my phone, it was slapped out of my hands and shattered on the ground (I can provide pics ).  She told her backup over the radio that there was an &quot;unstable individual displaying erratic behavior trying to enter the tarmac.&quot;  Nobody had even allowed me to give my side of the story yet.  I kept trying to talk, to get anything out, but was met only with snide cruelty, especially from the female officer.  She told me &quot;I should just call my supervisor to throw your ass in jail.  He doesn&#39;t put up with people like you.&quot;</p>

<p>I was taken to a back room and searched (raped) thoruaghally.  It had been two hours and there were no departing flights out of the airport on my airline at this point.   During the search, the female officer (who was still present) joked about getting out early to watch television.  I have never been so humiliated in my life.</p>

<p>When they had satisfied themselves I wasn&#39;t a terrorist, they let me go sleep in the terminal.</p>

<p>TLDR: Missed grandpas funeral mass because of freedom.  I was an idiot for trying to go out the door, but it was unmarked, and there is nothing that I did that justifies the way I was treated by these assclowns.</p>

<p>I would then take a shower and try to wash the stench of lizard people off of me.  </p>

<p>Also to deal with trauma I find that martial arts is the most effective solution to PTSD and depression (for me).  </p>

<p>Seriously womps, OP.  Speaking for myself, I&#39;ve been there.  Never been physically violated but I&#39;ve been hauled off for extremely lengthy and personal questioning for no reason.  Can&#39;t imagine the rage and hurt you are feeling.  </p>

<p>If it means anything, coming from another human and not a lizard person: Fuck them.  We all gotta work hard so this stuff stops happening.  </p>

<p>Also just to prep you:  When you tell this story some people might try to make you feel stupid or small, as if you are in the wrong.  These people are brainwashed idiots.  Please ignore them.  You have a right to be fucking outraged, and I hope those around you are solid people who get this.  </p>

<p>Finally: Sorry about your g dad.  That hurts too.  Tough week.  Don&#39;t give up, though.  We need you.</p>

<p>The fact that an authority figure gave an order and it was not followed to the letter, justified in her mind her behavior. That is to e expected. People in different walks of life have power kicks all the time. But....</p>

<p>By justifying terrible treatment on the grounds of not OBEYING an authority figure, we have just outlined how conspiracies work. </p>

<p>Of course there was no conspiracy to kill President Kennedy, the Gov told us that&#39;s impossible. </p>

Out for a night on the town? going to see grandma? a trip to the movies perhaps?....enter at your own risk...you are guilty until proven otherwise, and even then, you are always suspect...slowly, one story at a time, one atrocity after another, one more dead puppy on the pile &quot;he was just coming up to say hi&quot;...one more beating, one digital ass raping at a time, 1= 10,000....they have literally changed the habits via fear of this very thing that happened to you, slowly they imprision you in your own home, only then to be watched there, like a free range prisoner living in solitary confinement...it is so much easier to control you when you stay in your pen....oh sure, you free to leave you cell anytime, but do you really want to? are you sure you wouldn&#39;t just rather stay at home with your circumstantial tyranny based depression that we sold to you as &quot;chronic sadness&quot;...WHAT! do you think you have privacy in your health care? ha, the mental health industry is a 2 way street that leads right to your &quot;assessment&quot; by those who watch you....just one more chip they hold over your head. You are number 6, please get back to work and pay your taxes, but if your smart you will only go to work, then come straight home, because it&#39;s the only safe thing for you to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I am sure that the TSA and police probably treated you a bit harshly, it sounds like the problem was your naivety in how to act in an airport. Just reading your description of the events makes me think that you came across as a crazy person. Folks have received worse treatment for doing less. While I too feel as though airport security measures are unnecessary I realize that they exist. Running through any closed door is going to result in getting tackled, probed, roughed-up, interrogated, and inconvenienced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the description, I would say he sounded hysterical and not crazy. Terrorizing hysterical people with probes, hassling, and bullying is not the correct course of action. Hysterical, emotionally overcome people are easy to identify, and after a quick neccessary assessment that he isn&#39;t armed and isn&#39;t an immediate threat, you can calm them down, take them to a different room, and be civil. There&#39;s no need for bullying.</p>

<p>I know we&#39;re expected to receive horrible treatment for slightly stepping out of line at an airport, even accidently. But that is a wrong policy.</p>

The question we have to ask ourselves is - why are so many police so terrified? And who&#39;s training them to brutalize first, ask questions later? And how do we, as citizens, fix this shit? Every incident in our home towns, we should be out protesting and putting pressure to investigate and prosecute those in power who break the law. How do good police fix this stuff? &#39;Cause I know they&#39;re out there. Are they even trying? Or are citizens and good police just giving up in the face of it? Or just too complacent? &quot;It couldn&#39;t happen to me&quot; until it very well does...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try not to fly anymore, my brother almost had similar treatment.  Apparently you have to check into your flight before checking into your flight now.  He was flying Frontier and we showed up to the boarding area 31 minutes before take off.  They told him he needed to check in 30 minutes prior to boarding, obvious &#39;???&#39;s where raised.  They said his email told him to check in online the night before.  He starts getting frustrated, they call security.  Security shows up and is ready to arrest my brother and throw him in jail.  Unlike you my brother is a 6ft 250lb angry veteran who has no shits to give about authority of freedom, when WE fought for freedom our selves.  Security was intimidated enough to hear him out.  He showed them the email and was quickly given a free flight and refunded his money on the flight out that day.  When in doubt, CHALLENGE ALL AUTHORITY!  Fuck them and next time they go to rape you, moan like you like it.  FUCK TSA!</p>
