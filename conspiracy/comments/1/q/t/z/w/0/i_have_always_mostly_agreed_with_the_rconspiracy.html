        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yesterday a user was banned from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1qs6fa/what_happened_to_the_alex_jones_stratfor_thread/cdfyj1m?context=3">this</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, a regular contributor who is known for being hostile to anyone who disagrees with him made <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1qs6fa/what_happened_to_the_alex_jones_stratfor_thread/cdfza3d?context=3">this</a> series of comments with no punishment whatsoever. </p>

<p>The moderator who did the ban on BlackSwanx said he was banned for attacking the sub due to the exchange I first linked to. Meanwhile, OWNtheNWO can regularly belittle and namecall anyone here, and obviously attack the sub itself in a worse way than the banned user. </p>

<p>I have never encountered BlackSwanX before this, and have no stake in his being banned. I just believe that everything about what took place on that thread was wrong, and for the first time I have seen what I believe was a mod getting a little out of control on this sub. Because as far as I can tell, the user was banned for little more than disagreeing with a mod. If that weren&#39;t the case then <a href="/u/OWNtheNWO">/u/OWNtheNWO</a> would have been banned as well. Hopefully I myself don&#39;t get banned for this post, as I have been a member of this sub for a long time and would like to continue to be. However, I can&#39;t agree with what took place and would like to see a fitting resolution. I have always liked the jobs the mods do here, I have had many encounters with them and all have been pleasant save this one. I think it was just a case of people getting hot headed and shit snowballed from there. But this is all just my opinion, I could be in the wrong here and maybe am looking at this wrong. Your opinions are desired guys, thanks.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a mod elsewhere I know these are tough decisions sometimes, but that thread should not have been erased. </p>

<p>Once something gets that amount of attention on front-page of Hot, you deal with it appropriately by making sure everyone knows that what the real story is. You don&#39;t just remove it without a note or warning, leaving countless of us wondering what happened. </p>

<p>There are many other reasons, but another is that the mod in question did not appear to care much about it when questioned by a subscriber. I appreciate the work that mods do, but listen to the community better or you&#39;re just stirring flames and watching them burn. </p>

<p>No. Just no. We are not catering for 5 year olds. Nobody with anything worth saying bases their knowledge on a matter by a headline they read on a subreddit where every second title is about things that 1) don&#39;t come true, 2) aren&#39;t true, 3) are somewhat libelous. </p>

<p>I took part in the original thread, putting my resources into verifying whether OP&#39;s find was being correctly interpreted. It was a shot in the dark and we were able to objectively conclude that it wasn&#39;t the same guy. Do you, or does anyone, believe there is no archival value in this? </p>

Also note that no one dragged him into anything, if you read that thread at all you will realize that he dove in head first of his own free will. </p>

<p>EDIT- I would also like to add something that I guess I failed to mention. The reason I made this post was because I messaged the mods about these complaints that I and many others have. Messaged repeatedly. I have received no response and so finally I decided to take it to a larger court. It is very rare that I don&#39;t get along with everyone I encounter here, and the reason is because I try to make sure that I am respectful to the people that I come across. I like to think I am fairly well liked among the people that know me here, just as I like most of the people that I encounter here. I apologize if you feel like I am going about this the wrong way, if you have suggestions on a better way to do it I am always open to listening to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t two different issues it was one issue. The issue is two people are accused of the same thing, yet the punishment was not dealt equally. One of these people had disagreed with a mod, one of them hadn&#39;t. Apparently because of that the person who disagreed with a mod is gone, the other one isn&#39;t. I don&#39;t think either one of them should have been banned, but I do think that if rules are going to be enforced it should be done evenly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s two different issues. Because I support the unbanning of blackswan but I don&#39;t support the attack on OWNtheNWO. It should be a separate thread. Look you&#39;re more than welcome to lump them together but you&#39;re going to lose support doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not really calling for the ban of anyone I&#39;m just pointing out that in this case there was someone banned for &quot;attacking the sub&quot;, meanwhile we have someone else mere comments away blatantly attacking the sub who received no punishment. The difference between these two was that one was disagreeing with a mod and one wasn&#39;t. If there are going to be rules enforced, they should be enforced equally and without personal emotion being involved.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>at this point i could definitely agree with banning <a href="/u/OWNtheNWO">/u/OWNtheNWO</a>  he doesn&#39;t even try to argue with people that disagree with him he just calls them fuck face shills and ends the conversation there, he did say he wanted to stop coming to this subreddit and he hasn&#39;t posted in a while so lets hope he&#39;s gone for good. people like that can make a forum such as this become a cesspool pretty quickly.</p>

<p>With that said the Alex Jones thread was kind of stupid it wasn&#39;t even the same Alex Jones so I&#39;m glad the thread got removed because as much as i disagree and dislike most things Alex Jones thinks and says people were just attacking him because of a chain of emails he had nothing to do with but a perma ban shouldn&#39;t have been given out for a comment like that, maybe a 3 day ban or something like that to keep things civil but everyone has a right to their own opinion and we shouldn&#39;t be perma banning them when they use that right. </p>

<p>And finally the mods on this forum have been doing a fantastic job as this subreddit grows bigger and bigger, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> have done a terrible job and have censored a ton of posts than point to a random rule on the sidebar which most of the time the rules were never broken. this subreddit has become a great place to discuss and also find alternative media articles if you read the first part of the sidebar under the subs picture they could very well ban as many posts as they want and than point to that part and say its not a conspiracy so it doesn&#39;t belong here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the part about the mods here doing a good job. I&#39;ve had many encounters with them, mostly <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> and they&#39;ve all been good experiences. Part of the reason I like this sub so much is because the mods aren&#39;t out of control with the banning and such. In fact whenever I see someone talking crap about them I stick up for them. And I hope I&#39;m not coming off as talking crap about them now, because I&#39;m not. I&#39;m just addressing something that I think was wrong and hoping it can be corrected or prevented in the future. I&#39;m still not in complete agreement about the deletion of a post for lack of evidence, but that is also just my opinion and Mr. Dong and I discussed it, he gave his reasons I gave mine and that was that. I respect his decision, and that&#39;s really my entire thoughts on that  issue. But I don&#39;t agree with his decision to ban someone for something I don&#39;t feel he did at all, and meanwhile a few comments away there&#39;s some egotistical nut going on a rant and completely assaulting the sub and it&#39;s users that nothing happened too at all. Nothing may come of this and if it doesn&#39;t that&#39;s that, I&#39;m still a fan of this sub, it&#39;s mods and it&#39;s users. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been banned from this sub 3-4 times on different accounts, not for breaking the rules, and each time i&#39;ve contacted the other mods to no avail (its all a joke to them), the reasons i was banned were simply because the mods didn&#39;t like my username or didn&#39;t like me confronting them about abusing their power (was done so in a non-hostile manner), if you haven&#39;t been banned yet you are not doing it right.</p>

<p>and please, lets not be so naive to believe this sub is different than any of the other popular ones.</p>

I have a conspiracy that OTN is actually Alex jones. I get very sad when I see 4 posts, one after another on this thread, all of infowars. At least be versatile! Like, the dude isn&#39;t even a conspiracy theorist, he&#39;s just an Alex Jones reddit megaphone. </p>
