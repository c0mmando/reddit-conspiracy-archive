       "one of President Johnson's close friends was David Harold Byrd, who created the Civil Air Patrol just before World War II and later formed Ling-Tempco-Vought (LTV Corporation).
So the Byrd name was often seen with Johnson's.
No relation to Lady Bird Johnson. She had this name as a very young girl."
(so they say but BYRD is a very unusual name and Lady bird Johnson is often spelled Lady BYRD Johnson.)

       "Johnson may also have helped secure the financing from his Texas oil backers – H.L. Hunt, John Mecom, John De Menil, Sid W. Richardson, D. Harold Byrd (who owned the Texas Schoolbook Depository Building at the time of the assassination),"
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way former President eisenhower who you remember warned in his last speech of the huge secret Military industrial complex called HL Hunt pretty much nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       "President Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953-1961). The original passage, from a letter Eisenhower wrote to his brother Edgar on Nov. 8, 1954, went as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       Should any political party attempt to abolish social security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these things. Among them are H. L. Hunt (you possibly know his background), a few other Texas oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or business man from other areas. Their number is negligible and they are stupid. "

       (by the way you'll notice that link is to archive.org because the letter is no longer onthe Eisenhower presidetial website so you might want to download that and back it up.)

       Civil Air Patrol was conceived by Gill Robb Wilson and Fiorello LaGuardia in the late 30s. David Byrd had nothing to do with it. They patrolled the coast by air during WW2 looking for U-Boats.

       From that article it is pretty detailed about his history in the civil air patrol.
      </p>
      <p>
       "David Harold Byrd was born in Detroit, Texas, on April 24, 1900. He studied geology at the University of Texas (1917-19) and during his holidays worked on an oil rig in Santa Anna.
      </p>
      <p>
       After leaving university he worked for H. E. Humphreys. He joined Old Dominion Oil Company of San Antonio in 1924 but the following year he became a freelance geological consultant. During this time he acquired his nickname by drilling fifty-six dry holes. His luck changed when he discovered oil on 5th May, 1928. The Byrd-Daniels oil-field produced 1,000 barrels a day, which sold for three dollars a barrel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Byrd formed a business partnership with Jack Frost and in 1931 founded Byrd-Frost Incorporated. The new company operated 492 East Texas wells that produced an average of 4,000 barrels a day. In the 1930s he purchased property, including the Texas School Book Depository building in Dallas.
      </p>
      <p>
       During this period Byrd became very interested in aviation. In 1938 Governor James Allred appointed him to the Texas Civil Aeronautics Commission. In September 1941 he formed the Civil Air Patrol. During the Second World War Byrd commanded an antisubmarine base for the Civil Air Patrol at Beaumont.
      </p>
      <p>
       Byrd's cousin was Harry F. Byrd, who was described by Alden Hatch (The Byrds of Virginia: An American Dynasty) as "the leader of conservative opinion in the United States." Byrd also had a close relationship with Sam Rayburn, Lyndon Johnson and John Connally. As Byrd pointed out in his autobiography, I'm an Endangered Species: "Another goal was to reach a rapport with the politicians who ran things, especially at the seat of state government in Austin.... Sam Rayburn, Morrie Sheppard, John Connally, and Lyndon Johnson on the national scene were to become men I could go to any time that I wanted action, and so were a succession of Texas governors."
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1944 Byrd founded Byrd Oil Corporation and B-H Drilling Corporation. In 1952 Byrd established the Three States Natural Gas Company. Byrd later sold Byrd Oil to Mobil and Three States to Delhi-Taylor. Byrd used this money to invest in aircraft production and established Temco. A company that employed Mac Wallace after he was convicted of killing John Kinser.

       Alright, I had to go do some digging since David Byrd's name never once was mentioned in my 4 years in CAP.
      </p>
      <p>
       The organization known as Civil Air Patrol was in fact founded by Gill Robb Wilson. David Byrd formed/founded the Texas chapter of the organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       ETA: Just talked to a friend of mine who was in a Texas Squadron. I guess they do talk about Byrd more in their programs. I was in the Illinois Wing.
