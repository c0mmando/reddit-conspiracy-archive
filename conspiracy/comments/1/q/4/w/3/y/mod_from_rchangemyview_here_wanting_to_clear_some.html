        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve only just found out about this, but there seems to be some confusion about the whole thing. Mainly that the CMV mods were involved, when in fact we weren&#39;t <strong>at all</strong>. </p>

<p>We were very proud of the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fv4r6/i_believe_the_government_should_be_allowed_to/caeb3pl">comment</a> made by <a href="/u/161719">/u/161719</a> that earned about 11,500 points, 15x reddit gold, #1 bestof post of all time, and a huge interest across the whole internet. Definitely a defining moment in our history.</p>

<p>Then, roughly 5 months later, 161719 posts a comment to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that gets linked to <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a>. This sparks some ban on all <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posts, and from what I can tell, <strong>caused 161719 to change his original comment into what it is now - his opinion of bestof and a copy/paste of his <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> comment</strong>. Only then was the bestof post removed, as <strong>it was no longer the comment advertised by the title and the comment users would expect upon clicking</strong>, although he did provide a link to the original version.</p>

<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: At the top of his edited comment, it says &quot;THIS COMMENT HAS BEEN REMOVED&quot;, suggesting that this was done by the CMV mods. If we had removed the comment, you wouldn&#39;t be able to read that sentence.)</p>

<p>This all upsets me greatly, and 161719 has put us in a difficult position. If you have understood what I&#39;ve told you so far, bestof might actually have done the right thing by removing what was now a completely different comment. Will we leave it up? I&#39;m not sure yet. Perhaps we&#39;ll use some CSS trickery to insert an image of the original comment in its place.</p>

<p>Did 161719 do the right thing by using his top comment to platform his opinions? I don&#39;t think so, and I believe that because the original comment is now less accessible, it is probably a negative thing. I wish he kept his CMV comment and his <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> comment separate, and then he wouldn&#39;t have lost both. (<strong>Edit</strong>: I&#39;ve got a feeling it&#39;s this part that&#39;s caused people to downvote me. I&#39;m sorry if my opinion has annoyed you, but it&#39;s not really about what you or I think. This is about clearing up the confusion that CMV was somehow involved.)</p>

<p>Anyway, hopefully I&#39;ve made this confusing progression a little clearer. Feel free to ask me any more questions :)</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>TL;DR FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DON&#39;T SEEM TO BE READING THE POST PROPERLY:</strong> I am a mod of <a href="/r/changemyview">/r/changemyview</a>, not <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a>. I, and the other CMV mods, have no control over what bestof has removed. None of 161719&#39;s comments have been removed from CMV.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I have added a couple of images to the top of 161719&#39;s <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fv4r6/i_believe_the_government_should_be_allowed_to/caeb3pl">original comment</a>. Before people get up in arms again, nothing was removed - all of 161719&#39;s material is still there. I did this to make everything clearer, and benefit everyone as much as possible. People can read the original comment easily now, and 161719&#39;s edit is still there too.</p>

If you can find me a rule that says you must praise Israel, then please show me. This thread is extremely misleading because we are concentrating on the fact that his 5 month old post was deleted, instead of the real problem. Technically his 5month old comment&#39;s deletion was for violating a rule, but that violation was RETALIATORY.  The bestof mods (or whoever did the censoring) fired the first shot. That is the issue and the only issue. All of this other business about technically violating a rule and talking about r/CMV is just a diversion from the simple, one sentence problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why you care about my personal opinion on the matter, as outside of CMV I&#39;m just another joe, but if you want my full opinion here it is. </p>

<p>Before I start I want to note that these are my tentative opinions based on what information I have at the moment and are subject to change and more information becomes available</p>

<p>It is my understanding that <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> disallows submissions from certain subs, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> included. I don&#39;t fully know their reasons for this. If they have a good reason, that&#39;s fine. If not, that kind of sucks. </p>

<p>If my understanding is correct, removing the link to his post from their sub was permissible. I don&#39;t think such an action holds any moral weight one way or the other.  However, if my understanding is wrong, and there is no such ban on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and it was removed due to content, that is clearly wrong.</p>

<p>How <a href="/u/161719">/u/161719</a> acted after the removal was counterproductive - by editing his 5 month old bestof post he was abusing the platform he had been given, and removing that post from <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> was appropriate (and unfortunate). The <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> submission that linked to his post was no longer accurate and they have no obligation to keep linking to his post after it had been altered. </p>

<p>After he edited his post and was banned from <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a>, at some point he deleted his account. I feel that was very unfortunate too as now he cannot relate his side of the story.</p>

<p>I have not seen any evidence that the <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> mods removed the post because of criticism of Israel or anything like that. I personally have no horse in that race - I do not consider myself informed enough on the subject to form any opinions one way or another. I do wish the <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> mods would try to clear the air and say what went down from their point of view.</p>

<p>So I have a quantum superposition of views on this, and without more information I&#39;m not rooting for anyone. I don&#39;t like to hold views that are not well informed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see a lot of people throwing accusations around about CMV censoring the comment.  </p>

<p>For instance, looking at your sub <a href="/r/CMV">/r/CMV</a>, and the new comments in reply to the edited comment:</p>

<p>The newest comment, by _shlwe, mentions that she asked <a href="/r/help">/r/help</a> and <a href="/r/answers">/r/answers</a> about the censored comment, but if you look at those requests she/he clearly was asking about /b/bestof mod actions and not <a href="/r/CMV">/r/CMV</a>.  She/he got it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another reader that wasn&#39;t confused:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sometimesimweird 1 point 2 days ago</p>

<p>Reading this and the other comment you made that you linked has made me much more aware of the world around me. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>161719 clearly states a number of times how he turned his most highly rated comment into a &quot;platform&quot; to spread the message about censorship.</p>

<p>In fact, the only people I see making a point about being confused is Snorrrlax who introduces the idea there is confusion.  Then Snorrlax expresses his/her personal opinion how 161719 wasted his potential to get the earlier message out.  Most other commentators seem focused on the <a href="/r/best">/r/best</a> of mods censoring the comment about Israel.</p>

<p>Where&#39;s all this confusion that needs to take precedence over the actual censorship?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>u/161719 posted the Israel comment to r/conspiracy.</p></li>

<li><p>One of the r/bestof mods said it was a false comment and deleted the r/bestof post.</p></li>
<li><p>r/conspiracy reacted by getting upset.</p></li>
<li><p>Not liking the reaction, same mod requested to ban r/conspiracy from r/bestof.</p></li>
<li><p>Request was accepted, and r/conspiracy was banned. Time Passes.</p></li>
<li><p>u/161719 posted the surveillance comment to r/changemyview.</p></li>
<li><p>Surveillance comment was bestof&#39;d, and became the all-time top r/bestof post.</p></li>
<li><p>u/161719 changed the text of the surveillance comment on r/changemyview to be the same as the Israel comment from r/conspiracy, along with a complaint about censorship by r/bestof mods. Also included a link to the original text of the surveillance comment (or maybe that was edited in at step 11).</p></li>
<li><p>On the grounds that this was unfairly priviledging the story about Israel, the r/bestof mods deleted the post and banned the user. They <em>also</em> deleted every other post the user had on r/bestof. By that I mean other comments he&#39;d made that were bestof&#39;d, not posts he&#39;d submitted there.</p></li>
<li><p>u/161719 edits the comment with updates.</p></li>
<li><p>The r/changemyview mods use css magic to append the original surveillance comment text to the beginning of the altered r/changemyview comment, without censoring u/161719&#39;s complaints or the story about Israel.</p></li>
<li><p>u/161719 deletes their account.</p></li>

<p>If he had not edited that comment, effectively making it a completely different comment, it would have remained #1 for all to see, so make of that what you will. CMV shouldn&#39;t really be involved in all this, but there&#39;s been a lot of confusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I don&#39;t think anybody really cares about the CMV issue right now. The top bestof comment that he edited was in retaliation to unwarranted censoring, would you agree? </p>

<p>Your second paragraph (and please correct me if I&#39;m wrong) appears to be a slight misdirection because nobody really cares about the original content of that comment. The main issue is the &quot;censoring for talking bad about Israel.&quot; Since his comment was censored, clearly unnecessarily, he retaliated by changing the other comment.

<p>There&#39;s a reason why it was the #1 bestof post of all time. 5 months ago when it first appeared, the amount of eyes it seemed to open was unbelievable, and I would expect <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to appreciate that. Now, it is a lot less accessible, which can only be a bad thing. I&#39;m not sure why anyone is okay with this amazing comment being removed by ultimately 161719 himself, just to make a different point.</p>

<p>And about CMV, a lot of people think we&#39;re censoring, so they do care. And therefore we care.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, doing this got that comment removed. If he hadn&#39;t edited it, it&#39;d still be there for everyone to see and everyone to learn from. I can only reword the same point so many times, but please let me know if this is still confusing you, because the way I see it there is no way in which editing that comment is a greater benefit than the message the comment was already spreading.</p>

Just because the words &quot;do not censor content strictly to praise Israel&quot; was not written down somewhere as a rule does not mean it was not a rule.

<p>So you&#39;ve clarified that you didn&#39;t censor the comment.  Great!  But we already knew that!  He clearly stated that in his edited comment:</p>

<p>As if it wasn&#39;t obvious because as you point out we could read his comment on CMV.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve never said you can&#39;t, and we&#39;ve never prohibited or made a rule against it in CMV.

<p>I personally think removals of content should be accompanied with an explanation. But when you only have one reddit account, sometimes you speak for yourself, and sometimes you speak &quot;for the office&quot;. Since we only managed to figure out what happened in the last 24 hours, most of what we&#39;ve done so far is speak &quot;for the office&quot;.</p>

<p>As a person, I don&#39;t know why <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> decided to ban submissions from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. It&#39;s their sub, so they get to decide what to do with it, but I think subreddits should provide explanations for what they do.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t yet know why they did it, and on a personal level I&#39;m the type who &quot;waits and watches&quot; before forming an opinion. It&#39;s a habit that CMV encourages by its very mission to entertain all points of view. </p>

<p>On first blush it seems dubious. I don&#39;t think I would have done it had I been a mod there, but maybe <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> had a reason and they&#39;ve chosen not to talk about it. I personally detest censorship, but at the same time I respect the right to create forums with a focus that&#39;s enforced. If a forum is about cats, I would understand why they&#39;d remove posts about dogs. We have a luxury here, on reddit, that anyone can start a new forum about dogs.</p>

<p>(And no, I don&#39;t know or could explain why <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> felt <a href="/r/censorship">/r/censorship</a> posts were &quot;dogs&quot; to their &quot;cats&quot;. I don&#39;t think I should speculate on their behalf.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s when the enforcement is universal, or done in such a way that it&#39;s realistically impossible to publish ideas with equal or greater exposure elsewhere, that I feel the &quot;focused forum&quot; excuse doesn&#39;t hold.</p>

<p>The reason I don&#39;t have a stronger opinion is because I&#39;ve formed so many, thousands of opinions over time, only to see them shot down days, months, even decades later when some other information came out. Thousands of issues, thousands of historical events, thousands of judgements reversed over and over again. After so many, I came to the conclusion that &quot;the only correct opinion is that there are no correct opinions,&quot; and I came to that long before today, or yesterday, or even when <a href="/u/161719">/u/161719</a> made their initial post 5 months ago.</p>

<p>For the same reasons, I don&#39;t judge someone for the opinions they form in the early hours of an event. It&#39;s something we do, and people change their minds, and that&#39;s part of why I was attracted to a sub called Change My View.</p>

<p>I think <a href="/u/161719">/u/161719</a> deserves the energy to protect what he thinks about both state surveillance, Israel vs. Palestine, and censorship. I think those issues also deserve that much energy and more on their own merits, regardless of who&#39;s saying it.</p>

<p>Perhaps not, but if he returns and tells us what he wants, then we will likely honor his wishes.

<p>Perhaps we will try other ways in the coming hours and days. We&#39;re going to see what effect there&#39;ll be by using CSS to add an image to the original comment. Either way, we have to work within the limitations of reddit. More elegant methods aren&#39;t yet features we can use.

<p>If you want to assist a commentator spread his message I would suggest simply adding a reply comment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fv4r6/i_believe_the_government_should_be_allowed_to/cd97gyi">We did</a>.</p>

<p>I scrolled until the bottom of <a href="/u/161719">/u/161719</a>&#39;s comment was just under the top of the browser scroll area, and then I hit &quot;PgDown&quot; and counted them until I got to <a href="/u/Snorrrlax">/u/Snorrrlax</a> &#39;s explanatory comment.</p>

<p>One hundred and eleven &quot;Page Downs&quot; later, I got to that comment.</p>

<p>Your mileage may vary, depending on the size of your screen, resolution, and how high the window is set. Mine was set to about 720 pixels high (half the height of a 2560x1440 screen). Presumably that means if I&#39;d maximized the window and performed the same experiment, I would have only needed to page down 55 times to find the comment in question.</p>

<p>But the odds that any but a single-digit percentage of all the people who are still viewing that comment--which has undoubtedly increased considerably in the last two days--would get down that far, after <em>acres</em> of 5-month-old comments, is very low.</p>

<p>When someone sees &quot;THIS COMMENT HAS BEEN REMOVED&quot; and won&#39;t know it was the user&#39;s action--and not ours--until they scroll through 50 to 100 pages before reaching our explanation, it leads to problems that could be avoided very easily by simply explaining the new situation above the fold.</p>

<p>Again, fine, if you really think there is &quot;confusion&quot; then <em>maybe</em> it&#39;s okay to put an short and sweet explanation at the bottom of his comment.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see any of the new commentators that had problems figuring this out.  One person was confused and thought the newly edited comment got all the upvotes, but 161719 set them straight right away.  Most comments were focused on the censorship because of the anti Israel point of view.  One comment, from nagelwithlox, disparaged the comment as being &#39;astroturfing,&#39; apparently taking issue with the negative reflection on Israel.</p>

<p>Also, it wasn&#39;t the user&#39;s actions that led to this.  It was the <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> mods.  Once again you mods are revealing your bias and subtly supporting the original censorship.</p>

<p>Yes, I think you&#39;re right. I don&#39;t think we have access to any kind of statistics about how our users chose to sort comments though. From what I underatand, the default sort is &quot;top&quot;, which is the one I used to measure the distance.</p>

<p>It might be possible to do this, I don&#39;t presently know if reddit provides this mechanism, though. I think what <a href="/u/Snorrrlax">/u/Snorrrlax</a> did was use CSS to insert an image via comment flair.</p>

<p>I hope so, too.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d like to understand the nature of the bias. I think what you&#39;re saying is that we&#39;re biased to favor other mods ahead of any other person. In the case of <a href="/u/161719">/u/161719</a>, I view them in the same context as I described earlier: that I do not judge someone for what they do in the early hours after an event. People are often compelled to act on the limited information they have, especially when it seems that time is critical, and most importantly I believe this applies to us as well. I noticed that <a href="/u/Snorrrlax">/u/Snorrrlax</a> has tweaked the image he attached to the post-in-question, possibly as he learns more and processes it.</p>

<p>A hazard of moderating a sub like CMV is that we are tennis balls in the court of accused bias. I think I could be a contender in a match of contradictory accused biases. I&#39;ve got accusations of being both a mysogynist and a female femminist, an anti-GMO <em>and</em> a Monsanto shill. If you could clarify the bias you&#39;re accusing me of, I might have contradictory testimony.</p>

<p>161719 wanted to edit his comment and his edit should stand.  If the mods want to clarify a charge they <em>perceive</em> from the comment then they should reply with a comment.  Or at worst leave an unobtrusive note, preferably at the end of the comment, clearly identifying them as mods, stating something like OP&#39;s TL;DR states.</p>

If I wanted to support Snorrrlax&#39;s efforts to defend his subreddit&#39;s reputation here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, all I could do is upvote this submission and maybe make some informative or convincing comments here. As moderator, you can do more, and have, by using the sticky post. </p>

<p>Should moderators be elite users with special powers to advance their own agendas, good or bad? In my opinion, no! This is about the role of moderators on reddit. In my opinion even the need for round the clock dedicated moderators is a major design flaw of reddit. But if we must have moderators, their role should be minimal. </p>

<p>I strongly disapprove of two tiers of users on reddit, and I would expect most <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> participants to feel the same way. </p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s not said in the manner he wanted it said.  He took out text and you put it back in, and in an order he didn&#39;t choose and wouldn&#39;t likely choose.</p>

<p>I understand having a rule about editing for such reasons as people&#39;s links will no longer make sense.  But he clearly stated at the top that his previous comment was elsewhere and linked to it.  Someone coming from another link would be able to figure it out and get to his original comment.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I appreciated you having the courage and respectability to come to this sub and at least try to clear up the confusion, you must understand that most of us here have either witnessed or been a victim of censorship.  This is a very tender topic for us.  Regardless of what you say some will continue to hold a grudge.  I for one thank you for at least trying to clear up the mess.  My suggestion to you, if you care to redeem yourself in r/conspiracy&#39;s eyes, would be to put his comment back up, as it is, and walk away.  Just my two cents.</p>

<p>we are to be kept in a censored corral by the moneychangers, the next Hitler is on the rise, and he is a Jew, and he is coming for revenge against the rothschilds for killing us, the new holocaust will involve about 2500 men, and when justice has been served and the world freed from these evil gangsters, only then will peace prevail.</p>
