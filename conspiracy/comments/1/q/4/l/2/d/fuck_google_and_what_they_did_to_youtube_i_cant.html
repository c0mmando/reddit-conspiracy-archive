    <div class="md"><p>I had a brilliant exchange because of the reply feature.</p>

<p>I had a five day back-and-forth with a guy who couldn&#39;t definitively find that the U.S. Constitution applied to me in any way. He kept talking about case findings, but that&#39;s all if you operate within the bounds of the U.S. Constitution. He was never able to say that I was within any of those boundaries. I thought it was hilarious. He called me all manner of bad name and yet he was strangely unable to show that the U.S. Constitution was applicable to me (his final comment to me was something to the effect of &quot;stop being stupid&quot;). That exchange was only possible because of the reply feature.</p>

<p>Now such exchanges simply will not happen.</p>

<p>Too bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not accused you of anything. You made the claim. &quot;The constitution does not apply to me&quot;. It might suffice to say that you are accusing the government of binding you to something which does not apply to you, making you the plaintiff. </p>

<p>Furthermore, if your claim is that you operate outside of the constitution and the law of the land, then such rules like &#39;the burden of proof is on the plaintiff&#39; need not apply either, therefore you cannot use that to your advantage. You can&#39;t pick some aspects of law and throw other aspects out. Do you see what I mean? You are using a technicality that your argument claims is null from the get go. </p>

<p>Rather than pretend we are in a courtroom, just lead me through the logical path that lead you to make this claim... or we can get Socratic, your call. No rush</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, on some bands this is true. There are ways around this though--such as repeaters.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about using them for nefarious purposes--just that (barring an EMP) they CAN be used in a situation where the internet &quot;goes down.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have them in cop cars. When the cop talks into his &quot;body radio&quot; the signal is too weak to get to dispatch--so it goes to the car. The repeater in the trunk &quot;rebroadcasts&quot; the transmission to the endpoint. You can scramble at the repeater and decode at the endpoint also. Cops nowadays do this so you can&#39;t use a Radio Shack scanner to listen in on TACFREQS (well, most of them do...) </p>

<p>So, what I&#39;m saying is that you can use a low-power transmitter to get to a higher power (and hidden) repeater. If &quot;they&quot; track it (hard if you use TDMA or CDMA--or just scramble) they&#39;ll find the repeater radio and NOT you.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that there&#39;s a LOT more involved--this is the ELI5 answer because my fingers are tired!  ; &#39;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go over to hamuniverse! </p>

<p>Trust me...invest the time in learning, really learning, about HAM radio. If you&#39;re a techie like me you will not be disappointed! It&#39;s a fun hobby with a relatively low price of entry. To start you should get a good beginner HAM book (Radio Shack can get them) and a shortwave receiver to get a feel for the different bands. Then get your license (easy) and a cheap iCom 2m radio. You can NEVER learn enough. Example: simple <em>antennae</em> can cover years of information. Imagine how much there is to know about the radios themselves! ;)</p>

<p>In my city there are also clubs. Back in the day (1990) I was making phone calls over my radio and the club that owned the repeater charged like $10/mo dues. And with packet radio you can send data around the world for nothing, with no wires. It&#39;s not too fast...but it&#39;s fascinating.</p>

<p>Oh yeah...you&#39;ll get far better &quot;skip&quot; at night...the ionosphere will sometimes let me hear broadcasters in Europe and Asia from the Midwest USA. If you buy a receiver its a LOT more fun to listen at night!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They want &quot;civilized&quot; conversation. Everyone showing their true identity with picture and name so you can be accountable for what you say. Some fagget in the youtube comments on the video where they announced the change said that people who were against this were afraid of change. Meanwhile this stupid motherfucker had a picture and real name on his google+.</p>

<p>This is the kind of stupid we are dealing with, this guy hasn&#39;t a fucking clue what he&#39;s doing, he just loves technology and efficiency. He then proceeds to tag a friend and they start chatting like its fucking facebook on there. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sick to my stomach. </p>

<p>ps: most articles that covered this move by google were actually happy, they all used the same reasons. Troll comments and civility. People censor themselves when they are exposed to the opinions and judgement of others. If you got your whole friend list checking what you say on a youtube video about some controversial shit people will be more afraid. I&#39;m gonna be bloody honest and say that I don&#39;t want my friends to know what I write on reddit and youtube.</p>

<p>This is where I can truly express everything I feel. Whether I just want to call people faggots or elaborate extensively on the corrupt mechanisms in our world. You aren&#39;t going to get a more honest place than an anonymous internet. It reflects our collective consciousness, we can see all that is dark and all that is good. Ignoring or sugar coating it isn&#39;t going to make people stop feeling what they feel.</p>
