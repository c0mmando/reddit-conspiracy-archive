We must seriously ask whether reddit has gone down the toilet bowl along with the rest of the sewage and if the answer is yes, then we must find, or create, alternatives where we are free to talk with each other, to inform each other, and have the freedom to pursue those things about which we are curious to know and understand.  It&#39;s time to ask whether there is a reddit conspiracy which is following the agenda of a handful of unknown reddit administrators.</p>

In the course of the discussion he slipped up and exposed himself as a hard core political activist posing as an innocent tourist who encounters Israeli evil.  How do you know he hasn&#39;t deleted himself, and is now stirring up this controversy?</p>

<p>I followed that thread closely, and his points were disproved by people writing in with facts, left right and center.  When people disagreed with him he vomited out racial slurs, and accused them of being Israeli agents.</p>

<p>I think he deleted himself to cover up his own slip, and to set off this fire storm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So where do we go now? I don&#39;t like this shit anymore. Sure, this sub is relatively transparent, but I don&#39;t fucking care about that. I don&#39;t want reddit to think it can do this and not lose users. This fucking pisses me off. They are basically begging for money with the &quot;buy our gold&quot; campaign and now they are increasing censorship. I wonder if they&#39;re using that increase in gold purchasing to hire the manpower for this increased censorship. I sometimes browse /pol, but a) it can be too racially motivated and b) the interface is not as streamlined as it is here. So what now? And like I mentioned yesterday, sure we can go to GLP, ATS, etc but here our ideas and posts can reach members outside the sub, and reach new users like yesterday with /bestof. It&#39;s a shame, it&#39;s a great sub here, one of the better ones IMO and we also share it with non-conspirwcy theorists... Ideas spread far and fast here</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their presentment is taken as fact by the Supreme Court.  It&#39;s not an &quot;overruling&quot; but a difference of jurisdiction.</p>

<p>A presentment or indictment of a Common Law or People&#39;s Grand Jury cannot be questioned by the Supreme Court because it comes from the same jurisdiction of law as that of the Constitution, the same document that grants them any and all power.  </p>

<p>It simply exists in a higher realm of truth than that which the Supreme Court could rule, therefore they cannot overrule it.  It was written by The People, and they literally cannot question it.</p>

<p>The really interesting thing is that the People&#39;s Grand Jury is used today by prosecutors for things like federal RICO charges and such.  The government could never find you guilty for freely associating with other people, so they get 25 people in a room and have them attest that a person is guilty <em>simply because they associate with criminals</em> and that statement of &quot;truth&quot;, as illogical and unconstitutional as it is, is actually treated as &quot;truth&quot; by the system, it has to.  It is an indictment of a Common Law Grand Jury, so it is itself evidence of a true common-law crime.  Someone was injured and that indictment is proof, even though the prosecutor and judge and everyone else being paid by The People could never, ever, in a million years arrest someone for being affiliated with a criminal.  </p>

<p>Knowing the rules of the system is powerful.  Some rules you can bend, some you can break ... and some you can just simply use for your own benefit.  </p>

<p>Take some time and research the Common Law Grand Jury.  It will blow your mind what We the People could be doing if we realized that the power actually does lie in the hands of The People.  But if we aren&#39;t smart enough to hold them accountable, they are not going to go out of their way to tell us how.  </p>

We use the same psychological warfare as they do, but on our friends and families to subtley change perception of &quot;reality&quot; back to what it should be? The war is in conscious perception, so we need to make people aware that their very own mind is a fucking battlefield that has an infinite amount of influences on the subconscious level.. What are your thoughts on this paradigm shift</p>

<p>This.

<p>Which is utter bullshit. Reddit is a <strong><em>for</em></strong> profit company, it&#39;s their goal to <strong><em>make</em></strong> money!!! Instead, they pander to their userbase for <del>donations</del> hand-outs like this is fucking wikipedia. Fuck you Condé Nast.</p>

This is one individual subreddit not knowing what the fuck it&#39;s doing. This isn&#39;t reddit admins, and it even looks like 16719 deleted his own account at this point. One could argue about whether or not reddit is getting shitty, but let&#39;s not flip our shit based upon this story alone, which has nothing to do with reddit&#39;s admins. This is just <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> mods being idiots.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget subreddits are essentially autonomous. The mods of a given subreddit have total control of what stays or gets removed within that subreddit. A single subreddit&#39;s actions are not representative of the site as a whole, and anyone can always make a competing subreddit if they feel the moderators of a particular subreddit are failing at their jobs. People&#39;s reaction to this is akin to someone accusing the President of the United States of contriving a conspiracy because a local sheriff threatened someone and forced them out of their town.</p>

<p>You say this is exemplary of a bigger problem, but it seems this one story is really all anyone can reference. I&#39;m pretty upset at <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> and have lost a huge amount of respect for the subreddit and its mods, but I don&#39;t harbor any hard feelings to reddit or its admins.</p>

<p>Edit: Fun Fact: Paragraph 2 contains six uses of the word &quot;subreddit.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve accused 161719 of being a political activist and spouting racial slurs. I could easily type out the assertion that he did no such thing and you are a disinformation agent, here to do cleanup and crowd control by tarnishing his reputation with your dirty lizard people lies. See, you can type anything. Saying it doesn&#39;t make it true. I don&#39;t have a dog in this race. 161719 didn&#39;t change my mind about Israel or Palestine or Gaza. I&#39;m curious is all, because I&#39;ve seen it happen before, the criticism of Israel being met with frothy mouthed charges and recrimination. Since someone (maybe even himself) censored what he did say, I wonder if you have any evidence to support what you say. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now you are doing a major job of transference.  I was responding to the wild accusation that others had attacked him.  I made your very point.  I see no proof at all that Reddit deleted him.  I see no proof of anyone taking offense at the thread he started.  </p>

<p>The fact remains, I am reporting that I followed that thread intently.  Only one single person (out of roughly 800) had a single kind thing to say of Israel.  And that person was showered in racial slurs and accusation by 161719 and the rest.  The fact that the author responded with extreme racial bigotry at the first sign of disagreement says much about him in my book.</p>

<p>Further, it was 161719 who began the thread saying that he was a non political tourist walking through the Mid-East, and that he discovered Israeli evil from a basis of non aligned innocence.  Then in the course of the disagreement he admits he is a political science professor living in Egypt, and a political activist involved in the flotilla incident.</p>

<p>No one accused him.  He said one thing, and then he flubbed it, and stated flat out that he was completely misrepresenting himself with a false history.  This is why I think he deleted his own file.  To cover up his rank deception.</p>

<p>As a supporter of Israel I would be very upset if this thread was deleted by Reddit.  Any honest and rational soul would see what Israel faces on a daily basis through this thread.  I regret that it was deleted, but I just think it was the author who deleted it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lot&#39;s of words and no fucking proof. I could accuse you of anything, of being some rotten Nazi on some other account. I could say anything at all. I don&#39;t trust your assessment because I don&#39;t know you and you keep responding to requests for proof with sanctimonious recriminations and vague anecdote. What did this twisted bigot say? Did he call them kikes and dogs and scum and insects deserving of the purge? I only ask because people, not you necessarily, but we&#39;ve established I don&#39;t know you well enough to make a personal judgment call, but other people do seem to take any suggestion that the people of Israel have internalized the abuses of abolished regimes to the point where they have, in their feverish quest to establish perfect security, ascended to the role of the oppressor and subjugated another people. That the zionist movement and the state of Israel have become the same sort of jack booted thugs who made the state of Israel a perceived necessity is pretty well documented outside the confines of unsourced, anonymous comments. I read that thread as well, and I didn&#39;t find what you describe, but nor did I read 800 posts. Hell, come to think of it, I didn&#39;t count how many posts I read. Where you being hyperbolic or facetious or are you working here, collecting valuable data about those with the gall to criticize Israel? The best you have is the accusation that the original and effecting post was nothing more than stagecraft being worked by someone with a political agenda. The antisemitism stuff is just the boy who&#39;s been crying wolf for the last 30 goddamn years. You&#39;re a nuclear state for fuck&#39;s sake. You are not the twerp being pushed around the playground by the bully anymore. You&#39;ve become the bullies and you cannot face any kind of criticism without pretending you&#39;re right back in the middle of the final solution. This is the real world, not some allegorical story from before the bronze age. This story has no hero, only two different villains locked in endless struggle over a wrong long forgotten, neither able to even acknowledge that they have, in fact, given as good and as terrible as they&#39;ve gotten. </p>

<p>Just to be clear, I agree with you about what is more likely in this case. I&#39;m curious about it is all, because I am not a supporter of Israel, or of any other nation-state for that matter. I support the universal rights of all peoples and I believe in ideas, not hierarchies or political constructs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you ask, I was referring to one gentleman who responded against the author of that thread.  He pointed out that there were no security arrangements, no wall, no check points, prior to the terrorism.  That is a simple and easily verifiable fact.  He pointed out that the current security arrangements came one step at a time in response to terrorist attacks.  </p>

<p>And yes, the author responded by calling him a &quot;Yid&quot;, and a &quot;Heb&quot;, and a &quot;Kike&quot;, as well as &quot;fuckwad&quot; and &quot;fuckass&quot; and so forth and so on.  He stated that Israel has no right to exist, and all the Jews should leave and &quot;go home&quot;.  I am not exactly sure where home would be, as 90% of the Jews in Israel were born there.  But such was his thinking.</p>

<p>When you say that anyone can get on and say anything, don&#39;t you see that was the very point I was making?  This thread was comprised of all the folks getting on and saying the author had been deprived of his rights, and that there was a terrible conspiracy to silence him.  I was responding to those unproven assertions.</p>

<p>It still seems to me that it is far more likely that he deleted himself, once he exposed that he was a hard core activist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s review, shall we?</p>

<p>First, <a href="/u/slohcinretrac">/u/slohcinretrac</a> said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracy theory here: What if he is deleting his own account to draw attention to the things he believes by feeding into r/conspiracy&#39;s disposition towards believing that there is a conspiracy going on.</p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which I thought was an interesting point, at least worth considering. <a href="/u/Ahbraham">/u/Ahbraham</a> doesn&#39;t agree. S/he posted that it was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Baseless and needless speculation, IMO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and while we can disagree on whether or not <a href="/u/slohcinretrac/">/u/slohcinretrac/</a>&#39;s theory was based in evidence, I don&#39;t think a compelling case can be made that it was needless. I think there is always a need for healthy skepticism, both of the things you&#39;d want to believe and the things you wouldn&#39;t, but especially when you&#39;re throwing around accusations of censorship and duplicity. I suppose it comes down to how you read <a href="/u/Debasers_Comics">/u/Debasers_Comics</a>\&#39;s comment. I read it with a tone of facetiousness, pregnant with a meaning I must confess I agree with, which is to say the suggestion that we must equally weigh the possibility that it was a staged sham meant to raise the heckles of this community rather than a case of an organized zionist conspiracy working through Reddit to censor a genuine story. </p>

<p>And, so, now having worked back from the beginning I have arrived again at you and me. Could you show me where he is arguing that conspiracy theorists are idiots? Because I read it through again to check and it still seems like you&#39;re being a closed minded cunt for no reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bang on.  He started that post pretending to be an innocent American wandering around the Mid-East as a tourist, and discovering that Israel is evil.  Come to find out he is a hard core political activist, who posts thousands of anti Israeli post a day.</p>

<p>I think he deleted it himself, because he slipped and gave away that he is the one who is trawling these posts.  Like he forever accuses those who disagree with him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he posted a thousand anti Israeli posts a day, that would be roughly one anti Israeli comment every 86.4 seconds even while he sleeps. This includes not only writing the comment, but reading what everyone else is writing to contextualize his stance. Assuming this is correct, he is either on one extreme very original and prolific and finds something unique to say each time or on the other extreme, he is just spamming the same exact sentiment each and every time. Let&#39;s say he falls in the middle and roughly half of his comments are a handful of the same anti Israeli comments repeated ad nauseam. Some of these should be memorable to anyone who cared to look at all 1000+ comments per day and yet none of them can be more than alluded to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I followed that thread closely.  It&#39;s author was totally deceitful.  He presented himself as a naive tourist who went walking about the Mid-East, and to his surprise, discovered that Israel is incarnate evil.  Over the course of the intense discussion he accidentally revealed that he is a professor of political science, an anti Israeli activist, and involved in the flotilla operation of anti Israeli interests in Europe.  He was not an innocent tourist but a hard core political activist posing a babe in the woods.  His opinions and analysis were a deception from first to last.</p>

<p>He was also abusive, rude, and indulged racist epithets and insults against anyone who disagreed with him.  If you disproved a point he was making with fact, he accused you of being an Israeli intelligence officer, and would not address the facts that overturned his views.</p>

<p>I&#39;m rather new to Reddit, and don&#39;t know the set up, but when you start calling those who disagree with you racial slurs, isn&#39;t that grounds for being shadow banned?</p>

<p>Also, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he deleted his own thread, because his views were completely smashed by contributors, and he had exposed himself as a deceiver...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh for Pete&#39;s Sake...</p>

<p>There is no &quot;downfall&quot; of Reddit.  The only sub I see that is off the rails is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  You guys see an action, and then immediately have to connect it with a a bunch of other things, moving the dots to make it seem like your conspiracy is the &quot;truth.&quot;  Then when called out, you call people sheep and downvote them.</p>

<p>Everyone who&#39;s account is gone MUST be deleted by the admins.  And if there&#39;s even proof the owner deleted it themselves, then the admins forged it.  I even saw someone in here suggest it&#39;s somehow Obama&#39;s fault.</p>

<p>Sometimes, things just HAPPEN.  I agree there are conspiracies out there, but not EVERYTHING is a conspiracy.  Reddit is a site.  There are rules.  It is more likely a user broke a rule and got banned, or just deleted their own account, than some nefarious taking down of users because the government is telling them to.</p>

<p>Also, this concept of &quot;they are infringing on my free speech&quot; isn&#39;t true either.  Unless you own Reddit, this is not &quot;your&quot; site.  Same thing on sites like Facebook where people cry that &quot;their&quot; page was deleted or blocked.  You don&#39;t own the content you post on here.  The person who owns the website does.  It&#39;s YOU as the poster or subscriber to determine if you want your words, thoughts, and media used by that web site owner.  If you are deemed as not wanted by the owner or admins, it&#39;s the same as if someone came into your house, and you kicked them out because they were saying something you didn&#39;t like.  They don&#39;t &quot;own&quot; your house.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re entitled to your opinion.  If enough people don&#39;t like the way things are going here, and go to another site or create their own, then it&#39;s up to Reddit&#39;s owners and admins to determine if they want to continue with what they are doing and bleed users, or if they want to go back to how the site was prior that attracted people to it.</p>

<p>I like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  There IS some good stuff here to read.  But you guys take it to the extreme some times.</p>

High rated comment that could potentially be seen by millions of people that isn&#39;t proven factual by any means? I&#39;m not saying the guys experience isn&#39;t true, I&#39;m just saying it is a pretty compelling story that could be taken out of proportion by the media very easily. Remember the Boston bomber incident? 
It&#39;s a great story and deserves to be heard, but maybe on a different medium. Sparking political controversy when reddit already gets mentioned quite a bit in mainstream media outlets doesn&#39;t seem like a road this site needs to go on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A Palestinian is someone who is descended from the people who have lived in the area at the Eastern end of The Mediterranean Sea for a very long time.  No, it isn&#39;t a religion.  It would be fair to call &#39;Palestinian&#39; a culture, as you would call &#39;Kurd&#39;, &#39;American Indian&#39;, or &#39;Mayan&#39; cultures as well.  What they all have in common is that they are people who do not have their own &#39;country&#39; and are either stateless or are a distinct cultural group within one or another states.  </p>

<p>The Palestinians in the West Bank are virtual prisoners where they live, and are not protected by any nation, but instead are exploited by various nations, notably Israel in this case because the Israeli military seized this land from Jordan and withholds the benefits and rights of citizenship from the people there.  This isn&#39;t normally what a state should do, and it&#39;s grotesquely unfair to the Palestinians who live there.</p>

<p>American Indians, Kurds and Mayans have all also long been victims in a similar fashion, even continuing today.  It&#39;s not fun being someone whose ancestors have lived on a land for a very long time, whose land is then &#39;taken over&#39; by people from another state, who are then not given the same equal rights of citizenship that the people from the invading state are given.  It is our responsibility to speak for them to attempt to help them achieve rights so they are no longer exploited by the states and the people of those states who have taken their lands, their heritage and their livelihoods.</p>

<p>When I mentioned &#39;American Indian&#39; I grouped together hundreds of native cultural groups across the entire Western Hemisphere, which included Eskimo, Hawaiian, Mayan, Sioux, Algonquin, Inca and so many more.  So many cultures, and not a nation among them.  So many people without rights which were given to people from the &#39;Invading&#39; English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, et alia.  The same could be said of Africa and Indonesia, too, of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first cocksuckers who colonized them were fucking Calvinists. The worst of the worst. They banned <em>dancing</em>, for fucks&#39; sake. And the amount of cultural heritage that was destroyed in the name of &quot;civilizing&quot; and/or christianizing them is truly goddamn staggering.</p>

<p>And we&#39;re talking about what is likely one of the most egalitarian, peaceful societies in the history of the human race. Population control by lack of space instead of lack of food or by warfare. No real class divisions; just a chief(or queen) and his enforcer. No real standard of living differences. No hunger, minimal disease, clement weather, idyllic location. </p>

<p>Paradise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So where do we go now? I don&#39;t like this shit anymore. Sure, this sub is relatively transparent, but I don&#39;t fucking care about that. I don&#39;t want reddit to think it can do this and not lose users. This fucking pisses me off. They are basically begging for money with the &quot;buy our gold&quot; campaign and now they are increasing censorship. I wonder if they&#39;re using that increase in gold purchasing to hire the manpower for this increased censorship. I sometimes browse /pol, but a) it can be too racially motivated and b) the interface is not as streamlined as it is here. So what now? And like I mentioned yesterday, sure we can go to GLP, ATS, etc but here our ideas and posts can reach members outside the sub, and reach new users like yesterday with /bestof. It&#39;s a shame, it&#39;s a great sub here, one of the better ones IMO and we also share it with non-conspirwcy theorists... Ideas spread far and fast here</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s review, shall we?</p>

<p>First, <a href="/u/slohcinretrac">/u/slohcinretrac</a> said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracy theory here: What if he is deleting his own account to draw attention to the things he believes by feeding into r/conspiracy&#39;s disposition towards believing that there is a conspiracy going on.</p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which I thought was an interesting point, at least worth considering. <a href="/u/Ahbraham">/u/Ahbraham</a> doesn&#39;t agree. S/he posted that it was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Baseless and needless speculation, IMO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and while we can disagree on whether or not <a href="/u/slohcinretrac/">/u/slohcinretrac/</a>&#39;s theory was based in evidence, I don&#39;t think a compelling case can be made that it was needless. I think there is always a need for healthy skepticism, both of the things you&#39;d want to believe and the things you wouldn&#39;t, but especially when you&#39;re throwing around accusations of censorship and duplicity. I suppose it comes down to how you read <a href="/u/Debasers_Comics">/u/Debasers_Comics</a>\&#39;s comment. I read it with a tone of facetiousness, pregnant with a meaning I must confess I agree with, which is to say the suggestion that we must equally weigh the possibility that it was a staged sham meant to raise the heckles of this community rather than a case of an organized zionist conspiracy working through Reddit to censor a genuine story. </p>

<p>And, so, now having worked back from the beginning I have arrived again at you and me. Could you show me where he is arguing that conspiracy theorists are idiots? Because I read it through again to check and it still seems like you&#39;re being a closed minded cunt for no reason. </p>
