        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From a comment on facebook regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">Operation Northwoods</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems that I was not clear about my initial point. I&#39;m not using Operation Northwoods as &quot;evidence that the attacks of September 11th were an &#39;inside job&#39;&quot;, as your first article states--I&#39;m not even a &quot;truther&quot;. I am using Operation Northwoods as a reason why people should revisit the events of 9/11 and call for an independent investigation. </p>

<p>When you take 9/11 and Operation Northwoods in combination with PNAC (The Project for a New American Century), an independent investigation is a no-brainer. </p>

<p>PNAC was a think tank from which Cheney, Jeb Bush, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld and company pushed the idea of military hegemony over the Middle East and American dominance of the globe. They thought the process of American domination would take too long---and I quote their own documents here--without &quot;some catastrophic and catalyzing event––like a new Pearl Harbor.&quot; And then came a catastrophic and catalyzing event called 9/11. Gee, what a coincidence.</p>

<p>So you basically had an administration full of people who wanted to dominate the Middle East (i.e. PNAC). </p>

<p>Those people thought they could do that faster if they had a catastrophic attack on the U.S (i.e. 9/11). </p>

<p>And they belonged to a government with a documented history of being willing to bomb its own people (i.e. Operation Northwoods), so that it could fight its desired wars. </p>

<p>That spells MEANS, MOTIVE and OPPORTUNITY. If it was a criminal investigation, the only other thing that would be required to convict them would be evidence. But guess what? We never looked for that evidence because we just assumed that the government would NEVER do anything like that to us--HOW STUPID ARE WE? They were willing to do it in 1960!--The PNAC members should have had all their homes and offices raided and every document and computer seized for evidence. It&#39;s called the law, and everyone is supposed to be subject to it!</p>

<p>Now if you don&#39;t think that that type of situation requires an independent investigation into all of those people, we not ever going to agree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My only question is, if these guys really are orchestrating all of these things then why write books about it before hand? </p>

<p>EDIT: Just have to clarify, since this seems to be getting a lot of replys. I believe fully in the things you guys do, I just like to ask questions about everything. Is it really that weird to question why someone would publish a book about an enormous crime they are about to commit? Is this really the kind of comment you guys want to downvote in a subreddit that&#39;s supposed to be about questioning things?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do they have 3 months of reading about weather modification warfare that proves how they do it all?</p>

<p>Because they know that every dumb ass mother fucking sheep in this country will say &quot;no that&#39;s not true the government can&#39;t do that&quot;.</p>

<p>They say that even after you SHOW THEM THE PAPERS that prove it, show them that the info all comes from .gov and .edu that can&#39;t be tampered with, read the names of the people writing the papers and verify they&#39;re really who they say they are and blah blah.</p>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t work, they deny reality, &quot;WHY WOULD THE GOVERNMENT KILL PEOPLE? I DON&#39;T BELIEVE YOU NAH NAH NAH LALALALALA!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s fucking insane.</p>

<p>They put down their agenda in writing because they know they can play the &quot;conspiracy&quot; card and the sheep will go &quot;baaaaahhh I&#39;m not going to read that conspiracy shit&quot; even though it&#39;s a scientifically provable paper.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Israeli newspaper Ma&#39;ariv on Wednesday reported that Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu told an audience at Bar Ilan university that the September 11, 2001 terror attacks had been beneficial for Israel.</p>

<p>&quot;We are benefiting from one thing, and that is the attack on the Twin Towers and Pentagon, and the American struggle in Iraq,&quot; Ma&#39;ariv quoted the former prime minister as saying. He reportedly added that these events &quot;swung American public opinion in our favor.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, we get the government they&#39;ve convinced us is the only one we can have. </p>

<p>The main stream media walks a line down the middle on nearly everything truly important and that is by design.  It keeps the public thinking that although one might (correctly) see an issue one way, that there is roughly half the population that thinks the other way. They shrug their shoulders, say &#39;such is democracy&#39; and sit back down on the couch.   <em>For a plutocracy disguised as a democracy, that is incredibly convenient when you want to get things done with out a lot of public uproar</em>  Think about it, for a such a highly homogenized culture as the USA where the 1% reigns supreme, would you really expect opinion from everyone else to be so evenly split? All the time?</p>

<p>In order to keep up the appearance of keeping it honest, the polls must vaguely support the intended agenda.  The &quot;mouth breathers&quot;, unfortunately, are a statistically large (significant stat wise) but quite malleable group ready to regurgitate what they&#39;ve been rehearsed to believe. Easily swayed by pounded sound bites framed for consumption by this lowest common denominator, they lend credence to a talking head that says &quot;opinion is split on this 51/49&quot;.  &quot;Majority wins&quot;. Everyone walks away thinking democracy has been served. </p>

<p>Our media has been looking increasingly unsophisticated because it is speaking to its intended audience more - The Lowest Common Denominator. They are the most easily manipulated.  </p>

<p>And they belonged to a government with a documented history of being willing to bomb its own people (i.e. Operation Northwoods), so that it could fight its desired wars. </p>

<p>I really hate this rhetoric. What we actually have is a documented history of NOT being willing to bomb its own people for that purpose. Operation Northwoods was rejected.</p>

<p>You can say we came close and it&#39;s a red flag, that&#39;s fine. But to say we have documented history that they are actually willing is factually inaccurate.</p>

<p>If you want to point out that it came close to happening, and argue that with a new administration that was more prone to agree it would be likely to actually happen, I can accept that. However whenever I see someone point at it and act as though it was carried out, ignoring that it was in fact rejected, I can no longer trust what they&#39;re saying. They are no longer arguing from facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>EDIT: By that quote, I mean &quot;They thought the process of American domination would take too long---and I quote their own documents here--without &#39;some catastrophic and catalyzing event––like a new Pearl Harbor.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>That person took that quote out of context, not even keeping the whole sentence.The actual context of the quote is a chapter about transforming the military to take advantage of the high-tech &quot;revolution in military affairs&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/pdf/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf#page=62"><em>Rebuilding America’s Defenses: Strategy, Forces and Resources For a New Century</em></a>(PDF), pages 50–51.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To preserve American military preeminence in the coming decades, the Department of Defense must move more aggressively to experiment with new technologies and operational concepts, and seek to exploit the emerging revolution in military affairs. Information technologies, in particular, are becoming more prevalent and significant components of modern military systems. These information technologies are having the same kind of transforming effects on military affairs as they are having in the larger world. The effects of this military transformation will have profound implications for how wars are fought, what kinds of weapons will dominate the battlefield and, inevitably, which nations enjoy military preeminence.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Any serious effort at transformation must occur within the larger framework of U.S. national security strategy, military missions and defense budgets. The United States cannot simply declare a “strategic pause” while experimenting with new technologies and operational concepts. Nor can it choose to pursue a transformation strategy that would decouple American and allied interests.  A transformation strategy that solely pursued capabilities for projecting force from the United States, for example, and sacrificed forward basing and presence, would be at odds with larger American policy goals and would trouble American allies.</p>

<p>Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor. Domestic politics and industrial policy will shape the pace and content of transformation as much as the requirements of current missions. A decision to suspend or terminate aircraft carrier production, as recommended by this report and as justified by the clear direction of military technology, will cause great upheaval. Likewise, systems entering production today – the F-22 fighter, for example – will be in service inventories for decades to come. Wise management of this process will consist in large measure of figuring out the right moments to halt production of current-paradigm weapons and shift to radically new designs. The expense associated with some programs can make them roadblocks to the larger process of transformation – the Joint Strike Fighter program, at a total of approximately $200 billion, seems an unwise investment. Thus, this report advocates a two-stage process of change – transition and transformation – over the coming decades.</p>

<p>In general, to maintain American military preeminence that is consistent with the requirements of a strategy of American global leadership, tomorrow’s U.S. armed forces must meet three new missions:</p>

<p>• Global missile defenses. A network against limited strikes, capable of protecting the United States, its allies and forward-deployed forces, must be constructed. This must be a layered system of land, sea, air and spacebased components.</p>

<p>• Control of space and cyberspace.  Much as control of the high seas – and the protection of international commerce – defined global powers in the past, so will control of the new “international commons” be a key to world power in the future. An America incapable of protecting its interests or that of its allies in space or the “infosphere” will find it difficult to exert global political leadership.</p>

<p>• Pursuing a two-stage strategy for of transforming conventional forces. In exploiting the “revolution in military affairs,” the Pentagon must be driven by the enduring missions for U.S.  forces. This process will have two stages: transition, featuring a mix of current and new systems; and true transformation, featuring new systems, organizations and operational concepts. This process must take a competitive approach, with services and joint-service operations competing for new roles and missions. Any successful process of transformation must be linked to the services, which are the institutions within the Defense Department with the ability and the responsibility for linking budgets and resources to specific missions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They want to stop building aircraft carriers and concentrate on high-tech research and development, missile defense, space and cyber-space. If you keep reading the chapter, they want to build up the American naval presence in east Asia--that is, China and Korea. The Mid-east is mentioned as one of many trouble spots in the world.</p>

<p>What does 9/11 have to do with any of that?</p>
