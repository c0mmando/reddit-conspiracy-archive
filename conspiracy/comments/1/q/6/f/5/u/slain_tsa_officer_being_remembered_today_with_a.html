       If you didn't already know, a man named Paul CIAnCIA killed a TSA "officer" a week ago today. This happened at LAX. Today, the TSA will be gumming up the works with a ceremony to honor the first "officer" to be killed "in the line of duty." I find this infuriating, but let me explain why.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand completely that what happened was and is a tragedy. No matter how we feel about the TSA or other government programs, no one needs to be murdered over it. What I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       have a problem with is this notion they're instilling that TSA agents are legitimate officers who perform a "service to our nation" as a local news station described it and when killed are described as being killed "in the line of duty" as though they are police or soldiers. Now with this tragedy they're talking about
       <strong>
        arming
       </strong>
       these people and giving them license to fire weapons, because militarization of our airports is exactly what we need.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in a nutshell: I hate this. I hate this air they're trying to give these workers as though their job is so beneficial to society. By all means, pay respects to the man who was killed, but not like this. We might as well have a public ceremony and moment of silence for fallen fast food workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope I haven't come off as a bad person.

       No.  If you are like many here you believe that there is no reason that guy should have been in the line of fire to begin with.  I feel for anyone that dies and their families that have to carry on without them.  I will not put them on a pedestal without a much stronger reason.

       Think about it from the dead guy's POV.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's just a man. He's doing his job. His job, as he sees it, is to ensure that nobody getting onto an airplane in the USA can hijack it, hurt anyone, or kill anyone on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In his mind, he's clearly performing a public service. In many minds, he is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some jackhole then saunters into the airport, guns blazing, and takes this guy out. The reason for the jackhole's actions are irrelevant to the dead guy. He was just doing his job - adding whatever layer of safety and security he can add to air travel.
      </p>
      <p>
       He can have his moment of silence.

       Do we offer moments of silence for the men, women, and children killed in daily drone strikes?  How about the men, women, and children killed at Ruby Ridge or Waco?
      </p>
      <p>
       People die every single day under thousands of different circumstances.  You're right when you say this guy was just doing his job, but he's just a regular man doing his job.  That's it.  There's nothing special about the fact that he was a TSA agent, and he should receive no special treatment or consideration to the thousands of other men, women, and children who die every day doing their various activities.

       Correct me if I misread how this is happening, but it's the TSA - the organization he worked for - that is conducting the moment of silence, right?

       It's not national. It's not happening in schools. You're not being forced to bow your head and think about the dead guy for a minute. Neither am I.

      <p>
       It's just the company he worked for that is doing it, right?

      <p>
       We've been very unfortunate in my workplace - an organization with about 35 people - in that we've lost way too many to illness in the past few years. When that has happened, we as an organization did something to remember them, too.

       No, they're stopping the activities of hundreds of airports to do this moment of silence, or rather that they are imposing this moment of silence on millions of people.

       So for 2 minutes they're stopping working, during which the lines won't move?

       It's not "imposing" the moment of silence on anyone. They're not going to tell the people in the security lines that they need to bow their heads, right?

       You're missing the entire point of the post.  He's just just a regular guy who lost his regular life like will happen to everyone else.  The implications of the event that took place show clear evidence of an agenda to give TSA agents more authority and arm them - agents who shouldn't be there in the first place, agents who were put in place after a domestic plan to increase security and limit freedoms of individuals based on fear.  He is one death in an order of hundreds of thousands of deaths a day: police officers, military, civilians.  They are playing up this event as hard as they can to drum up sympathy and support for an agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they really wanted to honor the man, they would have a candlelight vigil at night away from the airports - even if televised.  It would not be first thing in the morning at one of the busiest travel times on one of the busiest travel days of the week.  And yes, they ask passengers to bow their heads and honor the silence that they are imposing, and I guarantee you that those who are observed not respecting this moment of silence will be treated like trash by the TSA agents they must go through to get to their destination.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just an inconvenience, it's a show.

       There may be such a conspiracy (agenda). There may not. The only thing we can know for sure is this guy was just doing his job when someone shot him. We can pretty accurately assume that even if there was an agenda/conspiracy, he probably did not volunteer to be shot to death or to participate in any way.

       How many terrorist plots or tragedies have you heard of being stopped by the TSA?  How about the shoe/underwear bombers?  Were the agents who let these individuals through fired?  Do you honestly feel that if someone truly wanted to hijack an airplane, a minor search by the TSA would stop them?  Do you really need any oversight to what people carry on airplanes?  The only goal and only result of the TSA is to restrict and control the general population in their travel, to impose security and fear.

No, a man who loses his life in a conspiracy is very likely to not be in on the plot - but does that mean he deserves any special mention?  No.  The media pushes an agenda, and this event does nothing more than bolster this agenda and plant the idea that TSA officers have any sort of real importance or authority in the minds of the public.

       Then maybe, instead of violating the privacy/rights/body of individuals simply wishing to travel, they should have trained individuals/guards to tag along on flights - less manpower and less expense than a full screening security force.  Oh wait, they already had something like that called federal air marshals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you're correct on this:

       </a>

      <p>
       There have been quite a few hijackings.  However, I fail to see how any of these justify the TSA or how the majority of them could have been stopped by the TSA.

       Man gets onto plane unscreened. He's carrying a bomb. 35 minutes into the flight he reaches into his pocket and flips the detonator switch.

       What does the air marshall do? Answer: dies with the rest of the passengers.

       I've tried to post several times in response to this and the conversation in general but it seems to be blocking me from doing so. Here goes again...

       I think the matter should be left up to private security forces. I don't see why we need to keep pouring billions of our own tax dollars into this mess when the market could very well handle.

      <p>
       I would be interested to know your defense for the inconsistency of the TSA's efforts, another common complaint. If the purpose of the agency is to protect travelers, why aren't they patrolling bus stops and train stations? Is it perhaps because doing so would be silly, just as doing so at airports is mostly silly?

       I'm not opposed to that. As long as someone competent is screening for weapons, bombs, whatever persons of ill intent might try to bring onto a plane. I don't much care who it is, as long as it is done effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the tax-funding, one way or the other, the cost will be paid by "everyman". If not through taxes then through increased prices for air travel. But whatever.

       From what I have seen, the TSA's efforts have been consistent - as far as I am aware there have been no incidents of violence in the air in any plane for which the TSA has screened all passengers. That's pretty consistent, isn't it?

       Or, you know, just fucking deal with it like everyone else has to.  Mass tragedies/tragedies in general happen every day.  They happen everywhere.  As is already shown every day in the media, having security measures such as the TSA in place doesn't solve a damn thing.  I bet you also advocate NSA spying, which was so effective in stopping the Boston Bombing, the Aurora theater shooting, the mall shootings that they admit they had prior knowledge of, or Sandy Hook elementary shooting.  People need to take care of and defend themselves.  We need to start by educating the world, rather than painting individuals as crazy or terrorist for lashing back against a government or population that has betrayed and condemned them.  Having a finger up your ass or getting arrested for trying to take a soda on an airplane certainly isn't the answer.

       How often do you hear about people wanting to blow up planes or read a manifesto about blowing up planes?  All of the "crazy" I've seen has been in direct retaliation for the way the individual has been treated.

       Well, there was that villain called "Shoeman" or something that they missed, which gave them the power to demand you take off your shoes and look like an idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, I think they missed the other supervillain known as "Underwearman" or whatever, which gave them the power to grab your pee-pee while  you look like an idiot.

       What villain are they going to miss next and what sorts of new powers will they receive to make you look like an even bigger idiot?

       Based on that incredibly detailed comment, I did 3 minutes of research.
      </p>
      <p>
       The underwear bomber boarded in Amsterdam. He was not screened by the TSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shoe bomber boarded in Paris. He was not screened by the TSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the TSA failed in those cases because... they were absent from the Amsterdam and Paris airports?

       Right, I remember one time I saw a TSA agent beat a child to death with a baton, right after executing his entire family in front of him. And of course this was at one of those TSA death camps they have all over the country, where hundreds of thousands of people are beaten, tortured, and executed on a regular basis. Although my eyesight is shit, he may have actually just asked someone to remove their shoes while they walked through a scanner. And it may have been at an airport, not a death camp.

       yeah they just come to your house in the middle of the night, shot your dog, beat you and arrest you.  all because you have the nerve to point out that they're executing the warrant at the wrong address.

       when we start seeing police officers and persons of authority actually being punished for wrong doing, then maybe you might have a point.  but the reality power protects itself and if you really think that the people who run america now are a better kind of person or a more enlightened person than who the nazis were, i guess we'll just have to disagree on the goodness of mankind.

       Pretty sure the guy from NM who got violated for rolling a stop sign is going to get a pretty penny. Hopefully the cops will be fired. The resolution for judge who issued the warrant(s) might be interesting...

      <p>
       Punishment often follows wrongdoing not by minutes, but by days, weeks, or months. Are you saying that cops are doing that shit from 2 posts ago and
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       facing consequences?  Or do you just assume they're not facing any consequences because they're not publicized when they happen so you don't see them?

       and his boss said everything was done to letter of the law and his officers did nothing wrong, and it's not the first time they did it. Timothy Young was stopped on Oct. 13, 2012 and guess what?
      </p>

       you can say that punishment is slow coming or whatever but i remember someone once saying something about justice delayed being justice denied.
      </p>
      <p>
       the reality of the situation is that police officers are, for the most part, above the law.  the only time they're ever held accountable for bad behavior is when the behavior has been brought to light through viral video and the public outrage to too great and politicians start worrying about reelections.

       Possible, but that would seem to be the minority of them. Can you link to any story that contains an interview with any person who actually encountered the guy that supports that claim?

       No, you aren't.  It was their choice to do their jackbooted job.  No one likes them.  No one feels safer.  Completely irrelevant loss of life.

       No, you're not a bad person. If you said 'he deserved it' or some shit you'd be a bad a person, but you seem to understand what's up. The dude was probably a great guy, just doing his job and getting by like the rest of us. He had no power, he was a just a shill, a cog in the machine like so many of us in one way or the other. TSA is bullshit and we do not need to celebrate the organization or what it stands for. Nothing wrong with celebrating the poor fellow's life though.

        having security measures such as the TSA in place doesn't solve a damn thing.

       Incorrect. How many incidents of airline violence have occurred since the TSA was put into place?

      <p>
       The fact that none has occurred means they're doing their job.

       That's a leap. I advocate for making damn sure people can't carry weapons onto planes and that means I advocate for NSA spying?

       The problem with that line of thought is that some individuals
       <strong>
        are
       </strong>
       crazy and
       <strong>
        do

       want to blow up planes. So we should just let them? No. Not even a little.

       Some of us have the capacity to recognize the difference between reasonable protections (that is, searching for weapons and explosives) and abuse of power and accept one but rail against the other.
