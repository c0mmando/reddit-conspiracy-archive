        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;Regarding possible conspiracies, to this day I have serious doubts that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. I certainly have doubts that he was motivated to do that by himself. I’m not sure if anybody else was involved. I don’t go down that road, with respect to the grassy knoll theory and all of that, but I have serious questions about whether they got to the bottom of Lee Harvey Oswald. I think he was inspired somewhere by something, but I can’t pin anything down on that. I’ve never spent a lot of time on it. But I think, after a certain period of time, and that period of time may well have passed, <strong>it is totally appropriate for a country like the United States to open up the files</strong> on whatever history can be shed light on. I think that is appropriate. It has to be done in the right way, by the right entities or people, but certainly by a valid historian or for some valid analysis; I think that everybody would benefit.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>UN Arms Treaty is a good idea to combat the arms trade. Syria Government should be obliterated. I understand your logic but these are serious issues globally and the UN should do something about them. The only reason nothing happened is because they&#39;re Russian trade partners and then the people got scared and duped into thinking they would take Americans guns away when the treaty had nothing to do with American gun ownership. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no substance in your post. It is generalizations that prove you are brainwashed. I actually read the text in the UN Arms Trade treaty. I know what&#39;s going on in Syria and how the only reason they aren&#39;t obliterated already is because it&#39;s of special interest to Russians. You can not refute any of that. You may think you have proved me wrong or something but you haven&#39;t said anything and only proved that YOU are brainwashed. I am obviously more educated on this than you are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What right do we have to combat arms trade when we are giving guns to Cartel drug lords in mexico and farming Heroin in the Afgan poppy fields. Hell we even legitimize and train warlords in Kenya so they can hunt terrorists (other warlords).</p>

<p>I think you are mistaking the people and countries in those NATO seats for someone who cares about you. Whether its a gun confiscation or not, the only people this bill helps is the Military industrial complex, seeing how arms trade is their business and we wouldn&#39;t want anyone else cutting in on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the UN, not us. Doing nothing is not a solution. If there is international law that does something about it then it makes it more difficult to supply arms. The Arms Trade treaty only focused on territories and nations that were under civil war or terrorist states. It was the right thing to do. Besides the cartel drug lords in Mexico are being hunted down. Sure they still exist but drone strike after drone strike they are being eliminated and as more intelligence is gathered we arrest their kingpins. If you&#39;ve paid any attention to the ongoing situations in the world you&#39;d see this. </p>

<p>We have a program that pays and protects farmers in Afghanistan to not grow poppy fields. Farmers in Afghanistan are forced to grow poppy fields and get paid poorly for it by local militias and the Iranians. We pay them and protect them to not grow and contribute to the drug trade and instead grow food. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing to do with this article, but I really like how Dan Carlin from Hardcore history paints the idea that the JFK assassination could of been a cover up to prevent WW3. </p>

<p>Say Lee Harvey Oswald really did do it. He had communist ties. What if Russia sponsored the hit using LHO. </p>

<p>Just like how WW1 started when the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife were killed(in a similar way to how JFK was killed btw), maybe by saying LHO acted alone, it prevented America and the allies from going hog wild on the Soviet Union who was Nuclear equipped. </p>

<p>Thats a fascinating idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kerry said in a recent interview he thought Oswald&#39;s communist leanings and his time in Moscow should have been given more scrutiny, thereby neatly sidestepping any idea that the plot originated closer to home.  If there had been any inkling the Russians were behind it would have been WW3.  I seem to remember reading somewhere that the KGB carried out their own investigation into assassination and came to the conclusion that LBJ was at the middle of it.
