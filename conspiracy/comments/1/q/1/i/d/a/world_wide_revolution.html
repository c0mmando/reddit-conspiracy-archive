       There is a world wide revolution unfolding. Something mankind has never experienced. Its safe to say the globalist agenda is no longer a conspiracy "theory". History is being written, how will the future turn out.

       Whoa, whoa there. People marching in protest is
       <em>
        significantly
       </em>
       different than a revolution. I understand, you are just as frustrated as the rest of us but now is not the time to adjust your tin foil hat. It was a march of protest, nothing more.

       The right to revolution is exercised by the people when their government no longer acts in their interests. The people are the government as it is explained in the U.S.A. Declaration of Independence. The Declaration of Independence only explains what is going on; a piece of paper does not make things so. The Declaration of Independence as well as the Bill of Rights also applies to everyone in the world since these pieces of paper only document and explain what is already in existence for everyone. With that being said, understand that your rights aren't given to you by a piece of paper; they're yours because you had them when you were born. Depending on if you're spiritual or not, either your rights were inherited or your rights were given to you by spiritual beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other rights you've inherited as well; IE the right to revolution mentioned above. This is why there is a revolution unfolding. It's going to happen sooner or later unless behaviors change quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       These changes are going to come at a cost because those hidden people who are truly in power are going to realize that their power is waning. Those mentioned people are, for lack of a tasteful phrase, living in a childish alternate reality drunk on power, and are going to behave destructively when they figure out the situation with their false power. Therefore it's very important to revolt in ways that embrace peace, life, community, togetherness, education, civility, happiness, and love before we move on from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd think that it would be better to be aggressive and pop a cap in that fat golden ass, but that's what those who are truly in power want and are prepared for. Unfortunately there may be a time for that, but if it happened right now, it could hurt many people. Please let us share a nerdy internet moment with each other and agree that love is the most powerful magic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first steps to a revolution by taking power back to the local communities are to stop depending on people really far away for your survival. Use any piece of land that you can to grow food, set up organic bee keepers, start locally in your neighborhood and appoint leaders, use forms of communication that do not depend on infrastructure (word of mouth, paper, etc.), use cheap and natural ways to have clean water and medications. I could go on for hours ad dry heaving about this, but I’m sure we’re getting the picture. The main point is to be self-sustaining and then move on to being able to defend yourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       This grassroots movement has to start like this, and then those leaders can get together and form a larger community. The next steps can be discussed later, and then we can move to a real, history book inspirational story worthy revolution. It starts with you, being a giver. Give to give only with your high level magic of love. I’ll take off my hippie head band now and let the LSD wear off. &lt;3

       I don't want to be this guy, and this is a genuine question; How long do you think that if we start to become more and more self sufficient, in larger and larger numbers, before the powers that be steps in to stomp that out? I doubt that they were just let us effectively cut out some of our incomes (their incomes), at least loosing our shackles. My guess is once that this starts catching on that laws will pass saying that we could be growing toxic plants, building illegal greenhouse, or some other BS like that. I'm not saying that it isn't a great idea, in fact I try to only buy locally and not give my slave money to big business, just saying that they always have their interests in mind and will never stop to protect those interests.

       I agree that it's a genuine question, and it's totally okay to be that guy for the sake of discussion. Thanks!
      </p>
      <p>
       My answer for this is unfortunately not a black and white one. It really depends on how obvious we do this. The more 'because fuck you' we are about it, the faster there will be retaliation. It should be a social thing with a good basis. If we’re doing anything based on something negative we’re probably going to attract more negativity. Instead of becoming self-sufficient because fuck them; we could be self-sufficient to help educate our younger generations, stimulate local economies, sustainability, health reasons, social reasons, fun reasons, etc. I also think it’s very important to not be very loud about it as well. The attitude is my biggest concern, and I’d actually like to play the whole mind game of: those who are actually controlling our federal government don’t exist in my reality. Ignore the media, and ignore the whole machine. No comment, get off my property, no loitering, and thanks for visiting.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of non-attitude things, the speed at which we all change and act may have an impact. If there’s a large amount of change very quickly, it would be hard for the bad guys to catch up. However, if we go just fast enough to be noticed it could also be problematic. We’re in double edged sword land in a way. Too slow is bad. Keeping it on the down low is the highest priority.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also other factors as well, and I’m trying my best to keep this short as possible. We also need to have the attitude of not wanting to be completely cut – off. We need to salvage what has belonged to us in the first place, and this is where local first philosophy comes into play. Using their own medicine against them, as well as gaining control of local governments comes at a high priority. Use legal means to have local governments act in the interests of their people immediately or fire them. There’s several examples of sheriffs stating they’d arrest federal employees if they do anything unconstitutional in their jurisdiction, and that’s a good example of what we need everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       So with the combination of having local governments on the side of its people instead of kowtowing to the federal government, people being quiet about it, having a positive attitude, not engaging in commenting or helping make a story, and also the give to give attitude will tip the scales. I hope for the best, and if this happens sooner than later, maybe we won’t even need to have a violent revolution that comes at a giant cost. I still think there will be a cost for all of this, but I strongly believe this is the best way to avoid violence while keeping our power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other things we can do is vote third party. People like to say negative things about that, and if you convince them they usually ask which one. It doesn't matter just as long as it isn't R or D.
      </p>
      <p>
       :0) I also think we should build a rocket, fly to the moon, and steal their alien artifacts. Someone needs to hack their drones and have them do aerobatics above rush hour traffic. We should also make bad ass tinfoil hats as well. :0)

       CA reporting in.  Roseville was under Martial Law in the last weekend of October.  thousands of people ran from the city.  Im a 45 min drive away and I'm scared.  People are starting to gather and figure out what the hell is going on.  I'm just a student however I'm now in my community talking to everyone, before I was just playing my videogames minding my own business until my roommates rushed in my room to inform me that black hawks are being sent from a AFB that is 20 mins away to Roseville.

       There was a manhunt going on there, however I do not think it was Martial Law. They locked down schools and looked in cars for the suspect, but that is far from martial law.

       The new term for martial law is "shelter in place". They unveiled that little wordplay after the Boston Marathon bombings. What they executed was martial law, what they called it was "shelter in place". Now whenever there is an "active shooter" there follows a "shelter in place" order. I cringe every time.

       I agree that it's a genuine question, and it's totally okay to be that guy for the sake of discussion. Thanks!

       My answer for this is unfortunately not a black and white one. It really depends on how obvious we do this. The more 'because fuck you' we are about it, the faster there will be retaliation. It should be a social thing with a good basis. If we’re doing anything based on something negative we’re probably going to attract more negativity. Instead of becoming self-sufficient because fuck them; we could be self-sufficient to help educate our younger generations, stimulate local economies, sustainability, health reasons, social reasons, fun reasons, etc. I also think it’s very important to not be very loud about it as well. The attitude is my biggest concern, and I’d actually like to play the whole mind game of: those who are actually controlling our federal government don’t exist in my reality. Ignore the media, and ignore the whole machine. No comment, get off my property, no loitering, and thanks for visiting.
      </p>

       In terms of non-attitude things, the speed at which we all change and act may have an impact. If there’s a large amount of change very quickly, it would be hard for the bad guys to catch up. However, if we go just fast enough to be noticed it could also be problematic. We’re in double edged sword land in a way. Too slow is bad. Keeping it on the down low is the highest priority.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also other factors as well, and I’m trying my best to keep this short as possible. We also need to have the attitude of not wanting to be completely cut – off. We need to salvage what has belonged to us in the first place, and this is where local first philosophy comes into play. Using their own medicine against them, as well as gaining control of local governments comes at a high priority. Use legal means to have local governments act in the interests of their people immediately or fire them. There’s several examples of sheriffs stating they’d arrest federal employees if they do anything unconstitutional in their jurisdiction, and that’s a good example of what we need everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       So with the combination of having local governments on the side of its people instead of kowtowing to the federal government, people being quiet about it, having a positive attitude, not engaging in commenting or helping make a story, and also the give to give attitude will tip the scales. I hope for the best, and if this happens sooner than later, maybe we won’t even need to have a violent revolution that comes at a giant cost. I still think there will be a cost for all of this, but I strongly believe this is the best way to avoid violence while keeping our power.

       Other things we can do is vote third party. People like to say negative things about that, and if you convince them they usually ask which one. It doesn't matter just as long as it isn't R or D.

       :0) I also think we should build a rocket, fly to the moon, and steal their alien artifacts. Someone needs to hack their drones and have them do aerobatics above rush hour traffic. We should also make bad ass tinfoil hats as well. :0)
