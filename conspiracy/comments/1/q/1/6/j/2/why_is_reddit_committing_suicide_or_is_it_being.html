       I left that stupid place to join reddit. Now they want to fuck another place. It is time to fight back big time. I am commited to defend our rights and our voice. My tactic is as follows. Just do what you find to be appropiate now and think about your own tactic and then do it yourself. If everybody figths back decentralised then they will not know how to fight back nor who they are fighting against. Organize and spend time fighting back. It is the only option left.

       Beats me, I'm only here because of the downfall of digg.  I for one can't wait for reddit and its circle of jerkery to crash and burn.  Most of conspiracy sites out there are active disinformation sources but I enjoy lunatic outpost.

       I'm curious, what would you describe to be the underlying issue? Profit-driven corporate influence on the site?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's something I think about quite a bit. There's a difference between having a noble objective, and realizing one. Here's a couple of things I've written (somewhat) related to the matter:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://hubski.com/pub?id=7186">
        http://hubski.com/pub?id=7186

       <a href="http://hubski.com/pub?id=100957">
        http://hubski.com/pub?id=100957
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, what we do matters far more than what we say. The final judgement is the user's to make. I feel it's best for me to describe our thinking, and then to do things. Over time it becomes very difficult to convince people of what isn't true.

       If you could think up the most highly infiltrated/monitored website, it would be that. 4chan is probably like right at the top of the list of all major intelligence agencies in the west focusing on grassroots opposition/resistance-minded youth "self-radicalizing" on the internet(
       <em>
        because of course nothing done to them or their family and friends by the government could possibly have anything to do with radicalizing them, right? JUST LIKE A FUCKING PSYCHOPATH, THEY HAVE NO SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYTHING, everything is about furthering themselves and their own power/influence/avoiding fault or problems

       I dunno. I've noticed a hell of a lot less bullying over the past few weeks, compared to MASSIVE bullying a few months ago (personally received death threats that the poster then laughed at and said he was "just joking").

       I wonder how much longer TPTB are going to even allow us to have access to so much information via the internet?  The internet is making their lives a little uncomfortable because we can watch youtube videos of them lying.  We can do our own research.  We can commune with like minded, freedom motivated individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet represents freedom and TPTB do not want us to be free.

       Reddit is owned by Conde Naste, a subsidiary of Advance Publications.  Although the vast majority of the userbase has little to no agenda outside of cute cat pictures or karma whoring; there is definitely a small subset or users that harbor no altruistic motives.  Media manipulation is nothing new.  Why would reddit be any different?  It's probably a better platform because people see comments and tend to assume they are from other average people when in fact some may be posted by corporations of special interests trying to sway public attention.  Keep looking at the cute cats while your liberties are quietly eroded away.

       Frankly I've decided that half the bullies on Reddit are disinformation agents paid to discredit, ridicule, bully, and humiliate folks who rock the boat. That or the world is simply full of meanspirited emotionally stunted individuals. Which is equally plausible. :P
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily, logic is an excellent way to fight back. You can't really argue with "um, I never insulted you or attacked you, so why are you insulting ME?" especially when the bullying is blatant and the person being bullied has never attacked anyone.... It's basically the online equivalent to standing in front of a crowd, taking punches from a bully and refusing to fight back. After awhile it becomes pathetically obvious where the problem is stemming from: the bully.

      <p>
       :D

       ps. i didn't know reddit was owned by conde naste. that totally changes my perception of it as an indie discussion board. funny i was under the impression that reddit was owned and run by a group of freethinking geeks. it appears I am mistaken.

       In 1917 JP Morgan &amp; Co purchased control over America’s leading 25 newspapers in order to propagandize US public opinion in favor of corporate and banking interests, and to encourage US participation in the war. Thus freedom of press ended in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the same way I believe control of reddit has been bought and will be steered to corporate media at the expense of independent media.
      </p>
      <p>
       But....but...this is making most of reddit's readers unhappy. Reddit is open source. It should be easy to set up an alternate news aggregator with anonynmity, up voting (down voting makes suppression of certain opinions too easy), the submission of articles and the formation of sub groups. Many of us are actively looking for an alternative. Build it and we will come.

       You know I used to come to this sub reddit every day  cuz all the other news subs were blatantly being manipulated by what comments would get upvoted but I noticed this happening here as well so I stayes away for a couple of months and go to some of the entertainment subs and lay off conspiracies as it has taken a toll on me
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed that same truthful stuff even in those subs getting down voted when a convo would go down s conspiracy territory. Made me realize this is every where. Its invaded every sub like mods are told things incase a user might lead down there. Hip hop sub reddit for example is run by white elitists and any rapper who isnt exactly in the system will get dissed or down voted. They almost all hate Immortal Technique ... they will love Kanyes musix but make him seem crazy with his talk about the system.

       It is the Admins...   Reddit is owned by Conde Naste   - Advanced Publications.  This is the corporate media.  The term "corporate media" is for all pratical purposes the Zionist Media.  I don't know if you happened to check the New York Times web site while Obama and Kerry were pushing for a military intervention in Syria?  At no time were any other views presented.  The Zionist Media has an agenda.

       The most recent change in the default subs...   Did you happen to notice that TV was added.  Do you really think there's much room for debate in the issues presented on television.  It's a Democrat/Republican echo chamber  - which amounts to absolutely no progress at all.   The poor and the middle class are going to continue to be squeezed and the rich will never have to pay their fair share.

       's fault?  This sub is overtly anti-semitic and subscribes to some rather insane beliefs, most notably with the chemtrail and anti-vaccer crap thats been showing up.  Also the fear mongering, I thought the news was bad then I found this place.

       Anti Zionism isn't anti semitic.  No one has the right to treat any other people as sub-human.  I don't know if you've seen the posts that have been submitted about the different versions of Time magazine; the American version vs. the World/European version.  And Time magazine isn't the only one.  Israel is never shown in a critical light in the media in America.

       I agree that some of the submissions aren't always good but there are really good posts as well.

       Yes, because one subreddit = reddit.  I know you're easily confused, but that's embarrassing even for you.   Also, notice that in your previous comment you didn't actually
       <em>
        say
       </em>
       anything that shows the admins are doing anything.  You just made some vague remarks with random words that don't do anything to actually support what you're trying to claim.  Typical enough I guess, but I figured it was worth making sure you were at least self-aware.

       I'm not sure why you think anyone on Earth gives a shit how long you've been here.  That does nothing to respond to any of the things I pointed out about your inane posts.  What, you've been making inane posts

       It's implied and should be self evident by the main topic of this thread on reddit. Beyond that all I saw was a vague personal attack and nothing worth discussing.

       Yes, it was clearly
       <em>
        implied
       </em>
       that this was happening, but if you actually read the words you just quoted, you would see that what I said is that it has not been shown to be

        true

       <em>

       anything I want, but that does not make it true.  Does that clear it up for you?

      <p>
       And no, it was not vague at all.  I am explicitly stating that if someone is incapable of critical thinking to a point where they realize that merely writing something in the title of a post does not make it true, then they are just embarrassing themself.  Nothing vague about it.

       There can be all kinds of talk about monied interests buying off Reddit, and using it to push or continue an agenda. But it wouldn't be worth their time or money if there wasn't a fuckload of impressionable youth here to gobble the message up.

       All the 17-22 year olds who have never held a real full time job and had to support themselves (maybe through no fault of their own), who have never lived anywhere but with Mom &amp; Dad, and who feel like life owes them something because they managed to get a college degree, who sit around and still obsess about their Pokemons and cartoons made for children and dress up in Halloween costumes...
