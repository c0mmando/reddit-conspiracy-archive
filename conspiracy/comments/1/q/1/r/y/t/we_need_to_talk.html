        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Edit:  Read below I am now banned from bestof, and they deleted every post of mine that was there throughout my user history.  There were several.  About surveillance, religion, Africa, the Middle East, and my own experiences.  Reddit wins?  I guess?  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/altnewz/comments/1q35an/just_for_archives_purposes/">Here&#39;s the archive of screenshots I made in /r/altnewz</a></p>

<p>I am the person who wrote the comment about Israel that was deleted from <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a>.  I was as surprised and angry as many of you were at this decision, and I was equally surprised at the weakness of the arguments in favor of the decision that came out in the aftermath.  </p>

<p>I have serious issues with the wall that separates Israel and Palestine.  I went there as I said I did, and I saw some horrible things, some of which were worse than what was included in my original comment.  </p>

<p>However, no one should use my post as an excuse to further their own belief that Jewish people, or even Israeli people are to blame for this.  The entity to blame, as many here know, isn&#39;t really clear.  In this case, however, I would point the finger at the Israeli government, and to some extent, the American government.  I also point the finger at those who would keep themselves or others willfully ignorant of the situation.  Ignorance, however, is not the same as evil.  Ignorance is only solved through compassion, understanding and patience.       </p>

<p>Just as many of you disagree with the actions of your own government and feel hopeless to change them, so too do many Israelis and Jewish people disagree with what is being done &quot;in their name&quot; and with the constant association of all Jewish people with the actions of a few decision makers in the Israeli government.  Yes, there are dicks there, but there are dicks everywhere.  The point is, each person must be judged on his own actions, and until you know a person, it is not right to judge them.  I guarantee that for every person here, I could find a reason to label you &quot;guilty&quot; for some atrocity.  Judge not lest ye be judged.</p>

<p>I have made it a point to downvote and criticize blatant racism in this subreddit, just as I do in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, and every other place on reddit where these idiots lurk.  Because I look at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> a lot, I know that the accusations leveled against this community are largely bullshit, and that there are good and bad people here just like in any group.  By ignoring it or simply laughing it off, we give stupid people a reason to ignore us.  This is dumb, and it is on us for not being better about it.  </p>

<p>However, if we are going to have ANY hope of getting the change we want in the world, we need to start rising above.  The first way to rise above is to root out ignorance in YOURSELF.  I will try to do this, and I ask that you do too, and I also ask that we all work together to prove those that want to silence us wrong by continuing to be one of the few good sources for alternative news and opinion on reddit.  If you are one of the people who strongly feels that another race, religion, or group is solely to blame for your problems, I suggest that you do more research, and step outside of your comfort zone.      </p>

<p>By the way, the post is back up on <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a>.  Simply go to <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a>, sort by &quot;best all time&quot; and click on the top post.  I would encourage you to take screenshots of this because it likely won&#39;t be up for long, and I also ask that you consider the suggestion therein to quit buying reddit gold for people, and instead donate to the EFF on their behalf.  Better yet, use the money to buy a meal for someone that is hungry.  I have plenty of reddit gold, it&#39;s stupid and useless, and frankly I&#39;d like to see reddit get starved for cash so long as it is set up to let a few unaccountable people decide what is an is not a legitimate topic for discussion.  </p>

<p>Edit:  It&#39;s gone.  <a href="http://imgur.com/Q5O1mB6,AeQZdRH,WabHQZR#0">Proof, and screenshot</a>  Also they banned me.  Not sure if this means I can&#39;t post to their shitty subreddit (I never did anyway) or if anything bearing my name will be deleted.  I guess we&#39;ll find out :-)  </p>

<p>Kind of funny that they deleted a comment that was more than twice as clicked as their current best comment of all time.  </p>

<p>Thanks for your attention.  Please support <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> by subscribing, upvoting, and telling others that it exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand exactly where you&#39;re coming from but, on a related level, if there is truly some type of Zionist backed manipulation of reddit which we should not be halted from condemning it as such.</p>

<p>As you rightly point out there is a huge distinction between Jewish people and zionists, I myself am Jewish but as anti-zionist as one could be.</p>

<p>But I am <em>highly suspicious</em> of what is going on in bestof with regards to your comment, and the general theme of the zionist regime. Yes it&#39;s back now, but it was removed right as it was the at the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> to prevent dissemination. That&#39;s an affront to how reddit works.</p>

<p>And now look at the top post there at the moment-<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1q16h4/uemr1028_effectively_sums_up_wwi_era_influence_on/">http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1q16h4/uemr1028_effectively_sums_up_wwi_era_influence_on/</a>, it is a comment which blames the arabs for failing to accept the creation of the state of israel as a result of British imperial lies.</p>

<p>There is some serious bullshit going on indeed, and more than boycotting reddit gold is necessary. The people who censor for profit need to be shamed and shamed into obscurity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First: I don&#39;t support censorship, and I wouldn&#39;t support your voice being silenced.  However, please take the following on board:   </p>

<p>Look, more than likely, I think what happened is that one or a few of the mods didn&#39;t like my post because they are personally a supporter of Israel, and read what I wrote as &quot;propaganda&quot; against the state of Israel.  </p>

<p>This is obvious nonsense.  As I have stated elsewhere on reddit and as you can probably infer, the post had about 30 readers when I made my comment.  I wrote it as I was taking a shit.  I am not some mastermind.  </p>

<p>But just as I am not a mastermind, neither is the mod who removed my post.  He is just a guy, or she is just a girl.    </p>

<p>He or she is wrong, and I will make it a point to demonstrate that using the resources I have available to me.  But it is a mistake to believe that they are any more (or less) powerful than they actually are.  </p>

<p>The problem with reddit isn&#39;t that it is run by Zionists.  The problem with reddit is that unaccountable people hold veto power of content.  That goes against the whole point of the site.  However, I think that is something within our power to change, should we be persuasive and present viable alternatives.  </p>

<p>Currently, I think we should encourage people to stop buying reddit gold until the admins step up and fix the moderation system.  Should that fail, we should loudly advocate for <em>our just build</em> a better alternative.  </p>

<p>Digg failed because of shit like this.  Let&#39;s not believe that Digg was also an all powerful Zionist entity.  </p>

<p>In my mind, the problems facing the world aren&#39;t magical or mystical or even mysterious.  They make sense.  It is clear which incentives are motivating people to fuck the world up.  There is no reason it can&#39;t be changed.  But as I said before, the FIRST thing you have to do is eliminate your own ignorance.  First be absolutely sure that you understand the problem.  Then set about solving it.</p>

<p>Which opens the door to payola, yea? Payola which, if we trace patterns of removal, is not that hard to induce. </p>

<p>I do agree, it&#39;s pretty clear the biggest threat to aggregates is not the format but rather the editors. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Of course not, but digg did fail because of veiled manipulation of content for profit. I remember when it happened, started with the whole digg patriots thing and only got worse. but the bluray key censorship was the tipoff that digg was compromised internally. I&#39;ve been trying to build a new aggregate for a few months now, working with some folks at the moment and you&#39;re more than welcome to join. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Just remember that Ian Chong, Saydrah and Cinsere were just &quot;some people&quot; until their malfeasance was exposed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didn&#39;t put it up.  I took matters into my own hands.  I had another post which was number one on best of, so I deleted it and put up the one they banned  along with a message about how stupid their decision was.  My hope is that they will delete it, as that post was quite popular and sooner or later people will either see my message or notice the post missing.</p>

<p>Their point was &quot;we can do whatever we want with our subreddit.&quot;  My point is &quot;I can do whatever I want with your number one submission.&quot;</p>

<p>Edit;  They deleted it and banned me.  Nice work to them, that&#39;s what I was hoping would happen.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Incredible post.</p>

<p>I would like to add to this by saying that if people come to us, seeking for truth... we should do our best to inform them. We shouldn&#39;t resort to personal attacks of any sort, and we must not pretend to be on a high horse and all-knowing. </p>

<p>Stick to facts and not general statements. Support your stances with credible sources if someone asks you to do so, whenever possible, and don&#39;t refuse it and push them off for asking citations. They aren&#39;t wrong for refusing to believe what we say if we cannot offer any support for it. We are skeptics and not people who stuck believing in delusions. </p>

<p>If there are people rejecting us and all around being a troll, it is more beneficial for us to step away from it and ignore it. We have a lot to lose here because we represent a growing number of skeptics and it is important that we stay level-headed. </p>

<p>We will continue to have lots of new comers soon because it is only going to become more obvious to the people... and so we have to keep in mind to make them feel welcome.</p>

<p>If you are making comments against a general group, like Jews, make sure to specify it as much as possible... such as extreme zionists and evidence it with videos and articles. Let&#39;s not make generalizations because all jews are not bad. It is important that new comers don&#39;t get the wrong idea and think we are some sort of hate group against a certain ethnicity. </p>

<p>Stay civil. The struggle has only begun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an important point. Far too often people are quick to call out <em>shill</em> to anyone parroting the official story. Shills work so well because they get millions of people to believe the official story. Which means there are millions more regular people that&#39;ll believe what people of power tell them without much thought. Which also means someone parroting the official story is far more likely to be a regular person with the potential to have their minds changed. Being called a shill or any other name will only hurt that. </p>

<p>I am however unashamed of my hatred of Israel and anyone, jewish or otherwise that thinks it has any right to exist as a country and here&#39;s why.</p>

<p>I&#39;m Japanese american, married to a japanese american. My wife&#39;s family was interred , my family was not due to the heroic actions of the mayor in the town where they lived. He said these people are as american as you or I and no one is coming into my town and taking an american anyhwere.</p>

<p>To show their gratitude my grandfather and his siblings enlisted in the US Army. They literally had to fight for the right to die for the country they loved. My grandfather took part in the rescue of the lost battalion in Germany. The 442nd was the most highly decorated unit in the European theater of combat. My grandfather was on of 17 men out of his company who survived this battle. He received two purple hearts. </p>

<p>These men were used as cannon fodder, and sacrificed their lives in order to save the Jewish people from Hitler&#39;s camps. With their own families rounded up and living in camps here, they identified with Jews. </p>

<p>It is a mockery of their sacrifice for the Jewish people to treat the Palestinians the same way that Hitler treated the Jews.</p>

Any ethnic group could lay claim to around half the landmass on Earth if they went back far enough in history. </p>

<p>This poster&#39;s point is that blaming the Jews is racist and doesn&#39;t strike at the truth of the matter. It is a very specific and politicized sect of Jewish people that run Israel, blame the Zionists! Blame a political group that is organizing this military, blame our government for funding it. The Jewish people are being used as a scapegoat for these people performing these atrocities because their internment is so fresh in the world&#39;s consciousness, and so blaming them can be dismissed as the same hatred that led to their genocide. You&#39;ve heard the rallying cry of the people that support Israel, they shout the word Anti-Semitism with incredible frequency. Deflate the power of their defense, and criticize them directly and keep the Jewish people from your blame. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is VERY important for you to know that your comment was one of the BEST comments that I have ever read on Israel--100% true and straight to the point. It is a place rife with disgusting people who are <em>taught</em> to hate from the moment they enter school as a child all through their lives. Children do not hate when they are born--they are <em>taught</em> to hate--which is precisely what Israel has been doing for years now.</p>

<p>You really must watch the movie &quot;Defamation&quot; by Israeli Jew Yoav Shamir (its on YouTube). He shows, without editorializing, what is wrong with Israel, how their hatred spreads to Jewish groups in America, and how &quot;anti-semitism,&quot; while it <em>does</em> exist in a VERY limited fashion, is used as a &quot;tool&quot;--a &quot;trick&quot; to derail people&#39;s so-called &quot;hostile&quot; arguments about a brutally genocidal apartheid state. As I said, my experience there was much like yours. I am somewhat &quot;Arab-looking&quot; (though a Sephardic Jewish male) and I cannot even begin to tell you how much HATE was directed towards me by a large number of the people that I met--mostly young men, many IDF. When I saw that the Palestinians had to go through this <em>every day of their lives many times per day</em> I began to see the huge lie that Israel has become--hell, that it was <em>founded</em> upon. </p>

<p>Yoav also made a highly relevant (to this discussion) film called &quot;Checkpoint--Israel&quot; that has no dialog--the viewer is just shown by the camera the sheer brutality that the Palestinians are facing. It is powerful stuff and Mr. Shamir is a VERY brave and well-spoken man. Plus, he gets extra points for making the ADL look like the joke that they are (in <em>Defamation</em>)--like the &quot;red scare&quot; of the 50s they search out non-existent &quot;anti-semitism&quot; in every dark corner. It&#39;s actually--literally--laughable. Abe Foxman is such a fat douche--like a Jewish Rush Limbaugh. In the first film Mr. Shamir found that Israelis didn&#39;t even know what the word &quot;anti-semitism&quot; <strong>meant</strong>--one guy was like &quot;Huh? Anti-semitism? Why? Jews rule the world--everybody knows that!&quot; The filmmaker&#39;s own mother (the cutest Jewish grandma ever) states that Jews don&#39;t stay in Israel because there they have to work--unlike America where they can make money off of usury and selling liquor. Quite a telling moment in the film! She is incredulous at Israelis that move to America...&quot;what, do they want another Hitler to round them up and kill them?&quot; This is in <em>Defamation</em> and is a must-see.  </p>

<p>It is very important though for me to clarify this--I met some of the most amazing, kind, intelligent, and hospitable people of my life there. The rabbi that I stayed with and his family are now among my best friends in the entire world. A LOT of Israelis buy into the Likudnik&#39;s hatred but, trust me, nowhere near all of them though. Israel is just like America--FULL of great people but led by murderous, abusive scumbags who are intent on ethnically cleansing their state by any means necessary.</p>

<p>It is NOT &quot;anti-semitic&quot; to report the truth. America just happens to be supporting a terror state (Israel)--it&#39;s no different than all of the other terror states that America has supported. Well, it&#39;s a little different in the fact that dual-citizens (such as Diane Feinstein) are allowed to set American policy...which should be against the law. Also that dual-citizens (or simply people who are loyal to Israel--and various <em>sayanim</em>) control the VAST majority of what Americans see and hear in the media every day. Thanks to people like these the meaning of &quot;anti-semitism&quot; was changed from &quot;somebody who hates Jews&quot; to &quot;somebody that the Jews should hate.&quot; It&#39;s sad and angering.</p>

<p>Still, more people over there want PEACE than you would think. But in NO way, shape or form should America be supporting ANY country that racks up so many human-rights violations. We didn&#39;t stand for it when it was Africa...and we shouldn&#39;t stand for it when Israel does it either. There are no two ways about it--apartheid and outright <strong>genocide</strong> are violations of basic human rights--no matter WHO is pulling off the violations. America should cut all aid IMMEDIATELY to countries that violate the Geneva Convention on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Thank you SO much for your comment!! As I said before--you put into words (quite eloquently I may add!) something that I never could have. Thank you for telling the truth. Most Jews in America like myself would NEVER have known that this shit is happening unless they have actually been to Israel--and they would be <em>shocked</em> at how blatant and in the open it has become. </p>

<p>Fuck off JIDF--the truth ALWAYS comes out and Israel is finally having her 60+ YEARS of lies and deceit against Arabs and Jews alike come out into the open. It&#39;s about fucking time I&#39;d say.</p>

<p>Shit, sorry for the novel! Just know that your comment was one of the best I&#39;ve ever read on this site--and certainly, by far, the most accurate. Cheers my friend.</p>

<p>tl;dr Israel is FULL of great people but, like America, is controlled by maniacs who will not hesitate to blow up the world if it suits their desires.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s good advice, and I think there is a further issue with this sub. Quite a lot of us sometimes feel pretty pissed off about the state of the world in general, or maligned by a particular topic in hand - it sometimes inspires some pretty polemic and adversarial words to spill from our fingers. It makes this sub like a tinderbox sometimes, and it hurts discourse.</p>

<p>I hope to try and make an effort to maintain composure on here, and hope others do too. It&#39;s annoying being a laughing stock subreddit sometimes, but I refuse to let it sully my (and hopefully our) efforts to work some shit out.</p>

<p>Not saying we have the ways or means to do anything mind-blowing, but a community that shares these ideas and efforts should try and be a supportive and welcoming place, rather than a blood-brawl - even if we all may come from far different sides of the political spectrum with different personal beliefs, allegiances or ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% in agreement with you, but with one cavet.</p>

<p>In a world where the legacy of Edward Bernays reigns, those who are of an ethical predisposition do need tools to fight against years of abdication with regards to civic participation if they happen to encounter such impediments to cogent discourse . Polemics, when used by the benevolent to encourage sovereign thought, are a useful tool in a war that is fought via the shaping of language itself. </p>

<p>This is rooted of course, in the notion that republican legitimacy exists only insofar as the private deliberations of lawmakers/policy makers are congruent with the discourse of the public sphere. So the threat to discourse posed by 80 years of PR conditioning is far more destructive than polemical tools used to decondition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>not the case with me in this incident. ive buckled and admitted defeat (or reached a middle ground) with someone with opposing views many times. I prefer if someone disagrees with me actually, because there is a chance that my views are wrong. 
These people were pushing propganda and following the rules of disinformation. I think i even called one out and listed the rules he was using (to which he stopped responding afterwards)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve heard of Stormfront, &amp; maybe I shouldn&#39;t even mention there name but I was thinking maybe it&#39;s just the neo-nazis from 1 of those sites coming here to influence people, &amp; if that&#39;s what people mean by shill then sure I guess so, but I notice it too &amp; would like to see less support for such comments, </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>how many of those people do you think were actually shills? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>at least half of the people that responded to me, id say. I didnt go through every indiviual person and check, mind you but from the handful i did, total shills</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a shill is a disinformation agent. usually being paid for their time. a person who argues with you because they don&#39;t buy into what you buy into, isn&#39;t automatically a shill</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yup, im aware.  (though being paid isnt part of the criteria). A shill is a person in group, movement, cause (etc) that pushes their views without disclosing the fact that they are part of the group, movement...etc.
 Its not they disagreed with me, but the reasons why. Im talking about Isreal and palistine and suddenly 3 separate accounts berate me with &quot;what about THIS incident? HMM??! Dont you feel bad?!&quot;, trying to trap me for being a hypocrite or siding with the people who committed crimes simply because of their ethnicity. and their posts only or primarily talk about that 1 subject.</p>

<p>And accounts who dont even post on the same subreddits suddenly converged onto that 1 topic and then each took turns using the same sort of argument as the one before after i blew one off? come on. Ive had posts that had 20+ upvotes that were quickly squashed after i expressed distaste to Isreal and a handful of people &quot;argued&quot; with me with my my opinion is wrong. </p>

<p>I never called them shills directly, though i knew what they were</p>

<blockquote>
<p>either way, this word needs to see a lot less daily usage. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>i will agree to that. im sure everyone at some point threw the word around haphazardly. its an easy term to fall back on if someone disagrees with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The entity to blame, as many here know, isn&#39;t really clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it&#39;s pretty goddamn clear.  Zionists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this case, however, I would point the finger at the Israeli government, and to some extent, the American government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds about right on target.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also point the finger at those who would keep themselves or others willfully ignorant of the situation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That too.  Very much so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ignorance, however, is not the same as evil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Willful ignorance - of which there seems a lot going around - comes <em>really</em> damn close though and starts blurring the lines before too long.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ignorance is only solved through compassion, understanding and patience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which, paradoxically enough, ignorance itself combats and keeps from blossoming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just as many of you disagree with the actions of your own government and feel hopeless to change them, so too do many Israelis and Jewish people disagree with what is being done &quot;in their name&quot; and with the constant association of all Jewish people with the actions of a few decision makers in the Israeli government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think a lot of that is because there are indeed a <em>lot</em> of &quot;good&quot; Jews who still benefit from what hateful Zionism does in their name.  Take Hollywood as one of the most obvious examples.  Are you black?  Mexican?  A minority? even female?  Well good luck getting a break in the industry.  Are you Jewish though?  Even <em>half</em> Jewish?  Well welcome on aboard, son!  You&#39;re home!</p>

<p>I exaggerate here, but only very slightly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, there are dicks there, but there are dicks everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Zionist dicks tend to be smarter, more organized, and - unfortunately - more nefarious and evil, so they are responsible for a lot more problems than most other groups.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point is, each person must be judged on his own actions, and until you know a person, it is not right to judge them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can know them on their actions, however, and the actions of many Zionists and individuals in Israel <em>are</em> indeed demonstrably deplorable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guarantee that for every person here, I could find a reason to label you &quot;guilty&quot; for some atrocity. Judge not lest ye be judged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re <em>all</em> guilty on some level, and I&#39;ve never had any real problem with being judged, as I know I&#39;ve got various faults and I would be doing only myself the greatest disservice if I tried to deny them and not learn and grow from them.  However, just as it is not right to try to get on a pedestal and be &quot;holier than thou&quot;, it is also <em>very</em> much not right to NOT put rightful blame where it should indeed be placed - and what Zionism is doing in Palestine and to the world in general is indeed a damnable thing and <em>should</em> be made known and clear to everyone.  I do not feel that one is being hypocritical by calling to light what the group has been responsible for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if we are going to have ANY hope of getting the change we want in the world, we need to start rising above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this.  I do not think, however, that it involves <em>not</em> calling out Zionism for what it is:  A world and people raping system of manipulation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also ask that we all work together to prove those that want to silence us wrong by continuing to be one of the few good sources for alternative news and opinion on reddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Realize and keep in mind that this cannot be done without, again, calling out the true sources of evil on this planet...and the fact of the matter is that one cannot speak about the horrible atrocities going on in this world without also talking about what is going on in Zionist-controlled Israel (and Zionist-controlled U.S. for that matter).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are one of the people who strongly feels that another race, religion, or group is solely to blame for your problems, I suggest that you do more research, and step outside of your comfort zone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zionism is most certainly not the <em>only</em> perpetrator of wrong on the planet.  It is not <em>the</em> only source.  Far from it.  It is, however, one of the biggest, most influential, and most powerful though.  This is a fact.  As such, that nefarious influence should be rooted out and done away with.</p>

<p>America is where the finger should be pointed. They&#39;re mainly responsible for flooding Palestine with Jewish people in the first place, against the will of Palestine. It&#39;s insane that Israel is a state in the first place, absolutely insane. But I&#39;d say the fact that America had a major hand in Israel existing and their massive financial contributions to Israel show that America is pulling strings here.

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m not on the same side of Zionists but I&#39;m also not going to think the same way as a Zionist and blame ALL Jewish people for Israel/America&#39;s crimes. People that have been born into Israel are raised in a fucked up environment, and even the early Jewish people that flooded Palestine didn&#39;t have much of a choice, they were refugees and they didn&#39;t get to choose where they went. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never blamed &quot;The Jews&quot;.  At the same time let none of us deny the intensive, never ending molding of the minds of children by their Jewish/Christian/Muslim/Buddhist/Catholic parents, teachers, relatives which is intended to permanently brand their religion and its viewpoints upon those children.  Very few children, only the most fortunate ones, grow up free to choose much of anything and most children grow up believing what they are taught to believe as children throughout their entire lives.</p>

<p>edit: The moderators of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> messaged me and informed me that the post was not removed by the admins, that the user deleted his own account and automoderator was &quot;confused&quot; and removed the submission.

I don&#39;t even understand how you could go to the Zionist entity as it was. No normalization, only boycott and divestment. I mean you <em>talked</em> to these &quot;people&quot;, how can you do that and still claim to be a good person?</p>

<p>it&#39;s up there with some of the other subreddits. the difference with conspiracy is that it specifically hates jews. now what i mean by this, is that there is a large number of people here, who are racist. </p>

<p>they&#39;d hate jews with or without r/conspiracy. but a place like this, gives them a outlet. conspiracy brought a majority of this on itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no dude, what goes on here. you can call it what you will. but it&#39;s very clear racism. </p>

<p>you can couch it in a &quot;well they&#39;re just against Israel&quot;, but the top arguments are always about the jews. there&#39;s a difference. if you really look around at the comments that go around here, it&#39;s not always against israel or their policies. it usually ties to a great jewish conspiracy, that often times has nothing to do with israel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh I&#39;m well aware of the posting  patterns of several users. its always the same sensationalist garbage, with no sort of actual evidence. then when you bring it up, op usually replies with something along the lines of &quot;wake up sheeple&quot; or &quot;you disagree therefore you must be a paid disinformation agent&quot;.</p>

<p>you kind of have to take things at face value around here because there&#39;s not much actual value to any of it. its shock value or emotional response value is really all there is to it.</p>

<p>take the Hastings incident for example. that was a car wreck. likely caused by severe sleep deprivation and a loss of control at high speeds. to hear conspriacy tell it, no other car in the history of man, has ever caught fire or ejected a engine after a 80+mph wreck into a tree. </p>

<p>I mean for fucks sake I heard people saying that they though the bomb  must have blown the motor through the tree.</p>

<p>all it really ever took from the start was to see the video. actually watch it and pay attention to it. none of this shit about the motor being behind the car (it wasn&#39;t ) or how the car mysteriously turned into the tree (it didn&#39;t ) or how Mercedes should release a press statement about how their cars don&#39;t explode (they don&#39;t). </p>

<p>all of this ignored the fact that Hastings entire career was that of a tool. he may not have known he was being used in that way, but he was. &quot;oh Obama wants one of our most successful generals out of iraq?&quot; </p>

<p>well we will just send in hastings and supply him with some information about the general&#39;s use of hookers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s good advice, and I think there is a further issue with this sub. Quite a lot of us sometimes feel pretty pissed off about the state of the world in general, or maligned by a particular topic in hand - it sometimes inspires some pretty polemic and adversarial words to spill from our fingers. It makes this sub like a tinderbox sometimes, and it hurts discourse.</p>

<p>I hope to try and make an effort to maintain composure on here, and hope others do too. It&#39;s annoying being a laughing stock subreddit sometimes, but I refuse to let it sully my (and hopefully our) efforts to work some shit out.</p>

<p>Not saying we have the ways or means to do anything mind-blowing, but a community that shares these ideas and efforts should try and be a supportive and welcoming place, rather than a blood-brawl - even if we all may come from far different sides of the political spectrum with different personal beliefs, allegiances or ideas.</p>
