       Wrong Alex Jones guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's how he signed the emails: Alex Jones Strategic Forecasting, Inc Webmaster
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?q=&amp;amp;mfrom=&amp;amp;mto=jones%40stratfor.com&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;notitle=&amp;amp;date=&amp;amp;nofrom=&amp;amp;noto=&amp;amp;count=50&amp;amp;sort=0&amp;amp;file=&amp;amp;docid=&amp;amp;relid=0#searchresult">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And here's the Alex Jones, in Austin, who was the Internet Manager at Strategic Forecasting in 2005:

        http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexsjones

      <p>
       Strategic Forecasting, Inc. = Stratfor
      </p>
      <p>
       Stratfor's Webmaster or Internet Manager in 2005 was a guy named Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's his personal website. No resemblance.

       Thank you for providing this, but I still stand by the belief that the mods shouldn't be deciding for us what is what. We can do our own investigating, the mods just need to keep it civil.

       I think you might be a little too close to this specific case to make well reasoned judgement calls.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you post a lot of infowars stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do need to let the community hash this stuff out on their own.  In that way this revelation is well vetted and people like me who don't like Alex Jones have been made aware that this isn't really him in the stratfor emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       My initial inclination was to believe that it was Alex Jones of info wars.

       Ive been in this sub long enough to know not to look at anything you post because everything you post is from infowars. If I wanted to go to infowars, I would type that in the search bar, not reddit. If you have useful information, try citing it instead of spamming
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       with infowars bullshit. You're the type of person to discredit a source by spamming it down this subs throat. If I never saw another

       No, the only way you people are going to learn is for me to pull away again and let the sub degenerate and stop wasting so much of my time trying to post useful information that inevitably get's buried by the same shills and useful idiots who upvote this garbage.

       I'm at a loss for how I've earned your animosity, I've always enjoyed you're posts. But if "fucking people like me" are ruining this sub for you and you feel like you have to leave, that's fine by me. I have supported these mods the entire time I've been here, and taken up for them on many occasions. I don't really see a good reason here for you to start acting all self-rightous and flipping out on people.

       I've noticed that most of your posts involve you calling someone a shill or talking shit to someone. I've also noticed that you know absolutely nothing about me, yet continue to presume that you do. It also seems that you really ride Alex Jones' nuts a lot. Who is the real shill here?

       ok here's a 3 year old account telling you that if you want people to read and digest what you post here you need to stop acting like such a fucking child. not everyone is a shill the fact that most of the comments i've seen you posting lately is you just attacking random people is pathetic, get off your high horse and start posting comments that don't make people discredit everything you post because of the way you conduct yourself in this forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'm also a different person from the other commenter and i usually like what you post but the way I've seen you act trying to discredit any random comment by calling them shills without a shred of evidence makes people tend to ignore everything you say or post and for good reason too they probably think your 12.

       I'm going to have to end this convo now, sorry but I'm not here to argue with childish people. However, in the almost 2 years I've been here now it is good to actually form an accurate opinion of you. Up until now, I had respect for what you do here. Thanks for reminding me that respect needs to be earned, not given.

       I've been surfing some of the emails while I'm in "my office". And some of the guys were laughing at Alex and saying that I would be very funny and ironic if they had him thrown in a fema camp.  Very interesting stuff reading stuff from their point of view.

       Wow. I have always taken up for the mods here whenever someone says something about censorship, telling them that I have never seen what I thought was censorship here. I guess I can never say that again. I don't know why you would take this down claiming a lack of evidence, this is a conspiracy sub. Those emails were evidence, they provided a name. And then we look for more evidence to try to get a positive ID. Is there some reason that you don't want all of that to happen? Will the mods be deciding what we should look at now or will you be restoring the post so that we can make our own decision?

       Zero proof that these were emails from Alex Jones, new post asks users to prove it was and first post can be approved. Other than that the original post descends into a witch hunt for any random Alex Jones.

       Yes, I saw the explanation and I still disagree with it. And I'm not saying whether these emails involved the I.W. Alex Jones or not, because honestly I couldn't give two shits about the man. That is irrelevant. The point is you have removed an article because of lack of evidence. There are plenty of things posted here that have zero evidence, but they have not been removed. We are perfectly capable of seeing something and figuring out for ourselves whether there is evidence or not. In fact, plenty of people in the original thread have said it's not the right guy. However, by deleting these posts you are denying us the ability to do that. You have taken it upon yourself to decide what we should review here, and that's not right.

       Maybe. I don't like deleting things either. But, right now, there's another post on this exact same topic. There are posts there encouraging people to call up that number and demand answers. That's not a good thing, right? So what should be done? Send individual emails to everyone who may have read that and set them straight on the facts? Leave it up to knuckleheads who won't read all the information and will go around misinformed and misinforming others?

       Then the posts saying to call the numbers, etc should have been removed, not the thread itself. And half the people here are misinformed and misinforming others all the time anyway, no reason for that not to happen with this thread.

       My reason for removing the post is because 'a' Alex Jones could get bombarded and witch hunted because of an erroneous post. Again if readers can prove or add evidence that this information is about the 'real' Alex Jones i will re-approve.

       A lot of people could get bombarded and witch hunted because of false information on this sub, that's always a risk with anything and throughout Reddit and the internet. So basically you are saying that you are here to protect us and others by deciding what we should discuss, otherwise we may do some stupid shit to an innocent person. Likewise, if drugs weren't illegal I may decide to become a heroin addict, huh?

       No that's why i posted you the original link about this theory(which is still active). So far no one has proved or added any evidence that the original post was about AJ/infowars. evidence to suggest it is was all i asked for.

       I agree, if you wanted to hide it you could have, and I respect that. You made sure that everyone here can link to it and see it. I don't think you're trying to censor it for ulterior reasons.But I really feel that things shouldn't be deleted by a mod for lack of evidence. We are all here to discuss various evidences for ourselves. This was very quickly discovered to not be THE Alex Jones, and anyone who read the thread would have seen the evidence that it wasn't and been aware of that. But it should be up to us to do it. For a mod to delete something due to lack of evidence seems like a scary precedence to me. By all means, please jump in and discuss it with us, call it bullshit and show us why. But don't decide for us and delete it.

       When posts are flagged we have a decision to make, i do not want random people flamed because of an erroneous post on a conspiracy board. This is the only reason i removed it. You make a good point and i respect your argument, please respect mine.

       I asked readers for proof, removed the post because of how vague it was, there was no evidence that this post was about Alex Jones.

       I'm sure it's not him, but there is enough evidence for speculation.  The phone number is from austin, he is talking about 'his websites" and it was recently pointed out that one of AJ's interns came from Stratfor.  That's enough to dig a little deeper.

       You still haven't addressed my point. If anything all of your dissembling, and your avoidance of my question makes it seem, very strongly, as if you are unable to be objective regarding the subject of Alex Jones, and if so, perhaps you should consider recusing yourself from any further moderation of topics regarding him, if you wish to continue being regarded as a fair and impartial moderator of this sub that has no personal agenda to push.

       Now it seems like you are just being disingenuous. I don't have a dog in this fight regarding the actual identity of the Alex Jones being discussed in these emails. I have a problem with the way that you are shutting down legitimate conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm asking why it is that you are holding people to a higher standard of evidence when posting about Alex Jones than is evident when anyone posts about anyone else. Easily 10% of the posts on this sub would be considered libelous by any metric.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm wondering why Alex Jones is so deserving of this special protected status, especially considering how fast the apparent real identity of this Alex Jones at Stratfor was found and brought to light.

       Here's my point. If you are concerned about people posting unsubstantiated and/or misinterpreted information that will cause anti-social behavior by the simple-minded and easily led, then the logical thing to do would be to shut down this sub in it's entirety, because there isn't a single goddamn post in this sub that couldn't be used by a delusional idiot of some sort as justification to go on a killing spree.

       BlackSwanX is in the middle of a conversation, with you, in which he is criticizing the way that you are using your mod powers, and he presents an example to illustrate his point, about the way that he is saying that you are abusing your mod powers, and you then use that as a reason to ban him?

       For the record, I think you definitely made the right choice. People's hate for AJ made that post rise without legitimacy. "Alex Jones" is a common name, and the article didn't connect to the infowars AJ at all besides that.

       Such a damaging post, without basis is slanderous. Very well done to remove it. People don't understand how difficult it is for the mods here in
