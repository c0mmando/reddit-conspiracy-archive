<p>Strategic Forecasting, Inc. = Stratfor</p>

<p>Stratfor&#39;s Webmaster or Internet Manager in 2005 was a guy named Alex Jones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you might be a little too close to this specific case to make well reasoned judgement calls.</p>

<p>I know you post a lot of infowars stuff.</p>

<p>We do need to let the community hash this stuff out on their own.  In that way this revelation is well vetted and people like me who don&#39;t like Alex Jones have been made aware that this isn&#39;t really him in the stratfor emails.</p>

<p>My initial inclination was to believe that it was Alex Jones of info wars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok here&#39;s a 3 year old account telling you that if you want people to read and digest what you post here you need to stop acting like such a fucking child. not everyone is a shill the fact that most of the comments i&#39;ve seen you posting lately is you just attacking random people is pathetic, get off your high horse and start posting comments that don&#39;t make people discredit everything you post because of the way you conduct yourself in this forum.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m also a different person from the other commenter and i usually like what you post but the way I&#39;ve seen you act trying to discredit any random comment by calling them shills without a shred of evidence makes people tend to ignore everything you say or post and for good reason too they probably think your 12.</p>

I guess I can never say that again. I don&#39;t know why you would take this down claiming a lack of evidence, this is a conspiracy sub. Those emails were evidence, they provided a name. And then we look for more evidence to try to get a positive ID. Is there some reason that you don&#39;t want all of that to happen?

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I saw the explanation and I still disagree with it. And I&#39;m not saying whether these emails involved the I.W. Alex Jones or not, because honestly I couldn&#39;t give two shits about the man. That is irrelevant. The point is you have removed an article because of lack of evidence. There are plenty of things posted here that have zero evidence, but they have not been removed. We are perfectly capable of seeing something and figuring out for ourselves whether there is evidence or not. In fact, plenty of people in the original thread have said it&#39;s not the right guy. However, by deleting these posts you are denying us the ability to do that. You have taken it upon yourself to decide what we should review here, and that&#39;s not right.</p>

<p>My reason for removing the post is because &#39;a&#39; Alex Jones could get bombarded and witch hunted because of an erroneous post. Again if readers can prove or add evidence that this information is about the &#39;real&#39; Alex Jones i will re-approve.  </p>

We are all here to discuss various evidences for ourselves. This was very quickly discovered to not be THE Alex Jones, and anyone who read the thread would have seen the evidence that it wasn&#39;t and been aware of that. But it should be up to us to do it. For a mod to delete something due to lack of evidence seems like a scary precedence to me. By all means, please jump in and discuss it with us, call it bullshit and show us why.
