       I want to post productive stuff and not reposting content so I have a few questions.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Are there conspiacy theorys that everybody knows that they are true?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Like JFK is a clear case, 9/11... etc.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        How do you guys think about 9/11?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I took 6 month of my lifetime (whil I was in school) to research all kind of stuff about 9/11 and I know a lot of stuff. The question is: Does it make sense to post content to prove that it was an inside job or it it nonsense because everybody knows that already?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Are there some
        <em>
         uncommon
        </em>
        Theorys that the most people think they are strange?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       That's it. I discovered this 5 min ago and I already know that I'm gonna spend a lot of time here...

       I can pretty much guarantee that any conspiracy or conspiracy theory you can think of has been discussed here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even so, if you think it belongs here, then post it. We'll discuss it again. And again and again. The more it's discussed, the better the chances others will see and participate.

       Let's not forget mass shootings like Aurora, Sandy Hook, the Navy yard, and LAX.  Bombings like Oklahoma City, and the Boston marathon.  Plus plenty of current topics like Fast and Furious, targeting by the IRS, NSA, Benghazi, and Obamacare.
      </p>
      <p>
       They all have a conspiracy side to them, which is that many do not believe the official narrative.

       Don't spend too long in this sub the information will get to you and soon enough you will be going crazy cause others you know will just be oblivious to everything going on around them. I spent a lot of time in here and was allways pissed off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainly cause other people out there don't wanna know the truth as strange as it sounds it is true. And do yourself a favor stay away from alex jones posts that fuckin guy is just bad lol.

       Even if some of what he says is accurate, it's the manner in which he says it.  He makes a living by scaring the b-jesus out of people.  And he offers little/no solutions.  It's just, "The globalists are out to get you!  They control every single aspect of your life!  Be paranoid... and continue to listen to my show."   Find freedom and liberate your mind.

       There is a collection of conspiracy theories that most people who post here seem to believe are true, or at least are partially valid. Among them is the notion that Oswald didn't kill Kennedy on his own, and that 9-11 was an "inside job" as they say. There are also theories that most posters think are ridiculous, such as crop circles, Bigfoot, and David Icke's reptilian theory. But you will have to hang around here for a while to learn which theories are embraced and which get the cold shoulder.

There are constant duplicates, especially from newer users and older users who feel strongly about something and want to keep the topic in a dialog.

       This sub is an excellent news aggregator because anything which could involve a conspiracy appears here almost instantly. However, you need weapons grade bullshit filters to cope with some of the more lunatic claims made. Also, if you dare to challenge anyone's personal pet paranoia, be prepared for an avalanche of hate messages.

       If I was to guess just based on this post I would assume that you were mentally impaired. I'm not saying you are, I'm saying that the way that you write makes you seem like you are mentally impaired. You may want to work on that before you start posting threads on a regular basis.

       It's not bullying, it's constructive criticism. Note the complete lack of hostility.

       Did you forget that a lot of people here don't speak English as their first language? How about you focus on more important matters before criticizing someones grammar, when all they want is to hear your opinion on some of these theories, not your opinion about them personally.

       It's not criticism. It's constructive criticism. You may notice how I didn't say that I even thought he was stupid. I do not think he is stupid. But the fact remains that the way that he writes does not make a good impression. I am offering him advice so that he can more effectively communicate his ideas. What exactly would you like me to do? Lie to him by apologizing and saying that his writing is very clear?

       There seems to be a tendency that I've noticed here on Reddit where people seem to think it's better to make people feel ok about themselves than actually help them in a useful manner. That seems nice, but you're actually not doing these people any favors by allowing them to have comforting illusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oddly enough, I was under the impression that part of the reason people become interested in conspiracy theory is because they would rather know a blunt truth than a comforting lie.

       And the simple fact is, if you would prefer a comforting lie to a useful truth, this sub may not be a good fit for your personality.
