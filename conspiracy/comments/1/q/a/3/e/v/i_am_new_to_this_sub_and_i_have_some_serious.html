<ul>
<li>Are there conspiacy theorys that everybody knows that they are true?</li>
</ul>

<p>Like JFK is a clear case, 9/11... etc. </p>

<ul>
<li>How do you guys think about 9/11?</li>
</ul>

<p>I took 6 month of my lifetime (whil I was in school) to research all kind of stuff about 9/11 and I know a lot of stuff. The question is: Does it make sense to post content to prove that it was an inside job or it it nonsense because everybody knows that already?</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there some <em>uncommon</em> Theorys that the most people think they are strange?</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s it. I discovered this 5 min ago and I already know that I&#39;m gonna spend a lot of time here...</p>

<p>They all have a conspiracy side to them, which is that many do not believe the official narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a collection of conspiracy theories that most people who post here seem to believe are true, or at least are partially valid. Among them is the notion that Oswald didn&#39;t kill Kennedy on his own, and that 9-11 was an &quot;inside job&quot; as they say. There are also theories that most posters think are ridiculous, such as crop circles, Bigfoot, and David Icke&#39;s reptilian theory. But you will have to hang around here for a while to learn which theories are embraced and which get the cold shoulder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not criticism. It&#39;s constructive criticism. You may notice how I didn&#39;t say that I even thought he was stupid. I do not think he is stupid. But the fact remains that the way that he writes does not make a good impression. I am offering him advice so that he can more effectively communicate his ideas. What exactly would you like me to do? Lie to him by apologizing and saying that his writing is very clear? </p>

<p>There seems to be a tendency that I&#39;ve noticed here on Reddit where people seem to think it&#39;s better to make people feel ok about themselves than actually help them in a useful manner. That seems nice, but you&#39;re actually not doing these people any favors by allowing them to have comforting illusions.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, I was under the impression that part of the reason people become interested in conspiracy theory is because they would rather know a blunt truth than a comforting lie.</p>

<p>And the simple fact is, if you would prefer a comforting lie to a useful truth, this sub may not be a good fit for your personality.</p>
