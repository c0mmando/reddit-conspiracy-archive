       ...be deemed as having some mental issue, and not able to obtain guns.  From what I understand if you have a mental disorder/condition, you can't purchase a gun, correct?  Well, with all the toxins they put in our food/drinks, water, etc,  slowly but surely we'll all have something.  Right now, I think I read 1 out of 4 people have a mental illness.  I think its probably more than that but I don't have proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone think this is part of the agenda as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its the plan.  And removing fluoride from our water,  and additives/chemicals from our food is paramount, but the corporate lobbyists will
       <del>
        fight
       </del>
       pay   to keep it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm sure some shill will come on here because he has a "fluoride" alert and state how its safe and its the most studied chemical, yada yada yada.

       I'm more afraid that in 30 years a portion of the gun rights supporters will have died off as the youth that have been taught to fear actual guns (while loving virtual ones) gains voting power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it'll only take a few more mass shootings, or worse, a terrorist attack to see more rampant "gun control", I mean look at what's happened already.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're right, but there might not even be available guns for the "mentally fit" to purchase. I hope otherwise though.

       Oh yea, the false flags from medicated folks they created is going to increase, without a doubt.  And everyone will point to guns as usual.  No one will bring up the fact the big pharma issue, and the fact kids are put on neurotrophic cocktails starting at the age of 5 because they are hyper from all the additives in our water/foods.  Its such a clusterfuq of scams that are being run on us, its really sad.

       First of all, his take that medication is "bad" is shocking. I can tell you, the medications I take for psychological conditions really do help. Nobody is trying to poison me.

       I take Methylphenidate HCI SR (Concerta) 18mg. I'm certain there are side effects.

       Right now what they are doing is using "color of law" to intimidate people into not carrying or using guns. When somebody carried a rifle on their back, the police are called, and they arrest that person even though the person is not in violation of any law. Or when somebody reports that a neighbor has some guns in his house, the police come and take the guns even though the neighbor has a legal right to possess them. The police are currently acting outside the laws on a regular basis, in support of the liberal Nanny-state policies of those who hold power, and who want all guns removed from the hands of common citizens.

       Psychiatrists are pill pushing pseudo-scientists who, with a simple word, or flick of their pen, can deem you "mentally unstable" or having "chemical imbalance"  the truth is these are just labels and I think OP is right. People being labeled mentally ill to keep them from participating in society seems like the path we're on.  People will call you "crazy
       <em>
        " if they can sell you a pill.  There's no cure for crazy

       The majority of the time I see a discussion regarding water fluoridation, people seem to miss the fact that it isn't natural fluoride that is added to the water, it's a toxic fluoride compound consisting of Sodium Fluorosilicate and Hexafluorosilicic acid.

       I was thinking in terms of cost and availability. I am far from an expert on this topic so if you think there is something better, let's hear it. I am just trying to say that we need some sort of standardization if we are going to share parts or ammo.

       Well 12 gauge shotgun ammo is quite ubiquitous in the US.  As is .223 and .308 for rifles. For pistols I would recommend 9 mm and .45 cal.  I am also not a huge fan of AKs and would instead recommend the Springfield M1 (I prefer the civilian model) or Ruger mini 14 in .223 for rifles, Remmington 870 (no Mossberg) for shotguns, and Glock, HK, or Colt for pistols (in calibers previously mentioned).  While I'm no expert, I am fairly knowledgeable, so if you have any other questions I will answer them to the best of my knowledge.  Hope that helps.

       Yes, well, I was really thinking of getting the same caliber for both the pistol and rifle. Again, I am thinking of simplicity and standardization. So, for cheapness, I think of the 22. So, is there any semiautomatic rifles that take the 22? How about for pistols? Again I am not so much pushing for any one solution as for having some sort of common standard, which would require organization, which we aint got.
      </p>
      <p>
       The  Ruger mini 14 in .223  looks a lot like what I was thinking about for a rifle. What pistol would take the same ammo and be decent?

       There is only one handgun that I know of that takes .223 and that is the Thompson Centerfire. It is only single shot but you can get multiple barrels in different calibers. My father had one for back-country backpacking with a .44 mag, a .308, and a 410 shotgun barrel.  This was carried in case we ran into unfriendly wildlife and I wouldn't recommend it for "tactical" applications.
      </p>
      <p>
       There aren't many rifle pistol combos with interchangeable ammo that I am aware of.  My recommendation would be a Winchester lever-action riffle in .44 mag and then a revolver or pistol of the same (I like the Ruger Blackhawk but it's really about comfort and preference).  If you were to go the "military grade" firearms route, I would suggest a HK UMP+USP combo since both are in .45 ACP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I personally prefer a pump-action shotgun for multiple reasons. And should you decide to go that route get one that can fire the 3.5" shells because they will still fire the shorter rounds. ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that helps! :-)

       There is a lack  of sufficient evidence to reach a confident conclusion about the adverse effects of fluoride in drinking water.[11] A Finnish study published in 1997 showed that fear that water is fluoridated may have a psychological effect with a large variety of symptoms, regardless of whether the water is actually fluoridated.[1]This response was automatically generated from

       All of this is also from the Bot's article. I can cherry pick too :)

       Studies suggest that the use of water fluoridation particular in industrilzed countries may be unnecessary for caries prevention, because topical fluorides (such as in toothpaste) are widely used and caries has become low. 
 Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits. 
  Like vaccination and food fortification, fluoridation pits the common good against individual rights.[26] Fluoridation can be viewed as a violation of ethical or legal rules that prohibit medical treatment without medical supervision or informed consent, and that prohibit administration of unlicensed medical substances. 
 Controversies include disputes over fluoridation's benefits and the strength of the evidence basis for these benefits, the difficulty of identifying harms, legal issues over whether water fluoride is a medicine, and the ethics of mass intervention
 Opponents of fluoridation include some researchers, dental and medical professionals, alternative medical practitioners such as chiropractors, health food enthusiasts, a few religious groups (mostly Christian Scientists in the U.S.), and occasionally consumer groups and environmentalists.[86] Organized political opposition has come from libertarians. 
 Every year in the U.S., pro- and anti-fluoridationists face off in referenda or other public decision-making processes: in most of them, fluoridation is rejected.[86] In the U.S., rejection is more likely when the decision is made by a public referendum; in Europe, most decisions against fluoridation have been made administratively.[95] Neither side of the dispute appears to be weakening or willing to concede.

       You can't just say fluoride is good because no tooth decay. If you had the right diet you would have very little tooth decay

       What?  Why those two?  I'm curious because it is my experience that there are more prevalent (and effective) rounds and firearms in the US.  So why did you choose .22 LR and 7.62mmX39?
