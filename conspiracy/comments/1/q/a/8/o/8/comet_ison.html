    <div class="md"><p>The thing about Ison is that even NASA must concede there is an unknown element to it. That&#39;s because Ison will reach it&#39;s perihelion in the near future, which could put strain on it, break it up, or change it&#39;s orbit. It&#39;s a big comet for Earth impact, 5 kilometers in diameter, so we definitely don&#39;t want it hitting Los Angeles or Fukushima or anything. </p>

<p>The government knows all this and has probably taken a few steps to prepare. I highly doubt there is a conspiracy, where the NASA has specific knowledge that it&#39;s going to impact. There are literally millions of amateur astronomers watching and studying comet Ison. Virtually 100% would tell you there is a small chance that Ision will break apart and possibly hit Earth, but will most likely pass by as expected.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re all a little nervous about the grid here lately. I think we&#39;re finally coming to realize our system is bunk. We are WAY too dependent upon gasoline and electricity. If the grid goes down, we lose everything. Not only that, but it&#39;s incredibly vulnerable. The Earth&#39;s magnetic field, solar flares, comets, nuclear blasts, EMP&#39;s, computer viruses, oil shortages, global warming, and government screw ups, all threaten the grid and the stability of our global civilization. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to be rude or anything, but I don&#39;t think you know what you&#39;re talking about.  Comet Ison wasn&#39;t discovered until last year sometime. This is her first go around for us. We don&#39;t even know if this is Ison&#39;s first perihelion or not. According to <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1980A%26A....85..191W">this paper</a> from the ADS there is a 10% chance a comet&#39;s first perihelion result result in &quot;random&quot; disruption. </p>

<p>Do you know much about computer modeling with general relativity and multibody orbital determinations? <a href="http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/2.4129?journalCode=jgcd">Topology gets a little crazy when there is a large amount of bodies involved.</a> It&#39;s one of my favorite subjects actually. It&#39;s so interesting, because it&#39;s so confusing.  There&#39;s way more than just Earth, the Sun, and Ison in play here. Our capabilities are quite constrained really.</p>

<p>Anyways <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/776/1/L5">this paper</a> simply states that &quot;tidal disruption to be unlikely unless other factors (e.g., spin-up via torquing) affect ISON substantially.&quot; Which sounds quite a bit a different than </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Infinitesimal. Astronomical. For all intentions and purposes, zero.</p>

<p>So, stop spreading wrong information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Former Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano said a cyber attack to wipe out the power grid will happen. When a government official says something catastrophic WILL happen, that demands some serious attention since the government has an interest in keeping the general population in the dark about most things. </p>

<p>There is talk about ISON interacting with the sun and triggering a massive solar flare and/or CME, the dreaded &quot;kill shot.&quot; ISON whips around the Sun on November 29.</p>

<p>Ed Dames, a long-time remote viewer and the best of the best employed by the US government, said in an interview on Coast to Coast AM earlier this year that there is not much point in seeing beyond this kill shot into 2014.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more likely that the government is anticipating this natural disaster, and that there are no false flags involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve heard, there are a couple of possibilities. A strong enough coronal mass ejection from the sun that is aimed properly could hit the Earth like an EMP, wiping out electrical grids. Suspicious0bservers on YouTube does a lot of work linking solar activity to earthquakes, so expect some massive ones plus tsunamis. But it&#39;s speculation and I don&#39;t know anything for sure.</p>

<p>What America would gain from martial law is an interesting question. If survivors can be rounded up into camps, given food and shelter, kept dependent on the remains of the state for survival, then some semblance of the same old machine can be kept grinding away. I imagine slave labor growing food and such for the families of those who are in power now. It&#39;d be feudalism -- just like today, only without the pretty lies of faulty democracy covering it up.</p>

<p>Anyway, lots of speculation, lots of daydreaming. No facts from me. You might be interested in this, though: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9niiXmqlPQk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9niiXmqlPQk</a></p>
