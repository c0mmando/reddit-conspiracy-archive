       NASA has pictures they aren't showing us, from Mars, from Mars orbiter, from Hubble. The dramatic major effects the comet passing had on Mars, which we can glimpse from amateur pics but NASA must have far better ones...
      </p>
      <p>
       They are hiding something.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way ISON threads are buried here is also curious, ISON is all over godlikeproductions.com and lunaticoutpost.com where it cannot be down-voted, here it ends up in 'Controversial' almost immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think at the very least, if you haven't already, get some basics preps and some kind of escape plan to a remote location for your family and friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       The odds on this thing affecting us globally in some way, from small to major, are quite high imo. It did have a visible large scale effect on Mars we know that much. I am not sure if it passes closer or further from us? But in any case the trajectory can and likely will change as it goes round the Sun, it could hit us directly yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extinction level event or alien invasion are outside chances, but still chances with this thing.

       Personally, I think the truth of ISON is being suppressed by NASA and governments everywhere, and that includes here on r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's be clear, not even the most pessimistic independent astronomer is predicting that ISON is going to hit earth directly, but its debris certainly will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether that debris comes in the shape of a devastating meteor bombardment or toxic cyanogen nano-particles (which will mix with water in the atmosphere to produce cyanide rain) or both, or neither, only time will tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other possible threats predicted from this celestial body involve damage to the earth's electro-magnetic shield which would allow life-threatening levels of solar radiation to reach Earth, and/or its gravitational impact on the earth's crust (causing eartquakes, volcanic eruptions and massive flooding).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever ISON is, NASA, and your government (wherever you are) are deliberately not telling you the full story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read what John Bortle, the global authority on comets has to say about ISON - he sounds pretty worried to me.
      </p>

      <p>
       I think ISON may pose a genuine threat to Earth, and any ridiculous theories concerning an alien space-ship is designed to sidetrack sensible discussion of that threat.

       As the NASA article points out, the debris will be very, very fine dust, and since the exact composition of this dust is not known, "nano-particles" is a reasonable term to use.

       I recommend not spreading fear about harmless events, such as a comet passing.  What do you think of that idea?
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish we could wager a zillion Bitcoins on this comet event.  In the meanwhile, what is the mass of the comet compared to the mass of Earth's atmosphere?  Do you have the ability to multiply and divide?  Stoichiometry?  What is your level of ability here?  I wonder, because a back-off-the-envelope calculation would clarify everything for someone who is able to perform that.  So I assume you are unable.

       I know what you mean: Cyanogen is about 1 nm long and about 0.2 nm wide.  But nobody uses those units.  Chemists use angstroms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a molecule is a "particle" is another interesting question.  Is it a particle in the sense that "nano-particle" would have to mean?  It can't be, e.g., an electron.  That would be a "femto-particle."  A "nano-particle" seems to me that it should be something well-defined and not amorphous.  Most molecules are amorphous.  Arguably, cyanogen is not.

       Yes, of course they do.  I have posted about them here.  I lived in a town where a warehouse burned, and it turned out, according to the news briefly, to be a fire of "Nano Plex Tank Armor," whatever that is.

       But Cyanogen is a molecule.  You know what a molecule is?  Do you know the difference between a molecule and nanotech?

       This is something you could actually calculate, but I won't hold my breath. Just know that the moon is
       <em>
        unimaginably
       </em>
       more massive, and
       <em>
        much much
       </em>
       closer than ISON will ever be, and it has yet to rip our tectonic plates apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, it sounds like you have a laundry list of reasons to be afraid of ISON. What a remarkable coincidence that one small comet should have a dozen different ways of killing everyone on earth. Well, to be fair, the gravitational one doesn't really hold water, but I know that there must be
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       reason to be afraid, dammit! I mean, it's a comet!!!

       If you read the comments I posted by John Bortle, ISON is not behaving like a "normal" comet.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can be certain that NASA knows a great deal more about ISON than it is sharing with the public (which is virtually nothing). My reaction to this withholding of information is one of suspicion. Perhaps you have an alternative explanation and could share it with us?

       you can see observation 2013.282 starting a block of observations which took this photo:

       Now I guess none of that means anything if you're just willing to believe that NASA falsifies all the info on their Hubble pages, but I'm curious to know why you think these images

       I'm not being sarcastic. I'm simply saying that there are times where the MSM has covered or at least
       <em>
        partially covered
       </em>
       something meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't expect them to cover 90% of the topics posted here, or at least not in the light we do... but it doesn't mean they are
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       wrong. Furthermore, it does not mean that the MSM invalidates anything, it just means to take it with a grain of salt (and usually it's fairly obvious).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the context of ISON, I'm going with they're using it as a distraction because they don't think it's meaningful. However, that does not mean it is not. This is more of a future event than a past cover-up so it would make sense their editors wouldn't be so hush-hush about it. Government coverup of scandal XYZ is far more obvious to censor than say... this celestial body which seems to be 'just another thing passing us by.'

       During my morning reading-routine, I stumbled across this woman's vision (yes, yes I know, just stay with me here) that was posted yesterday.  Take notice of what substance is the culprit of death.  Random internet weirdness? Most likely yes, but strange indeed.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        VISION OF CLASSROOM WITH STUDENTS AND TEACHERS HAVING BEEN POISONED WITH CYANIDE!
Steve, I am very troubled about a vision I had last night. Have been seeking the Lord about this for the last couple of hours, and cannot disregard it. I keep getting verification in my spirit of the vision, but I also asked the Lord if this vision was from Him, to confirm it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, I have asked why He showed it to me. When and where - what did He want me to do. The only answer I received was - to warn His people. I have no other answer.
       </p>
       <p>
        During my prayer time last night, in the vision I was taken to a classroom. The children were there, so was the teacher, it was during class. I seemed to be invisible to them, and stood off to the side of the room to watch why I had been taken there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, I had read the Alerts and Dreams/Visions sections of your web site about possible attacks on school children. Because of this, I was listening and watching for an alarm to go off, for the children to be evacuated, for any kind of commotion. But nothing like that happened, they just kept having class. So I really wondered why I was there - what was I to see?
       </p>
       <p>
        After a while I noticed that the children and the teacher were no longer sitting up - they were slumped over their desks. I wondered what had made them so sleepy (I assumed they were asleep). But then I realized that they had died. What horrified me was not just this tragedy, but also that, with all being dead including the teacher, there was nobody to alert anyone on the outside. They would only be found like this some time later - everything was so quiet! SQ-I RECEIVED THIS AFTER I HAD POSTED IRS STORY AND FELT PROMPTED TO WARN PARENTS TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN HOME NEXT WEEK DURING GRID EX EXERCISE WHICH COULD GO LIVE-THIS SISTER IS A FULL TIME INTERCESSOR AND HAS THE GOODS!
       </p>
       <p>
        I asked the Lord what had happened, and the answer was "cyanide."
Steve, I knew in my mind that what happened must have been caused by a gas. But all I was familiar with in regard to this poison were the pills or capsules, and that from news reports in past years. But the web has enough information about this as a gas as well that I am genuinely concerned.
       </p>
       <p>
        A bit later on I also - in a vision - saw the parents coming into the school. Mothers fainted, I do not know if it was from the gas residue or from finding the children.

       Very interesting. As George Noory would say, "There's no such thing as coincidences." I'm not on the "full speed ahead to Doomsday" train, but we do live in trying times and many are having these dreams/visions and if anything, we can expand the list of "possible scenarios."

       I'm not a religious man and for the most part, I think
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       religions are bunk.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I do find these types of coincidences quite interesting nonetheless. Now, there is always the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_astronauts">
        ancient astronaut
       </a>
       theory. Perhaps they (the human population at the time) received warning ages ago and their best way of describing it was the way they did in the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science and "magic" (religion) can seem one in the same at times when the causes are unknown. I mean look at the Salem Witch trials... and that wasn't
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       long ago. If you drove an automobile through the Middle Ages, I'm sure they'd describe far more glorious and abstract than what it really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I am curious about ISON and I do believe there is something strange going on with the lack of information from NASA about it.

       This.  At some point religion was all people had to describe their world.  It was to them what science is to us now, which is in many ways comparable to religion as it existed in certain aspects in certain time periods.  They wrote it as a history and as the best explanation they could give and alot of it isn't utter bullshit.  It is merely very very difficult to decifer and at times unspecific, off the mark, and utterly human.  People just like to twist things for alterior motives and, alas, spirituality happens to be an a+ method to gain control over people's though and whatnot.  I don't want to give too much credence to all spiritual prophecy but there were plenty of extraordinarily intelligent philosophers who put down their thoughts in this context that, at the right time, in the right context will be shown to have a certain insightful message to share.

       <em>
        Chernobyl

        Bortle has observed several hundred comets and yet, he writes, "At this stage of the game, with the comet about to cross the orbit of Earth, I cannot recall any previous comet in my 50-plus years of comet observing looking quite like this. So, what does ISON's current look foretell, or mean? I honestly don't know. All I can say is I don't like the odd look of it at this time."

       So the comet looks funny.  Lots of things can "look funny" without being in any way a threat.

       You know what it means when something looks out of the ordinary in your 50+ years of experience? That it is indeed, out of the ordinary.

       And everyone in this thread needs to stop saying nano-particles like it means anything or sounds scientific.  Just say molecules.  Thats what you mean.  I know it doesn't sound as mysteriously threatening, but you're just kidding yourselves pretending that "nano-particles" are way worse than regular ol molecules.

       Hm. Did you include it's speed into your thought process? mass increases with speed. more mass means more gravitational pull. the moon has a relatively constant pull. an approaching comet at high speed has a slowly (?) increasing, peaking and then decreasing pull. are you certain thag it can't have an noticeable influence? i don't see how possible effects are comparable with the moon at all.

       Mass increases when an object approaches the speed of light.  ISON is not approaching the speed of light.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if mass and speed had a linear relationship (which they do not), the moon is still vastly more massive (orders of magnitude here) than ISON.  And the moon is moving fast as fuck as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some easy googling found that an asteroid passed between the earth and the moon (read: millions of miles closer than ISON will pass) earlier this fucking year.  It wasn't spotted and flipped out about because it isn't shiny as fuck with a giant particle trail.  But the world didn't erupt into chaos.  No massive earthquakes.  Yellowstone didn't plunge the world into the next ice age.

       Well if you consider that the gravitational pull of the moon on the earth is a fraction of that of the earth on the moon...and that there is no scientific evidence that shows the moon causes earthquakes (I did find one that tracked moon cycles, earthquakes and the number of missing cats and dogs in the newspaper...if thats scientific to you)...I would say that the notion that a comet thats going to be 10s of millions of miles away (versus 250000 for the moon) is inconsequential.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I guess if you really want to believe...its more fun not to take things like actual science into account.

       Every time a comment comes through people come unhinged and start talking about the end being near.  Yet thousands upon thousands of years life on earth keeps right on going same as it did the day before.   The rich and the powerful continue to exploit the poor and the weak.  Disease, war, starvation ravage us endlessly.  Comets, not so much.  Unless one of these things is on a collision course it has absolutely no chance of causing us any harm.

       We pass through the dust trails of comets on a regular basis.  The predictable meteor showers we see routinely through the year are often the remnants of comets that have been through the inner solar system.  A couple of years ago I remember some in the conspiracy community getting all wound up over another comet (can't remember the name off hand).  Some were claiming it was Nirubu others that it was going to bring massive tectonic destruction as it came in line with the sun, earth and another planet in the solar system.  I laughed as I watched people with absolutely no scientific background rant on endlessly about things they didn't understand.  But then as it thought about it it made me sad because it is exactly that kind of bullshit that colors the view of the general public when you try to make people aware of the real dangers to humanity right here on our own planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless a comet is on a collision course relax and enjoy the cosmic light show in the sky and then get back to wording about what really matters, what our own species is doing right here on he planet.

       <sup>

       doomsday predictions were making their rounds. Atleast we might get a beautiful comet in our skies from this one. I come to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       for subversive theories about people in powerful positions, not to read some un-scientific rant about a layman's fears of the great cosmic unknown. That's probably why these posts get downvoted; until there is some

       Why do these videos always have either dance/trance/electronica music as a background? Is it supposed to add to the "mystery"?  Am I one of only a few people who feel this detracts from whatever point people are trying present whether valid or not?

       There are many different genres of music to choose from. I suppose the real question is, why do you need the music? If the information is correct, you don't because morbid curiosity will captivate your audience who will sit, paralyzed, watching your video in it's entirety.  Tricks are only needed when the information presented can be refuted and is presented in a way that requires too much thought to understand due to the(most cases) fact that the information presented is incomplete and/or incorrect.

       Why would i do that for free? Why would i do something you are more than capable of doing for yourself? It's the whole insistence that something so easily found doesn't exist that is a bit of a turn off. You are free to pretend. Carry on.

       To prove your beliefs to others.  Since you refuse to support them evidently you really don't believe in them.  Posting a few links would have been less work then that rant you just posted which leads me to think you have zero (0) evidence.

       Yes, i know that and you may know that, but he believes that if somebody makes a claim, he has to be able to easily back it up too. That's nothing on his part, it's on your part. It's the quickest way to gather peace and you might win a friend.

       You are right, i could have provided a link to a google search. But i guess i wanted to not be involved in a conversation about the information not being valid. Because i am not stating the information is valid. Just that people with telescopes made claims and posted them online.

       It's hard to deal with people, when it comes to this. One has to look out to not say the wrong things and make everything as clear as possible. Most people don't think, they just react. One has to take this into account, to make sure a conversation is going smoothly.

       that ISON space dust (trillions of nano-particles) will hit Earth from two different directions in January 2014. There is a soothing
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eSYxvUWwVk">
        NASA video
       </a>
       to make you feel all relaxed about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will notice that at no point in the article/video does NASA discuss the COMPOSITION of this space dust - a fairly crucial detail, I think you'll agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/105087/comet-ison-goes-green/">
        Universe Today
       </a>
       does discuss the makeup of this space dust, however, (such as cyanogen and diatomic carbon) and it could be a real problem for all of us.

       When you start calling natural substances "nano-particles," I know to stop reading right there.  But I kept reading, and it seems you think we should be afraid of some pretty normal chemicals, in small quantities, reaching our upper atmosphere...

       There are plenty of "pretty normal chemicals" which you should be afraid of. Cyanogen is one of them.

       So how much cyanogen do you expect will be deposited on Earth from ISON? What concentration is that relative to the volume of air on Earth? What is its buoyancy relative to the composition of the atmosphere- will it float or sink to the surface where it can effect us? If it does sink to the point it will expose people, what will its concentration be then?

       Who knows, this is just rampant doomsday speculation with no scientific basis for hypothesizing a la godlikeproductions, we can expect more of this here until it's entirely a useless subreddit like politics and news and all the rest, now that several high-profile examples of reddit censorship, reddit "payola" and all the rest have been posted here.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words this is a red herring, an effort to distract peoples attention from all the real issues. Go look at godlikeproductions frontpage and you'll see the future of

        /r/conspiracy

       as time progresses. The same people and organizations will (already are) target this sub. It's just an effort to undermine progress towards exposing legitimate conspiracies, by making people on the fence think "Oh man, these guys are morons, nothing bad even happened!

       Well my point is that these are pretty important figures to understand, before we start freaking out about cyanide rain, no? You could even do a back-of-the-envelope calculation. Do a conservative estimate that the
       <em>
        entire
       </em>
       mass of the comet is cyanogen. What concentration would that amount to if the entire thing was absorbed into our atmosphere?

       Yes, this would be a back-of-the-envelope calculation to give a strict upper limit, and my hope was that if someone actually worked it out they would see that even this upper limit was nothing to be concerned with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got as far as noting that it would be 1 pico-percentage (1 * 10
       <sup>
        -14
       </sup>
       ) of the atmosphere by weight, before deciding working out the molecular concentration would be pointless. It would be more dilute than most homeopathic remedies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course, the entire comet
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       cyanogen, and the whole thing
       <em>
        won't
       </em>
       be absorbed into the atmosphere, so the concentration would be far less still.

       This all reminds me of the ridiculous nonsense we heard about Elenin, which thankfully never got picked up on here much (seemed to be mainly Youtube, where they really do believe
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       !)
      </p>

       Anyway, the best example I heard for Elenin not causing widespread disaster was the comparison of holding a grain of sand 5 feet away from someone's chest, and saying "Can you feel it? The gravitational pull of the sand pulling you towards it?" ;-)

      <p>
       Quite the contrary.  I'm not around any Cyanogen at the moment, and the Cyanogen in Comet ISON is a trivial tiny amount that is nothing to "be afraid of" as you advocate fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       And notice how sincerely and literally you flat-out advocate fear.  You actually wrote: "... you should be afraid of."

       That is fear-mongering.

      <p>
       None of the chemicals are "nano particles," in any meaningful sense of the word.  Nano-Plex Tank Armor is made of nano particles, Norvo Nordisk Factor 7 is nano particles, but normal molecules should not be confused with nanotech fabrication.

       Don't forget about the conductivity of those particles and our molecules. If ISON has enough of a charge, we might see some crazy electrical effects.Depending on what the composition of the dust is, it could be toxic as well. The only thing we can do about it is get some burgers and throw a party. If it's the end of the world as we know it, then we enjoyed it up to the last minute. If it's not, we still had a fun party.  Win win if you ask me.

       He disagrees, therefore is a shill in his logic.

       Not just a shill, but also the dumbest comment that he's read in a while, which I find difficult to believe unless he wears blinkers.

       You would need a battery to use blinkers. I'm guessing you mean blinders - but in any case, I guess fallacious retorts aren't reserved only for shills.

       We call them blinkers in the UK (

      <p>
       In this case, the conspiracy would be between scientist, astronomists, nasa, gov., etc... to keep the truth about this LIFE THREATENING EVENT FROM REACHING THE MINDS OF THE POOR SHEEPLE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!

       For being one of the bigger conspiracys on the internet/youtube/blogs recently, I have noticed the rather loud noise of crickets about ISON in this subreddit.  This month alone, youtube has over

       videos about

       <strong>

       articles about it.  0_o

       Look east right before dawn. It will be visible to the naked eye starting around the 18th as it passes mercury. If it has an electrical interaction with mercury the likelihood of there being issues when and if it passes earth are very high.

       My understanding is that ISON goes around the "far side" of the sun at the end of November, and comes back into view in early December. I think it should be visible near dawn/dusk at that point. It will become more visible during December and January it gets further away from the sun. The early predictions were that it could be brighter than the full moon at that point, but there is no consensus. The truth is that astronomers know less about comets than they want to admit.

       How so? Every Conspiracy site I have ever been to has the same type of format, a broad spectrum of topics that appeal to some, but not to all. Let the reader use (dis·cern·ment) it is their responsibility to decide what is valid, being factual or not.

       Idiotic claims made about astronomical events are something you have to get used to if you want to be a part of any conspiracy forum. I can't even tell you how many times I've read about "solar events" and "rogue asteroids" and "strange new planets" over the years. I won't believe in anything of that type until it actually happens. Too many times seeing the story of the month turn out to be absolute horse shit, I guess.

       This is fearmongering.  I encourage everyone to look up the predictions of Wernher Von Braun, who said that after Communism would come Terrorism from the third world countries, then it would be Asteroids and Comets and then there would be an alien invasion.  AND THEY WOULD ALL BE FAKE, so as to justify setting up a weapons system in space that could be used to enslave everyone.  I've posted several posts about this and yet these idiots still keep getting scared over obvious fearmongering propaganda.  They target the people who would be most against an obvious conspiracy first, like the bitcoin fanatics are pushing a DIGITAL currency while talking about hard money.

       The point is that if you know what the other two celestial bodies are you then know approximately where to look. Stop being a defensive douche. If you dont have anything positive or constrictive to add to the conversation just go away.

       For one its not "perfect". Secondly, even if it was a "perfect triangle" so what? Alignments don't mean anything special what so ever. So tell me, what could a comet possibly do when it is over 20 MILLION miles away from earth during its closest approach?

       I've done some research but am no expert on the topic. I read something like 600,000 miles away from earth when it passes. It is a fact that it will pass further from earth then it did mars. But the whole earth's electromagnet field becoming disrupted/debris pulled in by earths gravitational pull is uncertain. It will leave some effect of earth IMO but the scale of destruction I don't know. NASA and freelancing scientists all agree we have absolutely nothing to worry about. I think only time will tell.

       Comets have been associated with all sorts of bad things throughout history. There have been a slew of books written about the different opinions of famous scientists and alchemists on the properties of comets. But one thing is consistent. Every time a comet visits our planet shit gets crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So before anyone disregards the odd viewpoints just remember that history repeats itself. In this history of this planet.. some interesting things have happened when comets make an appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's an interesting book available on Google Books called "The Ages of Two-faced Janus: The Comets of 1577 and 1618 and the Decline of the Aristotelian World View in the Netherlands" which goes into detail of different viewpoints of scholars throughout history.

       The fact people think this is a conspiracy is simply hilarious to me. Comets, astroids or meteors ARE REAL! You have to be one of the numerous simple minded to think nothing could hurt the earth from space. just saying.. why not be concerned about something that could effect millions/billions of people.. get over yourselves lol.

       Our sun is powerful, everything revolves around it and listens to  it's will. Maybe that space dust will go on and do great things in many solar systems over time.

       This is about it for me. I think they are using the situation in Fukushima to build up yet another theatrics spectacle. Something they can shock and stun and scare Mr and Mrs MSM with to their very core, if they so desire, where Mr and Mrs MSM and their little kiddies will feel

Then the first time anybody gets wronged and fights back, they loose the anti-government, conspiracy whackjob playbook on the media that they are dipping in the waters right now and the same sick game goes on.
