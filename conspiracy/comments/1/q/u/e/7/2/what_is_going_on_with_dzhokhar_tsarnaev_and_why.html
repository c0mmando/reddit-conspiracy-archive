       Just wondering if anyone on this sub has heard any new information on the Boston Bomber. Seems extremely fishy that he has effectively fallen out of all media and no one has heard anything about him. All I can find on the internet is he is being kept in solitary in a prison near Boston, not too much else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any additional info?

       Honestly, let's critically think this out. First according to Huffington post, clearly stated that there were two fresh graves in Virginia where Tamerlan was buried, with no mention of who, or why two graves were dug right next to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/13/tamerlan-tsarnaevs-burial-angers-virgina-muslims_n_3267478.html">
        http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/13/tamerlan-tsarnaevs-burial-angers-virgina-muslims_n_3267478.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have the non-existent BOP registration number. Friends of Jahar were given a BOP number which they could write to him with, and even leave money on his account in jail. The problem is, that BOP number is completely fake, doesn't exist either on the BOP website, or with the BOP themselves, I called both Devens, and the main BOP number to try and get information on the whereabouts of Tsarnaev, without giving them his name, just his BOP number, no record exists is the answer I got.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has not been a single picture of Tsarnaev alive since the boat in the media, no mugshot, no picture being brought into court, etc. Remember Timothy McVeigh? Remember how many perp walks they did with him before they executed him? When they arrest someone charged with domestic terrorism,  make an ex-wiexample out of them, and send a clear message to the nation, not one picture of Tsarnaev.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have the fact that not one of his family members has been able to visit him in jail, almost 8 months after. That's not normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's these weird rulings by the judge in the case, no pictures can be taken of Tsarnaev by attorneys without prosecutors being present, and the more recent ruling that the ACLU can't even attend the hearing for Tsarnaev, again very suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO he's dead. There's more evidence of him being dead then ialive

       This, a million times. I've been saying the same thing since his capture, he could not be left alive. Other weird inconsistencies include the no camera rule during the plea hearings, and the only description of the proceedings describe this young pot head as some Russian gangster leering at old women. After the friend's execution by the FBI, the rest of the family started to change their tune as well. They've been threatened into silence.

       this, a gagillion times. there is no effing way "he" (the character Dzokhar Tsarnaev) is alive. first of all, "he" is a character portrayed by an actor. none of it was real. it may have seemed real to the officers because they were not informed, only given orders (the higher up corrupted officers were the catalysts for the whole set up; without their compliance the whole thing woulda fallen to pieces.) The actor portraying Dzokhar, (of whom is only known as P. Tracy, which anon got form his file before the gov anti-hacked their hack.) was offered over 4 billion dollars to stage the act and actually risk his life (because although the officers were ordered not to shoot while he was in the boat, there was a chance one would play brave cop.)  The people who owned the boat were brainwashed and were actually tied up while the gov set up the boat with painted blood, etc. Anyways, P. Tracy (Dzhokhar) and his bro are probably living on a private island somewhere with Osama and Suddam lol.

       You don't take it personal because you don't need others to follow you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on and on about a story that happened to me, trying my best for others to believe me and understand that I am being completely 100% sincere, something that truly and remarkably effected my life, but I wouldn't even dare to attempt such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Well because I know right off the back that people would have a hard time believing me and probably wouldn't attempt to take me seriously. I will more than likely be the only one in my entire life to know about it... and that's ok. All I need to know is what happened and not to worry about having everyone believe in it also.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you should try the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or hell- if you're really wanting to be taken seriously, then make a compelling argument. Don't just ramble on about downvotes instead of trying to actually defend your intuition.

       Most likely not the same guy, remember the throat wounds. First reports from the lawyer said he had no visible throat wounds and that he could speak fine. Soon after, the original reports of the "self inflicted" knife wound to the throat started to disappear. Try and find them now, from a MSM site.

       The weirdest thing I remember is the day they caught him someone was telling me about how they found notes written on the boat wall. I didn't hear anything about it until like 3 weeks later when it was breaking news like it was brand new. I tried looking for earlier articles on it but there was nothing.

       Eh...His friend said he was a 'changed person'.  That's a pretty common saying to say someone has changed due to stress or life altering events.  It didn't sound like he was saying it was a different person.

       The different accent and messed up face are interesting when combined with the body language comment though.  Interesting but still very speculative.

       He hasn't stood trial yet.  We will see him in the trial.  I just cannot imagine them getting away with replacing him with an actor.

       I'm not asking for proof but at least give some evidence that would make you think he's dead. I could see him 'committing suicide' before the trial, but hiring an actor? Come on.

       So why is there not a single record of him being alive in the government's own database? They say he's being held at Devens FMC, which is part of the federal bureau of prison system, but he doesn't have a BOP number, and the number that was given to his friends and supporters is completely fake, I called myself, and I encourage you to do the same.

       His family hasn't seen him in jail, and matter of fact, his sister broke out sobbing when she saw him in court, and hasn't been heard from since! His lawyers haven't said a single word publicly in front of cameras defending their client from a death sentence, and many aspects of the FBI investigation have been sealed under "National Security", like Todashev's autopsy, which he was executed by the FBI, what makes you think if the government killed him under the NDAA they wouldn't also seal it under "National Security"?

       The concept of a “burden of proof” is important in debates — whoever has a burden of proof is obligated to “prove” their claims in some fashion. If someone doesn’t have a burden of proof, then their job is much easier: all that is required is to either accept the claims or point out where they are inadequately supported.

       He's provided several pieces of evidence to argue his theory.  The theory that the kid is dead certainly has not been proven by this evidence, but there is enough to make it a plausible theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting that you are putting burden of proof on some shmoe presenting an opinion rather than on the system which has been caught lying about facts regarding a case where a kid has been considered guilty of a crime without proof.

i can speculate wildly all day about pretty much anything, but until there is real evidence, like a body, at best it is a speculation.

       you're right.  it's just an opinion and was presented as such with the reasoning (evidence) behind the opinion.  You don't have to believe it- I don't "believe" it, though it's perfectly feasible.
      </p>

       But we are being TOLD to believe that this kid is guilty.  That's what bothers me.  He hasn't even been to trial and is constantly referred to pejoratively.

       Sorry smitteh, you're wrong on this one.  It's on the theorist to at least provide some reasonable level of evidence.  You can't just say 'aliens exist, prove me wrong'.

       What about the burden of proof on the FBI to provide more evidence than "these are the guys were looking for. Don't look for anyone else"? That's what they did, without providing any evidence other than the fact that the brothers were present before the bombing. There's plenty of surveillance footage that we never got to see, yet there was none released that proved anything other than that...where is the fbi's burden of proof?

       Neither do I but I also don't see any singular conspiracy theory doing it either.  My point is he has a lot to lose and little to gain by joining this fight. Let him fight the powers in his own way.  Ron Paul never went on TV to say 911 was an inside job, yet no one called him a shill.

       I did say in my opinion, he's dead. I didn't say I had proof he's dead. The circumstantial evidence however is pretty overwhelming that he's dead, however if you think otherwise, please lay out your case of why you think he's alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think that the whole thing was a staged terror attack, a false flag, then you have to at least consider the fact they killed him on the boat. For God's sake, they executed Miriam Carey for running turning around at a check point and you don't think they'd kill Dzhokhar Tsarnaev?
      </p>
      <p>
       You say speculation is fun, but isn't it speculation that he's alive at this point also? If you believe he's alive, you are believing the same MSM that fed these unbelievable lies to the people in the first place. If you really believe that this was exactly what MSM said it was, happened like MSM said it did, then you really belong in another sub Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to debate you on the facts of this case. I've followed this case more then any other case in my life, and from the facts I've read, I've come to the conclusion, he's dead.

       So you've studied this case more than anything in your life and you have no links or notes you can provide?  I would like to see your evidence, I'm not trying to attack you.  I don't trust the MSM but for them to coverup his death would be beyond their normal tricks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not investigated it but we are told he is currently in solitary and will be on trial next year.  We will see him then and have confirmation then if he is alive.  It would be quite the ballsy move to replace him with a double and have no family members call them on it.

       What is he is not dead, but rather this is a attempt to limit the exposure that violent demonstrations have on the media. Exposure would likely encourage others to do the same for fame and to get their message heard. Maybe that was the goal of the bombing in the first place.

       So how does Rolling Stone magazine publish his photo on the front cover of their magazine, and not violate the Patriot Act? So they can use my picture on the front page of their magazine and not pay me anything? If they used his photo to sell magazines this is a clear violation of the Patriot Act, giving financial support to terrorists, or he's dead, which would give them the right to use his picture without paying him anything. You can't say the media is trying to limit the exposure of him when he's on the fucking cover of rolling stone magazine.

       There are always external influences in journalism. Some of the largest contributions are through advertising and third parties. To get money from advertising, they have to attract viewers. With the exception of an exposé, balanced and fair reporting can fall flat when the viewer has the choice to watch one of the many fictitious programs on other channels. They have to make the programs more enticing and intense, and then a normal story on a shooting because a month-long endeavor.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, I'm fairly certain that they also receive money from third parties to over-report, or under-report certain events. This could also include foreign governments (such as Israel) or political interests (such as Democrats or Republics). That being said, it is unlikely that they would have a direct hand in the way that a story is reported; they would solely influence what is reported.

       He may very well be disfigured, but if he is, it was done to him after the fact, by police brutality. Look at these pictures, they can leak these, but even after his attorney's went to the judge and got permission to take pictures of him in front of prosecutors, won't release any pictures of him, disfigured or not, when in reality this would HELP his case, and help him avoid lethal injection. He was after all unarmed on the boat. The fact his public pretenders won't publicly defend him in the media should tell you damn well they are just as corrupt and complicit as the government.

       These pictures honestly don't even look like the same guy that was on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine, it looks like a double.

       Also, no one seems to have seen the surveillance tape of them planting the bombs. Back when this was fresh, Gov. Deval Patrick went on CBS: Face the Nation and spoke of how horrendous (paraphrasing) it was to see, but in the next breath admitted he hadn't seen it himself. Who has?

       I have the same issue here.  The RCMP in Victoria BC claim to have thwarted a bomb plot on Canada Day after two people placed bombs at the Provincial legislature... I live less than a block away and was there on that day and I saw no noticeable bomb squad or police.  There are no less than twenty cameras on this building and not a single PICTURE of these people leaving a bomb, or the police retrieving it.  Nothing.

       1) The dumbfucks who planned this hoax didn't have a contingency for one of the patsies surviving and being taken into custody.

       2) Sod's law - the law enforcement thugs who were supposed to kill him fired hundreds of rounds into that boat, but missed their target!

       3) The government is desperately trying to keep their patsie out of court and out of the news. So, like James Holmes, Dzokhar is probably being pumped with so many drugs he doesn't remember his own name.

       What's interesting to me lately is what the other newsworthy people/victims have been up to.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, Jeff Bauman
       <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/us/jeff-bauman-boston-bombing-book/">
        got a book deal
       </a>
       in September with
       <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.biz/about-hbg/publishers/grand-central-publishing/">
        Grand Central Publishing
       </a>
       who were formerly known as Warner Books / Time Warner Book Group. Grand Central was recently acquired by a mega French media company, though the executive publisher remains the same, and she has been there since Warner Books days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the one alleged victim sporting an absurd amount of Botox,
       <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/07/03/for-some-marathon-victims-holiday-brings-echoes-terror/KBNKgMYQv6Q47YyGwI45gL/story.html">
        Joanna Leigh
       </a>
       (first image you see in the article), who claims that she was later diagnosed with
       <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/general-interest/some-boston-bombing-victims-criticize-one-fund">
        traumatic brain injury
       </a>
       which, according to the One Fund Claims document, would put her in line for $500K - $2 million. Unfortunately, she never went to hospital, opting to stroll home after being within 10 feet of an explosion, so the One Fund organizers are only willing to give her $8,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       She actually

        took them to court
       </a>
       which appears to have made the original organizers bail on their voluntary leadership of the fund. One of the two people who left the fund behind, Kenneth Feinberg, "also administered the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, the BP oil spill fund, and the Penn State University sex-abuse settlement fund."

       I'm really not comfortable with the attacks on the victims.  Even if these are false flags there is no reason or strong evidence that the victims would be actors.  I feel like these theories go off the deep end and show a certain callous paranoia.

       Hmm, actors? I've never heard this conspiracy theory before.

      <p>
       Just kidding. I'm sorry it makes you uncomfortable thinking that the significant victims are actors. Can you imagine how uncomfortable it is for me? I have formed my judgement sans deepseated paranoia (I'm not even American), based on my experience working and living with a professional illusionist. But eh okay.

       Don't underestimate the power of the NDA, cameras, a good stooge crew, and props. These aren't the first people to make money this way. Look at David Blaine, Kris Angel, and so on. There's a lot that can be faked with even minimal resources.

       So even if it was a false flag staged event, your not comfortable questioning those in this event that robbed the American people blind? Jeff Baumann made over $2 million dollars off this hoax, most of which was donated by genuinely good people who believed what CNN was saying. These people are good, good caring people who genuinely care about humanity, and their fellow Americans. No difference between Jeff Baumann's fraud and the Nigerian prince fraud, both prey upon American's heart strings, who just want to help. Jeff Bauman is just as culpable as the people who planned and staged this. I'd love to catch schmuck drunk Jeff in a bar one night, I'd punch him in the face for dedefrauding my grandmother out of $50

       I'm sorry, but if you still believe that Jeff Bauman actually lost both of his legs that day in Boston, you really haven't researched or done anything more then listen to CNN, MSNBC and Fox News. Listen to the reply on this video that was written by an EMT in the state of Oregon. Just look at the photographs that were taken from a birds eye view, directly above bomb scene 1, coincidentally by a Flickr user with the username Hahatango.
      </p>
      <p>
       The black woman laying on top of Jeff, with no visible wounds on her, is taken out on a stretcher, BEFORE THE GUY WHO JUST LOST BOTH OF HIS LEGS who is later taken out in A WHEELCHAIR, just lost half of his body, but is taken out in a wheelchair, lol ok, like that would ever happen. Instead of pulling the ambulance up to the guy who lost half of his body, they wheel him two blocks down to l the street in a wheelchair,and you really believe this shit?

       If you really still believe that Jeff Bauman lost both of his legs that day, and is telling the 100% truth about what happened, you are a shill (I'm sure Jeff can afford to pay for some positive social media PR now with his $2 million + payment) or your in complete denial, either way, I know what I saw, and it's very easy to see for yourself, unless you don't want to see it.

       I think mine makes a more compelling case than yours.  Not all conspiracy theories were created equal and I just don't buy this. On top of that it's a cruel joke on victims of a tragedy.  Do you really think this guys entire family and circle of friends are in on it?

       Are you familiar with the concept of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">
        confirmation bias
       </a>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are both under-informed and misinformed. You need to widen your research on the "Boston Bombings", because it is clear you have only looked at articles that support your incredibly naive viewpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       No intelligent person who has spent hours looking at the known facts and the footage of the two explosions can be left in any doubt that these events were pre-planned by the authorities and involved multiple actors.

       Thank you. Exactly my thoughts. There is this feeling that the actors are somehow off limits of criticism for some reason. I agree it's not the best tactic to try and wake someone up to the hoax, but they are the ones who robbed Americans blind, making them just as guilty as the government

       You can't fake blown off legs? Sorry, that's not true. He never had legs to begin with. Did you see Jeff Bauman's Facebook photos?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at this
       <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4662618077126&amp;amp;set=a.1534763562718.76042.1043692236&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater">
        pre-Marathon photo of Jeff Bauman
       </a>
       and when you see that it was one of about 7 photos he ever had on his Facebook page... Why is it that in the only photo showing his legs, he's actually leaning awkwardly on the side of that rickety house for balance/support?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of those small things they hoped we'd miss. But they were so obvious overall it's shocking you can't see it, or just don't want to.

       I'm pretty sure that's what they said about a man
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAEw-gtDkO4">
        vanishing the Statue of Liberty
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, you can fake anything and make it look as real as you want - it depends on your budget, backing, and coordination.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, the backing, budget, and coordination was already painstakingly planned with FEMA/DHS/regional emergency services/select hospitals and... actors/students/stooges. Also, fancy pyrotechnics and an absolutely crack team of special FX and makeup artists, I have to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what the Boston Globe revealed in light of the Boston Marathon two months after it happened:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/06/07/before-police-could-plan-for-terrorist-attack-real-thing-happened/ufxjb9O0RXyzVZNPFyGkiI/story.html">
         Police response training planned, but bombs hit first
        </a>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       They had planned - but hadn't yet executed - a massive drill with FEMA/DHS/etc/etc/etc (the first two acronyms paid for all this, as it was a national security drill, basically) to take place in the next two months with police detectives being watched, coordinated, and fed clues by those behind the veil of the drill management team.
      </p>
      <p>
       The drill scenario involved backpack bombers in Boston, and even went so far as to include cute creative details like how:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The hypothetical terrorist group was even given a name: Free America Citizens, a home-grown cadre of militiamen whose logo would be a metal skull wearing an Uncle Sam hat and a furious expression, according to a copy of the plans obtained by the Boston Globe.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now let me ask to see if you've paid enough attention to this rather dire matter. When Reddit banded together to try identify the suspects, who was one of the main suspects? Those big scary military/private security guys? I know I thought that, anyway. And whoa check it out, they even have cute little skulls for the detectives to profile. What? Okay then... Read through that article carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I may give an opinion at this point, they purposefully switched the terrorist roles in the drill scenario from "Homegrown Militamen" with skulls on their hats (AKA
       <a href="http://thecraft.com">
        Craft International
       </a>
       ) to "Random Chechen Terrorists" to ensure the simulation would play out as real as possible. Because those guys were also there, but they weren't the perps!
      </p>
      <p>
       So what do you think? Is it truly impossible that many people you've never met, not even on television, could pull off something this incredibly complex? I'd say it's close, but it's not impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's impressive, even.

       Come on guys the MSM only throws the public stories that will boost their rating.  I bet many of MSM employees wish they could share their personal agenda with the world however thats not going to happen.  Personally I'm going into Journalism and I plan on traveling and seeing stuff with my own eyes.

       haha I'm just a regular person.  I personally believe that I live in a extremely secretive country.  9/11 was what made me question reality.  I was in grade school and I had to write a essay the same week about why 9/11 happened in 6th grade.  Coming from a military family, I had just about everyone telling me that it happened because of a disturbing gov't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I'm still early in the learning process of the secrets we aren't told and I plan on finding out more information about everything around me.  I wish college offered degrees in conspiracy however Journalism works too.

       I'm usually playing league or just out and about.  Its interesting how so many people throw that term out there.  If you think I'm on a supporter or a declining government I would have to say I'm not.  Personally I'm more focused on how our Constitution and Bill of Rights mean nothing to our elected officials.

       Don't you find it odd that they let them come all the way here, and go all the way back before arresting them? And as I said, not a single photo or surveillance video.

       I'm really not comfortable with the attacks on the victims.  Even if these are false flags there is no reason or strong evidence that the victims would be actors.  I feel like these theories go off the deep end and show a certain callous paranoia.

       You don't take it personal because you don't need others to follow you.

       I could go on and on about a story that happened to me, trying my best for others to believe me and understand that I am being completely 100% sincere, something that truly and remarkably effected my life, but I wouldn't even dare to attempt such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Well because I know right off the back that people would have a hard time believing me and probably wouldn't attempt to take me seriously. I will more than likely be the only one in my entire life to know about it... and that's ok. All I need to know is what happened and not to worry about having everyone believe in it also.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you should try the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or hell- if you're really wanting to be taken seriously, then make a compelling argument. Don't just ramble on about downvotes instead of trying to actually defend your intuition.

       So you've studied this case more than anything in your life and you have no links or notes you can provide?  I would like to see your evidence, I'm not trying to attack you.  I don't trust the MSM but for them to coverup his death would be beyond their normal tricks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not investigated it but we are told he is currently in solitary and will be on trial next year.  We will see him then and have confirmation then if he is alive.  It would be quite the ballsy move to replace him with a double and have no family members call them on it.
