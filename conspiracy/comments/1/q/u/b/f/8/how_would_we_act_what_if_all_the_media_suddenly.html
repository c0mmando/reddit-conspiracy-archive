       I have watched a few conspiracy videos, not only of JFK but 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is incredibly sad to watch some of the men break down and tear up with the admission they have had to accept that their own government is hiding the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine that from the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder how much blame would be placed on the news organizations, elected officials, university history departments, etc. 
Seems to be many  places to spread the blame and shame.

       Yeah, if the media is reporting one thing, that would necessarily mean that it's some sort of lie to hide some deeper truth. r/conspiracy would likely start looking to whatever conspiracy theories were in tension with whatever one the media reported (i.e. LBJ instead of Bush/CIA, Castro instead of Russia, etc.)

       I went to a JFK assassination lecture by Dr Jack Gordon who said to watch for the media saying one shooter.. and he was right. The thing that sticks out the mos for me is how the media knew EVERYTHING about Oswald in such a short time...in 1963

       The point is, this is like time travel basically. When they write the official narrative, it's how the public takes in history. If they finally reveal that things didn't happen the way they said the first time, then that unravels the entire time line. What deeds have been done for the interest of the elite, yet re-branded as acts of terror, as wars of democracy? What other public figures have been silenced for their views? It opens up an entire new can of issues and distrust. For many americans that might be the last straw. Many americans that might be the eye opener that brings them to our level.

       Sure, but you wanted an opinion of what would happen about it; and since most would have a hard time correlating this event to our modern day lives, most wouldn't do a damn thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's not something that is blatantly fucking each of us in the ass on a daily basis; (even though that's how I see it) people will be completely nonchalant about it. The vast majority will only interpret the main message and will move on.
      </p>

       "So rick, did you hear that the government was responsible for the JFK assassination?! Yea John, that is some crazy shit, now lets finish this shift and go have some cold ones."
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said dude, it is a very sad thing to witness, but people are diluted as fuck. They have bills to pay and sports to watch, they feel competent because that is how it was designed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's going to take something a lot more shocking to wake up the sleeping giant. Sometimes you have to stop trying to imagine your personality being similar to others, expecting everyone to be as mad and surprised about something just like you were about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the modern day NSA leaks and information isn't going to start change, neither will something that happened in 1963.

       I don't know...  Other than the word "suddenly", maybe everyone, including the media, would wake up, and realize "Holy cow -- we have to do as much as we can to fix it, and make it better"...  Couldn't hurt to try.

       There would be outrage mostly at the level of people who were born early enough to remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example if 9/11 was admittedly done by of own government and showed plenty of proof I think my generation would be enraged.

       It's like time travel. You change the truth about one incident in history and it unravels the entire fabric of the time line. It destroys the remaining trust and confidence the government has from the people. Think about some of the names of politicians and lobbyists and other revolving door members that have been in the game since jfk days. They could very well have been implicit in the assassination. What other public figures have been silenced by the government? What other points of history are completely wrong?

       ~60% of the population believes JFK was killed as part of a conspiracy. For most of the last 50 years, that number was higher (&gt;70%).

       I think you might be right.  I remember when I felt that is exactly what the "news" crowd was up to.  When they began telling us what they just reported, telling us what to think about it.  Especially that Sunday Morning crowd.  Of course that was the purpose for the creation of Fox News and all day talkers.
      </p>

       We are not only going to control what you are told, but we are going to tell you how to accept/think about it.

       I just saw a comment on another Kennedy thread where the person went out of their way to note that he was not killed a generation ago, it was 2 generations.

       This was the subconscious way that they separated the incident from their daily lives. "People in WWII didn't feel the same as me because their pictures are in back and white".--- mentality.
      </p>
      <p>
       What percent of the population knows that the incident that drew the US into Vietnam was a lie?  Even less care.

       I agree,"Pearl Harbor," used to trigger an instant response from our grandparents/parents.  Now, it is kind of a yawn/twitch/question? 
What is Pearl Harbor?

       I grew up in a large multi-generational family group, and probably have more contact with the eldest generation than most.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means not only grandparents but the great aunts and uncles and all those opinions and responses.
      </p>

       So The stories are close to me, but I agree, not so much to many others who are my age.
