<p>Edit: Before I get another borderline racist reply, I said that because the thread that OP is referring to is the George Zimmerman arrest. Posts about this guy always seem to garner racist comments. Those are quickly deleted and I don&#39;t feel bad about it in the least. I find it strange that OP conveniently left out which post he is referring to. He lets you assume its a post about something important.</p>

<p>Edit2: Need any more proof of this, go and look at his recent activity. Or should racism be allowed? Maybe I&quot;M wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, as long as racism still exists, there is no such thing as a &quot;race card&quot;. Also, I can only assume that you are taking a shot at me thinking that I am black based on my name. Low-blow but I will let it slide. Its my turn to assume that you are probably a redneck or something and just don&#39;t know any better. Secondly, I was referring to the post the OP had to have been talking about. The last post that he was commenting on before this post was about the recent George Zimmerman arrest. I was on that same post and could see the same deleted comments. It was obvious from the responses of others that the comments that were deleted were either racist or a blatant violation of other comment rules. Do some research for yourself before just blindly believing the shadow ban thing. You know what happened to the boy who constantly cries wolf? People either get annoyed and then ignore or tell you to stfu because its annoying. I guess using reason now makes me a shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahahah, didn&#39;t notice your name.   I like how everyone is a racist in your eyes though...  Also, not a redneck, although I have thought about it.  Just hate when people cry racism when racism has nothing to do with the scenario...</p>

<p>Also, posting something with no context to the original post isn&#39;t my problem.  If your racism remark wasn&#39;t so far off topic there would be no confusion.  Bringing beef from other conversations into new threads is just childish.  Reddit isn&#39;t a flame forum even though it may seem like it is.</p>

<p>Also, the ban thing isn&#39;t something mods can do.  I never said anything in support of the OPs assumptions.  I just saw your comment and it was like having acid thrown into my eyes..  I have been around for a while and I&#39;m not a fucking idiot.  I can hold my own like an orangutan watching monkey porn.  Just thought I would comment on your comment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don&#39;t look at everyone&#39;s comment/post history before I comment on a post/comment, so I don&#39;t know/care what the OPs post/comment history are.  </p>

<p>Stay cooky!</p>

<p>What part of my post gives you that assumption? And your not a redneck but you &quot;thought about it&quot;? Huh? (Letting it slide.) Again, no part of my original post &quot;cried racism&quot;. I was leaving my opinion as to why he was seeing so many deleted comments on the post. You ignored that part, again.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I have no beef with the OP or anything he said. I have never had a problem with him and don&#39;t think I will in the future. I don&#39;t reply negatively to people unless they say something negative first or are attacking someone else for no reason. There you go assuming things again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just saw your comment and it was like having acid thrown into my eyes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A comment that that you see as &quot;crying racism&quot; was enough to make you reply negatively without any back story or context. I know you aren&#39;t racist but, its attitudes like these that disappoint me about people. Off topic, but maybe you could at least find out if something is racist or not before you instantly hate it for even having the word racist, first. Racists just piss me off. I&#39;m sorry for that.</p>

<p>You always should. It puts A LOT of things into perspective about people&#39;s posts sometimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People from r/conspiratard come here all the time crying racist.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t get why I responded the way I did gtfo.</p>

<p>also, if you don&#39;t get that racists are essentially retarded and that you don&#39;t really need to censor them because they aren&#39;t convincing anyone they have the right idea, you deserve any frustration they cause you.  Getting upset at what a racists says gives their words and ideas power.  If racists piss you off, they win.</p>

<p>I have known so many people who are &quot;racist&quot; so long as they get a reaction.  The second their stupid remarks don&#39;t get a reaction they stop.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m not going to argue that you shouldn&#39;t cry racism, only that you are the type of person they want to comment on their posts so they get the reaction.  It&#39;s called feeding the trolls, and you should avoid doing it.</p>

<p>Not sure what kind of fairy tale world you live in but, real racists don&#39;t care about the reaction. They are simply stating their opinions bases on how they were raised. Parents, usually, teach their children that some people are bad based on the color of their skin. Then those children grow up repeating this as if it were fact. Ignoring it lets others know that these type of comments are OK and can be accepted in a 21st century society.  Plus, I never even respond to blatantly racist comments when I see them. The only reason that we are even talking about it here is because you bashed me for &quot;playing the race card&quot;, which I wasn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How? Is this a place for discussion or what? </p>

<p>My comment had no opinion on race one way or the other. I simply stated that the comments were most likely deleted due to racist content, which happens to be the first rule and can result in a ban. My comment had no opinion on race one way or the other, nor did it say that shadow banning doesn&#39;t occur to some extent in r/news and r/worldnews. I believe that it does. </p>

<p>I wanted to check it out for myself, however, OP didn&#39;t link to which post he was talking about or any other detail that would confirm his claims. I clicked his name to see if maybe I could find any clues. That is when I noticed that the last place he was commenting was in the article about George Zimmerman getting arrested again. Earlier, his comments from that article and him making this post were 5 mins apart. I was there reading comments earlier and noticed the high amount of deleted comments as well. Knowing the nature of redditors and the type of comments the &quot;George Zimmerman&quot; topic garners, I figured that this could be the reason as to why so many comments were deleted. How it can be seen as anything other than an opinion on what OP was seeing is beyond me. Me suggesting racist comments wasn&#39;t an excuse for why there is zero banning. I was suggesting that perhaps this was the case in this particular situation.</p>

<p>I do find it strange that people are so sure that banning is taking place that they don&#39;t even look into it anymore. The just take a post as 100% truth without any supporting detail or evidence. Anyone with a dissenting opinion is downvoted and their post is hidden at the bottom where it will receive little to no further discussion. Sound familiar?</p>

<p>People cant even talk about ideas and try to get to the bottom of them in r/conspiracy anymore. Its just believe my opinion or STFU. OP still hasn&#39;t posted where else he has seen the vast amounts of deleted comments. I read r/news everyday and I see very little deleted comments that would suggest information suppression. It always just looks like the comments was just something really stupid and rule breaker based on other peoples&#39; responses to it.</p>
