       when a post gets that sort of traction on a frontpage sub, the moderators should be not be able to remove.  It's one thing to put a caveat on it, but this censorship is really getting out of hand.

       Spam and bad content. Ideally the users would downvote it all, but on subs that move slowly and have few users, that's not always the case. Bad content can stay near the top for a long time because there aren't always enough users to do something about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some subreddits might also benefit from the way moderation can enforce some kind of "safe space." Subreddits where people post images of themselves or things they've created often have rules barring negative content, and a -30 comment saying "you're gross" will still make submitters more reluctant to post than if those comments were deleted. Having strong moderation encourages more posters and promotes the long-term growth of the subreddit.

       People want democracy with true and accurate representation of their beliefs, ideas and content. Reddit could be so much closer to the democratic ideal and would be benefitted by it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or we could just accept having no power or voice on a site we all support, where we provide the content but ultimately don't and can't decide what get's censored. Ahh yes, the easy going life of a dumb doormat. What fun!

       It sounds like your reasoning is "we frequent this site therefore we should have at least some say in how it is run." I do agree a more democratic control of the site would be beneficial, but I feel no entitlement to control. If I have mistaken your views please correct me.

       Someone will slightly modify the concept like they did with Digg and Reddit, or MySpace and Facebook. They will actually listen to what the users want, and we will all move there for a couple of years until the same group of power hungry admins and moderators take over again, when we will then move onto somewhere new yet again.

       The problem is that hosting a site like reddit is too expensive. I could easily create a message board like this. I cannot afford to host it.

       Reddit doesn't make money from adversing. I am 100% sure they make the most money from people who want to influence public thought. TPTB are censoring news, and pushing garbage content. Just check what advertisers have to say..

       Will mods be vetted by their reddit accounts? I'm not sure how you'd vote for someone you know nothing about. Great idea though. Let me know if you find it.

       /pol/ is literally the worst place on the Internet for intellectual debate. If you're not a white-supremacist neo-Nazi then you're a JIDF shill. If it's not Aryan, it's degeneracy. You don't need to have heavy-handed moderators to have a shithole of a board.

       I was basically getting at the fact that you're mocking the community and then telling us to go to /pol/, but it's all good. This forum should accommodate all opinions, which is what makes this community different from /pol/..  I just don't think the majority of us here adhere to nazi beliefs. I'm sure some do, but it's no worries. We can hopefully merge zionist and nazi discussion into intelligent discourse. Take care.

       I'm getting ready to uninstall this app. If I see anymore of this censorship. This is supposed to be social media. However, if the real news is being deleted then it's nothing different then main stream media. Fuck off with that, there is a reason I don't watch tv.

       Why? I can already see what this will lead to, and it will be a lot more like Digg than the current system.

       Fanatical subbreddits will be able to spam all the front page subs, then upvote the hell out of them. Then yell "we have too many upvotes to take it down now".
      </p>
      <p>
       If the story is sticking in US news or wherever else it belongs why is that not enough? I'll bet some Pentagon employees bike to work, why not put it in r/bicycling as well?

       And I understand that some people think the posts should be left up if they've been highly up voted, but that's not the way reddit works. The mods make the rules, and if you don't like them you can make your own subreddit.

       Ever notice how

        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       has more subscribers than
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news

       ?  Well people go to
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       and subscribe because they want to feel enlightened by hearing about the news of the world.  Unfortunately, the news of the world is largely irrelevant and uninteresting to the typical American redditor.  Often times, people vote on posts without looking at their subreddit.  If an American sees a news headline on the front page that they enjoy, they're going to upvote it.

       Okay, but surely that's an minor issue about the merits of the each subreddit's posting policy and not some cross-community conspiracy to censor as OP would have us believe? If I ran either sub and somebody made a post that violated the rules , I would remove it too - that's a moderators job plain and simple.

       Agreed, don't want to be the devil's advocate, but it's in their sidebar, "no US posts" and this isn't related to technology in any way, so even despite the attention received, still makes sense the takedown.

       Of course it didn't, but the rules of the sub explicitly say "US internal news/US politics" are under 'Disallowed Submissions'. The post was removed because it violated that rule, not because of some conspiracy to censor.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for r/technology, a simple glance at the other content on the thread shows that that post had no business being there. It's a sub for news and updates from the world of technology. I couldn't upload a picture of my breakfast just because "i used some kind of technology" to make it.

       Whatever man if you have a problem with the rules of the subreddit you can take it up with the mods, all I'm saying is that you can't cry "censorship" when your post gets removed for blatantly violating them.

       I think the idea is that reddit is (or at least was) mainly a site visited by Americans, therefore domestic news is just "news" and news in any other country is "worldnews." That's pretty much the way it's broken up by every other news website, as far as I know. But even if it isn't the reason, the person that made the sub decided that was a rule, and it's their right to enforce it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, you can't post an article on a subreddit just because it's kind of sort of tangentially related to the subreddits topic of choice. I'm sure one of the people involved was atheist, therefore it could be posted to
       <a href="/r/atheism">
        /r/atheism
       </a>
       , right? And I'm sure one of them had an iphone or ipad, therefore it would be relevant to
       <a href="/r/apple">
        /r/apple
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/iphone">
        /r/iphone
       </a>
       , right? Bottom line is, if the
       <em>
        main focus
       </em>
       of the article isn't on technology, it doesn't belong on
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology

       .

       The point that people are making is that Reddit has an American-centric take on this instead of a Tier-based system. The idea that
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       should contain news that is globally relevant, American or not, is the point people are making.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile,
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       is okay being defaulted to domestic American news, as the vast majority of Redditors are American. Thus, we would have
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       for American-level,
       <a href="/r/UKnews">
        /r/UKnews
       </a>
       for the Brits,
       <a href="/r/Germannews">
        /r/Germannews
       </a>
       for the Germans, etc. It is about the tier. World news is relevant at a global scale, no matter where it comes from, and people are saying
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       should be able to have American news if it's globally relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       On this same idea, if Jesus, Buddha, and Hitler all resurrected in Chicago, it would certainly be national news for America. But it's ridiculous to say that a story like that doesn't affect the rest of the world, and that a subreddit that should be dedicated to world-tier news is limited to news that is foreign to Americans, despite representing the majority of Redditors, is ludicrous. It is "World News" if Jesus, Buddha, and Hitler resurrect in Chicago. But the way the sub is run now, it means "news from the world outside America", and thus, our incarnated historical figures have no place. Which is where the dispute comes from. Following this line of logic, we'd only limit the resurrection of these guys to
       <a href="/r/SearsTowerNews">
        /r/SearsTowerNews
       </a>
       if they resurrected at that location, and no other subs would have any claim. Do you see the error? All news comes from somewhere, and can be relevant to a much larger audience than those that happen to be closer than others on the map.

       It's due to artificial inflation of the "give-a-fuck". We need to get back on the gold standard. The backing of our give-a-fuck notes with starving african children has failed, and we need to audit the Fuck Reserve.

       I don't want to berate you, but if you think reddit corporate gives a shit what your opinion is, you are sadly mistaken.  Oh, you don't like it?  Reddit corporate  deletes you.  It's that simple.  This isn't a democracy, or a place to have protected speech.

       That's what plan the enlightened have been regurgitating for many years (I don't know where it started) but all we ever see on that progress is "427 new facebook subscribers for the cause" or "Let's do this!" and nothing happens.

       What are we waiting for? For someone else to do something about it? I sure am. Why even complain if you're not out doing something to change the situation?

       reddit rose to such a high position as an alternative to MSM that it attracted the attention of some of the kingmakers and the crooks. They've taken steps to make sure embarrassments don't stay visible for long in the reddit headlines. You can bet your sweet ass that reddit is highly compromised.  Just try to criticize Obama, Israel or Goldman Sachs and the Fed, or Hillary, or Monsanto. They all have agents working overtime to quell criticisms,

       There needs to be a way of moving a post from one sub to another, keeping all the upvotes &amp; comments, then
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       could have just moved it to
       <a href="/r/usnews">
        /r/usnews

       or wherever it would be relevant. Obviously the mods of
       <a href="/r/usnews">

       would have to approve the move their end.

       If you don't want your post removed, you shouldn't post it in the wrong subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, mods should remove posts which violate rules even if they become popular. Otherwise you set a bad precedent for other posts which break rules. It's not that complicated and it's not censorship.

       If it is so important and everyone is so positive that it's going to blow up and be undermined, why not just post it to the correct sub to begin with and then complain when it happens? Post it in US news or Pol. Should blow up there the same as it did in the others. If it does and doesn't get censored, not a conspiracy. If it does get censored, conspiracy. If it doesn't blow up, nobody gave a shit to begin with and its a wash.
