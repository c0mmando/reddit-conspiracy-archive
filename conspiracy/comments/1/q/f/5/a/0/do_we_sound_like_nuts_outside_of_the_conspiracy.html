       Okay most of us have been there, in the midst of drunkenness we may say things that sound poetic and inspirational when in reality we just sound like drunks... sluing incoherently etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So today I spent some time with a good friend of mine who was in his 50s (a darn sight older than me) we (well I) had good conversation about the nature of fiat currencies, JFK, Anarchy etc. 
Now from my point of view I think I sounded pretty coherent and my perspective clear. But I can't shake the feeling like I sounded like a nut! and although he didn't hasn't really ever question the status quo, he's watched enough 'hollywood' films to know what a conspiracy nut is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I probably sound like a nut to most people...
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you critical thinkers like yourselves deal with others' perception of you? Do you hide your views AFK? Do you share your views with your significant other/family? if so do they believe you?

       I've found, oddly enough, that your emotional tone is what most people experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have a firm grounding on what you think is really real it'll convey naturally through your speech patterns, voice quality, eye contact and hand gestures. The less sure you are, the more flakey you seem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back when I used to believe in the Illuminati proper I came off like a nut because I sorta thought I had it figured out, though I couldn't really say why or how. I was able to identify groups and symbols, but it was really hard to link them in a coherent manner. I knew this and the people to whom I spoke also knew this. Robert Anton Wilson actually helped me with this [maybe logic].
      </p>
      <p>
       When I started learning about
       <a href="http://youtu.be/Hon3AzMO6vs">
        psychopathy
       </a>
       it was like some revelation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Me world view has become a lot more coherent and inclusive of data. It's much easier for me to process new data because my model of 'reality' has more nuance and I'm more aware of the complexity. That is; I know that I know very little. I also know that my model works for certain applications and not others. Right tool for right job.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has taken me years to get to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, not everyone is going to be open to these ideas. Let's be honest about it: these topics are fucking scary if taken seriously. Most people have a very simple good / evil diad model. They think that Dems are one side and Reps are the other side (not that it matters). If you rip that model away from them they are in a position of confusion and possibly fear. This is highly uncomfortable psychologically. Especially if they personally identify with these groups. This is ego death and I speak from personal experience when I say it's really unpleasant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talking about these things isn't just about 'truth' - its about "reality" itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heavy shit, yo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm a lot calmer and gentler about my discussions with people. I send out a few trial ballons and see what they're able to handle. If they're unable to handle a proper and formal discussion I'll let it slide and not bother them. Why should I ruffle their feathers? Wouldn't that make me an asshole? I think so. So, I'm really calm these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consequently, people find it easier to talk with me even if we disagree on topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fundamentally we're all on the same side: Team Humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Above all remember that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you'll seem less nuts.

       Your definition of ego death is a little off. Having your social/political worldview challenged is not the same as losing your sense of self. They're both changes in perspective, but ego death is a much more extreme one.

       She identifies herself as a Democrat. This, to her, is every bit as meaningful as being female and human.

      <p>
       You're using the phrase incorrectly, there's a rigid definition of what qualifies ego death. You literally lose the sense that you are separate from anything else. It's not something used to describe a part of your ideals changing or dying off, you straight up lose the idea that there's a self of yours who can have identity traits.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think you get this, but I hope that one day you'll be fortunate enough to experience what I'm talking about.

       Fair enough.

      <p>
       I suppose I mean loss of identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that if you take away a person's sense of self they get really upset. People identify themselves with ideas to the point that a challenge to the idea is perceived, by them, as a challenge to their sense of self. In some cases their sense of "reality."

       I think the reason I liked 'ego death' was because it was fewer syllables than 'loss of identity.' I went through a poetry phase a couple years back and I have a soft spot for short sentences and tiny words. It initially sounds like I'm dumbing things down, but the idea is to cut as much out as possible sop that I can just discuss exactly what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case my word choice could have been better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have a similar correct-usage-of-terms streak in me too. It's funny to be on the other end of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Figuring out ways to discuss this stuff is always on the tip of my mind. I'm always trying to engage in a conversation with someone on a near daily basis. Even if I think a person may not fully understand I'm still always happy to at least try to speak of things that might get them thinking in new or alternate ways.

       I've decided that democracy as such is total bullshit. It's literally mob-rule. Whoever has the ability to compel the largest number of people into voting a particular way wins. In which case the person with the most resources wins. And they win because of the poor suckers who "voted" and then decided to enforce the dictates of the ruler with the most resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, on a smaller scale, imagine three people on an island. If they all decide to form a government, two of them may out-vote the third and decide to eat the third. All democratically legal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poppycock.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just another top-down control structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a long conversation about this with a co-worker the other day. At first I thought she wouldn't be receptive and I sort of tossed everything off as though she simply wouldn't get it. Not only did she get it, but she even challenged me to think harder and put my ideas to real world applications. She ended up agreeing with my position even though she recognized that there would be difficulties in applying it to life as of where we are right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I learned a couple things from her:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) Seriously; be cool. If you're all emotional and agitated you'll sabotage any possibility for interesting discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) Never under-estimate the person you're talking to. They may just surprise you.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) Whatever you think you know - someone else knows something that will challenge you to think even harder. This is an opportunity to hone your thoughts. If the person is supportive you both may come out with a richer understanding of whatever it is you're discussing.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.) No, really -
       <em>
        be cool
       </em>
       . Cooler heads always prevail.

       I know that definition of ego death. I interpreted as i read his sentence
that he was talking about a portion (complex singular) of the ego distortion. If the ego is all about you're emotional responses =&gt; interacting to objects in the super id. Such as Her rational brain society wide societal views getting warped, Brain overload, uncomfortable amount of new knowledge spiced with negative words and connotations.
Leading to an emotional backlash from pleasure seeking part of brain - going through pain.

       That sums up how I've progressed in my way too.  I understand and accept that I still know very little.  I just ask simple questions, and I engage the right people who are open to it.  The others will have their time.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all simply need to be asking the right, down to earth questions of others that they feel themselves but never tackle because it isn't how they've been programmed to play ball.  They just work, eat, sleep and that is "life" for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try and break down those barriers with the info that can't be denied and pose those questions to for them.  Get them to address them or get them thinking on a topic that they wouldn't normally think about.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Team Humanity" is right, and we all need to be supportive of everyone in order to overcome.  That's why "they" do their best to manipulate and separate people from each other.  Families, racial groups, lower, middle and "upper" class people......we're all under the same gun.  If we were all united, it would be a hard family to crack.

       Not only do most of you guys sound like nuts to the average person, you sound positively schizotypal to the average doc.

       Doctors are the most brainwashed "officials" out there, 7years isn't it? 7years of don't think, remember this, remember that, plus high stress and short sleep, a perfect mind control program.

       Obviously if you drew a venn diagram then there would be overlap between someone that does have schizotypy and an otherwise normal individual that is interested in conspiracy theories such as the JFK assassination, which is nothing more than what most consider to be an unsolved historical event much the same way that most white people consider the OJ Simpson verdict incorrect (does questioning the official narrative of that make someone crazy?).  Point being that the term "conspiracy theorist" covers a continuum with normal people at one end and schizotypy at the other.  I get the impression that you have never met someone with schizotypal personality disorder in real life - they are extremely odd and
       <em>
        rare
       </em>
       individuals.  You would definitely know when talking to a schizotypal individual that there was something wrong with their thought processes regardless of the topic, whereas with a "conspiracy theorist" that wasn't schizotypal you would have no idea that they were a "conspiracy theorist" unless the topic of specific theories came up.  To put this another way, a conspiracy theorist often has to hide his or her beliefs in the workplace, whereas it would be
       <em>
        impossible
       </em>
       for someone with actual schizotypy to hide their illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, what you are doing is taking the extreme of conspiracy theorists and treating them like the rule instead of the exception.  Its basically the same type of cognitive distortions that racists have.

       Dude, you misused a word that is categorical. True, I misspoke by calling it "not a word" when I meant to say it was being used improperly, but you certainly did misuse it like whoa.

       being over fifty I can tell you that we (as a generation) have seen tv's go from black &amp; white to color, the sky go from the deepest blue to silver. we have seen the country be raped over and over by the politicians, and if we don't speak, it is because we are ashamed. as the sons and daughters of the greatest generation, we the baby-boomers failed to stop the tyranny. we were taught that if we get the right job and make a good living for your family you will respect yourself and everyone else will respect you as well. we were taught shit and kept in the dark, so it is no wander that we are quiet like the mushroom crop of human crap that we are. we did not resist. we let our enemy have our children just like our fathers did. they taught them how to see everything through the eyes of war. war on drugs, war on women, war on the browns, war on the blacks, war on the reds, the fucking blues and for damn sure those stupid fucking whites.
      </p>
      <p>
       but we are only in our fifties, or forties, or sixties, or what ever age we are. we can change this shit in to something that everyone can be happy with. something that can let the young ones grow up safe and sane in a world that has a common law that holds that the state will not create an atmosphere of war. where there has got to be a victim and there must be damages for a crime to have been committed. a place where lies are not valued and fictions do not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       that is the conspiracy that WE should be working on! Fuck what they do. because we are the ones that will sound crazy if we speak without saying that.

       I only have one other friend that's a "conspiracy theorist", and we get into some pretty deep talks.  The only other person I discuss it with regularly is my fiance.  Not sure if she believes everything I say, but she acts interested at least, and that works for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well the other night I had 4 friends over for a fire, and my fellow "conspiracy theorist" was there as well and we started discussing our beliefs.  2 of my friends clearly thought we were crazy, and just made a joke of everything we said.  Luckily we've been friends since grade school, and I've done plenty in the past that probably made them think I was crazy then as well, so to them its no surprise and they don't hold it against me.  But 1 other friend just sat in silence the entire time we were talking, not really saying anything.  After everyone else left he came up to me with some serious questions/concerns about what we were talking about.  I think all the information we were discussing that night scared him, but at the same time I'm glad I was able to help someone else notice whats going on in the world.  I've talked to him a few times since then, and he's started doing some research on his own.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the point of my story is, I think its worth it to have some people think your a "conspiracy nut" if it means opening the eye's of at least one other person.  My personal rule of thumb though is to not discuss these theories with people I don't already trust (except on this sub-reddit of coarse!).

       There isn't two sides to this. It's one long journey out of the cave with many diversions. If you're talking to a person deep in the cave of ignorance, then help them along one step toward the cave exit. If you're talking to a person who's about to step outside and see the light, then help them move in that direction. Attempting to speak with everyone in the same fashion will only push most of them deeper into ignorance. Their belief that you are a nut will be reinforced.

       You have to communicate properly, that means pointing out relevant shit when it's relevant. No one wants to hear random opinions shot at them constantly. You can only really help by pointing people in the right direction and knowing when the time is.

       Over time, pretty much everyone I know is aware that I blame the US and Israel for 9/11, think the Fed is a scam, and consider the government to be a bunch of crooked fucks.

       Most people aren't terribly interested. Some people are, and those are the people I talk to. Only had one person suddenly hate me and refuse to talk to me. Shit happens.

       Depends on who we surround ourselves with. Some people were raised in open minded families and some not. I personally would not be in a relationship if my partner wasn't on the same page. But opposites do attract. And one thing I've learned is selective conversation if talking about conspiracy related issues helps. I usually ask a simple question like What do you think about _______? Gauge your respone accordingly.

       exactly, people can only change their beliefs a little bit at a time, and rightfully so. you need to figure out where they're at and work from there.

       same is true for everyone, really, it's not sane to accept a whole new worldview all at once just because someone tells you something.

       When those who are awake become willing to establish an ongoing communication with those who are not, and the numbers of the awake begin to grow more and more, then it will become increasingly difficult - nay impossible - to cart everyone off to the "insane asylum".

       I just started doing my own research after meeting one of my friends who was a combat medic in the national guard. He told me about several extremely sketchy things that he had seen during his time in the guard and now I can't stop digging deeper and questioning everything that previously didn't seem like a big deal to me. I tried to talk to my roommates about what I had learned and they just cracked jokes at me and one actually said "I think you sound like a complete retard". It's extremely frustrating.

        A former insider at the World Bank, ex-Senior Counsel Karen Hudes, says the global financial system is dominated by a small group of corrupt, power-hungry figures centered around the privately owned U.S. Federal Reserve. The network has seized control of the media to cover up its crimes, too, she explained. In an interview with The New American, Hudes said that when she tried to blow the whistle on multiple problems at the World Bank, she was fired for her efforts. Now, along with a network of fellow whistleblowers, Hudes is determined to expose and end the corruption. And she is confident of success. Citing an explosive 2011 Swiss study published in the PLOS ONE journal on the “network of global corporate control,” Hudes pointed out that a small group of entities — mostly financial institutions and especially central banks — exert a massive amount of influence over the international economy from behind the scenes. “What is really going on is that the world’s resources are being dominated by this group,” she explained, adding that the “corrupt power grabbers” have managed to dominate the media as well. “They’re being allowed to do it. - See more at:

        Looking at the state of (post-9/11) America today — the perpetual War on Terror, empire building in the name of “humanitarian regime change” of democratically elected leaders in foreign countries, the Department of Homeland Security and its Transportation Security Administration goon squad, the National Defense Authorization Act and its ability to disappear American citizens suspected of terrorism without due process of law, Obamacare, the National Security Administration’s big brother surveillance state, the militarization of our police in an ever-expanding police state, the common core, the Federal Reserve’s runaway monopoly money printer and a nation hanging on the verge of economic collapse, the crackdown on food freedom. And when revolutionaries like MICHAEL HASTINGS are assassinated like MALCOM X, MLK JR, JFK, RFK, AND TUPAC, it only strengthens the flame yearning for resistance and justice.

       I think that there are a range of topics from the firmly established conspiracies to the way-out-there crazy ones. So, if you are going to introduce these ideas to people, it is better to start with the rock-solid ones.

I'm going to say what I think if you ask me and I'll still be your friend if you don't share my view. If you don't want to be my friend because I believe 911 is a fucking lie, peace out brah.

       Yes, we do, although the conspiracy circle might be larger than we think. Well, let me backtrack. If someone describes a scenario where the extremely rich and powerful write the laws and control the media, and seek to get more and more power at the expense of the citizenry, using fear tactics and divide-and-conquer strategies, they could get a lot of people to agree with them and they won't seem insane. It's when we get into specific things--like false flag attacks or the family lineages of those in power or groups like the Illuminati--that we come off nutty.
      </p>
      <p>
       In discussing things with people, we can make some judgments about whether some specfic point if actually crucial. Do we really need to convince someone 9/11 was a false flag or is it enough to see if they are already bothered by the way that event was used to treat them like criminals in airports and start the conversation from that agreed-upon point?

       I think the biggest problem for conspiracy researchers is their refusal to say "I don't know" when someone asks something there's no immediate answer for. Be honest. Don't flail about trying to prove a connection if you don't have it immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, most importantly,
       <em>
        don't get caught not knowing.
       </em>
       If you have an obvious question about the validity or background of a conspiracy you're researching, KEEP DIGGING, find the answer. If you're dedicated and you're questioning it, you can bet a natural skeptic will have questions too. Know the answer OR adjust your thinking as you acquire new information.

       I don't hide my views, but I don't shout them from a rooftop. I tell some of my family and some of my friends what I know to be true, and make jokes to them about what could be true (if it seems outrageous, but possible). When stating a fact as a fact, people believe me. When stating a possibility as a possibility, I come across plenty of cognitive dissonance.

       Be careful talking when you are drunk.  It's hard enough to keep things straight when you are sober.  Always start with the facts and let the facts raise the questions. Never make an unfounded conclusion if you are trying to educate someone.  Pick and choose the most concrete, tangible evidence and avoid conjecture that could be labeled "paranoid".

       Look there is much more to it than you think, say whatever you know all the time. when you quit being egocentric about it, what the hell do you care if someone that has fallen for all the lies and stuck their heads in the sand, thinks? you have a job to do, save your family!!! save your friends!!! there are friends that I have had to write off, that are now giving me the salute when they see me. they lower their heads and put their hand to their brow, if that is not a salute then I do not know what one is.

       I have been messed with like you would not believe, because I have told everyone the truth about what is happening. but knowledge is funny in that more they hear the more that sinks in. the more they see and digest, the more MSM seems crazy and you do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       dissect your presentation as much as you want, but being genuine and speaking the truth about any way we are under full on attack from an enemy that intends on one hand to thin the herd or to the other extreme to reduce the world population to 500,000,000 which is 1/14 what it is now, like it says in stone in Georgia.
      </p>
      <p>
       of course we are going to look and sound crazy. they have no idea what the truth is, they have never heard it before. but they are all waking up. I have people tell me all the time that they heard someone else talking about the same stuff I talk about.
      </p>

       the solution is education in the truth. so if you got it you need to give it away, and you will find it is not like ten years ago, or longer for me, when they would look at you and laugh while saying "oh, you are a conspiracy theorist". the term now has legitimacy associated with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       the truth is still a little bit revolutionary right now. but with 55% to 75% wanting a full out audit of the Fed there is much to give a man hope.

       start talking like it is a done deal that people will be brought to justice over the fraud that has been portrayed upon the People.

       two standard sales tools are "fear of loss" and "perception of loss".
the first is used when directly merchandizing a product, they put it into your hands and then remove it, best example is the test drive of a new car.
the second is predominant in advertizing. it is simply keeping up with the Jones's or well any advertizing targeted at women or the homemaker.

       when you speak in a matter of fact way that there is Mercury in the shots, that the USAF is spraying things in our air to cause sterility in men, and that the Gardisil shot will kill their daughter or make her sterile. they then hear it in other places and soon they know it even if the don't realize they know it.

       Racism is being relegated to the trash heap of history because people talked about it. and they did not shut up. when it was one guy and he was black then he was just a pastor of some negro church. but as soon as he started marching and people fell in behind him, Brother Martin held the attention of not just a nation, but the whole world.

       you confront ignorance with education on any subject, and ignorance will always end up giving ground.

       A former insider at the World Bank, ex-Senior Counsel Karen Hudes, says the global financial system is dominated by a small group of corrupt, power-hungry figures centered around the privately owned U.S. Federal Reserve. The network has seized control of the media to cover up its crimes, too, she explained. In an interview with The New American, Hudes said that when she tried to blow the whistle on multiple problems at the World Bank, she was fired for her efforts. Now, along with a network of fellow whistleblowers, Hudes is determined to expose and end the corruption. And she is confident of success. Citing an explosive 2011 Swiss study published in the PLOS ONE journal on the “network of global corporate control,” Hudes pointed out that a small group of entities — mostly financial institutions and especially central banks — exert a massive amount of influence over the international economy from behind the scenes. “What is really going on is that the world’s resources are being dominated by this group,” she explained, adding that the “corrupt power grabbers” have managed to dominate the media as well. “They’re being allowed to do it. - See more at:

       Looking at the state of (post-9/11) America today — the perpetual War on Terror, empire building in the name of “humanitarian regime change” of democratically elected leaders in foreign countries, the Department of Homeland Security and its Transportation Security Administration goon squad, the National Defense Authorization Act and its ability to disappear American citizens suspected of terrorism without due process of law, Obamacare, the National Security Administration’s big brother surveillance state, the militarization of our police in an ever-expanding police state, the common core, the Federal Reserve’s runaway monopoly money printer and a nation hanging on the verge of economic collapse, the crackdown on food freedom. And when revolutionaries like MICHAEL HASTINGS are assassinated like MALCOM X, MLK JR, JFK, RFK, AND TUPAC, it only strengthens the flame yearning for resistance and justice.

       She identifies herself as a Democrat. This, to her, is every bit as meaningful as being female and human.

       So, yes, it's an identity trait for her.
