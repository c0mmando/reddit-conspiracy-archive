<p>So today I spent some time with a good friend of mine who was in his 50s (a darn sight older than me) we (well I) had good conversation about the nature of fiat currencies, JFK, Anarchy etc. 
Now from my point of view I think I sounded pretty coherent and my perspective clear. But I can&#39;t shake the feeling like I sounded like a nut! and although he didn&#39;t hasn&#39;t really ever question the status quo, he&#39;s watched enough &#39;hollywood&#39; films to know what a conspiracy nut is.</p>

<p>I probably sound like a nut to most people...</p>

<p>How do you critical thinkers like yourselves deal with others&#39; perception of you? Do you hide your views AFK? Do you share your views with your significant other/family? if so do they believe you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve found, oddly enough, that your emotional tone is what most people experience.</p>

<p>If you have a firm grounding on what you think is really real it&#39;ll convey naturally through your speech patterns, voice quality, eye contact and hand gestures. The less sure you are, the more flakey you seem.</p>

<p>Back when I used to believe in the Illuminati proper I came off like a nut because I sorta thought I had it figured out, though I couldn&#39;t really say why or how. I was able to identify groups and symbols, but it was really hard to link them in a coherent manner. I knew this and the people to whom I spoke also knew this. Robert Anton Wilson actually helped me with this [maybe logic].</p>

<p>When I started learning about <a href="http://youtu.be/Hon3AzMO6vs">psychopathy</a> it was like some revelation.</p>

<p>Me world view has become a lot more coherent and inclusive of data. It&#39;s much easier for me to process new data because my model of &#39;reality&#39; has more nuance and I&#39;m more aware of the complexity. That is; I know that I know very little. I also know that my model works for certain applications and not others. Right tool for right job.</p>

<p>This has taken me years to get to.</p>

<p>Also, not everyone is going to be open to these ideas. Let&#39;s be honest about it: these topics are fucking scary if taken seriously. Most people have a very simple good / evil diad model. They think that Dems are one side and Reps are the other side (not that it matters). If you rip that model away from them they are in a position of confusion and possibly fear. This is highly uncomfortable psychologically. Especially if they personally identify with these groups. This is ego death and I speak from personal experience when I say it&#39;s really unpleasant. </p>

<p>Talking about these things isn&#39;t just about &#39;truth&#39; - its about &quot;reality&quot; itself.</p>

<p>Heavy shit, yo.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m a lot calmer and gentler about my discussions with people. I send out a few trial ballons and see what they&#39;re able to handle. If they&#39;re unable to handle a proper and formal discussion I&#39;ll let it slide and not bother them. Why should I ruffle their feathers? Wouldn&#39;t that make me an asshole? I think so. So, I&#39;m really calm these days.</p>

<p>Consequently, people find it easier to talk with me even if we disagree on topics.</p>

<p>Fundamentally we&#39;re all on the same side: Team Humanity.</p>

<p>Above all remember that.</p>

<p>And then you&#39;ll seem less nuts.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death</a></p>

<p>You&#39;re using the phrase incorrectly, there&#39;s a rigid definition of what qualifies ego death. You literally lose the sense that you are separate from anything else. It&#39;s not something used to describe a part of your ideals changing or dying off, you straight up lose the idea that there&#39;s a self of yours who can have identity traits.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you get this, but I hope that one day you&#39;ll be fortunate enough to experience what I&#39;m talking about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>I suppose I mean loss of identity.</p>

<p>The point is that if you take away a person&#39;s sense of self they get really upset. People identify themselves with ideas to the point that a challenge to the idea is perceived, by them, as a challenge to their sense of self. In some cases their sense of &quot;reality.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reason I liked &#39;ego death&#39; was because it was fewer syllables than &#39;loss of identity.&#39; I went through a poetry phase a couple years back and I have a soft spot for short sentences and tiny words. It initially sounds like I&#39;m dumbing things down, but the idea is to cut as much out as possible sop that I can just discuss exactly what I mean. </p>

<p>In this case my word choice could have been better. </p>

<p>I also have a similar correct-usage-of-terms streak in me too. It&#39;s funny to be on the other end of it. </p>

<p>Anyway, thank you. </p>

<p>Figuring out ways to discuss this stuff is always on the tip of my mind. I&#39;m always trying to engage in a conversation with someone on a near daily basis. Even if I think a person may not fully understand I&#39;m still always happy to at least try to speak of things that might get them thinking in new or alternate ways.</p>

<p>My most recent mental toy is democracy.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve decided that democracy as such is total bullshit. It&#39;s literally mob-rule. Whoever has the ability to compel the largest number of people into voting a particular way wins. In which case the person with the most resources wins. And they win because of the poor suckers who &quot;voted&quot; and then decided to enforce the dictates of the ruler with the most resources.</p>

<p>Or, on a smaller scale, imagine three people on an island. If they all decide to form a government, two of them may out-vote the third and decide to eat the third. All democratically legal.</p>

<p>Poppycock.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just another top-down control structure. </p>

<p>I had a long conversation about this with a co-worker the other day. At first I thought she wouldn&#39;t be receptive and I sort of tossed everything off as though she simply wouldn&#39;t get it. Not only did she get it, but she even challenged me to think harder and put my ideas to real world applications. She ended up agreeing with my position even though she recognized that there would be difficulties in applying it to life as of where we are right now. </p>

<p>I learned a couple things from her:</p>

<p>1.) Seriously; be cool. If you&#39;re all emotional and agitated you&#39;ll sabotage any possibility for interesting discussion.</p>

<p>2.) Never under-estimate the person you&#39;re talking to. They may just surprise you.</p>

<p>3.) Whatever you think you know - someone else knows something that will challenge you to think even harder. This is an opportunity to hone your thoughts. If the person is supportive you both may come out with a richer understanding of whatever it is you&#39;re discussing.</p>

<p>4.) No, really - <em>be cool</em>. Cooler heads always prevail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sums up how I&#39;ve progressed in my way too.  I understand and accept that I still know very little.  I just ask simple questions, and I engage the right people who are open to it.  The others will have their time.  </p>

<p>We all simply need to be asking the right, down to earth questions of others that they feel themselves but never tackle because it isn&#39;t how they&#39;ve been programmed to play ball.  They just work, eat, sleep and that is &quot;life&quot; for them.</p>

<p>I try and break down those barriers with the info that can&#39;t be denied and pose those questions to for them.  Get them to address them or get them thinking on a topic that they wouldn&#39;t normally think about.</p>

<p>&quot;Team Humanity&quot; is right, and we all need to be supportive of everyone in order to overcome.  That&#39;s why &quot;they&quot; do their best to manipulate and separate people from each other.  Families, racial groups, lower, middle and &quot;upper&quot; class people......we&#39;re all under the same gun.  If we were all united, it would be a hard family to crack.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously if you drew a venn diagram then there would be overlap between someone that does have schizotypy and an otherwise normal individual that is interested in conspiracy theories such as the JFK assassination, which is nothing more than what most consider to be an unsolved historical event much the same way that most white people consider the OJ Simpson verdict incorrect (does questioning the official narrative of that make someone crazy?).  Point being that the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; covers a continuum with normal people at one end and schizotypy at the other.  I get the impression that you have never met someone with schizotypal personality disorder in real life - they are extremely odd and <em>rare</em> individuals.  You would definitely know when talking to a schizotypal individual that there was something wrong with their thought processes regardless of the topic, whereas with a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; that wasn&#39;t schizotypal you would have no idea that they were a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; unless the topic of specific theories came up.  To put this another way, a conspiracy theorist often has to hide his or her beliefs in the workplace, whereas it would be <em>impossible</em> for someone with actual schizotypy to hide their illness.  </p>

<p>Basically, what you are doing is taking the extreme of conspiracy theorists and treating them like the rule instead of the exception.  Its basically the same type of cognitive distortions that racists have.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>being over fifty I can tell you that we (as a generation) have seen tv&#39;s go from black &amp; white to color, the sky go from the deepest blue to silver. we have seen the country be raped over and over by the politicians, and if we don&#39;t speak, it is because we are ashamed. as the sons and daughters of the greatest generation, we the baby-boomers failed to stop the tyranny. we were taught that if we get the right job and make a good living for your family you will respect yourself and everyone else will respect you as well. we were taught shit and kept in the dark, so it is no wander that we are quiet like the mushroom crop of human crap that we are. we did not resist. we let our enemy have our children just like our fathers did. they taught them how to see everything through the eyes of war. war on drugs, war on women, war on the browns, war on the blacks, war on the reds, the fucking blues and for damn sure those stupid fucking whites.</p>

<p>but we are only in our fifties, or forties, or sixties, or what ever age we are. we can change this shit in to something that everyone can be happy with. something that can let the young ones grow up safe and sane in a world that has a common law that holds that the state will not create an atmosphere of war. where there has got to be a victim and there must be damages for a crime to have been committed. a place where lies are not valued and fictions do not exist.</p>

<p>that is the conspiracy that WE should be working on! Fuck what they do. because we are the ones that will sound crazy if we speak without saying that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only have one other friend that&#39;s a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;, and we get into some pretty deep talks.  The only other person I discuss it with regularly is my fiance.  Not sure if she believes everything I say, but she acts interested at least, and that works for me.</p>

<p>Well the other night I had 4 friends over for a fire, and my fellow &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; was there as well and we started discussing our beliefs.  2 of my friends clearly thought we were crazy, and just made a joke of everything we said.  Luckily we&#39;ve been friends since grade school, and I&#39;ve done plenty in the past that probably made them think I was crazy then as well, so to them its no surprise and they don&#39;t hold it against me.  But 1 other friend just sat in silence the entire time we were talking, not really saying anything.  After everyone else left he came up to me with some serious questions/concerns about what we were talking about.  I think all the information we were discussing that night scared him, but at the same time I&#39;m glad I was able to help someone else notice whats going on in the world.  I&#39;ve talked to him a few times since then, and he&#39;s started doing some research on his own.</p>

<p>So the point of my story is, I think its worth it to have some people think your a &quot;conspiracy nut&quot; if it means opening the eye&#39;s of at least one other person.  My personal rule of thumb though is to not discuss these theories with people I don&#39;t already trust (except on this sub-reddit of coarse!). </p>

<p>You have to communicate properly, that means pointing out relevant shit when it&#39;s relevant. No one wants to hear random opinions shot at them constantly. You can only really help by pointing people in the right direction and knowing when the time is.</p>

<p>Over time, pretty much everyone I know is aware that I blame the US and Israel for 9/11, think the Fed is a scam, and consider the government to be a bunch of crooked fucks.</p>

<p>A former insider at the World Bank, ex-Senior Counsel Karen Hudes, says the global financial system is dominated by a small group of corrupt, power-hungry figures centered around the privately owned U.S. Federal Reserve. The network has seized control of the media to cover up its crimes, too, she explained. In an interview with The New American, Hudes said that when she tried to blow the whistle on multiple problems at the World Bank, she was fired for her efforts. Now, along with a network of fellow whistleblowers, Hudes is determined to expose and end the corruption. And she is confident of success. Citing an explosive 2011 Swiss study published in the PLOS ONE journal on the “network of global corporate control,” Hudes pointed out that a small group of entities — mostly financial institutions and especially central banks — exert a massive amount of influence over the international economy from behind the scenes. “What is really going on is that the world’s resources are being dominated by this group,” she explained, adding that the “corrupt power grabbers” have managed to dominate the media as well. “They’re being allowed to do it. - See more at: <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/world-bank-whistleblower-reveals-how-the-global-elite-rule-the-world/5353130#sthash.hDfvgpY4.dpuf">http://www.globalresearch.ca/world-bank-whistleblower-reveals-how-the-global-elite-rule-the-world/5353130#sthash.hDfvgpY4.dpuf</a>
Looking at the state of (post-9/11) America today — the perpetual War on Terror, empire building in the name of “humanitarian regime change” of democratically elected leaders in foreign countries, the Department of Homeland Security and its Transportation Security Administration goon squad, the National Defense Authorization Act and its ability to disappear American citizens suspected of terrorism without due process of law, Obamacare, the National Security Administration’s big brother surveillance state, the militarization of our police in an ever-expanding police state, the common core, the Federal Reserve’s runaway monopoly money printer and a nation hanging on the verge of economic collapse, the crackdown on food freedom. And when revolutionaries like MICHAEL HASTINGS are assassinated like MALCOM X, MLK JR, JFK, RFK, AND TUPAC, it only strengthens the flame yearning for resistance and justice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we do, although the conspiracy circle might be larger than we think. Well, let me backtrack. If someone describes a scenario where the extremely rich and powerful write the laws and control the media, and seek to get more and more power at the expense of the citizenry, using fear tactics and divide-and-conquer strategies, they could get a lot of people to agree with them and they won&#39;t seem insane. It&#39;s when we get into specific things--like false flag attacks or the family lineages of those in power or groups like the Illuminati--that we come off nutty. </p>

<p>In discussing things with people, we can make some judgments about whether some specfic point if actually crucial. Do we really need to convince someone 9/11 was a false flag or is it enough to see if they are already bothered by the way that event was used to treat them like criminals in airports and start the conversation from that agreed-upon point?</p>

<p>of course we are going to look and sound crazy. they have no idea what the truth is, they have never heard it before. but they are all waking up. I have people tell me all the time that they heard someone else talking about the same stuff I talk about. </p>

<p>the solution is education in the truth. so if you got it you need to give it away, and you will find it is not like ten years ago, or longer for me, when they would look at you and laugh while saying &quot;oh, you are a conspiracy theorist&quot;. the term now has legitimacy associated with it. </p>

<p>the truth is still a little bit revolutionary right now. but with 55% to 75% wanting a full out audit of the Fed there is much to give a man hope.</p>

<p>start talking like it is a done deal that people will be brought to justice over the fraud that has been portrayed upon the People.</p>

<p>two standard sales tools are &quot;fear of loss&quot; and &quot;perception of loss&quot;.
the first is used when directly merchandizing a product, they put it into your hands and then remove it, best example is the test drive of a new car.
the second is predominant in advertizing. it is simply keeping up with the Jones&#39;s or well any advertizing targeted at women or the homemaker.</p>

<p>when you speak in a matter of fact way that there is Mercury in the shots, that the USAF is spraying things in our air to cause sterility in men, and that the Gardisil shot will kill their daughter or make her sterile. they then hear it in other places and soon they know it even if the don&#39;t realize they know it.</p>

<p>Racism is being relegated to the trash heap of history because people talked about it. and they did not shut up. when it was one guy and he was black then he was just a pastor of some negro church. but as soon as he started marching and people fell in behind him, Brother Martin held the attention of not just a nation, but the whole world.</p>

<p>you confront ignorance with education on any subject, and ignorance will always end up giving ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A former insider at the World Bank, ex-Senior Counsel Karen Hudes, says the global financial system is dominated by a small group of corrupt, power-hungry figures centered around the privately owned U.S. Federal Reserve. The network has seized control of the media to cover up its crimes, too, she explained. In an interview with The New American, Hudes said that when she tried to blow the whistle on multiple problems at the World Bank, she was fired for her efforts. Now, along with a network of fellow whistleblowers, Hudes is determined to expose and end the corruption. And she is confident of success. Citing an explosive 2011 Swiss study published in the PLOS ONE journal on the “network of global corporate control,” Hudes pointed out that a small group of entities — mostly financial institutions and especially central banks — exert a massive amount of influence over the international economy from behind the scenes. “What is really going on is that the world’s resources are being dominated by this group,” she explained, adding that the “corrupt power grabbers” have managed to dominate the media as well. “They’re being allowed to do it. - See more at: <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/world-bank-whistleblower-reveals-how-the-global-elite-rule-the-world/5353130#sthash.hDfvgpY4.dpuf">http://www.globalresearch.ca/world-bank-whistleblower-reveals-how-the-global-elite-rule-the-world/5353130#sthash.hDfvgpY4.dpuf</a>
Looking at the state of (post-9/11) America today — the perpetual War on Terror, empire building in the name of “humanitarian regime change” of democratically elected leaders in foreign countries, the Department of Homeland Security and its Transportation Security Administration goon squad, the National Defense Authorization Act and its ability to disappear American citizens suspected of terrorism without due process of law, Obamacare, the National Security Administration’s big brother surveillance state, the militarization of our police in an ever-expanding police state, the common core, the Federal Reserve’s runaway monopoly money printer and a nation hanging on the verge of economic collapse, the crackdown on food freedom. And when revolutionaries like MICHAEL HASTINGS are assassinated like MALCOM X, MLK JR, JFK, RFK, AND TUPAC, it only strengthens the flame yearning for resistance and justice.</p>
