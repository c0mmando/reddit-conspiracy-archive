    <div class="md"><p>There is a teapot in orbit somewhere between the earth and mars. A very special teapot. Now this teapot doesn&#39;t like to be viewed you see, and will cloak itself if you attempt to find it. But it is very real. This teapot revealed himself to me, only me, and instructed me to spread awareness of its existence.</p>

<p>Instead of waiting for someone else to provide proof, I challenge you to go out of your way to try and disprove it. I&#39;m sorry for everyone with this mentality, and I pray that someday the truth (about the teapot) will be so clear that it won&#39;t be this easily tossed away.</p>

<p>There. You see that? You see how ridiculous that sounds? Yet my ridiculous story about a made-up teapot is just as disprovable as Jesus dying for our &quot;sins&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greek mythology and Nordic religions are infinitely more fascinating.  The bible is a collection of books written and re-written (5 main authors can be identified in the first 5 books read Armstrong&#39;s &quot;A history of God&quot;) to fit the early Hebrews beliefs at the time to suite the priest caste and keep them in power.  The polytheistic Hebrews adapted most of their legends from other writings and civilizations that they conquered in their bible and eventually the cult of Yaweh, the god of war, won out over the other gods such as the god of fertility Baal or the god of the mountain, el shadai.</p>

<p>The idea of hell/afterlife as a fiery inferno isn&#39;t real and only came about in the early middle ages as a form of priest caste keeping power.  Circumcision has clearly been written about as a method to control male sexuality by lessening sexual pleasure by influential Jewish scholars (as we know, many of the Jewish practices lived in on Christianity today).  Lucifer/Satan has several different meanings from a star in the sky to the generic human &quot;accuser&quot;.  The gnostic writings, the gospel of peter (popular in the middle ages), the story of bel and the dragon, and many other highly influential and important early Christian writings have been completely forgotten.</p>

<p>I am a former Evangelical Christian who was brainwashed for nearly 25 years before managing to break free and learn the truth as best we know it after I completely read the bible, pondered the paradox of an all loving and all powerful god allowing a place such as hell to exist, and eventually reading works from biblical scholars .  I truly pity those who will never be able to break free as I have due to their weak minds being afraid of the truth or from never having the curiosity/desire to actually learn about Christianity and instead preferring to be spoon fed lies from an authority figure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It shows the power and influence that the Jews had even back Two Thousand years ago by the simple fact that two of the world biggest religions (Christianity and Islam) use their holy book with some modifications.</p>

<p>There was a &quot;Ancient israel lobby&quot; in 1st century BC Rome, they exported gold from the Roman provinces to Jerusalem in a huge money laundering scheme, their Great Temple was basically a Central Bank, Vespasian and Titus built the Colosseum with the gold they looted from the destroyed Jerusalem Temple after the Jewish Revolt of 70 AD:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum#History">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum#History</a></p>

<p><em>Construction of the Colosseum began under the rule of the Emperor Vespasian[5] in around 70–72 AD, funded by the spoils taken from the Jewish Temple after the Siege of Jerusalem.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero:">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero:</a></p>

<p><strong>Cicero Pro Flacco</strong></p>

<p><em>The hatefulness of the Jewish gold now follows. Surely this is the reason that this case is being tired not far from the Aurelian steps. For the sake of the crime, this place and this crowd, Laelius, was sought by you. You know how large this band is and how close and how powerful they are in assemblies. So, I will proceed with a quiet voice, so that (only) judges may hear. Indeed, there is no lack of those who would incite them against me and anyone respectable. I will not help those men to do this more easily.</em></p>

<p><em>When it was accustomed that gold was sent to Jerusalem each year from Italy and from all the other provinces by the authority of the Jews, Flaccus forbid by edict for this gold to be exported from Asia. Who, judges, is there who would not truly praise this deed? In fact, the senate during my consulship vehemently and frequently in the past determined that gold ought not to be exported.</em></p>

<p>Q: Is this because Christians teach that individuals should be under the control of a God who is holy? Or should I say, one who judges right and wrong?</p>

<p>A: Christianity is about idolising a human called Jesus of Nazareth first, which is an abomination.
Christians teach what they have been told to teach by the ones they oppose.
I can tell you who the 4 individuals were who wrote the Hebrew old testament and the exact date, if it suited me.
Same about your new testament which was gathered by 6 people from 2 different areas.</p>

<p>Q: &quot;Are there any non-corrupted parts of the bible and if what bible version would you suggest?&quot;</p>

<p>A: &quot;No. As with all Sacred Texts, they have been distorted from the original information that was given with each translation. Though again, as with all Sacred Texts, there is still much truth hidden within them. Much of it being &#39;metaphorical&#39;. If you can find pre King James versions, that is the closest you will get. Good luck with that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls has proved conclusively that the OT text has not changed since Jesus quoted it personally.  Proving, whatever Constantine et.al. created, they did not change the text of the OT.<br/>
Regarding the NT, we have around 6000 manuscript fragments that are over 1000 years old, and some around 1900 years old.  All these fragments agree with each other 99.5% of the time.  This proves the selected texts that are included in the NT have not changed either.</p>

<p>Absolutely it&#39;s true that some people use religion to manipulate other people.  So far, those manipulators have not significantly changed the text itself of the bible.</p>

<p>Therefore if somebody comes to you and says &quot;look at this archeological evidence that demonstrated that ancient Hebrews practiced paganism&quot; then you can actually go to the bible and corroborate that evidence.  For example Ezekiel 8 (and hundreds of other places) actually do talk about the leaders of the ancient Hebrews practicing paganism.  </p>

<p>Of course, you also read in the bible that that practice directly caused the destruction of their nation more than once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible is God telling humanity his eternal truth and allowing us to know who he is. Through the death of his son we have become reconciled with him. By seeking him out and accepting his son we have become a part of the family. It is a personal relationship and let me tell you it is well worth it to become a friend and child of the creator of all that is. You&#39;ll know he&#39;s real, he makes himself known to you. It&#39;s a personal relationship with God. He lets you in on his creation and he loves you. You&#39;re no longer exiled, you have a place to go with all of your problems, worries, concerns, hopes, dreams, ambitions or if you just want someone to talk to. This is honestly the worst thing that can happen to you if you accept the reality of God:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a teapot in orbit somewhere between the earth and mars. A very special teapot. Now this teapot doesn&#39;t like to be viewed you see, and will cloak itself if you attempt to find it. But it is very real. This teapot revealed himself to me, only me, and instructed me to spread awareness of its existence.</p>

<p>Instead of waiting for someone else to provide proof, I challenge you to go out of your way to try and disprove it. I&#39;m sorry for everyone with this mentality, and I pray that someday the truth (about the teapot) will be so clear that it won&#39;t be this easily tossed away.</p>

<p>There. You see that? You see how ridiculous that sounds? Yet my ridiculous story about a made-up teapot is just as disprovable as Jesus dying for our &quot;sins&quot;.</p>
