    <div class="md"><p>This may sound kind of obvious and dumb, but it&#39;s just a suggestion.. have you ever tried talking to the construction workers or the man with a bluetooth to ask what they are building? I&#39;m pretty sure you won&#39;t be the first one but I think by doing that you can analyze your conversation to see if they are lying etc and to see if what they are doing are in fact suspicious. If you work there it isn&#39;t unordinary for you to be curious. or do you think that this a bad idea?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last I checked, that 100+ miles to the gallon car used the fuel&#39;s vapours to feed the engine. As opposed to spraying a mist of fuel droplets into the combustion chambers as all our cars do. You can see that vapour yourself when observing the fuel from the right angle. Poor a small quantity of the stuff into a glass and hold it up at eye level. It sort of looks like heat waves above a road in the distance. It&#39;s all wobbly like. That&#39;s the stuff you want to set on fire. By virtue of being a vapour mixed with normal air, the air fuel mixture is almost perfect right off the bat. On the other hand, a fuel droplet, no matter how tiny, is still in a liquid state and that&#39;s very hard to ignite. What you&#39;ll get will be wasteful. You&#39;ll never get to ignite all of it. I&#39;ll go out on a limb and state that using the vapour itself is <em>immensely</em> more efficient.  </p>

<p>... and that&#39;s all I have to say about that. </p>

<p>This is consistent with the construction of a high-security &quot;strongroom&quot; such as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_Compartmented_Information_Facility">SCIF</a>. Mr. Bluetooth is probably ensuring that only contractors with security clearance high enough for the job go into the room itself. I&#39;d speculate that it&#39;s some kind of &quot;operations room&quot;, but that could mean anything from airport security to regional disaster response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I dont know the definition of troll is.  But I would think this guy was attempting to make this subreddit look stupid. which didnt happen cause his story was just too normal and had no real &#39;traps&#39; in it. &#39;Hey I work at an airport and have a question bout this construction&#39;  What followed was a open polite comment section  both critical and supportive. Giving opinions like &#39;hey there is a push to get TSA armed, maybe this has something to do with it&#39; or &#39;Just ask&#39; or &#39;I call bullshit&#39;. </p>

<p>I dont know, I just think that this was stupid.  This subreddit does upvote personal stories and questions out of respect; I think not because we 100% take personal stories on here as proof of something, but just because open dialog is what matters. </p>

<p>I think if he said he had photographic proof of 9/11 and we all jumped on board and to later he zoomed out on the picture and it was a dick. That would be a correct troll. </p>

<p>I was just thinking about these camps, then started thinking about what <strong>Bill Cooper mentioned in his book &quot;Behold A Pale Horse&quot;. He said that prior to WWIII breaking out, people would be told to go to their closest Postal Office</strong> to receive their orders about where they would be going to work for the war movement. He said that husbands and wives wouldn&#39;t necessarily be sent to the same factory or work location, so they would be placed on separate buses/shuttles and be sent to the camps.</p>

<p>I find this significant since several post offices are closing now due to down sizing and the economy. His warning seems as though it makes more sense now. It would be really easy to use abandoned post offices for other government purposes such as this.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What in the hell makes you think a plan for arming airport security is not possible? Why are you so perturbed?</p>

<p>They sometimes use the national guard to man checkpoints at airports. It&#39;s happened before. It is extremely plausible that airport security will be armed and thus have an &quot;armory&quot; so as to check in and check out weapons in a secure environment. It is not only plausible, but very likely in the very near future.</p>

<p>Whether the OP&#39;s story is true or not (I think it&#39;s bullshit) does not have any bearing on the fact that this is possible, so you need to turn it back from 11 and calm down.</p>

<p>This pretty much sums up the obedient non-thinking public mass. Nearly 70% believed it was likely that ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was <strong>personally</strong> involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. </p>

<p>Oh, and did I mention that the theory even though belived by 70% of your great country, held little to no <strong>factual</strong> evidence. The same reason Osama Bin Laden was never tied to 9/11 <strong>oficially</strong>(only through legal manipulation).</p>

<p>So if you are caught up in the illusions, you obviously wont see through them, right? Your whole knowledge base is corrupt, do you understand? We&#39;ve all been lied to, misled, manipulated and brainwashed through our lives, intentionally or unintentionally. Newsreaders, advertisers, parents, teachers, politicians, celebritys, religious leaders, cartoons, hollywood movies, friends and foes. </p>

<p>The world is the way it is because of our collective thoughts about it. Few people are aware we shape the universe though collective counciousness(experienced individually), and they want to keep it that way. Symbols have power because we give them power. So take a real good look before deciding what symbols to give power!</p>

<p>And the sooner we wake up, the sooner we can start shaping our own planet, hopefully in the direction of peace, love and understanding, and not &quot;arabs did 9/11&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing insane about airport security possibly having an armory. Do you even know what an armory is? It&#39;s as simple as a room reserved for securing weapons, even just a few handguns. The term armory doesn&#39;t mean &quot;army vault of super weapons&quot;.</p>

<p>As already noted, some airports in the world already have airport security that is armed.. and guess what? They have armories, so they can check out and then later return said weapons from a secure room.</p>

<p>This is what you think is &quot;insane&quot; and &quot;unbelievable&quot;. What kind of world do you live in where this is &quot;insane&quot;?</p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t want armed security at our nation&#39;s airports, I think that <em>would</em> be insane, but the theoretical possibility of it actually happening is very &#39;sane&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in the infantry, I am well aware of what an armory is. My point is that it wouldn&#39;t require any special security during construction because there would be no arms in it, additionally there are currently no airports with Armed guards, and none planned, therefore building an armory would be sort of dumb, No? </p>

<p>There is no evidence even vaguely hinting at it being an armory, there is however evidence against it, and yet my comment above has - 5.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are being unbelievably dramatic. First of all, not &quot;everyone&quot; thinks it&#39;s an armory. One person made a <em>very clear</em> hypothetical and people responded in hypothetical that <em>&quot;Yes, it&#39;s possible.&quot;</em></p>

<p>I for one believe it is a very real possibility, and by no means crazy. However, I don&#39;t think this because of OP&#39;s post. You are taking everything way out of context.</p>

<p>As for your argument that there are &quot;no plans&quot; for arming TSA or anything.. not yet. But as already said somewhere in the comments here, it wouldn&#39;t be something that takes very long. They will announce that they are doing it, and then it will be done. Make no mistake that plans are already drafted, and if they are seriously considering arming airports, they will have logistics squared away before they even consider announcing it to the public.</p>
