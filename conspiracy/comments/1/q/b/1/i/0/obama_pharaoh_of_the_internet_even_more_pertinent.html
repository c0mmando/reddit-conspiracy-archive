        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s an excerpt: &quot;RB: The instructions seemed very specific. Infiltrate web forums, collect screen names, avatars, and posters’ tag lines, and attempt to resolve these to their actual identities. I read one paragraph that listed circumstances when the “asset” was only to monitor but do not disrupt without authorization. There was another section titled “Divert, Disrupt and Destroy,” listing “how to’s” in certain cases.</p>

<p>There was also a section on maintaining a social media presence, and another on the most effective use of Twitter.</p>

<p>Lastly, there was a “reference section,” which included statistics, specific language to use to marginalize different posters, and effective methods to discredit people while maintaining a sense of legitimacy.</p>

<p>It was surreal, to say the least.</p>

<p>Oh, one more thing that’s important. As I said, these “kids,” or young people I believe, are known collectively as “Cyber-Warriors for Obama.” The subheading was “And the truth shall set you free.” Truth? Really? They were hired on their hacking abilities, or more precisely on their abilities to make postings through proxy servers and effectively use alternate identities and multiple e-mail addresses. Their purpose is to spread disinformation, not truth.</p>

<p>There were also motivational statements on various pages, including one that referred to Obama as the “Pharaoh of the Internet,” which I thought was an odd characterization.</p>

<p>But what’s important is that suddenly, through the use of Internet aliases, multiple e-mail addresses, and screen names, a project that employs 3,575 people will have the appearance and effectiveness of maybe 10,000 or more different people.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>now the questions:
if this is true, and I see no reason to disbelieve this story, are they on Reddit? </p>

<p>some might ask if they are mods of the other subs.</p>

<p>if they are on here wouldn&#39;t this thread be bombarded with shill/troll posts?</p>

<p>I know there are many question, but can redditors post interactions with these shills/trolls. one would think that we could do that to bring out the user names.</p>

<p>can we reverse the op on them, and if so let&#39;s.</p>

<p>now I am not talking about someone that disagrees with you, but one that does so without sense. that seems they have nothing but a failed talking point.</p>

<p>so the hunt is on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;You&#39;re a traitor!&#39; yelled the boy. &#39;You&#39;re a thought-criminal! You&#39;re a Eurasian spy! I&#39;ll shoot you, I&#39;ll vaporize you, I&#39;ll send you to the salt mines!&#39;</p>

<p>Suddenly they were both leaping round him, shouting &#39;Traitor!&#39; and &#39;Thought-criminal!&#39; the little girl imitating her brother in every movement. 
It was somehow slightly frightening, like the gambolling of tiger cubs which will soon grow up into man-eaters. There was a sort of calculating ferocity in the boy&#39;s eye, a quite evident desire to hit or kick Winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so. It was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding, Winston thought.
Mrs Parsons&#39; eyes flitted nervously from Winston to the children, and back again. </p>

<p>&#39;They do get so noisy,&#39; she said. &#39;They&#39;re disappointed because they couldn&#39;t go to see the hanging, that&#39;s what it is. I&#39;m too busy to take them. and Tom won&#39;t be back from work in time.&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;Why can&#39;t we go and see the hanging?&#39; roared the boy in his huge voice. &#39;Want to see the hanging! Want to see the hanging!&#39; chanted the little girl, still capering round.</p>
