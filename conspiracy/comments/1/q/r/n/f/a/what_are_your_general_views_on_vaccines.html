<p>It&#39;s also hard to trust any medicine where the government stepped in and said we&#39;re going to cap malpractice damages at $250,000...</p>

<p>I believe in the concept of vaccination, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re even nearly as safe and effective as we&#39;ve been brought to believe.  We believe it because of a constant drumbeat, not because of the hard science.  As soon as you read the hard science, you start to get scared and pull a wtf face.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Generally quite bad. It&#39;s not that they don&#39;t work, but the side effects are quite damaging (permanently in most cases) to your immune system.</p>

<p>This is because of the adjuvants they need to add to the vaccines (in addition to any intentional conspiratorial damage) in order for the immune system to properly &quot;take&quot; the vaccine.</p>

<p>Just look at the actual ingredients in vaccines, they don&#39;t use as much mercury as they used to, but they still do use it, in addition to TONS of other chemicals that go straight into the bloodstream, and do serious long term immune damage. Thus making even more vaccines necessary and by extension even more damage to your immune system.</p>

<p>Also, it is a well known fact that millions of vaccines in the 50s and 60s (polio) were intentionally tainted with cancer causes viruses, which is one major factor among many that has lead to our current cancer epidemic.</p>

<p>If they intentionally put cancer causing viruses in vaccines in the 50s and 60s, what do you think they&#39;re putting in them now?</p>

<p>For all those claiming vaccines don&#39;t cause autism, look up autism rates amongst the Amish. Close to zero. </p>

<p>The vaccines are intentionally tainted/sabatoged, as if they weren&#39;t bad enough already.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not 100% court proven type of evidence, but it&#39;s pretty solid nonetheless.</p>

<p>Just because the towers on 9/11 fell at almost freefall speeds and it certainly LOOKED like a controlled demolition doesn&#39;t mean of course that it was. It just warrants further investigation into the matter (an investigation that the 9/11 commission and NIST refused to do, rather instead opting to make up their own science with the conclusion in mind ahead of time).</p>

<p>The point is -- correlation doesn&#39;t outright prove anything, but it certainly warrants further investigation into the issue, particularly when autism rates amongst communities that are not vaccinated are consistently lower than those that are vaccinated. It would be one thing if this was region/race specific, but it&#39;s not, at least not particularly.</p>

<p>Anyways, onto what you asked for:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting that you&#39;re actually using evidence to justify your claims. It was more than I expected, however, if all you are claiming is that correlation warrants investigation, then I agree. Obviously though, your original post did not say just that, and though it is possible that I misinterpreted it, you totally changed views right now.</p>

<p>The paper you brought up was interesting, but irrelevant. In literally the first line of the abstract, it mentions that it is still a mystery that autism rates are rising. Now yes, I&#39;m all for investigation, but you need proof for your claims instead of just &quot;well this might be true.&quot; There have been numerous studies that have disproven the claim that vaccines cause autism, and although correlation warrants a little more studying, you have virtually no argument.</p>

<p>No, I just articulated what I had mentioned beforehand.</p>

<p>Obviously when speaking in scientific terms, you can&#39;t outright claim something to be 100% true when you are still researching it, so of course they are going to claim it to &quot;be a mystery&quot;. I fail to see how the paper is irrelevant because it claims the disease is still a mystery. That&#39;s like saying that a thousand studies linking cancer and smoking are irrelevant because officially cancer is still a mystery. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now yes, I&#39;m all for investigation, but you need proof for your claims instead of just &quot;well this might be true.&quot;</p>

<p>There are more links I can provide you with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There have been numerous studies that have disproven the claim that vaccines cause autism, and although correlation warrants a little more studying, you have virtually no argument.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can disprove certain claims for why/how/if vaccines cause autism, but considering the increasing number of studies showing correlation, I do not see how studies done 5 10 15 years ago on the correlation are as relevant as you may think they are as the investigative channels/what they are studying as far as the link are becoming more complex/intricate. </p>

<p>In other words, as autism is becoming better understood, so is the research linking vaccines to autism (it&#39;s becoming more intricate I mean). The studies that disprove the link are still valid to a degree, just less so now that more is known about both the disease, and how vaccines react in the body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines are a nice idea in theory, but they have drawbacks which the original creators of the vaccines never foresaw.</p>

<p>For one, they trigger serious auto-immune diseases. They probably account for the massive increase in asthma, allergies and more deadly auto-immune diseases that we have seen in recent decades.</p>

<p>When you fuck with how the body defends itself against invading pathogens, you have to expect the body to react. Life is not static -- it reacts to changing conditions. That&#39;s why antibiotics,  once so powerful against bacteria, are now worthless in many cases. Life reacts, and it compensates.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it is wise to give anyone any vaccination at present. Certainly, those that do not combat life-threatening  diseases should be immediately discontinued. Flu vaccines, for example. But even vaccines for more serious diseases are of  questionable benefit in our modern, hygenic society. I wouldn&#39;t even consider giving vaccinations to an infant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, effectiveness of vaccines is a general topic. Generally, for something to be approved as a vaccine, it has to be proven effective. Nonetheless, I will provide evaluations for what you are asking.</p>

<p>Flu vaccine:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flu? Not a mortality study. Cochrane proves that flu vax does not influence mortality.</p>

<p>&quot;Vaccine use did not affect the number of people hospitalised or working days lost&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD001269/vaccines-to-prevent-influenza-in-healthy-adults#sthash.m4W3QYmN.dpuf">http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD001269/vaccines-to-prevent-influenza-in-healthy-adults#sthash.m4W3QYmN.dpuf</a></p>

<p>Polio? Epidemiology studies. Not RCT&#39;s. Any RCT&#39;s you could possibly offer about polio would be 3rd world countries.</p>

<p>Measles? 3rd world studies. No one dies from measles in the first world. And there are no double-blind long-term RCTs in the first-world to prove otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, we weren&#39;t talking about whether it influenced mortality. I was demonstrating the effectiveness of the vaccines which was the original discussion. Now if you want to try and change the subject while ignoring all opposing facts, then I don&#39;t want to continue discussing this.

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on which ones, but for the most part I do not consent to them. Some can be harmful, some are fucking useless, hell- some really can help you.</p>

<p>The only fact I need to know is that they can be harmful and have been documented at times that vaccines have done the very opposite of what they are intended for. </p>

<p>The real problem is even trusting them at all if you know where they are manufactured from and by who; especially if a &quot;crisis&quot; were to break out, and a certain vaccine was introduced as a solution... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines have transformed the world.  They&#39;re one of the most amazing applications in modern medicine.</p>

<p>That said, we probably should be discerning about what we put in our bodies. Vaccines are big business and Doctors DON&#39;T always know best.  The adjuvants currently used aren&#39;t as bad as they were ten years ago, but we were/are probably injecting too much stuff in our kids.</p>

<p>MMR is important.  Herd immunization does help shelter people who CAN&#39;T get vaccinated.  The fact that we&#39;ve eradicated certain diseases with vaccines and are on the way towards driving others extinct is amazing.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re working in a hospital or a preschool or a senior home, you should get the flu vaccine, otherwise, why bother?  Your chance of getting flu isn&#39;t that high and it&#39;s not horrible if you&#39;re healthy.  Flu vaccines are not worth it for the majority of people.  But if done of us were vaccinated, we would all have a higher probability of getting sick, so it&#39;s one of those things that may be important for siciety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cochrane collaboration, the gold standard of evidence based medicine has looked at every flu vax study and concluded that flu vax is useless and causes harm... And that those results are optimistic at best.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>vaccine use did not affect the number of people hospitalised or working days lost but caused one case of Guillian-Barré syndrome (a major neurological condition leading to paralysis) for every one million vaccinations. Fifteen of the 36 trials were funded by vaccine companies and four had no funding declaration. Our results may be an optimistic estimate because company-sponsored influenza vaccines trials tend to produce results favorable to their products and some of the evidence comes from trials carried out in ideal viral circulation and matching conditions and because the harms evidence base is limited.</p>

<p>“Scientific societies are as yet in their infancy … It is to be expected that advances in physiology and psychology will give governments much more control over individual mentality than they now have even in totalitarian countries. Fichte laid it down that education should aim at destroying free will, so that, after pupils have left school, they shall be incapable, throughout the rest of their lives, of thinking or acting otherwise than as their schoolmasters would have wished. DIET, INJECTIONS AND INJUNCTIONS will combine, from a very early age, to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable, and any serious criticisms of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible …</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting that you&#39;re actually using evidence to justify your claims. It was more than I expected, however, if all you are claiming is that correlation warrants investigation, then I agree. Obviously though, your original post did not say just that, and though it is possible that I misinterpreted it, you totally changed views right now.</p>

<p>The paper you brought up was interesting, but irrelevant. In literally the first line of the abstract, it mentions that it is still a mystery that autism rates are rising. Now yes, I&#39;m all for investigation, but you need proof for your claims instead of just &quot;well this might be true.&quot; There have been numerous studies that have disproven the claim that vaccines cause autism, and although correlation warrants a little more studying, you have virtually no argument.</p>
