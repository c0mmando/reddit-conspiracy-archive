<p>Another big one is that the mafia did it.</p>

<p>Truth is, it was like the assassination of Caesar: everyone agreed to have a hand in it, so no one could escape blame. It was a phenomenol collaboration where everyone had dirt on everyone else.</p>

<p>Of course, the CIA and military industrial complex and oil men are still in power, so let&#39;s blame the guys that are petty much out of the picture; LBJ, The Soviet Union, Carlos Marcello.</p>

<p>Limited handouts everywhere.  What a cynical scam.  It&#39;s immoral how much they keep continually killing Kennedy, over and over again with their bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One bullet might cause 7 wounds, but it won&#39;t remain in the only minimal damaged condition of CE399. The bullet had allegedley pulverized a rib and crushed a wrist.</p>

<p>The single bullet had: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>no thread striations on it (fine lines which a copper encased bullet tip will get when it penetrates clothing threads)</p></li>
<li><p>no blood, tissue or clothing marks on it</p></li>

<p>Here a video which shows the bullet&#39;s condition and the condition of some bullets which were fired in <em>recreated scenarios</em>:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You offer no evidence other than people claiming they shoot a lot, then when someone goes and scientifically recreates the shot and proves it could happen, you dismiss it as lies. I&#39;m all for being skeptical of the official story but when there is science to back it you you have to be a fool to continue to argue without any evidence.

    <div class="md"><p>So you link to a Reddit post that shows only one angle of the &quot;magic bullet&quot; from which it looks relatively undeformed. But your comment on that post links to a Wikipedia article that I think you should read again. Mostly look at the pictures, there is one of the bullet from its base, that shows it is flattened on one side quite severely. 
Plus I&#39;ve seen bullets hit dirt that were more deformed than the bullet that hit a cadaver&#39;s wrist, so by your logic that picture is a conspiracy. But really the the reason for the difference in deformity is the angle and speed of impact not magic or conspiracy.</p>

<p>So the bullets fired into a cadaver wrist and into a goat&#39;s rib show much more damage than the magic bullet that supposedly went through many more layers of flesh and bone and clothing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not more deformed just deformed differently, like I said before the picture that you&#39;re linking to doesn&#39;t show the deformed side of the &quot;magic bullet&quot;, the side of the bullet that is now flat. And since the bullet in that picture were all fired at different targets from different angles it makes since that they are deformed in different manners. I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and guess that you didn&#39;t even watch the Discovery Channel documentary where they recreated the shot almost exactly and the bullet ended up looking just like the original. And If you think that it&#39;s all lies, go and try it yourself in front of a camera. If you get different results then maybe your onto something. But otherwise saying a different test came up with different results is entirely meaningless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;magic bullet&quot; did indeed get deflected from its course. And your argument here is specious.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure there is <em>some</em> chance of it going more or less straight. Besides, we don&#39;t need to posit a straight line through all Kennedy and Connally&#39;s wounds, since in the re-creation (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSBXW1-VGmM#t=225">here</a>) it&#39;s not like they had exact wound locations, or perfect models of Kennedy and Connally&#39;s bodies. It just shows that the wounds are entirely consistent with a single bullet- no crazy u-turns or things like that. To first order, it&#39;s what you&#39;d <em>expect</em> a bullet shot at that angle to do.</p>

<p>Let me put it this way: I would never willingly trade places with Connally in that scenario, saying &quot;oh it&#39;s okay, the bullet won&#39;t hit me, it&#39;ll tumble and curve out of the way.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sir, it&#39;s a copper jacketed lead core bullet.  Not even the nose was deformed in any real way.  That IS impossible.  I do a lot for shooting, and that is not what bullets do after going through multiple targets.  What you&#39;re also saying is that it was able to carve a straight line even going through multiple targets as well.  No deflection whatsoever.  That is impossible paired with zero damage to the bullet itself.</p>

<p>A bullet going through skin experiences the same resistance as going through 4 inches of muscle.  We are not made of putty.  Our natural &quot;armour&quot; so to speak, does have an impact on those projectiles.</p>

<p>They simply drew a perfectly straight line to support their idea, which cannot happen.  The bullet MUST react to the media it goes through.  It basically didn&#39;t flinch as it traveled or even shed its jacket.</p>

<p>They didnâ€™t have super bullets in 1963 and they don&#39;t now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wUfmxg7xM44/TEn5v8LVLBI/AAAAAAAAAJg/Y1ZgOIeVGF8/s400/magicbullet.jpg">This bullet?</a> is not warped in any way.  What you&#39;re seeing is the rifling cuts on the jacket of the bullet, which is normal.  That&#39;s how they spin, right?  I have seen and recovered my own bullets many, many times and never have they or do every come out as pristine as this one.  Not after hitting, SOMETHING.  There is almost ZERO damage to the nose of that bullet.</p>

<p>Something to consider is, that bullet is OLD technology too.  They used horrible round nose bullets unlike today which are more streamlined and such for that penetration.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meplat">The meplat</a> of that bullet means it will crash into its target and expose much more of the surface area of the bullet on its target.  Meaning it will transfer MORE energy sooner, rather than penetrating and pushing through before shedding jacket, core, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Remember how physics works?  Newtons 3rd law.  An object that exerts a force on a second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first.  <a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/physics/courses/physics101/repository/files/lectures-fall-2012-physics-101/Lec4G.pdf">Called action-reaction.</a> That bullet MUST show some kind of damage for it to be take seriously in any way.  If that bullet penetrated bodies, it would show something.  It shows nothing other than how many cuts the rifling was produced with.</p>

<p>Just to give everyone a quick refresher on the subject.  Even I needed to read it again to get it straight and think on it properly.</p>

<p>Again, Kennedy&#39;s head went back and to the left.....an impact from the front, NOT the rear can make that happen ONLY.  If I smack you in the noggin, from the front (go ahead and give yourself a smack on the side of the head) see if your head goes forward or backward.  It would be like a bad star trek fight scene, where the guy punches from the right, and the bad guy flies off to HIS left, the same direction as the punch?  That kind of stupidity.</p>

<p>Can people really believe a bullet from the rear will cause Kennedy&#39;s head to move in the same direction that the force came from?</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t cite Penn and Tellers shooting of a watermelon as an example.  They are showmen, TV personalities......not scientists demonstrating how physics works in comparable situations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You chose a black and white photo which shows shadows and light reflecting off the bullet to show &quot;warping&quot;.  I chose a color image close up.  The bottom on yours looks like it got crushed slightly somehow and on top of that, that bullet was found where again?  On a stretcher in the hospital.  Where do you think it went after it was fired?  Out onto the street or hitched a ride in someones pocket only to jump out later?</p>

<p>As for your opinion on what a bullet would do to &quot;fuck up the brain&quot; is all expected, and you don&#39;t need to talk about it.  Don&#39;t let that cloud the FACTS. That is all said and done and not in dispute.  Your thoughts on that prove NOTHING at all.  Transferring &quot;as much energy as you might expect&quot; and talking about &quot;jets&quot; this and that is terribly subjective.  Yeah, the bullet goes IN and stuff comes OUT, not surprised!   You&#39;re right!  Fantastic, good for you.  That bullet won&#39;t come through that process without nary a scratch.  Be as dramatic as you like about the description you picture in your imagination, but it doesn&#39;t change a thing.  If you think that bullets go through bone and skin and STILL come out like that, even if your idea on it being &quot;warped&quot; was true.......I have some awesome land in Florida for you to build your dream home on.  Real cheap.</p>

<p>Stay on target here Luke.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re only talking about your opinion.  The bullet is the truth.  The damage is the proof, or lack of damage.  The bullet is still almost entirely intact!  No deformation of the nose of the bullet.</p>

<p>Then you go ahead and use Penn and Teller&#39;s BS video as more proof?  That&#39;s friggin ridiculous.</p>

<p>Man, did you hit yourself in the head with your hand and actually have your head bounce back toward your hand again?  Or did you have to use the muscles in your neck to move your head forward again?  This is not rocket surgery.</p>

<p>You are clouding the facts with your opinion and imagination.  Good luck out there Sir, keep debating amongst yourself if you like.  Maybe you&#39;ll convince yourself even more.</p>

<p>Kicker is, earlier in the show they had one of the attending physicians on. When Morgan asked what he noticed about the body, the Dr. clearly said and physically demonstrated that the exit wound he witnessed was in the back right of the president&#39;s skull (just like the picture we&#39;ve all seen of the doctors concurring with an exit wound in the lower back right side.) Which alone completely invalidates the warren commission and the official story. </p>

Every kid who shot a .22 knew this - back in the day that was almost every kid. Directly after that event it became common knowledge that bullets hit things all the time and stay pristine.

<p>Fast forward to 2001.</p>

<p>September 11. Physics for the universe changes forever on that day. Before that event it was common knowledge that skyscrapers didnÂ´t just crumble to the ground within their own footprint unless specifically forced to do so. Directly after that event it became common knowledge that this happens all the time, and that it is actually no anomaly that 3 very tall buildings all fell into their footprints on one day as a result of 2 planes hitting only 2 of the buildings. Long, drawn out explanations by really smart scientists easily explain how all observation up to that point in history were actually insufficient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You offer no evidence other than people claiming they shoot a lot, then when someone goes and scientifically recreates the shot and proves it could happen, you dismiss it as lies. I&#39;m all for being skeptical of the official story but when there is science to back it you you have to be a fool to continue to argue without any evidence. And in doing so you make the rest of us look like idiots.</p>
