<p>Anyways, they have been giving this car so much shit about existing, questioning its sales etc, and now that its doing great, its starts &quot;catching on fire?&quot; IMO the right people are being paid to get the Tesla off the streets and keep getting the general public to purchase &quot;SAFER&quot; cars(non Tesla vehicles)  Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Items are made well below guidelines and only when a sufficient number of failures can be attributed to the manufacturer do they improve quality, and even then it&#39;s only by the <em>barest</em> possible minimum.  If there are more failures that may cost them money they will increase quality by a hair, the very least amount they can get away with.  This is repeated until such time as failure and profit reach an equitable balance.  Health and safety only factor in as a relation to profit margins.</p>

<p>If people want these cars, they should simply start paying for and driving the damn things.  The designer or whoever could take orders via Kickstarter or something similar; and if they&#39;ve produced a prototype, then they can presumably build other single units.</p>

<p>Also, do not come back to me, bleating about &quot;safety,&quot; or any of that other bureaucratic rubbish.  I do not care, and neither, in truth, do the people who made said laws in the first place.  It is all just more excuses that the various rackets make in order to defend themselves, and prevent disruptive technologies from getting into the hands of the public.</p>

<p>Whenever we can not have anything worth having, &quot;safety,&quot; or &quot;protection,&quot; are always what the governmental or corporate psychopaths resort to as a reason why.  It is an appeal to cowardice, and because most of you <strong><em>are</em></strong> cowards, and also steadfastly refuse to think, you accept anything that said &quot;authorities,&quot; say, purely because they are the ones saying it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between thinking that you need to go to an existing venture capitalist, in order to raise money to take <strong><em>multiple</em></strong> orders which you do not even have yet, as opposed to producing something on a <strong><em>per-unit</em></strong> basis, so that only the specific individuals who want one said units, pay for said units entirely themselves.</p>

<p>A venture capitalist is a middleman, by definition.  If you go to middlemen, they remain in control of what you do.  That is what I was referring to as the Capitalist process, in that sense.</p>

<p>I never see any engineer now, or anyone else who comes up with a new product, thinking that they can sell it themselves.  There is always talk of obtaining capital from a third party.</p>

<p>If the designers of this vehicle want to sell it, then I think they should try to come up with a design that is entirely replicable via (preferably man portable) 3D printing.  The idea is to do as much as possible oneself, and to avoid becoming any kind of incorporated entity; but those are symptoms.  The true goal is to remain autonomous, which means staying out of the hands of the suits.</p>

<p>If you go to the suits for money, then you are owned by them.  If you do not go to them, they have no say in what happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah fuck VC, that is for suckers, everyone knows this. Well everyone except those idiot kids who play startup like children play house.  But you cant blame capitalism because market demand is a really good solution for not blowing money on shit nobody wants to buy.  Being critical of venture capital funding does not equate to blaming capitalism, it just means you cant figure out a better way to come up with cash. If you have an idea that is worth something, you will be fine. If you dont, you end up on reddit complaining about capitalism....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha, try charging a Model S with a solar array that costs under $50,000...do you have about 2 days to charge to full range?</p>

<p>No thanks.</p>

<p>I would NEVER buy a car powered by 7,000-or-so AA lithium batteries. I am an avid RC modeler and can tell you first-hand that LiPos have to be babied or they either stop working or catch fire. This is not a design fault in Tesla&#39;s car though...it&#39;s a fault with Panasonic--the supplier of their batteries.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a conspiracy, it&#39;s not sabotage--it&#39;s just numbers. More people are buying the car, they are ALL powered by LiPos, and sometimes LiPos blow up or just die. If you want to own a tremendously impractical (but cool) car like this, well, those are the breaks. </p>

<p>Trust me, this is only the beginning. There will be more Teslas burning in the future--count on it. The oil companies are NOT threatened by Tesla considering that about .00000000000001% of the US population owns one...if that.</p>
