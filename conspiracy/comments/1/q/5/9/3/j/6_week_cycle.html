<p>This was hard choosing which news event to use for each cycle, I think there might be something to this. I will try to add more but feel free to post a continuation of this (or corrections) I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing some relevant ones. Too tired, going to bed now.</p>

<p>A quick addition of Navy Yard shooting, Mariam Carey, and the more recent LAX shooting will surely fit in the timeline here at the top. Somewhere? </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sep. 1</strong> Syria debacle-Secretary of State John Kerry asserts the United States now has evidence of sarin gas use in Syria from hair and blood samples</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jul. 21</strong> Hundreds of al-Qaeda prisoners escape during armed raids on two Iraqi prisons, including the Baghdad Central Prison (formerly known as Abu Ghraib). Also note 6 days later <strong>Jul. 27</strong> More than 1,000 inmates escape from prison in Benghazi, Libya</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jun. 6</strong> The Guardian obtains a copy of a document from April that reveals that the NSA is mining data using PRISM, spying on the e-mails and web activities of American citizens </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the FBI six week cycle.  The theory is that the FBI needs a domestic event every 5-7 weeks to concentrate their terror budget on. It doesn&#39;t refer to foreign events, it&#39;s really about the mass shootings and bombing plots which take place in the US.</p>

<p>Things like; boston marathon, navy yard, sandy hook, LAX, Colorado theatre would be part of the six week cycle.  Benghazi, NSA scandal, Syria etc would not.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I agree with the theory, just clarifying what it refers to. Thank you for your courage.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Dorner">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Dorner</a> </p>

<p>The first accused killings occurred on Feb. 3rd 2013.</p>

<p>And the wiki says he died from a self inflicted gunshot wound. I thought there was a voice recording somewhere of him being burned alive by the police.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Dorner was a false flag. I think he was a legit guy out for justice in what he believed was the only option after all the legal options had been lost. </p>

<p>The biggest reason I believe this is because, unlike, uh... EVERY OTHER MAJOR SHOOTER over the past several years, the guy had an actual motive, AND, the police were in a complete panic. </p>

<p>All these other shooters/bombers/&quot;terrorists&quot; were just a &quot;crazy lone gunman&quot;, but this guy was different, he had an entire agenda, a manifesto and the police had no fucking clue how to deal with him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure this 6 week cycle thing would require it to be a false flag. They could just seize the opportunity that Dorner provided and &quot;remind&quot; us all again why we need a strong government.</p>

<p>For the record, I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re right about it being a false flag, and I&#39;m not sure about this whole theory. I&#39;m certainly not sold that anything is planned with such regularity as a 6 week cycle. etc etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it could just be a moment to hype a shooting or something related to national security.  There are shootings every day, but only some get elevated to national news, and they&#39;re usually the ones that fit the agenda of those who control the media.</p>

<p>I would say it&#39;s probably more common to find unjustified shootings by police, but those never make it to the national level.</p>

<p>For example:  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/03/howard-morgan-ex-cop-shot_n_1399834.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/03/howard-morgan-ex-cop-shot_n_1399834.html</a></p>

<p>That could be a high profile case about police brutality and racism, yet most people have no idea it happened.  Didn&#39;t fit the 6 week cycle and didn&#39;t feed the narrative or cops being our sole protectors deserving of a monopoly on firearms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calm down, it&#39;s worth pointing out the fallacy at work.  It&#39;s part of entertaining it, to consider the Occam&#39;s Razor explanation.  That said, I think most of us consider that explanation very quickly, but the fun and interest comes in trying to see if there is more to the story.</p>

<p>I upvoted him because I think it&#39;s worth pointing out, but I will also point out that close to no one on this board isn&#39;t very aware that in many of these cases the simplest explanation is very likely the reality.  Still we&#39;re not here to discuss the accepted narrative, but to look for holes.</p>
