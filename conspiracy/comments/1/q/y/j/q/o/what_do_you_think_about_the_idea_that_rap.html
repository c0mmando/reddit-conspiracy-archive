<p>It seems plausible, and plenty of stuff like this has happened before. Is there any way to match music industry heads with private prison investments at the time just before Rap music changed its content?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was also there when rap went &quot;gansta&quot;, and I noticed that it was mostly white teens calling for gansta rap. They were the ones with the most disposable income, and the most likely to believe and subscribe to anything that was a &quot;black experience&quot;, no matter how valid or factual. </p>

<p>The record executives knew this quite well. </p>

<p>And now black people are saddled with the onus of having called for this, that &#39;gansta&#39; rap is somehow the true reflection of the &quot;black&quot; &#39;culture&#39;. When it is, in truth and by deed, a WHITE STEREOTYPE about blacks made flesh and imposed upon the black youth, to be made a reality. </p>

<p>But I was there. I heard a lot of songs and interviews about conscious educated emcee&#39;s getting marginalized, no airplay, pushed out of the game for not conforming. That pressure came from somewhere, and it wasn&#39;t the streets so much as it was the money from the top down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that rap&#39;s transformation to the glorification of crime is part of a larger agenda designed to disenfranchise African Americans permanently. It all adds up, when you look at the big picture: inner city schools have been allowed to fail, heroin/cocaine is so readily available that it&#39;s distribution has to have the government&#39;s tacit approval, federal aid money that is designed to fund the drug trade, rap music/media glamorizing the drug trade and inner city police that are simply there to ensure that as many African Americans as possible are branded as felons, so that they are locked out of middle class society. It&#39;s nothing less than slavery repackaged. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Most of the positive black leaders of the past are gone, replaced with idols and their &quot;get money&quot; monkey narratives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in order to discuss how and why that happened, we have to get into a factual narrative about how the entire population of this nation is being imprisoned, in ways that point to a systemic disregard for human rights. </p>

<p>And that makes some people feel <em>squishy</em> inside. So instead we&#39;ll get a bunch of garbage about the Bell Curve and genetic FUD-buckets culled from the wastebins of 1950&#39;s era social science. </p>

<p>This has ALWAYS, and will ALWAYS be about an issue bigger than race. This is simply Class Warfare. You&#39;re down here in it with all the rest of us, <em>believe it.</em></p>
