        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/1qukqs/631856746_til_that_in_1962_the_us_government/cdh3z29">Here&#39;s the post that got deleted.</a>  Probably, as usual, it is considered by the mods to be &quot;not good content.&quot;  I am, for the record, banned from posting on bestof, so....</p>

<p>My response to that horse shit is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/1qukqs/631856746_til_that_in_1962_the_us_government/cdh8z5z">here</a>. </p>

<p>Reddit has become the online, user-powered version of CNN.  While CNN censors via careerist reporters afraid to step out of line, reddit does it through overzealous moderators who impose their politics on the userbase.  To complain about this censorship seems frivolous, but it is the same white washing via omission that has screwed up the power relationship between people and governments now for decades.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t realize that by pushing this sort of discussion to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, they are actually adding to the userbase of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  When I first visited here it was at something like 80,000.  Now it is nearly 200,000.  </p>

<p>More and more people are realizing one simple fact: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; no longer means tinfoil hat.  Hell, &quot;tinfoil hat&quot; no longer means tinfoil hat.  That dam broke a while ago.</p>

<p>&quot;Conspiracy&quot; used to be a term used to deride free thinking and shame people who knew history, and lump them in with the &quot;I got probed&quot; alien crowd.  Now, thanks to censorship, more people are going to start opening the pandora&#39;s box of fascinating information, realizing that it isn&#39;t crazy, and more people are going to agitate for exactly this sort of free communication.  </p>

<p>You can only wade through so much mediocre slop on a site like reddit before you start to wonder, &quot;<strong>Where&#39;s the good stuff?</strong>&quot; </p>

<p>Today, &quot;conspiracy&quot; simply means &quot;open communication.&quot; People are coming here not only because they hate the lizard people (who doesn&#39;t?) but also because they get to see open discussion on topics that are deleted elsewhere.  </p>

<p>Hold it back, brave reddit mods.  Hold it back for as long as you can.  </p>

<p>The rest of you: subscribe to <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> and breathe fresh, uncensored air.  Comment, vote, support, make it the best place on reddit.  People will follow, it is inevitable.  I already can see the cracks forming on the hull of the good ship Digg 2.0.  What a nice system, which allows itself to be used to discuss its replacement.</p>

Declassified decades later, this information seems to sweep right over the public. Knowledge that our recent governmental designs included false reports to the public should be galvanizing the U.S. population to unify against corruption and instigate more questioning of 9/11, Sandy Hook, and all of the other recent questionable incidents. But as they say, the sheeple stay blinded by their own choice.</p>

<p>I see your point, BUT. This is hardly anything to celebrate.
