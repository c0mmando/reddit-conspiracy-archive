       Very easy solution.  Israel has been shown to game their system by using JIDF, which makes it an unfair playing field for ALL internet users.  I think there should be an effort to ban ALL ISRAELI IP addresses from people's forums and sites.  It's really the ONLY way.

       It's a fine line.  They want to censor content but still keep enough people invested.  That's why they hide their censorship as much as they can and limit the damage.  And hell, even people that are aware of the censorship still use it, case in point us on this thread.  By becoming so huge there are fewer alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, they can have conflicting motives.  They may have a profit motive from advertisers, but they also may have a ideological/government motive where money doesn't matter as much--the propaganda does (think Google).

       Seriously, I think the pharmaceutical (and other big business) lobbies are a lot more powerful than the JIDF and etc on Reddit. At least 161719's post made it to the top of somewhere, THEN was killed. At least we got to see it!

       Here's a case in point - Healthcare exchange curiously made exempt from fraud &amp; kickback laws --  already downvoted into oblivion on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       with a snarky unrelated kneejerk prObama comment on top like a cherry:

      <p>
       Edit: I realized that the person who originally posted this posted a Socialist web site, and possibly that's why it was downvoted in /politics so quickly. So, I dug up the original NY Times article about it, and posted it to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       immediately in

       Well...in this day and age, who even trusts SSL? Esp. a 128-bit cert, but it's better than nothing.

      <p>
       Can you explain what you mean by secure only in portions? If there's mixed content, the browser should warn. I don't see any mixed-content warning in any browser I've used to access via pay.reddit and everything looks kosher when I tcpdump.

       There used to be a ton of mixed content issues, plus the transmission between edge nodes and the actual reddit servers was not secure. I think all that has been fixed now, but cookies still remain to be secured. If you sign in on

       Everytime I say anything negative about psychiatric medication I get buried. Especially SSRIs. I dare anyone here to say anything negative about SSRIs or something like "depression is a natural, reactionary human state of mind, a symptom of a problem in your life, not a mental disorder per se which needs to be "treated" with pills" and not get buried.
Fuck psychiatry. It has become so corrupted.

       What kills me is THEY ALL KNOW. The side effects are on the damned boxes - and it's not just SSRIs, even nerve pain drugs like Lyrica and flu medicine like Tamiflu can cause suicidal/homicidal ideation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politicians know, police know, EMTs know, doctors know, every day people whose family members have been affected by these medications know, people who have taken these medications and tried to withdraw or had too high a dosage know. And you can bet the pharmaceutical companies know - they're the ones paying out the big bucks to get the news buried, to shut victims up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's documented in (publicly available) study after study, it's all over the web. Every day in a small town near you, someone stabs the shit out of a family member because their dosage was changed or they skipped a pill. But no one will discuss it and if you bring it up, (regular) people act like you farted and abruptly change the subject. If they do discuss it, it's behind closed doors, in whispers.

       I think it's more just the brainwashed masses on reddit.com who do that, not 'bots and shills', because they are the same kind of sensationalists they pretend to hate and react to any discussion about any kind of science or medicine by worshiping it, and if you warn anyone about anything you're a science-hating anti-medicine nutcase to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They aren't the smartest people in the world and they don't have very evolved personal views about many things but they think they're doing the obviously right thing by downvoting you because "depressed people should take pills to feel better!".
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, they're not very smart - or if they are, then they've devoted their intelligence to a socially acceptable/officially promoted avenue like in a university setting studying engineering or something to gain both employment and social acceptance - and they don't ever get exposed to any of this stuff there except in terms of "it's all good and anyone suggesting otherwise is bad or crazy or both!".

       Yes, this is exactly what it can sometimes feel like. Good analogy. That's the thing, is

       Placebo effect is strong..   SSRI work on that effect alone at least for any positive out come..  Now all the birth defects they cause are so rampant that they have class action lawsuits. You think those pills are only hurting your unborn fetuses?  They are frying your brain..  SSRI junkies are the worst. Brain washed into believing  they have a "chemical imbalance"  Really what chemical is imbalanced? 
Does low Serotonin come from being depressed or is Low Serotonin the cause of being depressed?  Why is it when one SSRI doesn't work. Then why would another work? or a combo of more  SSRI and Benzo drugs work?  why is it that suicide is a common side effect of those drugs? They are over prescribed poison and the masses eat it up..  even when they are still depressed being on a large cocktail of these drugs and now they are screwed if they try and stop.

       My favorite is the hand-wringing "Why oh why are our vets committing suicide in such large numbers? I mean, sure, we're putting them on 8-24 medications at once for PTSD once they return, and many of them psychoactive with known major psychiatric side effects, including suicide, and, also, none of which have ever actually been tested together, but why oh why are our vets committing suicide in such large numbers? It's a mystery!" UGH.

       You're exactly right. I'm a hospital pharmacist and have read a lot about antidepressants and reviewed many trials. Additionally, I've seen first hand how much they change people (usually not for the better). Tried to argue my stance here on reddit awhile back via throwaway account and have yet to see any of my posts get downvoted faster.

       I've personally seen a "coffee shop" open to members only that had an electronic bid/ask board where people were tasked with influencing social media.  It was typically something like: "$10 for 100 likes using legit accounts."

       Reddit in the past year or so has been overtaken by conservatives who are "pissed off and annoyed" at all the "neckbeards who criticise Israel and America all the time" - basically the 'anti-jerk' has become the mainstream opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even bother getting involved in most discussions about Israel, or religion or anything like that anymore, most of the time I do myself a favour and not get annoyed reading the comments on a thread about Israel. You will always be censored, downvoted and told to fuck off for being a "stupid liberal neckbeard idiot" with tonnes of sarcastic "dae Israel is literally Hitler" posts everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm not surprised the mods start to get involved too, if something is seen to criticise Israel the mods get "fed up" and start removing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is now a sustained negative reaction towards criticism of Israel, and it will only get worse as reddit attracts more from mainstream Westerners/Christians, especially Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I'm concerned the whole Israel situation is a dead end now, there won't ever be any turnaround from the situation now. The only thing I feel I can do is not join the military and fight their wars. This is just another chapter in the basically endless crusade for the so-called holy land.

       No, the type of people who are supporters of the JIDF just happen to be tech savvy and insane enough to endlessly try to control internet forums like this. I seriously doubt any member of an intelligence agency of any country would be stupid enough to act like people like
       <a href="/u/bipolarbear">

       act.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys should check out the history of the group of people (or one person?) apparently called NoLibs, who made a huge number of sockpuppet accounts and spread pro-Israeli/racist bile across both Digg and Reddit. Many people who act similarly just so happen to be mods in many of the prominent subreddits here, sadly. I think there is a thread about their pancaking "joke" (where they make fun of a woman who was crushed to death by an Israeli bulldozer operating in palestinian territory. Gross gross people, and if the site admins has any sense they'd perma ban the lot of them, as they use any means available to them to spread their racist bile while doing all they can to stop the speech of people who disagree with them.

       That isn't exactly related to what I was talking about, but is a good read. The HBGary guy sounds like a jackass sure, but a jackass with access to millions of dollars to surveil people and manipulate public opinion.

       Yeah, I just went down this rabbit hole last night after getting into a "debate" with bipolarbear.  Kind of hard to permaban this guy and his friends because they
       <em>

       I like to think the people who run reddit have a small but real set of morals/goals. They want to make money (which they aren't), and want to keep free speech alive on their site. But the way they go at it is to allow the moderators total control of their subreddits. So if a shithead like bipolarbear gets to mod
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       and takes the whole place down with him, the admins expect the userbase to migrate to another similar sub without people like bipolarbear moderating it. The admins seem to only see their job as intervening rarely (like getting rid of
       <a href="/r/niggers">
        /r/niggers
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is morally sound and works in theory, but not practically. When the subs that these insane moderators get control of get large enough, people simply do not care enough to switch to another one no matter how bad the moderators destroy the sub. This is happening in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       lately too. But because
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       has such a huge userbase, no one wants to mass switch to another one because the discussion will be far more limited. I personally think the admins need to be a little more hands on with the moderators of their subreddits, before they continue down this path of obliterating what good was left on reddit.

       You describe the practical workings of controlling this medium pretty well.  There is an outward appearance of democratic control (much like our democracy) but it's actually easier for a small group of people to control things than most people realize.

       I spend a lot of time reporting spammers (check my submissions). Some times I out a bunch of obvious spammers from a particular domain. I report them several times, but nothing happens. If you're some average Joe and you spam your blog then you get a shadow ban. But when I report a bunch of account to a site like TheLocal, nothing happens.

       Can you make a list of spammers that don't get banned?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've long assumed one of the tricks of the "alternative" media and blogs is to pretend they're some rinky dink operation when they really have substantial financial backing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't surprise me there really are secret deals re what websites are allowed to spam here.

       ok it's like this....this is an "advanced" Zionist "trick" of mental manipulation. It is very much in the best interest of the Zionist Jews who run the world, by controlling the monetary creation systems that you think, feel and believe that "all Jews are bad, and all the same"
      </p>
      <p>
       This, "oh no quick hide the post, their talking bad about the jews" gets them just what they want....It gets reddit to ask " why are they hiding "jew" posts"n which in turn leads to "suspicion"...like " whats up with these post's about Jews being hidden?" this creates what? SUSPICION, SUSPICION of the ENTIRE MASS of all that is "Jewish"
      </p>
      <p>
       Post's like these are intentionally pulled down, the aire is intentionally created in order to make you the non Jew go "Hmmm, somethings funny with these "Jews" And all this does is get you to look at "Jews" in general as one entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the same tactics used by the Zionist's in ww2 that lead to the slaughter of many innocent "Jews"...
      </p>
      <p>
       THERE IS NO LARGER THREAT TO THE "JEWISH" RACE THAN THE Zionist jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionist Jews use their "race" the entire Jewish race as a "human shield"
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the ways they do this is by getting "you" to be suspicious of all jews, and that is exactaly what this post does....creates suspicion, like "hey, what are these Jews trying to hide"
      </p>
      <p>
       But at this point there are far to many non Zionist Jews who understand what is happening, it will be up to the Jewish race to stop the Zionist's. The ones who will save you from the jews are jews

       It is disgusting.  I like the section on Israel:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Israel. I'm going to be brief here because this is a really emotionally charged topic, but... the formation of Israel and the failure of Arab leaders to "deal with it" in 49, 67, 73, was and remains easily one of the biggest reasons behind and one of the biggest outlets for distrust of authority, peddling of conspiracy theories, and the rising of a feeling of a need for a pan-Arab or (when that failed) pan-Muslim identity.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So instead of describing the history of such things as the Balfour Declaration and the subsequent betrayal of Arabs after using them in WWI, as well as other factors, the history is summed up as "the failure of Arab leaders to 'deal with [the creation of Israel.]"  Incredible whitewashing of Israeli-Arab history!  Shameful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then a gratuitous slam at "conspiracy" theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then notice our resident "historian" doesn't mention the British use of the Muslim Brotherhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he cites Bin Laden to explain things.  Just cheap history.  Doesn't surprise me.

       And here's a good history about how the British used the Muslim Brotherhood and cultivated "radical" Islam:

        http://www.redmoonrising.com/Ikhwan/MB.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the beginning:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I. The Roots of Islamic Terrorism
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past half-century religion has been in decline in the Western part of the world and in most of the East as well. Spirituality has been traded for materialism as living standards have increased, and popular culture has become almost completely secular as well. Why has the situation been different within the Middle East? How come the Judeo-Christian ethic has eroded, but the Islamic ethic has experienced an apparent resurgence? This study will try to explain how this situation is not something that has occurred by chance and it will offer evidence that militant Islam has been a card played by the global elites of the dominant Anglo-American establishment to achieve the long-term goal of a world government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before we turn to the events of September 11 we must first look at the small group of Muslim scholars who developed the ideology, and then as we continue it will become clear how tight-knit and closely connected the movement really is. It is a small movement within the religion of Islam, but it is very influential and its effectiveness must be measured in other ways than simply counting the number of adherents to its philosophy.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we related in Part One, the British used Islam to legitimize their puppet rulers in Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Palestine after taking over the Middle East in World War I. Because of this Islam was seen by much of the Arab populace as just another part of the corrupt colonial establishment. That is why the legitimate anti-colonial movements, such as those of Nasser, Mossadegh and Bhutto, were primarily secular in nature. When these nationalist movements began to succeed outside of the British sphere of influence the British turned to their Islamic allies to subvert these independent regimes. The Muslim Brotherhood stands out as the most important counter-revolutionary movement of this period in the Middle East, and one of the British-based Globalists' most important strategic assets today.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Muslim Brotherhood emerged out of Egypt in 1928 to evolve into "the largest and most influential Sunni revivalist organization in the 20th century." It was founded by Hasan al-Banna, the first son of a respected sheik who was also an author and the leader of a local mosque. Hasan was born in 1906 and was brought up immersed in Islam under his father's tutelage. He memorized the Koran and at age twelve he founded an organization called the Society For Moral Behavior. Shortly after he created another group, the Society for Impeding the Forbidden. He was a devout Muslim dedicated to his faith and at age sixteen he enrolled in an Islamic school in Cairo to train to become a teacher. As a teenager Hasan al-Banna also became a member of a Sufi order, the Hasafiyya Brothers' order. He was active in the order, reading all of the Sufi literature he could get his hands on, and he organized a Sufi group, the Hasafiyya Society for Welfare.

       Most broadly, reddit is an extremely popular site that shapes the opinions of millions of people, many of which who are young people who are still shaping their world views and political thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by actively censoring and culling content deemed threatening to the established powers, their interest of self-preservation is served. Nip the blossoming dissent in the bud, so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most dangerous thing to established state power is a public that thinks critically, questions or rejects the official state narratives, and demands better for themselves and their fellow citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       So naturally, that spirit and effort must be subverted, co opted and destroyed by those in power. And active censorship is merely but one tool in their kit.

       There once was this man who lived not that long ago, really we only need to go back 60+ years. This man was loved by his countrymen, he was loved because he was able to take an impoverished nation that had been destroyed by Zionist Money changers and turned it around into a very powerful nation in a very short time. he did this by removing the current money system that was controlled by the zionists and created a debt free currency for his people to use. As the world saw what he did they too admired and praised him. So much so that they put him on the cover of time magazine. As his power grew he found himself on a mission, that mission was to rid the world of Zionist bankers and their money printed as debt scams and to end debt slavery that these bankers subversively placed on the citizens of Europe. His methods were extreme, perhaps too broad and ended up killing many innocent Jewish people in his quest to rid the world of Zionist bankers. His name as you know is Adolf Hitler, and one may be able to stand back and say killing an entire race is "crazy" but by no means is ridding the world of central banking and money printed as debt crazy...So you can try to pussy foot around with the facts that are very historically laid out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a movie made by Mr. Hitler, I would direct you to the 21 minute mark if you would like to go directly to the "source" of the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets put it this way asshole, my source is so good, and was so serious about Zionist central bankers, those of which I named, being just what I said that he started ww2 over it....Dumbfuck

       That is given to whoever "for better or for worse" affected the year the most. Hitler got the award for causing a shitstorm in Europe, not because of anyone admiring him (only revisionists like you admire him). Ayatollah Khomeini got the "award", and certainly few outside Iran admired him.

       Anyway, I asked for a source about Reddit being controlled by a US agency, and you instead went on a rant about Hitler and linked to a propaganda film. So I guess Zionist media bad, Nazi media good. How edgy you are.

All Media that is mainstream, reddit is mainstream, are controlled by the military , just how we see that all private companies like apple, Microsoft, Comcast, att verizion, on and on are also part of the military...allowed to exist as long as they play ball....reddit is the same thing

       really I don't think one needs to view things as "good or bad" as much as what one feels and believes...the state of the world is quite self explanatory and this is why "conspiracy" minded people grows everyday....it is because people feel, sense and or know something is "Wrong" definable or not, most feel it, many would say know it, and so I am not here to have you put the weight of the conspiracy world on my shoulders, as if my words defined "conspiracy" as if I was the poster boy and I just make it look bad. It is the fastest growing sub because people find truth away from all the lies they have been told.

       like most people I use both...you seem so concerned with "our" image, why do you feel that way, you seem to want to say that Zionist bankers don't control the world and that it's just a coincidence that elgin is the "most addicted" reddit city, just young bored men with computers. gee I didn't know they got paid to hang out and post on the net, is that it, one joins the military so they can look at gone wild all day long???...Is this a fact or is it just something you feel

       furthermore explain to us why there are s many post's from elgin? and or how that a disproportionate amount of post's from one area that happens to be a military base is not unusual or suspect. Is that what your trying so say?

       The site you linked to said that 100,000 is the number of posts

       You said it is 100K per day.

       Doesn't surprise me.  There is a huge amount of propaganda and disinformation on this subject.  U.S. supported NGOs helped set up "citizen journalism" orgs in Syria and outside Syria well before the "civil war" started.

       Doesn't matter. It is not a reason to remove a legitimate post nor to have double standards. Removing it only gives strength to their claims and makes even more people cry "teh jews". When I first came here, I always thought "teh jews" were some shitty stormfront idiocy that somehow leaks on the internet. But with things such as
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_diplomacy_%28Israel%29">
        hasbara
       </a>
       ,

        Israel paying students to shill on the internet
       </a>
       , and the removal of contents critical of Israel on reddit, it becomes more and more difficult to not listen to and disagree with these people (even though many of them are fucked up). I already have some non observant Jewish friends who now do not like to be put in the bundle, not unlike Bob Fischer:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        Dear Mr. Osama bin Laden allow me to introduce myself. I am Bobby Fischer, the World Chess Champion. First of all you should know that I share your hatred of the murderous bandit state of "Israel" and its chief backer the Jew-controlled U.S.A. also know [sic] as the "Jewnited States" or "Israel West." We also have something else in common: We are both fugitives from the U.S. "justice" system.

       Hate breads hate, those kinds of skewed stories are posted by anti-semites in hopes to recruit people into line of thinking.  Reddit is full of useful idiots who have been recruited into this kind of hatred.  I believe most of these stories are emanating from the many hostile nations surrounding Israel to discredit their defensive efforts and people like you are their "pancake girls".

       My buddy in real life is a reddit-o-phile and he is constantly talking about different subs, phenomena, and users. He said to me yesterday something to the effect of people in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       whining about that post being deleted and overreacting. I said to him, ya know, hey there are some legitimate gripes there about deletions usually. He told me that it is par for the course for the bestof mods and it's not even likely a conspiracy about a censored conspiracy. I realize I am paraphrasing and perhaps not making a good point but he did say something like that.

       It's a fine line.  They want to censor content but still keep enough people invested.  That's why they hide their censorship as much as they can and limit the damage.  And hell, even people that are aware of the censorship still use it, case in point us on this thread.  By becoming so huge there are fewer alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, they can have conflicting motives.  They may have a profit motive from advertisers, but they also may have a ideological/government motive where money doesn't matter as much--the propaganda does (think Google).

       Yeah, it's pretty amazing how they slipped that past us.  Even Chomsky said it would be "more acceptable" for Obama to arm these terrorists if it was true the Syrian government used WMD.

       There used to be a ton of mixed content issues, plus the transmission between edge nodes and the actual reddit servers was not secure. I think all that has been fixed now, but cookies still remain to be secured. If you sign in on
       <a href="https://pay.reddit.com">
        https://pay.reddit.com
       </a>
       , and then visit
       <a href="http://reddit.com">
        http://reddit.com
       </a>
       , you'll still be signed in, which is theoretically exploitable.

       That's a different bestof'd comment of yours. The one in question here is not back up and definitely won't be any time soon.

       I feel that way about the 9/11 issue every damn time. If you question
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       about 9/11 you're immediately considered to have lost your marbles completely. The worst is when it happens in the family.

       Ugh, even
       <em>
        reason.com
       </em>
       is doing pro-GMO "people who just want labels on their food are idiotic eeeevil heretics!" articles now. The left-wing and right-wing sites are infiltrated by madness. Makes you feel like being a reasonable person that thinks critically is tilting at windmills, but you can't let the propagandists win. Can't sleep, clowns will eat us...
