<p>My uncles on one side of the fam are Masons, the other side of the fam are Hells, I was raised by Roman Catholics, used to work for the Bronfmans, and live amongst the Hasids. I&#39;m pretty darn sure I&#39;ll be informed well in advance if there&#39;s anything I need to worry about (or bomb shelters I need to run to). :P</p>

<p>From what I know about them, low-level Masons don&#39;t know what the high-level Masons do. I probably don&#39;t know much, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What exactly are you implying? Are you saying that women don&#39;t actually speak to the devil on a regular basis? That&#39;s heresy!</p>

<p>I do believe that the main three religions (in America) were founded and continued by men who saw reverence for women in religions of their day, and felt inferior to the idealized image of the other gender; so they idealized their own (gender).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WOMEN ARE THE DEVIL!</p>

<p>I believe that men feel inferior to women because - like God - women are capable of creating life. While extremely rare, women are also capable of parthenogenesis, which implies that men are not needed to further the human species. Which some could interpret as men being obsolete. Which, if I were a man, would freak me the hell out. Because then what is my purpose in life, if not to procreate to further the human species? How small and little and unnecessary am I now, to no longer be required in order to procreate the human species? I MUST DESTROY ALL WOMEN AND RENDER THEM POWERLESS UNDER MY MANLY FEET! MEN ARE SUPERIOR, BITCH, AND I&#39;LL KILL YOU TO PROVE IT!</p>

<p>la la la</p>

<p>What they neglect to realize is, even if women don&#39;t NEED the dick, they still WANT the dick. So dicks really need to chill out. And stop being dicks. Everyone is as important as we allow ourselves to be, regardless of gender.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yes, I agree, procreation is obsolete in and of itself. However, explain that to the average dude with an underdeveloped sense of self or self-actualization.</p>

<p>Human parthenogenesis is in fact possible. Women can self-fertilize eggs. In labs, scientists have been able to reproduce parthenogenesis by lightly electrocuting a human egg, which mimics fertilization by spermatozoa. The problem is while parthenogenesis is possible, using this method women can only give birth to female offspring, which would effectively wipe out the male gender altogether. And who wants that?</p>

<p>Google &quot;parthenogenetically activated egg&quot;.</p>

<p>Real science. Hear me roar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting! I will now commence my mid-life crisis...</p>

<p>I think that would make some men feel obsolete, or, possibly, most men. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a woman, so, from my perspective, I just know there would be something missing from life without women. It would suck. I imagine most women would feel the same if there were no men. </p>

<p>On the other hand, using this science (assuming to long-term genetic damage is done), if one gets enough funding and military strength, one could wipe out most of humanity and just breed an army of (female) workers to make life a paradise for the one in control. IS THAT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT??? Come to think of it, that sounds like something a man would do... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I&#39;m way more concerned about emancipating myself from biological slavery than I am with gender-based obsolescence.</p>

<p>Being female sucks. It&#39;s painful and emotional and having babies literally takes the life right out of you. Being male sucks too, it&#39;s also painful and emotional, and having your emotions so severely repressed (boys are not allowed to cry and if they do they&#39;re reprimanded or bullied or beaten, wtf) takes the life right out of you. Having sex organs sucks. Sexuality if often traumatic. And the gender war is tedious and hateful and exhausting. Day in, day out, thinking about our genitals constantly, like some dimwitted animal. </p>

<p>lol</p>

<p>Emancipation from biological slavery, however... of not being limited by a physical body. Of perhaps not even HAVING a physical body (unless you choose to have one at any given time). This is what I really want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I think you&#39;re in luck. Emancipation is an inevitability. Psychedelics are a short term cure; so is lucid dreaming and meditation. In the end, though, we are all free from our bodies... which, to me, leads to the possibility of choosing a new form or avoiding forms altogether. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re aware of the decision you will make until the time comes to make it. </p>
