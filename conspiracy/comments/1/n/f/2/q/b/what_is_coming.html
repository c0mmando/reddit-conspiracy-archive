       Well what is happening is the U.S economy is being propped up. The government is pretty well bankrupt. They can't hold up the economy forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason(s) they cannot let the economy tank just yet is because they aren't ready. They need to guarantee the same crooks will be in power in the new system, as they are in this system.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to get semi-automatic rifles out of the equation; as handguns, shotguns aren't very effective tools in fighting revolutions. Way more deaths using handguns than rifles, yet they are going after the rifles.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to make sure continuity of gov prevails.
      </p>
      <p>
       After/If they quell the U.S revolution. They will set up a "New World Order". After this, The teeth will be ripped out of the U.S constitution, will become mostly null &amp; void. U.S, Mexico and Canada may be merged into a Union. The idea of sovereignty will diminish. Replaced by new draconian laws, with little opposing voices which can be heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until then..
      </p>
      <p>
       They are using a campaign of "Tension" right now. This keeps everyone on the edge of their seat. Since they haven't gotten the rifles yet, there may be more incident's to bolster Obama's push to take guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest thing to watch out for is in the markets. And of course there could be another war in the middle east. Israel seems to always have plans.

       It's stunning to me how you guys don't "get" things, even if you consider yourself a conspiracy theorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has all already happened. There is a new order of the world, financially and militarily, run and administered from "
       <em>
        the new world
       </em>
       ", it is the largest quasi-empire in history and has
       <em>
        already succeeded
       </em>
       in establishing the first truly global economic / military order. The outliers(the muslims, the last ones in the world with their own separate system of culture and banking/finance laws with a potential power due to being seated over massive energy resources that the rest of the world needs, with a strong spiritual basis in the minds of their people) are now being stripped of their ability to offer any resistance or challenge via outright invasions/occupations or proxy wars/secret wars.

       Already happened, read "The Patriot Act"(1 &amp; 2)/The Victory Act/National Defense Authorization Act/etc. - all they need to do to render constitutional rights 'null and void' is apply specific legal terminology to their actions, that's it.

       A new and sole world-superpower has arisen in "the new world", the Americas, it has completely changed and reorganized the world. It is a military power that dwarfs all others in military expenditure and aggression/dominance throughout the world, it has changed everything in every major field of human affairs. It has been built over the past 70-100(and more) years.

       This is one of the most concise and level headed 'we're fucked' arguments I've read in all my years in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talk of revolution is funny because i believe it will be quelched before it could ever get off the ground. People now more than ever don't realize their true power in numbers and are distracted by petty differences set up to separate them.

       Not disagreeing with you that the plan has been in motion for over a decade. However, the Second Amendment will be the most difficult for them. Those who exercise the Second know exactly why our founding fathers explicitly mentioned it. They know without it, the rest don't matter (no way to defend your liberties against oppressors and tyrants).
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the writing is on the wall with the gun control agenda being pushed with every "horrible tragedy" they stage/abet. But the reality is there's still a lot of people (and congressmen) not sold yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       If push came to shove, it won't be pretty. It's going to be "Molon Labe" and the first raid on legal (read: constitutional) gun owners that results in a shootout will be the second Shot Heard 'Round the World.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it may seem improbable when you look at the Boston lockdown and the sheer paramilitary power but that was for two guys on the run. When you have communities and hunkered down positions with high powered weapons it's going to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many people waiting for this breaking point and have prepared. They will fight to the death to defend "Old America," and they very well may die just so. Most Americans already dislike their government, do you think they would side with it when fellow Americans are being destroyed while defending the Constitution and liberty?
      </p>
      <p>
       There will be many defectors in the military and police. This will be the great dividing point in our history yet again, if it happens.

       I'm optimistic, even though I can see how there's a lot of information that would make people think to the contrary. Things will get worse before they get better with respects to the economy. Raising interest rates--which is bound to happen--will probably trigger some ugliness.
      </p>
      <p>
       But after averting complete and total disaster in Syria, I have to believe that we humans are entering into a state of enlightenment and the great "waking up" period. Corruption's being exposed left and right. People seem to be far less gullible than before--just looking at the front page of Reddit indicates this, and it brings me hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to be an avid watcher of disaster porn purveyors (we all know who I'm talking about). But honestly, I'm trying to move beyond that. I fully believe in the theory that the world is a reflection of ourselves, and by maintaining our personal dignity, morality, and keeping our spirits bright, it helps mitigate the insanity around us. This isn't to be confused with being ignorant--I stay well-informed. But I no longer let doomsday scenarios paralyze me like it once did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I know this is a vague answer and will probably bring downvotes. But hey, whatever's coming... don't be afraid.

       Optimism is much needed, I think. But what do you mean by "a state of enlightenment and the great 'waking up' period"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you said that your answer was vague, but I'm wondering if you could be a little more specific on this part. What do
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       mean by "enlightenment" and "waking up"?

       I'm going to get lambasted by Reddit's hyper-rationalists, but whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the earth is influenced by changes in the solar system's vibrations. For example, the Schumann resonance is something like 7.8 hz? These frequencies have very real effects on our emotions and our circadian rhythm which dictates things like sleeping patterns. One study found that students shielded from these frequencies (they were living in a steel container underground or something like that) had a reduced sense of well-being, insomnia, etc. Anyway, that's just one example. But I do think that human beings are basically governed by electrical signaling which is highly sensitive to these frequencies, and others. It's one reason why the EMF signals from cell phones should be investigated much more closely. Some believe these signals may be responsible for honey bee deaths because it affects their brain's compass.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, the earth's frequency is increasing slightly--2012's significance was, in part, a reflection of this. Now, I can't say for sure that this corresponds with enlightenment or "waking up," but I don't think it's a stretch. I think these frequencies correspond with a more peaceful era.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't get started on where we are, astrologically speaking. But I think it too holds interesting insight that doesn't foretell doom and disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       To clarify, none of this negates free will. It just subtly affects our perception of events, much the same way as hormones might affect one's emotions but not necessarily decision-making.

       Hmm. Interesting. I can't say I buy it, but I don't really lean towards that stuff, so I don't read about it at all. I'll check it out, though.

      <p>
       What I meant to ask was what does it mean to be "enlightened" or "woken up"? (not so much the process, but the "end result," if enlightenment ever "ends") What, for you, is enlightenment? And why? Answer if you want, I'm not sure you have to defend your beliefs to me, and I don't want to sound accusatory or mean.

       well Oct. 1 is the day ISON flies by mars and the frst up close look of it and its composition.
      </p>
      <p>
       then look at the region 3 alerts.
      </p>
      <p>
       my guess is tuesday they find out if ison is harmless or an ELE and the region 3 alert is for the scramble to get the gov in to bunkers if its going to hit us
      </p>
      <p>
       roscosmos is saying that ison's trajectory is/was peterbed by mars/phobos so that would make the current paths a guess at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       considering its a big snowball swing close to the sun, the change in mass or even the push of jets of melting ice make this thing pretty unpredictable so its all speculating until tuesday, if nasa goes super quiet id start worrying.

       that was what got me worried, its expensive sure but why shut it down right when the risk of the objects is at its highest. ffs how many "big" ones have their been in the last 6 months?
