       I have tried to post things and they never get posted. I tried posting Ted Cruz's speech as he was saying it. Got a reply telling me it wasn't important, and made no difference. If r/politics isn't going to be unbiased then get rid of it, or rename it what it should be.

      <p>
       Reddit's admins can't rename it and do not give subreddits to new owners unless the subreddit is abandoned. Since politics has active administration they won't do anything unless there is a serious rule breach.

       are definitely not socialists or Marxists. In fact, I'd argue the opposite. Most people on

       pretend to be "socialists" but in reality, are dumbass liberals who want to damage control for the Democratic party without looking like complete idiots.

       I'm sure the admins had quite a few reasons to remove politics from the default set. We can't point to any one thing and have to accept that it was a convergence of a lot of different issues. I don't know what the admins think of WorldNews or if they would consider removing it from the default set but I know with a 100% certainty that WorldNews is much, much less moderated than r/Politics but at the same time it appeals to an international audience which Reddit relies on for page views and advertising revenue which, as we've seen, they desperately need.

       I'll ignore the fact that moderators cannot change the name of their subreddit for a moment and ask if you deleted the posts you made to
       <a href="/r/Politics">
        /r/Politics
       </a>
       that you claim were removed by the mods. A quick look at your history does not show any posts to the
       <a href="/r/Politics">

       Hi. I submit and monitor
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Setting aside the OP for a second.
      </p>
      <p>
       Submission censorship does occur, often times under the auspices of a rule violation to preemptively avert a Streisand (admins nuking
       <a href="/r/reddit.com">
        /r/reddit.com
       </a>
       also helped to allow more "obtuse" moderation practices sans community censure.)
      </p>
      <p>
       To your credit, you have been hands off about the nsa stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it's quite obvious to most of us who follow mod nonsense on this site that selective enforcement of rules is a way to allow censorship. And, just like I told the NY inner circle faggots, this is the subreddit most conducive to discussion of this matter
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I will cede that the administrators of this website set the tone (allowing SA (somethingawful) to raid CP and dox until the "problem subs were gone"and then rewarding them with the ability to brigade as they see fit.). And I will also say that in an arena wherein Lauralie whored for the feds, where Alexis talks to DOD contractors about social media gaming, where
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       mods attempt to subversively take on the Kremlin, and wherein certain cabals of mods are treated by the staff as more akin to editors then volunteer moderators I can see why you lot would think it okay to censor at the behest of whatever faction is offering top dollar that day and/or promote content via payola (probably the assholes paying davidreiss and maxwellhill).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, of course many mods have resigned upon seeing this culture of payola. VA from
       <a href="/r/funny">
        /r/funny
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/wtf">
        /r/wtf
       </a>
       being the most prominent example. Also PIMA took on the rat pack over the fact that those five dudes are IRL friends with Alexis, which lead to them subsequently destroying PIMA (asked him (through davack) to help quell the tide of CP raids in
       <a href="/r/creepshots">
        /r/creepshots
       </a>
       and then threw him to the dogs when cooper and the Guardian came calling).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now in terms of your specific sub, If I recall correctly you lot go so far as to use automoderator to target specific accounts that question your polices to prevent them from commenting. That's fucked it and of itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have questionable policies with regards to which domains you automod and it is also confounding that only you, luster and the CSS guy are the public face of the mod team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously some mods do more work than others, but we have to wonder if you don't have some type of organization set up whereby you sell your collective influence to PR firms (maybe with help from reddit inc, who the fuck knows?) to both censor and or promote stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I have it on good authority that
       <a href="/r/soccer">
        /r/soccer
       </a>
       mods ( a sub with a mere 100,000 people) have been offered monetary compensation numerous times to add people to the approved submittors list (therein training the algorithm to promote them) but they have so far turned down the offers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So your sub has what, 2 or 3 million subscribers (80% inactive or puppets no doubt), and you want us to believe you don't facilitate a revenue stream for reddit inc (and/or yourselves) by virtue of your editorial practices?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's let the users of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       chime in on their experiences with your sub over the past few years, shall we?

       I'm just trying to help this user and figure out why his posts may have been removed. I came here with the express purpose of helping to
       <strong>
        restore
       </strong>
       posts that inadvertently may have hit the spam filter or have been removed by accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure I should even indulge some of the stuff you alleged since it all sounds pretty sensational. I can tell you that I've never, ever (not even in a subtitle way) been offered money for moderating or posting content. We've even taken steps to ensure that mods can only post a total of 3 times per week.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure it would be very difficult for me to convince you that the mods of r/Politics aren't paid shills. We certainly do remove content in our efforts to control for quality. But, just being honest here, it's laughable to me to think that people in r/Politics are getting paid to mod a certain way. Most of the mods aren't very active and the ones who are are basically reddit geeks who like moderating and were snatched up based on the dedication they have shown in benign subreddits (like the SFWPorn Network) for patrolling the queues and diligently removing rule violating posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day you are going to believe whatever you want to believe but I think that your time would be better spent in other ways than peering over the shoulders of r/Politics mods. If that's what you want to do then that's fine. We've got nothing to hide, however, it's a fruitless endeavor.

       And your kidding yourself if you think that the politics mods don't take steps to ensure that the group is not brought down by the actions of a single individual. Hasn't the QuickMeme fiasco shown you that some times mods do in fact try to ensure that other mods are legit?

       This must be an alt. You, most assuredly, have some throw away accounts and I can't keep up with all that so I'm sorry but I'm not aware of your sourcing tendencies nor do I care. Yes of course everyone knows the stuff about Alexis and whatever.

       Hey, say what you want buddy. There are a ton of people out there who think the politics mods are shills or what ever and they are always searching for ways to prove it. There are private subs and secret, invite only IRC channels devoted to this mess. I'm just a slightly nerdy guy who likes reddit and helps 22 other people from across the world moderate an internet message board. It's a lot less scandalous than you'd think.

       Mods don't have the power to block people from using search.  In fact, if you just click on the grey search box, it will expand giving you the normal option to limit your search to that reddit and allow you to type in a search.

       I'm reluctant to agree, but yeah I gotta say r/politics is slowly changing for the better. Unlike r/news that keeps getting worse by the day. You want to see real hardcore censorship go look at r/news and then look a
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ModerationLog">
        r/ModerationLog
       </a>
       . Most censored sub right now is r/news
