       Hi Conspiracy community, I dont know if this is just me but I have seen a dramatic increase in pro vaccine propaganda spew all over my facebook and other social media platforms. Seeing friends/people reposting pro vaccine "reminders". 
This is worrisome for me and I understand there are equal amounts of dis-info on either side but there must be credible sources of anti-vaccines information that has been agreed upon? Thanks community I am looking forward on seeing what results if any are to come. I am a green horn to Reddit so I am unsure on what to expect from posing questions. :)

       Every scientific study says that vaccination is the way to go.  I might get flack for saying that here but anti-vaccine stuff is typically "backed" up with antecdotal evidence.

       I don't want this to be considered flak but how can you say that every scientific study says otherwise?  Thats clearly not true as there reports given and study's that shows the exact opposite. This is why I am asking for links or pages of material they find credible. I hope to provide a space  for fact checking, critical thinking , and a consensus.

       What reports or studies that have been peer reviewed say that vaccination is unsafe?  I haven't seen a single credible one.  I see a lot of "my daughter is Autistic after I got her vaccinated" but nothing that provides a direct link between vaccination and any disease.

       There aren't any , but that doesn't stop people to make claims that those studies exist. People will make as much bullshit as their brains allow them to in order to support their biased and unsupported beliefs.

       You dont know that Seqlar. The reason I started this thread was to sift through a lot of the study's out there. Like this page for example
       <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/salud/salud_vacunas28.htm">
        http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/salud/salud_vacunas28.htm

       You will NEVER find consensus on a PRODUCT that is both dangerous and lucrative! That is why I default to the CHOICE argument. Allow people to choose and then it is up to them to decide. I choose not to as I will NEVER believe what the ALLOPATHIC medical COMPLEX has to say about vaccination or any other medicine...we live in an age of consciousness and ANYTHING that is demanded of people, without the raising of consciousness over the issue, is fascism or parenting...and I am not about to let the state become my PARENT! And as they have already taken the path of fascism...I demand the right to choose. I believe in blood transfusion but I am not about to FORCE a Jehovah's Witness to get one. We have to respect each others choices in a free society whether we like them or not. What is freedom? What is love? It certainly is not found in the FORCED INJECTION of an experimental medical serum into BABIES!

       The people who call them preventable are those who are involved in the selling of the medicine that makes the claim that they are "preventable". If you read the inserts it will say that the vaccine is not 100% effective which means that theses diseases are NOT preventable.

       They don't have to be flawless to have value to a society. Their preventive benefits massively outweigh any (unlikely) downsides.

      <p>
       We use vaccines because the principles they are based off of are valid. This system of immunization actually works.

       All I am asking for around vaccination is
       <em>
        informed consent

       ...(which means full disclosure to the possible hazards of the medication...that's the
       <em>
        informed

       part...which is not being done by any nurse who doesn't provide the patient with the warnings provided on the manufacturer's inserts ...and freedom of choice...which is the
       <em>
        consent
       </em>
       portion...which mean the patient wants the medical procedure to be performed upon them and they are giving permission to the medical establishment to inject them with the agreed upon substance.

       Well you need to do more research because NONE of those diseases slowed down due to vaccination. The elimination of poverty, filthy living and working conditions, and the creation of modern sewage systems did more for the health of the poor and the well to do, than any medicine, vaccination or otherwise.

       What the fuck? Did I say that, troll? No, I didn't. Refusing to let my kid receive the education that I pay for via my MUNICIPAL TAXES, is what I was referring to. More than 2/3rds of my property taxes go towards the BoE.
      </p>

       And yes, federal taxes on a citizens living wage is unconstitutional. State and municipal taxes are not. Federal income should come from domestic corporate taxes and foreign tariffs. Considering how cozy corporations and government are in bed together, it'll never happen.

       Herd immunity has been co-opted by big pharma and DOES NOT APPLY to VACCINES. Herd immunity only applies to natural immunity development and does not work with vaccines.

       Not so much FUNNY as it is SCARY. And "these guys" do consist of shills and trolls and half baked thinkers. Why do I know...because I am simply taking my stance based on my distrust of institutions especially when they tell me I have to do something...live vaccinate. So when I am attacked on r/conspiracy for being skeptical of vaccination, and there is no tolerance for that skepticism, you know something is wrong...and it is NOT me.

       Obviously you didn't watch the link I gave you. There are NO reasons to believe these institutions. I find the automatic belief in them to be dangerous and stupid. If you look carefully at the history of all allopathic medicine, there is NEVER room for criticism (until they are forced to) and all alternative viewpoints are demonized...always. Even when they are right.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/conspiracy readers please watch this link...in the spirit of skepticism and truth dare yourself to open your eyes to the POLIO debacle. The vaccine DID NOT ELIMINATE POLIO! Watch and learn...

       Good thing I listen to and have confidence in myself and my powers of thought and not to crazy shills and vote brigades on reddit! Our "conversation" alone is an excellent example to everyone out there that there is no interest in the truth about vaccination...only interest in persecuting those who have skepticism over this heavily propagandized medical technology...and yeah...totally experimental serums as they don't know what is going to happen to human beings 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 30 years down the line.  That to me means that they are experimental.

       Fact: There is no peer reviewed paper that supports the idea that vaccines are bad.

       So you just spit out "facts" without evidence.. Just show me a study dude.. or any evidence..you have none. At least structural engineers get listened too when they talk about 9/11, doctors who say vaccines are dangerous get laughed out of academia.

       I think that the "thin veneer of control" is sliding away from most traditional "authorities" and they are grasping at straws trying to control the freedom of information era. Outright censorship is coming if we don't get a handle on that!
      </p>
      <p>
       The reaction from the AUTHORITY is a sure sign that something is up. Vaccines and GMOS are two excellent examples of this polarity. If GMOs are so safe and good for you why would they resist labeling? If the science is so proven about vaccines why are the people who SIMPLY QUESTION the party line crucified in public with such vehemence? It is because there is REASON to doubt. And cognitive dissonance has been used in the vaccine industry for years and years so that too is a bit of a red flag!

       Just because you haven't seen something because you claim it doesn't exist doesn't mean there is none out there. Your comments have been less then helpful and its pretty clear your a troll or shill. If you were so confident in your belief then you should have no problem in allowing a rational conversation to occur. You don't, you attack the people, you attack the subject. All in all pathetic

       We could just make people who aren't vaccinated where little yellow star badges in the meantime while we come up with a Final Solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: might have to tattoo them, since they could just take off the badge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit2: it might actually be a good idea to round them up and quarantine them somewhere. Any thoughts?

       Viruses mutate and if there are unvaccinated carriers where these viruses can mutate they can eventually mutate to be resistant to the vaccines we currently use to protect us from these diseases. The more unvaccinated people the higher the chances of mutation occurring and coming back even stronger. Vaccinate your kid and help get rid of many diseases that used to be deadly and those who lost their lives to them if Given a Chance would take the shots.

       I used that as an example. Not EVERY kid CAN be vaccinated. That is why it is important to vaccinate your kids to protect the ones that aren't. Parents who don't vaccinate their kids even though they can are putting them in danger. It should be against the law. It is fucking pathetic, not one piece of evidence suggests vaccines are bad. There is more evidence for big foot

       All anti-vaccine sources are NOT considered credible. The entire reason I started to question vaccines is because when I asked about side effects and/or reports that indicated that this may not be a safe medical procedure I got nothing but derision back from the doctor. This is what made me look into it and eventually find the truth...which is simply this...they are experimental serums and they have unseen and unstudied dangers and the fact that they are promoted as 100% safe and effective should be a red flag for EVERYONE! No science is infallible and they claim that vaccine science is! Fuck that.

       I'm glad. I have had a short email discussion with Dr. Suzanne directly and she is amazing. She has stopped her anti-vaccine crusade and now concentrates her efforts on TREATING the vaccine damaged (and there are many) and on EDUCATION...that polio film blew me away...I knew some of the stuff but not all of it. AMAZING!

       Obviously you didn't watch the link I gave you. There are NO reasons to believe these institutions. I find the automatic belief in them to be dangerous and stupid. If you look carefully at the history of all allopathic medicine, there is NEVER room for criticism (until they are forced to) and all alternative viewpoints are demonized...always. Even when they are right.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/conspiracy readers please watch this link...in the spirit of skepticism and truth dare yourself to open your eyes to the POLIO debacle. The vaccine DID NOT ELIMINATE POLIO! Watch and learn...
