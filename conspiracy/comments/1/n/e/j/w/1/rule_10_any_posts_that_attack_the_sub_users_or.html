    <div class="md"><p>I never made either of those claims, but I am making the claim that some of the trolls there are shills. It&#39;s 2013 and plain as day to anyone who reads the newspapers; they tell you right in there that people are paid to create a false reality online. Even if they are all trolls, my point remains; some of those people&#39;s sole purpose in life is to come here and fuck up the threads. Everything from name calling to vote manipulation and the mods allow it, despite immediately banning my novelty account Shill_detect_Probot because &quot;calling people shills is a personal attack.&quot; The account doesn&#39;t actually call people shills, it simply says it has detected the possibility. Just trying to make light of the plethora of accounts that come here to destroy any real conversation, especially about Israel. And it was immediately banned. </p>

<p><strong>What about Israel?</strong></p>

<p>If you made a bot which finds suspected shills, make the bot report the user, instead of writting &#39;potential shill&#39; in the comments below.</p>

<p>Other than that, I agree with you there are payed opinion changers. But it&#39;s difficult to ban them all, because accounts are free. my_sweet_user_name_33 is banned, o well, better create my_sweet_user_name_34:99, and wait a month and then continue shilling.</p>

<p>Just keep creating 10 accounts per day, and it won&#39;t matter if the mods ban 10 shills per day..</p>

<p>You think that&#39;s people you are dealing with? It&#39;s cheaper to use bots. Smarterchild was the beta test. Now, smarterchild bots are in place, a million times over.</p>

<p>And I noticed any threads that indicate Israel is doing <em>anything at all</em> that is wrong, accounts from conspiratard come here and vote certain posts down to negative 50 and usually just personally attack people. For some strange reason, their lives are devoted to making sure the tin foil haters love Israel. So I get banned and they get free access? And they don&#39;t just &quot;correct our misjudgement&quot; on Israel here. Many of them do the same thing in Worldnews and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The opinion-shapers are NOT REAL people. They are computers. Computers can already parse your comments and output a response that is almost human like. So when suddenly your anti-israel comment is downvoted past &quot;-3&quot; (the default &#39;do not show&#39; level), its due to a botnet. NOT REAL people.</p>

<p>Examples: Siri, smarterchild, googlenow, are all example of computer systems that you can have a conversation with. <em>Please note that I am not saying Siri is part of a political botnet.</em> Just showing examples.</p>

<p>There are people who believe everything they hear on the MSM. They come here to to laugh at how &#39;stupid&#39; you are. </p>

<pre><code>&quot;OMG, like look at all these tards.&quot;
&quot;Do you actually believe Obama is a lizard man?&quot;
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>So I get banned and they get free access?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Calling people &quot;potential shill&quot; is unproductive. The botnet doesn&#39;t give a shit (emotionless) and real people will either be offended or get a kick out of it. Eitherway, it&#39;ll be harder to change the opinion of real people posting ignorant stuff, when you make a bot calling people &#39;potential shill&#39;. Just report those who you think are shills and post easy to understand counter-arguments to their &quot;shill&quot; posts.</p>

<p>100% guarentee this will not get you banned.</p>
