    <div class="md"><p>Why does everyone here think that fingerprints are that big a deal?</p>

<p>First off, the government more than likely already has your fingerprints. Many places take them when you are born, get a driver license, etc. Yes, there&#39;s a chance they may not have them, but so what?</p>

<p>When it comes to your cellphone, the NSA has you by the balls at the carrier level. They already know your IMEI number, who the contract belongs to, and every call/text you make. They already know who is doing what, your fingerprint isn&#39;t a big deal to identify you at that point.</p>

<p>I mean with all the leaks on how the NSA has access to carrier/tech company data, I don&#39;t see why the fingerprint is gonna really seal the deal here. Recorded IP addresses can easily be linked back to what device had that IP at the time, bam, that phone/contract/user.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s say the NSA does get your fingerprint, how does that make any more a difference than now? Sure, your plausible deniability of, &quot;someone else stole my phone and was using it,&quot; goes away with texts... but that&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>Someone, please explain to me why fingerprint database would be a big deal? Are they gonna use them to frame you for a crime or something?</p>

<p><strong>Let me make it clear:</strong> I think privacy is important and I think the NSA and other agencies have gone way too far in this surveillance game. I&#39;m saying from a realistic standpoint what they have isn&#39;t going away anytime soon, so we have to work with what we can. Yes, the NSA <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> have access to this and that, but they do and will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just yet <em>another</em> thing they add to their total collection on your life. If they ever want to prosecute you or find you or coerce you into doing/saying something then they have this extra bit of information on you. By itself, it is probably not so important, but it is never &#39;by itself&#39; it is the fingerprints in conjunction with all the other stuff that gives them the power. Information = power. Now with the fingerprints, they just upped their power.</p>

<p>The idea isnt that they might get them. The idea is they already have them via the reasons you listed, and now can link conversations down to the exact user. Not just the person on the contract for the device.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to your cellphone, the NSA has you by the balls at the carrier level. They already know your IMEI number, who the contract belongs to, and every call/text you make. They already know who is doing what, your fingerprint isn&#39;t a big deal to identify you at that point.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this is true. But you seem to be missing the point. Currently any phone purchased without a contract, a &#39;Burner&#39; if you will, is essentially annonymous. They have to find the phone in your pocket and link the data to you personally. Without catchign you essentially red handed, any of the data could be linked to anyone as long as it isnt super specific. What finger printed does is takes away that anonymity. As soon as you put your print on it, it reads, and you start texting, its essentially an admittance of your actions.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, without a contract, physically catching you with the phone, or knowing who the user is, there is no real way to catch someone. Outside of maybe tracking GPS from your phone and already having an investigation build up on you. Nothing taking your battery out when not using wont fix.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone, please explain to me why fingerprint database would be a big deal? Are they gonna use them to frame you for a crime or something?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, basically. Or catch you committing a crime completely unconstitutionally.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure the NSA has fingerprints for one reason or the other but to think any info stored on the iPhone is only stored locally is likely a lie from apple. If you lose or replace your phone it&#39;s backed up on iCloud. It doesn&#39;t make sense to not store all the info in iCloud so to think it won&#39;t be accessible by the NSA is naive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guys a shill or uneducated.
How can you possably be so naive about the sophistication of nsa hardware and software backdoors. How many people could even find the very deep underlying processes running through smart phones which send this sort of data? </p>

<p>Even if it was found it will be priority one from Nsa to disintegrate this infomation from all mainstream/niche sites on the open web.
Let alone the repercussions for hackers who upload &#39;this infomation&#39;</p>

<p>How many sheeple could find and interpret bits of code on the dark web which claim to show fingerprints being sent to NSA servers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re the one whos made the claim that fingerprints are held/uncopied and stored on a local server, in which the only evidence in this case is Apple&#39;s word.</p>

<p>This is contrary to recent revalations that Apple are in conjunction with prism and the nsa. It&#39;s also likely these operations are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to survailence and analysis activties. One only needs to look at the quantity of media injunctions across the western world to realise how little national security infomation is leaking out. Once that data is stored on an apple server everyone should assume the nsa has it&#39;s hand on that data.</p>

<p>There is no technological argument that this can&#39;t be done discretely at least in the short term of around 6 months. You&#39;re the one making arguments or providing &#39;evidence&#39; that have no factual basis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they wouldn&#39;t. NSA access might very well be embedded in a chip (it was leaked that they&#39;re doing this, but not specifically what systems they&#39;re on).</p>

<p>And anyway, say it really is only stored on the phone, and NSA don&#39;t have backdoor access, if they get hold of your phone then they can prove that it was YOU that used it at any one time. Basically it strengthens their case (if they have a case against you).</p>

<p>All of this fear mongering over &quot;identity theft&quot; is allowing the system to set up a tracking grid to know who said what and when.  Once they get the internet ID and thumbscanning put together people won&#39;t have the plausible deniability on the internet anymore.
