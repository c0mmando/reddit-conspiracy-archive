       So my Canadian friends were leaving my place near the border in the US, they got pulled over before they crossed the border for no reason (not speeding) they  were searched, the cops asked to see their phones which were locked so they made them enter their passwords so that they could look through them. I asked why they complied, they just said they were intimidated and scared. So there you go, search of private property, without cause or warrants.

       Thanks to twelve years of ceaseless war combined with a policy of cutting military and post-military benefits... we do have a LOT of angry veterans.  And they're familiar with some pretty buff military tech and the latest in tactics and strategy.  This is our sleeping giant, at the moment.  It wouldn't take much, for a coup in the United States to get some legs.

       Is it really an opposite sentiment? I fully understand what will happen. I'm also sorry for everyone that it affects. However, something needs to happen. We cannot continue living in limbo while the final pieces of the police state apparatus are put into place and it is brought online. Hopefully a default will be the catalyst needed to cause the veterans to pick up arms and lead the rest of America against the criminal psychopaths that have stolen our government.

       Really creepy when I thought somebody was on my side -- that's what I remember about my peers here, and I'm sure you and everybody else knows who they like here &amp; who they don't -- followed by the knife in the back when it turns out you're either contradicting yourself, or just lying about one or the other.

       The way I see it, I wasn't contradicting myself. I have a very different view of the world and not a lot of people can understand it. I empathize with the veterans (my brother, cousin, and uncle are all veterans and both my brother and cousin receive disability pay). It fucking sucks that they're checks may stop if this drags out. For the greater good and the larger picture, it needs to happen. Once and for all, the people that were used to fight unjust wars for the imperialist oligarchy that our country is run by need to see that the elite don't give a shit about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for being on sides here, I have a firm grasp of who is who. If you have a doubt about me, I'll just say, I ain't no fucking 'tard. Dig deeper into my history and you'll see that. Also, still didn't answer why you remembered my comment from a self post that didn't rise above zero votes (and one you didn't comment in either). It's really strange.

       (1)  If indeed the U.S. defaults, it is a Shock Doctrine moment that would be bigger than 2008 -- and the golden opportunity to implement truly radical legislative
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_doctrine">
        "Emergency Law" measures
       </a>
       ; the golden opportunity of atmosphere for military/intelligence networks to create false flags that "necessitate" radical police measures; as well as the golden opportunity to transition into primitive "Apple iPhone fingerprint"-style biometric features, bitcoins-as-salvation-currency, and a meta-TPP where an elite council of corporate high priests forge a new order.  While the narcissists who will likely be responsible for pulling the trigger and blowing the brains out on the entire global economy, Ted Cruz &amp; company, will elicit not sympathy but support for the tanks that roll out on D.C. against the small-gun army that may or may not materialize, and would also end in the same fate of "Occupy Wall Street".
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering all of this, either (a) you don't really see either the implications of bringing down the entire tent upon the heads of those who will suffer most to prove a political point, or see whose parapolitical goals you are in fact supporting without knowing it, or (b) you think the Shock Doctrine IS the greater good.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) Really strange:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As for being on sides here, I have a firm grasp of who is who.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Strange that you remember who is who.  How do you remember?  And when your scorecard doesn't match what you just read this week, because you thought someone was on your side but it turns out they're on Team Rand Paul, how strange that you wouldn't remember the same name.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last thing:
      </p>
      <p>
       You think that these veterans "need to see that the elite don't give a shit about them".  That's mighty condescending -- and actually LOL absurdity.  Even if the closest you ever came to being in the military was seeing "Platoon" you'd know that THEY ALL KNOW THAT

       Now this is total speculation, but what if the nuke transfer everyone is talking about is being setup to go off in DC (False flag style)? Whoever would be doing this would need DC basically shut down if they were gonna pull it off. And better yet, need the police that are working to be distracted for a while. Considering the locations of the events, it seems plausible.
