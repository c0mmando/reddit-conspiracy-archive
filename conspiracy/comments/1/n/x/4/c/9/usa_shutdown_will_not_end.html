<p>But assume that this post is legit and submitted by a real person without any ulterior motive other then expressing their opinion. </p>

<p>This post is hyperbolic, based entirely on speculation, and shows little to no understanding of the issues that are unfolding in Washington.</p>

<p>What is this nonsense?? How does this get 38 upvotes? </p>

<p>I often come here for alternative perspectives and intelligent debates but it&#39;s this kind of nonsense that makes me come here less frequently, and the fact that it&#39;s been upvoted means that people who are just stumbling in here for the first time are unlikely to return -- except perhaps to mock the ludicrous claims made without a shred of tangible evidence. </p>

<p>And in this case -- they&#39;d be right.  </p>

<p>good lord, get some reading comprehension. <em>anything</em> referring to the future tense is speculation, no matter if it&#39;s posted on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, wikipedia, CNN, or your neighborhood newsletter. today you learned</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but I frequent a lot more subreddits than just this one. If you only use reddit for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> then you&#39;re limiting the scope of your knowledge to what happens in one particular subreddit. And I&#39;m here, as I said, to talk about alternative viewpoints and discuss things that are not openly discussed elsewhere. That doesn&#39;t mean that we shouldn&#39;t have a command of facts or reality and that we should assert speculation as fact.</p>

<p>I did that too. And it appears that my sentiments are not entirely unpopular -- except of course among the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> purists who cannot take even the slightest criticism about their precious subreddit and have to resort to &quot;love it or leave it&quot; tactics. </p>

<p>you seem to have the same problem as the other guy who replied to this comment thread. anything referring to future events, or future tense, is by definition &quot;speculation&quot;. it <em>cannot</em> be fact. this is not something that is particular to &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;. <em>anything</em> that refers to the future tense is <em>always</em> speculation. it&#39;s never going to be fact! ever.</p>

<p>the only person &quot;asserting speculation as fact&quot; is <em>you</em>. think about it for a second. someone posted a speculation about future events, and you <em>personally made the decision to treat it as fact</em>, despite the reality that this makes no sense, and is actually impossible. it hasn&#39;t happened yet. it can&#39;t be a fact. i cannot make this any more clear. </p>

<p>it seems to me like you just don&#39;t enjoy or approve of speculation about future events, which are by nature always going to be speculation. which is perfectly okay! but if this is the case, you&#39;re going to continue to run into frustration in this subreddit, because much of what is posted here is, in fact (real fact this time!), speculation about possible future events. there&#39;s nothing &quot;purist&quot; about this, it&#39;s just the way it is. and yeah, you pretty much have to love it or leave it i guess? i don&#39;t know what other advice to give you, because it&#39;s certainly not going to change.</p>

<p>sorry to be so harsh on you, but there are a lot of people who recently keep making the kind of posts that you made, and honestly the attitude you&#39;re espousing is pretty obnoxious to people who are interested in speculation and legitimate open-minded discussion. </p>

<p>tl;dr - if you don&#39;t enjoy reading and discussing speculation, don&#39;t participate in discussions that are speculation.</p>

<p>Actually I told him to post evidence to back up his assertions. That&#39;s not the same thing as censoring -- not even in the most twisted definition of censorship. But for the standard defintion of it, see your earlier comment for a prime example: </p>

<p>Speculation should be grounded in reality and supported by facts.</p>

<p>No -- that&#39;s how people who like to hear themselves speak on issues they fancy themselves as being informed upon make a mockery of the issues, themselves, and &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; at large (no matter how factual some of us may be) as is visible to anyone who is even remotely familiar with them. </p>

<p>It amazes me that you view all speculation as being uniform. As if you could lend equal credence to researched, documented speculation against ignorant and hyperbolic rhetoric just because they fall under the same category of speculation. It&#39;s as simple as determining who sounds more credible between an idiot and an intellect. </p>

<p>Oh so you&#39;re openly admitting that you&#39;re hypocritical? Or what it&#39;s justified because you <em>incorrectly</em> perceived me to be requesting someone censor themselves? </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not trying to weasel out of anything. I&#39;ve clearly established that I wasn&#39;t doing anything of the sort and you have no valid response. </p>

<p>All this Orwellian thought police nonsense is a childish overreaction to a very tempered and reasonable request that people not get out of hand and speculate just for the sake of speculation. </p>

<p>Even if there are extremely ignorant people -- which I do not dispute -- wouldn&#39;t it be better if someone was willing to share information in a non-aggressive non-condescending manner?

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not like this idea of a global collapse after the dollar collapse is a novel idea.  I&#39;ve been hearing this for like three years and many of the same economist that called the 2008 collapse are saying that we are on the cusp of another collapse that will be even more devastating than what happened in 2008.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pny7v62YSE">Dr. Jim Willie</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-CYU--VowQ">Gerald Celente</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buDsxcFcdko">Jim Rogers</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rcY97gUvg8">Marc Faber</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buqJP7y115s">Dr. Paul Craig Roberts</a>.  (Paul Craig Roberts was the assistant secretary of the treasury during the Reagan era btw. I find it ironic that most point to the Reagan era as the start of the growing disproportionate income inequality and now one the architects of the economic policies that are still in place now is against many US policies and even calls the US lawless and the president a puppet.) Whether or not the collapse will happen in the next couple weeks or so is up for debate, but surely we can speculate that it will be coming soon.  I mean this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying economic collapse is unfeasible. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is that if it does come about, it&#39;s unlikely that it will come from these debt ceiling debates. And this shutdown has far more to do with which side can tarnish the reputation of the other party the most, in my opinion.</p>

<p>As Paul Craig Roberts says himself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama has enough power under the various “war on terror” rulings to declare a national emergency and raise the debt ceiling by executive order</p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll default either.  I think the FED will keep printing money until they&#39;re blue in the face. It&#39;s been 5 years of quantitative easing from the FED. Why would anyone think that would stop? </p>

<p>I think, whatever is going on at those secret TPP talks is the next plan for getting the economy going again.  Honestly, if that falls through and nothing comes from it then maybe there will be a collapse.  </p>

<p>But there are many interesting factors that reinforce the idea that the US is preparing for a collapse.  The expansion of the NSA and DHS.  The militarization of the police force.  The fact that all of a sudden the US is the leading producer of energy resources, as if we&#39;re preparing for the incoming isolation from the rest of world. And now they throw us a nugget by giving everyone health care. Which on it&#39;s face sounds like a good thing, but it&#39;s marginalizing the upper middle class and middle class healthy people in their mid 20&#39;s to mid 30&#39;s. It feels like they&#39;re trying to redistribute wealth between middle and lower class to give everyone some sort of health care because once the dollar collapses at least we&#39;ll have our health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>This!</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for writing this.</p>

<p>My thoughts exactly. How could you not see it? Perfect timing too. </p>

<p>The govt shutdown is just an excuse to bring down the economy. If this persists past friday, then we are looking at a heavy economic downturn. </p>

<p>Middle east and Africa is nuts. Ison on tap for this winter. Fuku is reaaalyy bad (you&#39;ll see), and solar shutdown is happening (ice age to come). Plus everything OP said about the DHS, etc. </p>

<p>I see the writing on the wall and I just want to know why the frick I feel so alone with my ideas. Nothing I said was false.</p>

<p>Yet, so many go into the public and share these ideas of materialism and greed. It&#39;s not real. Collectively, humans create their reality. Ideas aren&#39;t tangible substances until humans decide they are. And, ideas can only be created by humans, no other organism. </p>

<p>So, shit people. Even though this is all over the place, I guess I just want more humans to realize that they are the ones creating the ideas and thus the collective reality.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can someone explain to me just why in the hell would the government want to collapse the system?</p>

<p>They already have everything they want from the citizens.  The rich are getting richer, and more insulated all the time from the plebs, your taxes are going up to pay for their banking schemes (and few is anyone gets punished for it). The people are easily turned on each other (zimmerman for one), and do nothing about their government spying on them and throwing away their rights. Their money is safe in foreign banks and their personal security is protected by the gates keeping them from regular people, and if need be they can easily get out for somewhere else.</p>

<p>Implementing martial law does NOTHING positive for them, they already have what they want from you, forcing the military to shoot it&#39;s own citizens will only destabilize what&#39;s working for them.</p>

<p>It makes NO SENSE to do that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve continued to mischaracterize my desire for there to be discussion grounded in reality as censorship. </p>

<p>I do not approve of censorship and I would certainly never tell anyone not to say anything, unlike yourself, a regular authoritarian dictator if it suits your purpose. </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that if you say things that sound ridiculous prepare to be mocked and at the same time perpetuate the stereotype that all conspiracy theorists are histrionic and silly. </p>

<p>I have to tell you you&#39;ve done a marvelous job. </p>
