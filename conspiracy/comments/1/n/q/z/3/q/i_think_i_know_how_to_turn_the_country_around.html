       A national Union organized right here, online. Unions are corrupt, the head of workplace unions only organize strikes when it's beneficial to those on top and that can't be changed buuuuut.... I was thinking about how free the internet currently is, how if we can get everyone to go on a mass strike the elites would have no choice but to appease us. If EVERYONE stopped working, not for a day, not for a week, but just stopped, the power would be shifted back to the people. It'd have to be organized on the internet, it's the only unregulated form of mass communication we have now. Workers of grocerie stores, of Home Depots, of everywhere, this is where we have to unite. This is where we have to organize our strike. Think about it, the country can't run if all the little guys stopped working.

       It would be a nice idea except one problem would be with the whole people stopping work. It would be extremely hard to get people to essentially quit there jobs, at least enough people to make an impact. Money holds to much power, which it shouldn't,  in our society now for people to not work.

       Didn't say it's be easy. It'd take some time, but if this idea spread throughout the entire country and everyone had a place to go to where they can "sign up" (like a website) to agree to stop working on a specified day in the future with a little people-whom-signed-up counter next to it, it might encourage them to participate. I mean, if you saw that 1,000,000 something people agreed to drop their jobs on a certain day wouldn't you join them? If 1,000,000 people dropped their jobs in a national strike surely that'd be televised. This is where it'd need to start, internet fame. You can't complain about the country and shoot down the plausible ideas that are there to change it.

       Possible solution: set up voluntary money associations and build vma machines next to every bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone can sign up to get a vma account - your thumb print is the only identification you need, but you can use other forms if you want to. No need to have a drivers license, an address, or a bank account - this ensures the system is universal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The VMA regulates how much money can be released per person per day based on how much money is within it and the rate at which money is being put into it. Anyone that is a member of the VMA can withdraw money from it. No member can withdraw more money per day than any other member.
      </p>
      <p>
       The VMA is a virtual commons. Rich socialists say "taxes should be higher for rich people," to which rich libertarians reply "people should give to charity more" and neither ends up giving up their money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes the VMA will say "reparations needed." That's a sign rich people are not putting enough money into the machine. It will be hard to get the richest to part with their money at first. The longer "reparations needed" is there, the more social pressure will grow. The more people that join, the greater the pressure will be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The VMA is an alternative source of money. The goal is to establish a world where enough money is being put in daily that everyone can flourish. People who get much of their money elsewhere and put in more than they take out will accumulate good karma.
      </p>
      <p>
       A certain percent (say, 25 - it depends how much is needed) of the money which goes into the vma could be set aside for public benefit: including education, social services, housing, health care, and infrastructure. This money could be used by states but any state would have to enter into a voluntary agreement to only use it for these purposes. This would help keep money out of the hands of politicians and the military-industrial complex while preserving the exisrence of public goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another economy (or an augmented economy) would be created alongside the real one. Deposits could be made in any currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would enable us to bypass banks, to establish an independent circuit around them. These machines could be installed globally and connected via wifi, helping remedy global wealth inequality as well as local wealth inequality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The federal reserve and the big banks already have a VMA, except its access is restricted and the federal reserve creates money out of nothing. See the bail outs:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11J_914RZ-o&amp;amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All deposits and withdrawals would be voluntary. The machines could be installed and maintained not for-profit: a company like google would be able to do it.

       What's wrong with his idea? Do you have any? Because you're not presenting any, you're just shooting down everyone elses ideas. Either you're really this narrow-minded and unable to expand your ideas or you're filtering some kind of past conscious abuse onto the internet by putting everyone else down. Which is it?

       I've got another idea. How about all the registered Dems pay the taxes they want and collect the benefits they vote for while the Rep's do the same. They get to use all the collective tax money their parties receive to base their budgets on. Make a law that fixes your affiliation for a set amount of time (4 years seems about right). There, everyone living their own dreams. Me? I'll vote Libertarian.

       This is the kind of attitude that's going to prevent any change. I EXPECT that the population will loot in order to survive. After everyone stops working it won't take long for that to happen, to keep order the government will have no choice but to appease the people. Of course I expect you to call me stupid now but I don't see anyone else coming up with a better idea.

       Your plan is a combination of suicide and murder.

       You want people to cease being able to feed themselves.

       You suggest that by throwing a tantrum and having government intercede is the best way to reign in an out of control government.

       To cease being able to feed themselves... That is the absolute stupidest thing I've ever read in my entire life. The shutdown of grocerie stores doesn't mean mass starvation, it means that once people are done looting what's inside they'd have to revert back to hunting-gathering, like humans originally did, the natural thing. I doubt that people would murder for food at a grocerie store if we weren't in some type of apocalypse. And really, you call it throwing a tantrum? That's a sad way to look at it. I didn't know demanding fair wages and financial equality via strike was "throwing a tantrum". I see you're going to be stubborn about your opinion and that's OK if you refuse to change it, you have the right to it. But to flat out deny my plan based on your opinion is childish. I doubt I'll reply to your next series of insults since you're probably one of those who believes the last word that's spoken is the winning argument, so I'll just let you have your win and be done with it.
