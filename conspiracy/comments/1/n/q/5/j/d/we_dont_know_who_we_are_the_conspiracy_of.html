       In this state of Separation, we've all lost sight of our true nature. Sure, it's one thing to read about it in a book. We can collect all sorts of great ideas about it, but to truly know something you must experience it. How many people, in the history of human civilization, have reclaimed their relationship with their Spirit? How many have experienced their Christ Consciousness or Buddha Nature? Far too few, but they made momentous contributions to humanity. We are all recipients of their contributions.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a Soul. There is a part of your Soul that has not forgotten its relationship with God. It is the part of you that cannot be corrupted. Can you imagine what this power might be able to do in this world? Even the smallest action or gesture, if guided by Spirit, can change a life. It can change the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can be a vehicle for such Greatness. That is what they are afraid of. Keeping you from your deeper nature is the biggest conspiracy there is. The power brokers on this planet understand these things. They have this wisdom. Your Spirit, that small inner voice, is constantly guiding you, sending you messages, seeking your attention. It wants to express itself through you. It needs you. The very structure of our society is fundamentally designed to keep you from it by distracting you in every way imaginable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's be honest, though. We can't really blame the powers that be, can we? At least not completely. If we are very honest with ourselves we will have to admit that we are all ambivalent. That is the nature of Separation. We love our distractions. We have all made compromises. Living in a state of Separation, we've come to enjoy our freedom. We've come to rely on our free will. Are we really ready to take guidance from our own divine nature? "What will I have to give up?" "Will I have to live like a monk?" "I don't think I'm ready for it... not yet... maybe later..."
      </p>
      <p>
       There comes a point in every Soul's journey where the distractions of physical reality no longer hold their appeal. Your attention is drawn to inner rather than outer things. This is the great turning point, you see. After being lost in the world and trying every sort of distraction there can be, trying to fulfill yourself in every way imaginable, you realize that such things can never fulfill you. You are a spiritual being. The world can never fulfill you because what you are looking for cannot be found in the world. You are looking for God - that part of you that has not forgotten its connection to God. It is the only thing that can ever fulfill you.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many paths up this mountain. A spiritual practice is the most expedient way up. Think of it as a map. Personally, I follow the
       <a href="http://www.newmessage.org/nmfg/Steps_to_Knowledge.html">
        Steps to Knowledge
       </a>
       practice. I have had good results. If you've reached the point where you can no longer find fulfillment in the world, then I'd encourage you to begin look at various spiritual practices. See which one resonates with you most. Perhaps Yoga is for you, or perhaps you are meant to be a Buddhist monk, or perhaps Zen is your calling, or maybe Sufism has your heart. There are many more to choose from.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the conspiracy. It is the conspiracy of Separation itself. You agreed to be fooled by this conspiracy when you came here. Once you see through it, however, the world looks very different. Rather than a place to lose yourself in your pursuit of happiness, it becomes a context for contribution. It becomes a place where your Spirit, using your mind and body as its vehicle, can express itself and contribute something very special through you. This is what will change the world. This is why the powers in this world - and other worlds - seek to distract you as much as possible. In truth, this is how powerful you are. You can change the world. Not your mind or your ego, but the Spirit within you. It needs you. The world needs you.

       Great post.
      </p>
      <p>
       What stands out the most to me is that part of this great conspiracy is a propaganda machine designed to make the average person feel alone and powerless, a machine or zombie toiling away just to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are made to feel too insignificant to change anything, and most believe there is no better way anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are indoctrinated by our societies and even parents into believing that the current system is the best one, that the "normal" path through life is the only "correct" path. That happiness comes from acquisition of money and power rather than human connection and love.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are told that our country is the best country, and we should be thankful we live here and not somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are told that we should follow the footsteps of our parents, get an education, work, propagate, retire, die, but
       <em>
        NEVER question it
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The most powerful entities in the world are vast collectives of elite families, corporations and banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know that human collaboration and cooperation equals power - so they attempt to divide us and set us against each-other. White against black, rich against poor, Atheists against Christians, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       They weaken our communities, making us reliant on their systems for survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       Individuals need to start coming together and cooperating towards creating the changes they want to see in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       But first people need to becoming self-actualized and aware of their "inner power", and connectivity with everything and everyone around them. When the truth is realized, the false barriers created by those in power are finally seen as illusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alternative course, which we are currently on as a society, leads to a horrible future.

       Several weeks ago I started to have conversation with my inner "secret" self. This was instigated by taking a small amount of an illegal substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since that time my life has completely changed. I now know who and what I am. Above all I know how much I am loved. In the space of a few weeks I've gone from wanting to kill myself to truly, for the first time in a long time, feeling a sense of wonder and joy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In one conversation I was told that the rest of my life would be "fucking awesome". Since then my medical conditions of 30 years have disappeared, my daughter announced she's pregnant with my first grandchild and I've givenup a 40 year long smoking habit and drink mostly water only.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything you say is true but I also believe that the so called "war on drugs" is actually just about keeping people in the dark.
