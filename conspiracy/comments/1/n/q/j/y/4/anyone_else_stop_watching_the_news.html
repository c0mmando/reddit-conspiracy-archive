       Growing up I loved watching the news. I watched it nightly. Even watched it before school and the 6pm editions in addition to the 10pm one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within the past couple years I stopped watching. It was mostly because the world was so depressing. Now it's a combination of depressing and not really knowing what's reported is true if not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I being irresponsible? Anyone else like me?

       Everything appears biased because everything IS biased. If you want the truth, you have to go to as many different sources and piece it all together yourself. Truth is hard to come by these days.

       That being said, democracynow.org is good. Another good way to follow news is to follow journalists you trust on twitter. Following glenn greenwald, david seamen, jeremy scahill will lead you to other reliable sources. See who they are following and follow those people.

       PressTV has good interviews, globalresearch is good. I enjoy RT mostly for the format i.e. they at least let their guests fucking TALK unlike the dumbed down goldfish spoonfeeding you get on us infotainment tv news where a

       'anchor' gets a yakker on for two mins and blares and interrupts constantly for 90 seconds of that with their own forced opinion.

       PressTV's news and feature propaganda is several generations more obvious than the western equivalents but they do have good interviews and guests. RT never mentions Russia, funny that. But has hot chics and is generally watchable, any agenda bs is easily left on the plate. I tend to go to BBC website to find out what I am
       <em>
        meant to think
       </em>
       on the topics of the day. It is very propaganda heavy but can still be useful, post-filtering.

       News became entertainment and a deciphering puzzle for me since the death of Michael Hastings. I knew of bias and corporate interests before, but I didn't know to mistrust literally every utterance until I looked deep into the rabbit hole.

       I stopped watching a decade ago. It made me crazy...upon reflection the blatant Cognitive Dissonance sub-consciously made me nuts. The KEN and BARBIE talking heads made me sick to my stomach...and then I discovered that a FIRE IN NORTH blah blah blah wasn't really news it was sensation. There was no local reporting. And national and international news was clearly biased and again...it told me nothing...not really. I know a fella who works at a major Psych hospital and HE does not watch the news either because he said it was bad for his mental health. It's nothing but programming. My mantra is ...IF IT IS SHOUTED OUT LOUD ON TV IT IS A LIE! Not just a partial lie either...totally fucking false!

       You are doing your mental health a favor. The news, especially mainstream media, pipes out fear on so many levels, because they feel a population that is always afraid is easier to control. They don't think rationally or logically.

       Hell yeah. One of the very first things I realized about the news before I turned 10 was that it was all bad and I had no interest in hearing bad news. The sentiment continued into my 20s, except "bad" became "depressing," and I got the feeling that if something immediately important were happening, I would hear about it one way or another. After that it became blatantly obvious how biased, controlled and generally untrustworthy the mainstream media is.

       I stopped watching ALL television back in 2002. I too watched news and investigative journalism. But I quit because:
* Local News is all about fear "are your children being molested at school? News at eleven!" and then at eleven they are all "of course not! where did you get that idea". A culture of fear is good for advertising.
* the death of 60 Minutes for me was the network alterations to the cigarette cancer stories
* the CONSTANT use by the media of the phrase "connected to Al Qaeda"; anything can be connected to anything, but they never trace those connections- just raise fear
* the lying and the sloganeering accompanying the aftermath of 911
* I read this book:

       ?"

       in my lifetime the "news" is being created. I just wanted to encourage you to look into mocking bird and cointel pro. Even further you may want to look into paperclip as well where the usg brought the natzi  best and brightest to amerika. That means the best propaganda money can buy.
with tv and people PAYING to see this setup in their homes. The mind boggles.

       The news sucks because the only thing they air are tragedies, and interviews with victims of tragedies (then the weather, and sports).  Nothing of it is vital to your daily living.  The world may be depressing but it will seem to be even more-so when you're only told about bad news.
