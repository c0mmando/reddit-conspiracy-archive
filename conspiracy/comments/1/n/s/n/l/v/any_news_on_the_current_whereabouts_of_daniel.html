       Is it just "coincidence" that 2 federal government workers are involved in the deletion of this page? Oh, and an admin because Tokyogirl79 is an admin of the english wikipedia.

       Ok and I don't disagree with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that I've revealed to you, however, that 2 of the users vying to delete the page actually work for the federal government, I wonder if you can share your thoughts on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think about the federal government assigning random federal workers to be involved in the manipulation of information online?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because there's no way in hell you're going to tell me that 2 federal government employees from completely different parts of it just randomly happened to edit the same article for no reason other than they enjoy editing articles on wikipedia. I don't believe that for a second. Way too coincidental.

       The media reports were all very conflicting as usual. The reason we know they media does this deliberately is because they are caught all of the time, as in the Trayvon Martin coverage (deliberately editing the phone call to make Zimmerman appear racist and then photo-shopping the pictures). So that is your first clue to look deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, we have a witness claiming that there was gun fire, the child was removed from the vehicle, and then more gunfire. That is an execution if true. The only reason I can think of the need to execute would be information suppression.

       It should be easy for an investigative journalist to confirm his arrest, detention center, release date, charges, etc.  According to a

       , a reporter at some point verified that he

       employed by the government.  So why can't someone confirm his whereabouts now?

       I believed every word he said. He is an unperson now, I don't doubt that at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he was news worthy and it seems that everything news worthy is kept on Wikipedia. Not Daniel Morgan Perry though, he doesn't exist and never did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do wonder how he's doing at the Ministry of Love though. Based on Bradley Manning, I doubt he's doing well.

       What? How is this a conspiracy? It says he was detained first of all. Second of all why can't this guy just be crazy? Don't you find it silly that he's throwing out snowdens name? The dudes all over the news and is a perfect person go on a crazy conspiracy rant about.

       Eh, that's from a tertiary source, so I'd put even more skepticism in that claim that the one's actually laid out by the guy ranting in the video. If I wanted to make this guy sound crazier than he was I would also make up a fake name and a fake claim like this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible he's just crazy, and if that's the case then we would have at least heard a statement from him or heard something about a sentencing from his family or lawyer. But that hasn't happened. And what if he isn't crazy? With all this shit going on with the government you're just going to write him off? I'm just saying it's a matter worth following up on.
