<p>What? -- Edward Snowden is barely three months old, and we&#39;re already forgetting him.  They can wait for 10 years if they have to -- and then, one day when you least expect it, there he is, dead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the defining thing about why Snowden was big news while the other whistleblowers who were saying the same thing weren&#39;t is that Snowden had official documents from the agencies themselves proving that what the other whistleblowers were saying was true. I think that while it&#39;s smart to be super wary of these organizations, 100% smart, you have to keep in mind that they are still bureaucracies, with stupid, emotional, imperfect humans behind the scenes. That&#39;s not to say that they aren&#39;t terrifyingly inhuman organizations, but we shouldn&#39;t be propping up this idea that these agencies are so superhuman that they become godlike. Fuck them, fuck that. They&#39;re not all-powerful, they don&#39;t run the world. They run because they get taxpayers to pay for their upkeep. It&#39;s not beyond hope. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you do a little research on the subject, you&#39;ll find that Snowden didn&#39;t release any documents the Guardian did and they got permission from the NSA to do so.  If I could find the video of the editor from the Guardian saying all of this I will post it.  Adam Curry on No Agenda podcast really hit the nail on the head with all of that, he had a TON of Glenn Greenwald/Laura Poitras clips in regards to this.  Greenwald and Poitras are Soros agents by the way, they work for his foundations, understand that, Soros being a globalist billionaire.  This whole Snowden thing did nothing but make the US an even bigger enemy in the world which will make the transition to world government much much much easier to the rest of the world.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other intelligence agency would willingly send out a message that they&#39;re incompetent. Keep in mind that these groups look to recruit some of the most technically talented people in America. Consider for example <a href="http://chasebrandon.com/">Chase Brandon</a>, who used to be the CIA&#39;s propaganda liaison to Hollywood. His job was to make CIA look <em>awesome</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Within those parameters he provided a decade of technical consultation to many feature films and television series such as The Recruit, Sum of All Fears, The Bourne Identity, Alias, and 24; as well as documentary programs to include the Discovery, Learning and Military channels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t find the link to where I read/heard this, but Brandon has talked about how the negative publicity the CIA gets actively hurts their recruiting. Why work for the CIA, which is widely ridiculed as incompetent and alleged to be frankly evil, when instead you could work for Google or Facebook? </p>

<p>Why has General Alexander from NSA/CSS/Cybercommand been so public in the past few years, even giving lectures at hacker conferences? Because he&#39;s trying to <em>recruit</em> the hackers. He&#39;s made this point perfectly clear in his lectures. </p>

<p>Now if anyone thinks they have <em>specific</em> evidence that points to intelligence agencies tainting their own reputations, by all means let&#39;s hear it. But I think it&#39;s ridiculous to think there&#39;s some sort of propaganda campaign telling us that the intelligence agencies are idiots. </p>

<p>Particularly because in reality, the CIA <em>is</em> brimming with idiots. There&#39;s a reason the eggheads at NSA call CIA the &quot;pickle factory&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely the case with things like bitcoin. Early adopters are inspired to believe that they are pulling one over on the central banks and the NSA as a way to have these very people develop and promote it. Same thing happened with the web itself. They seed labs in the wild, in the shadows and guide and coopt what works. By the time Amazon and Paypal are using bitcoin the Satoshi fairytale will be generally unknown. Speaking about it will get you labelled a conspiracy theorist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just have to agree with you on that.  They promoted bitcoin through the very people who should be the most against a digital only currency.  The libertarian/anarcho types are usuaully about &quot;hard money&quot; that is until their &quot;celebrities&quot; started pushing bitcoin and now they trade in bitcoins a literally worthless currency.  Its a classic trojan horse.  I&#39;ve been SHOUTING this for a long time but people are such sheep, even the people who claim to be &quot;awake&quot; are still taken in by it.  </p>
