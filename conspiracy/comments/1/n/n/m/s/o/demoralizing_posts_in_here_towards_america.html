<p>its the 45 goals for communist takeover of America, one of the goals is to discredit America and its culture to demoralize us. A lot of conspiracy theorists are on the jump on America bandwagon and I think <em>some</em> people&#39;s hearts are in the right place but they are barking up the wrong tree. The real conspiracy are those intent on breaking us down from within. They&#39;ve infiltrated all offices, media and the education field to destroy the American ideals, there IS an agenda and if it was exposed it probably would be deemed to fantastic &amp; bizarre to be believed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Americans let&#39;s get off our asses, put down the remote and smart phones/laptops and so on, get outside and get involved. Let&#39;s go to city council meetings, any political meetings we can get to as a public citizen, make some noise. Marxists, weirdos and those with agendas have been making sure THEY showed up- and while we were sleeping they took over the wheel. Anything that&#39;s been happening is OUR own fault! Let&#39;s take it back! </p>

<p>I learned a lot from a Mr Brian Gerrish- he&#39;s in UK but what he&#39;s accomplished is amazing. Here in US Americans have never heard of &quot;Common Purpose&quot; but we have that weird conspiracy here in spades. We <em>know</em> that something isn&#39;t &quot;quite right&quot; but we don&#39;t know exactly what it is.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I am I think that is what is wrong is that to many people here in america won&#39;t stand up any more and just let others talk like op and then agree with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what about the Americans that &quot;won&#39;t stand up&quot; because standing up means arrest by law enforcement or worse?</p>

<p>The revolution won&#39;t take on the forms you&#39;ve seen on television or in the movies. It&#39;s already happening. But at this juncture, <em>it&#39;s ineffective</em> to stand up and hoot and holler like a goddamn moron. We have to approach this in an intelligent manner, and that means not immediately caving to emotional counterproductive nonsense.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a brief talk by a KGB defector from 30 years ago that talks about just this problem. Brief summary...he talks about the three stages of PSYOPS towards an enemy nation...demoralization (this stage is complete), destabilization (almost complete or complete), followed by crisis (which could be argues to have already occurred although I think a bigger crisis is required.)</p>

He outlines basic Soviet PSYOP policy from 30 years ago...eye opening and fascinating...I have always been fascinated by cointel and psyops so maybe I am just overly impressed by how easily he describes a situation that I have been watching unfold for 13 years now...but never had the vocabulary or understanding of the scope of the issue..it&#39;s massive!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, demoralization is a tried and true tactic of propaganda.  This is why it is very important that individuals really learn to think for themselves, stay educated, and try to stay involved.  If the population doesn&#39;t respect this inward journey of values, the country they are a member of is going to stray from any value set it may appear to represent.  America, is a Prime example of this.  America is on some bullshit right now.  America and its 3 letter agencies are up to no good more often then naught.  America lies to its public.  America and its leaders are not setting the right examples for the future when it comes to the environment, children, and longevity of humanity.  Cash is King in the land of the free and that is the way it is.  Now I am not saying it is different or better anywhere else, but lets get real.  The almighty dollar is what drives our values.  The almighty dollar and pursuit of POWER is what the military defends nowadays.  You don&#39;t defend freedom, and haven&#39;t for a long time.  That is blatant propaganda just on the other spectrum of demoralization.  If America was invaded or faced a serious threat, I would defend the land, but that is not what we do.   We show smiles and bring tears of war/debt instead.  </p>

<p>So back to people getting involved.  How can people stay involved when they have to work all the time to support themselves or their families?  How can people get involved when they are afraid of being arrested/profiled/ID&#39;d/Labeled for anything that may go against what big institutions don&#39;t have planned?   How can people stay informed when the media, to whom they trust, are nothing more than a circus?</p>

<p>I appreciate your sentiment, but if you want to save this country, it needs to change from some hard truths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t be intimidated know your rights I myself have been harassed by tsa, dhs, and border security at more then just airports. The key is fight back but know what you are doing don&#39;t take and shit from them.</p>

<p>As for working all the time pfffff I am only home 5 - 8 days a month with a wife a four yo boy a dog a ferret and 8 chickens and I manage to enlighten at least one person every few days to the shit going on so that excuse is null. And if people are driven by the dollar whatever yeah I work a lot cause I got a plan and I want certian things for my family it isn&#39;t that they want them but I want it for them.</p>

<p>Plus I help at many organizations in my community mostly infant crisis centers and you need money to do that it is my job as an american is to offer aid to those that need the help and won&#39;t take advantage of it and babies I feel won&#39;t take advabtage of me lol.</p>

<p>Parents yes but it isn&#39;t the kids fault they got shit parents and I teach my son these values and he is only of the most generous children many have ever seen and courtious to everyone. I have yet to have anyone say anything bad about him. Yeah he is a kid and by no means perfect. That is my job to raise him and do my best to instill values in his character. </p>

<p>As for staying informed by the media it is something I really try to make people avoid I promote this forum and explain how to filter the bullshit best thing here is there are usually comments of people debunking the bullshit. If they still choose media then oh well I tried it is all I can do is my best and yes I understand that sometimes my best isn&#39;t good enough.</p>

<p>Best advise I give people is stay happy tou only get one shot at life make it count if you touch one persons life you made a differance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See I disagree with your first statement.  The majority of the population a) don&#39;t know their rights and b) don&#39;t want to be hassled.  They shouldn&#39;t have to be.  It doesn&#39;t take but a fart in the wrong direction to be arrested for speaking your mind nowadays.  If you were &#39;protected&#39;, you wouldn&#39;t have to worry about that.  For most people, its just easier to avoid the hassle and that is my point.  It also makes me think to the labor movement in the start of the 20th century and what those people fought for, just so people could have a normal work week and days off.  People died for those &#39;perks&#39;.</p>

<p>Also, the &#39;What can I do attitude&#39; is a huge limiter because people cannot assemble.  The people don&#39;t have power with out assembly.  Assembly has been effectively curbed.  Although, I will say the Syria consensus among the population was refreshing.  IMO.</p>

<p>I know about being busy and what it takes  Im not saying its an excuse. After working 10hrs a day+kids+dinner+soccer+school, who wants to worry about &quot;insert cause here&quot;.  Most  people won&#39;t react until something effects their paradigm.    </p>

<p>I do agree that if you have kids, raising them to be wakeful is probably our best bet.  And raising your kids with values should just be a standard, but people are not perfect and well we have to deal with that.  You then get into socioeconomic issues, drugs, or just plain deadbeats.   Or perhaps, that is all they know? </p>
