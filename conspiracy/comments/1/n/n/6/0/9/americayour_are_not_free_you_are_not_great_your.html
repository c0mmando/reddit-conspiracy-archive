        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I like Americans and recently had a wonderful holiday in New York, but seriously, why do so many Americans keep talking about America as the home of the free?</p>

<p>You have no money (the Fed took it all)</p>

<p>You have no freedom to walk unhindered in the streets (NY police can stop and frisk you randomly)</p>

<p>You have compulsory third-party auto-insurance and pretty soon compulsory health insurance at insanely high prices (obamacare).</p>

<p>You can&#39;t smoke in public places (but smoking is legal).</p>

<p>You can fight for your nation but not drink alcohol (legal drinking age in the rest of the world is—for the most part—equal or less than the military draft age).</p>

<p>In my recent three week NY holiday I found the US to be the most controlling and afraid nation I have been in as regards personal freedoms.  There is a massive delusion going on there.</p>

<p>You are taxed by your government on your income, on your sales, on your health, and most seriously on inflation which is destroying your money.  Three years ago one US dollar bought two dollars in my country.  Now it buys $1.20.  You have lost nearly half your money&#39;s value and guess where it went?  The Fed—a private corporation.</p>

<p>The question I have to ask is this: why the hell haven&#39;t you had another revolution?  The first was over far less!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We haven&#39;t had a revolution because the vast majority of the American people are still comfortable with their lot in life. It&#39;s strange: Americans are raised with the mentality that if life is rough, it&#39;s because they aren&#39;t trying hard enough. That&#39;s why you see Americans just kind of taking what&#39;s being thrown at them, they&#39;ve been conditioned to do just that. </p>

<p>A lot of &#39;aware&#39; Americans I talk to say that people will get in the streets when the food is gone. But even these people are stupid, because when the food is gone IT&#39;S TOO LATE to do something about the rampant corruption. </p>

<p>Also, Americans seem to believe the only way to revolt is violently, with bombs and property damage. Again, because they&#39;re taking cues from our corrupt media that tells them to stay at home and ingest the programming. It&#39;s a really sad state of affairs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s less about people being comfortable with their lot in life than it is the mass media and the government having a firm grip on public opinion.  </p>

<p>People are only &#39;comfortable&#39; to the extent that they aren&#39;t starving and their nose is just above water financially. But they are extremely unhappy with that situation and are <em>willing and able</em> to politically mobilize but they simply don&#39;t know who to believe. </p>

<p>And they&#39;ve completely fallen into a reliance on the mass media to tell them what to think and what to be afraid of out of some old idealized Frank Capra notion that the mass media press are the watchdogs of the country which could not be further from the truth. They are either shameless sensationalist ratings whores, sycophantic mouthpieces for a political agenda, or owned outright by someone with a political agenda.  And the ones truly trying to adhere to higher journalistic standards are too far below the radar to have a significant impact on the public discourse.  </p>

<p>Politically, the gloves are off, and it&#39;s become some statecraft nightmare melee where everyone is spinning every word, everything is some form of propaganda and no one gets the real unvarnished truth. And even when someone stands up and tells the truth there will be someone else of &quot;stature&quot; who will stand up and proclaim it a bold faced lie. </p>

<p>And there is a reason for that... The one thing the people who pull the strings of power in this country fear the most in an informed and unified populace.  They have a vested interest in keeping everyone politically at odds. Just ask yourself this, in a country this homogenized do you really think that nearly every important issue (according to the press) the country is split so evenly?  Thus intentionally confused, in this situation they&#39;re willing to believe the most credible talking head regardless of whether or not truth is coming out of its mouth. Result, a population confused into inaction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. It&#39;s in their interest to highlight and prolong the most divisive issues like abortion, gay marriage, climate change, healthcare, etc... These topics do not have easy solutions and will keep the American people divided and conquered for decades to come yet they are the ones we focus on. There are so many things that can be fixed quickly and easily that would benefit the people but are not good for GDP and crony capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand people being split on gay marriage, religion, &amp; abortion.  Those are <em>social issues</em> not political ones.  But most people treat them <em>as if</em> they&#39;re political ones. </p>

<p>The elite who run this country do not really care about those issues. The more attention people devote to those things the less they pay attention  to what the elite are doing - draining the wealth out of the country and destroying our sovereignty and rights.  They&#39;re quite happy to have everyone gnashing at each other about gay marriage and legalizing pot.  </p>

<p>It is the very fact that most people consider <em>social issues</em> like those to be the burning political issues of the day rather than how our country is governed, our monetary &amp; banking system, foreign policy, and our constitutional rights is exactly why we allow ourselves to be manipulated. The main stream media generously helps make it that way by focusing on them instead of real issues which would bore their target lowest common denominator  audience.  And sadly, stupid is as stupid does. </p>

<p>I take that back. I think if collectively we were genuinely informed without agenda spinning, had healthier role models in both the social and political arenas, that collectively everyone, even the lowest common denominator, would add to a more responsible and healthier self-governance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A revolution had been launched against rationality and truth. Those who question authority are instantly considered &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; simply for coming to logical conclusions based on the evidence in front of them. The term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; has been harnessed into a pejorative weapon with which to bludgeon free speech, healthy skepticism and independent thinking. 
 In reality, todays &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is someone who has managed to retain some remnant of control over their own thought process and one who has successfully resisted becoming another victim of &#39;gaslighting&#39; - an individual who knows when they are being lied to. 
 We live in an era where the the &#39;big lie&#39; has come to dominate virtually every sector of modern society - from news to entertainment, to foreign policy and politics, the economy and healthcare. Only by refusing to become victims of &#39;gaslighting&#39; can we truly remain sane, rational, and not allow our understanding of the world to be shaped by those who see us as obsolete.</p>

<p>The legitimacy of the Government is being called into question. That simple concept is the birth of revolution. I can&#39;t tell you what it will look like, but I doubt patriotic gun owners are what&#39;s going to make or break it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We had really good leaders in 1776, now we have puppets who inspire apathy. They put fluoride in our water, and our education system is just propaganda. Our media has been taken over. And our culture is geared towards pleasing oneself. Yes we got it good most people have running water, Electricity, Air conditioning, Vehicles, all the garbage food, drugs and sex you could possibly want. As a result 90% of the population doesn&#39;t give a fuck about whats going in our government much less the rest of the world. We are still great, but all of humanity is capable of greatness. However I don&#39;t like our attitude that we are better then the rest of the world. And the constitution is being raped by all 3 branches, but it is the only thing keeping back the dark tides for now!    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you know there are many types of fluoride and municipal water fluoridation only benefits a small subset of the population that has poor dental hygiene?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, yes, I&#39;m aware there are a number of <em>sources</em> of fluoride ions. Once the water is fluoridated, it&#39;s all the same thing though. As for your claim that &quot;water fluoridation only benefits a small subset of the population that has poor dental hygiene&quot;, that&#39;s a pile of bullshit.</p>

<p>Fluoride is not a medication, and acting like you&#39;re being put at serious risk is ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Intelligent opposition to fluoridation is against the delivery method and the inefficient targeting of treatment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, I didn&#39;t realize I was dealing with the <em>intelligent opposition</em>. Excuse me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure even the people who think fluoride is part of a mind control plot consider themselves the intelligent opposition.</p>

<p>Show me some evidence that the delivery method does not work, or that the &quot;inefficient targeting&quot; is causing problems, and then maybe you&#39;ll have a case, but you&#39;re talking out of your ass here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On top of that there are negative consequences from having too much fluoride and long term studies are still inconclusive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are also negative consequences of having too much water. I have seen zero evidence that fluoridating water at recommended levels poses any notable risk.</p>

<p>...and long term studies are inconclusive about <em>what</em>? Whether there&#39;s any risk? I think it&#39;s pretty clear that there isn&#39;t, but the idea that the jury is still out on this one probably comes not from any real doubts on the part of scientists, but from idiots who don&#39;t understand science. At some point, someone probably asked a scientist &quot;...but do you know absolutely for sure that there&#39;s no harm being done?&quot;, and when the scientist said &quot;no&quot;, as any reasonable scientist would, the idiot took that as an admission that it hasn&#39;t been adequately studied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there a difference between &quot;natural&quot; fluoride and &quot;artificial&quot; fluoride?</p>

<p>&quot;The claim that fluoridation is one of &#39;nature&#39;s experiments&#39; is not valid because the salts put into the water supply, sodium fluoride or silicofluorides, are industrial products never found in natural water or in organisms. They are, furthermore, notoriously toxic, sufficiently so to be used as rat poison or insecticide. Calcium fluoride, on the other hand, which is the form commonly found in natural waters, is not toxic enough for such uses.&quot; — Dr. C. G. Dobbs, (Ph.D., A.R.C.S.) Bangor, Wales, England.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, there isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>This &quot;Dr&quot; C. G. Dobbs doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about. (Oddly enough, pretty much the only reference I can find online to that guy is that quote... and something about him speaking at a mycology conference, why would you refer to a mycologist as though he knows anything about the dangers of fluoridation?).</p>

<p>Fluoride is an ion of fluorine. It doesn&#39;t matter whether you introduce it to the water as sodium fluoride or as calcium fluoride, it comes out identical.</p>

<p>Either way, sodium fluoride <em>does</em> exist naturally, and claiming it&#39;s only introduced by man is bullshit.</p>

<p>As for using sodium fluoride as rat poison, that&#39;s also bullshit (although it doesn&#39;t really matter anyways, the dose makes the poison... even water will kill you if you drink enough). The LD50 of sodium fluoride for rodents is about 100mg/kg. That means a small rat weighing 100g would have to eat 10mg in order to likely die... and that&#39;s a pretty large amount for a small animal. This certainly isn&#39;t in the range of being a reasonable poison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like pretty much all revolutions come to violence, or have violence lurking behind the curtain waiting to jump out when/if the peaceful protest fails, which is probably what makes allowing the nonviolent protest to have their way so appealing. </p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking about the civil rights movement last century, and wondering if the Black Panthers didn&#39;t provide that little bit of incentive to TPTB to allow, to a certain extent, the nonviolent movement to get what they wanted. If the nonviolent movement were to fail <em>completely</em> I think the Black Panthers and similar groups would have had more armed demonstrations at the capitols, but with larger numbers, and actually firing their weapons instead of just holding them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>tl;dr  No.  The Constitution is a framework that is reinterpreted over time, and US laws do evolve.  The biggest change is that we see the government as having the power to take away our rights instead of being limited to the powers we give it, which is one reason it will be incredibly difficult to get Americans to revolt.</p>

<p>Realistically, the Constitution is so ingrained in the American way of thought (source: I&#39;m American) regarding how a democracy should be run that we will likely never abandon it, much the same way there are parts (3 according to Wikipedia, for whatever that is worth) of the Magna Carta (from 1215) that are still in effect where you live.  The Constitution only outlines how the federal government should be set up, a sort of loose set of goals, and we have used Congress, the courts, and lately the executive bureaucracy to interpret the various provisions and fill in the details.  It was written as a framework so that it would stand the test of time, and the provisions can be reinterpreted as time marches forward.  The Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution, are supposed to be areas where the government doesn&#39;t encroach on our freedoms.  Courts have whittled much of that away over time, mostly in the name of public safety, so our rights are a shell of what they once were, but we cling to them under the idea that the government can&#39;t take those away from us.  The Supreme Court has also implied other rights into the Constitution, like the right to privacy, so we have that going for us.  The laws here do change and evolve.  Once upon a time our federal government had limited powers enumerated in the constitution, and would leave much to the decision of the states.  They have greatly expanded their reach over the last century or so and touch nearly every area of life.  When we get new justices in the Supreme Court, things can and are adjusted and old laws occasionally overturned with new cases.  </p>

<p>The real travesty is that we see government as having the power to take our rights away, when the way the document was written was that the government has no rights except those we give to it.  It&#39;s an interesting shift in thought, and one reason that it will take much effort to ever get the American people to revolt again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that they won a democratic election.</p>

<p>Everyone has always been criticizing the government. People criticized the government all the time in Germany.</p>

<p>The US is a country where free speech is an important element of society. The idea that the police in the US are free to &quot;raid your house, shoot your dog and terrorize you with no reprimands&quot; is nonsense, as demonstrated by the fact that when these things happen, they get a huge amount of publicity on sites like reddit.</p>

<p>Yes, there are plenty of examples of police abuse, but you have to be seriously uneducated to think that these are comparable to the systemic control in Hitler&#39;s Germany.</p>

<p>Nobody&#39;s claiming that there aren&#39;t problems with the US, but acting like it&#39;s turning into Nazi Germany is ridiculous.</p>

<p>A look at the rise of the Golden Dawn party would be a far more apt comparison. The Nazis weren&#39;t an old, well established party, they were thugs who became popular in the midst of economic turmoil.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t about that. Having a certain political affiliation or views makes you a target in the US in all sorts of ways. IRS investigations, OWS under scrutiny from the DHS, Ron Paul bumper stickers being made out to be a sign of terrorism, 9/11 opposing views being classed as terrorism by the FBI. That is fucking scary and there is a trend in all of that behavior. It displays opposition to the status quo which  is why you become a target for doing so. You may not be being dragged out of your home <em>yet</em> but would you be surprised if it come to that?</p>

<p>One thing a lot of outsiders don&#39;t know--but is hammered within this community--is the difference between zionism and anti-Semitism. Zionism is a largely political ideology, whereas anti-Semitism is prejudice against the religious beliefs and blanketed discrimination of Jewish people. </p>

<p>Ergo, I can be against the expansion of Israel and be against Netanyahu&#39;s aggressive policies (anti-Zionist) without hating all Jewish people and their religious beliefs (anti-Semitism). And yet, there&#39;s a systematic effort by groups like AIPAC to link these two things together as one in the same.   </p>

<p>To talk of zionist bankers is far from being the same thing as saying &quot;them dirty Jews control the world!&quot; </p>

<p>Dude, I sort of get your point, but no good leader would attempt to commit genocide against groups of people across an entire continent.

<p>You can&#39;t separate war and genocide from how he ruled a country, though. At least, not when weighing him as a &quot;great leader&quot; in the same breath. Again, attributes of his reign may be seen as favorable. But to summarize Hitler as a &quot;great leader&quot; is... unconscionable, really. The very neutral fact is that the man systematically executed 6 million people by no fault other than their religion and/or their allegedly inferior genes.</p>

<p>Also, to say he &quot;did a lot of positive things for the people of Germany&quot; is to exclude Jews, the gypsies, and gays from that whole category. These people definitely wouldn&#39;t agree with your perspective, nor would the non-targeted people who had to live in fear of speaking out against the Reich and its policies.</p>

<p>So EXCLUDING the things you continually reference and return to the conversation, EXCLUDING the genocide as i mentioned above, and EXCLUDING the crimes he committed, <strong>YES he was</strong>. why youre arguing with me is mind boggling. you continue to point back to his crimes on humanity despite me strictly excluding these qualities and actions from my analysis. Want to contest my point? point to germanys social polcies at the time. or the crime rate, or any other possible thing that constitutes how &quot;good&quot; a country is running.</p>

<p>considering you only use quotation marks when making <em>DIRECT QUOTES</em> and not when you paraphrase, my assessment and insult to your literacy and others is well placed. but hey , i guess not all of us went to the 4rth grade.</p>

<p>Secondly, for you to say i &quot;cherry pick&quot; facts(see how i properly used quotes there? take notes child) is so laughable it does nothing but confirm that you and your ilk are indeed morons, incapable of even understanding the most simple of sentences. I have made a clear distinction in all my comments, that im excluding the war and genocide aspect AND even made several references to it anyways to repel you and equally brain dead bottom-feeders at bay. Do you know what cherry picking even means? clearly not because it doesnt even apply here. im discussing and referencing (and have been in every comment now) <em>everything</em> prior to 1939 ( 1939, ie the start of WW2. ie, when Hitler began invading countries, ie when Hitler could be identified as a warmonger....do i need to break it down for you even more?). Thats nearly an entire DECADE of time im mentioning and assessing, but just because im excluding WW2 im cherry picking? hahahaha oh man, You and your butt hurt friends are clearly sad that someone isnt insulting your designated depiction of a &#39;bad guy&#39;. </p>

<p>i presented economic and social data of germany at the time. what have you and your fellow bottom-feeders provide? Oh yeah, &#39;but hes bad!! say hes bad!! wahhhhhhh!&#39;</p>

 cherry-picking
1.
selectively choose (the most beneficial items) from what is available.</p>

<p>By definition, you have cherry picked only what is beneficial to your argument. You have used the epitome of the term to paint a rosy picture while disregarding large chunks of history, again, under the guise of not qualifying as leadership attributes which is the silliest thing I&#39;ve ever heard. It&#39;s cute though how you keep trying to tell me how upset I am as you furiously type away inserting as many insults as you can muster in an attempt to validate your worth. Facts are facts. Leadership is judged by the entirety of the reign in question... a fact you can deny all you want, but does not change. As an entirety, he was a terrible leader. That&#39;s all there is to it. No matter how hard you want to cherry pick, again by definition, only what supports your stance, it doesn&#39;t change the entire scope. Now, calm down and go shine your boots.

And then after a barrage of absolute mind-nubing stupidity, you argue my point for me and in the same breath berate me for &quot;cherry-picking&quot;, (despite it coming down to only 2 chunks of time, post and pre WW2, hardly &quot;cherry-picking).</p>

<p>A brand new volkswagon in Germany back then would have costed 7k-8k (adjusted for inflation). Considering how their economy as so powerful several years BEFORE hitler began invading in 1939</p>

<p>Happy to.</p>

<p>The <em>Kraft durch Freude</em> car (Volkswagen) was supposed to cost 990 Reichsmark. That&#39;s quite some money. A &quot;powerful economy&quot; merely meant that people had enough for rent and living. There was a special program where people could pay 5 Reichsmark every month to get a Volkswagen in the end. The problem is, Germany started WWII before any of that could happen. Production sites in Wolfsburg were finished, but the steel for the cars was instead used for <em>Kübelwagen</em> and other Wehrmacht material.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, Germanys economy at the time was improving WELL before Poland and hit 0 at roughly the same time the occupation started. suggesting his economy improved because of it is simply a lie</p>

<p>So in the sense of a ruler of a country, and everything a ruler would generally do, he was indeed a great leader.

<p>This is just completely, totally wrong, and I think you&#39;ll even have to admit that you made up that distinction.  What you are saying is that anything good he did are the &#39;qualities of a great leader&#39; and anything bad he did is not, so should not be considered as to whether or not he was a great leader?</p>

<p>If Obama made sure unemployment was 0% but then tried to take over the world and ruined the country, would he be a &#39;great ruler?&#39; No, of course not, because part of ruling your country is about deciding whether or not to invade other countries at the possible risk of health to your own citizens.</p>

<p>the distinction that majority of world leaders  didn&#39;t commit mass genocide and invade other countries? No, not made up, but very factual.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>no, what im saying, speaking strictly as leader of a country and all leader-related duties of a country, he had the ualities of a good leader. And as i stated VERY VERY clearly (no excuse not to understand, as you just did) that committing genocide and invading countries are NOT qualities of a leader; so with that said, looking STRICTLY AT HIS QUALATIES OF LEADERSHIP AS A LEADER OF A COUNTRY(<em>again, genocide is NOT a quality of a ruler of a country</em>), he gets good marks in every category.</p>

<p>Ive stated many times that his his good leadership does not take away from his crimes. I dont know what other combination of words i can give you so please just read this carefully because im tired of rephrasing my statements a different way for guy that struts along. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>im going to explain this 1 last time. i have, repeatedly and explicitly excluded the war and genocide from the analysis and stated this many times. Why you and others continue to refer to that when i explicitly stated im not even looking at that aspect, is beyond me. So no, your obama analogy falls flat on its face because thats not what i was saying or implying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And can I just say that Hitler died cursing the German people for being cowards and not following him with enough loyalty</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ive yet to find a credible source that confirms this. But lets assume for a moment its true, you claim he cursed them for not following him <em>enough</em> meaning the normal civlian population had no problem with Hitler until he started committing war crimes, which aligns perfectly with what im saying.</p>

<p>if you have a &quot;rebuttle&quot; just say it quietly to yourself and just reread one of my comments for my response. Ive made myself very clear and precise and already covered every point youve made</p>

<p>But you CAN&#39;T DO THAT and make a valid point about his leadership. You can&#39;t examine how someone performs at their job and exclude a huge portion of what they do in that job.

<p>yes i fucking can because im not talking about his leadership as a whole you bumbling idiot. how many times do i have to fucking explain that? please tell what combination of words would you be able to understand so that it phases into that skull of yours.

<p>IM NOT TALKING ONLY ABOUT THE GOOD THINGS HE DID. im talking about the economic and social and international policies he put in place BEFORE HE WENT OFF THE WALL AND BECAME A WAR CRIMINAL. You know, thew things that QUALITY OF LEADERSHIP THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE DONE AND ARE MEASURED BY. </p>

<p>Any fucking insane asshole can send his country to war, thats not a quality you use to determine ones leadership ability; how he dealt with the people, economy and his country ARE.</p>

<p>Im not picking and choosing, im excluding everything after 1939 and looking at him purely as a leader of a country and NOT a man who went off the walls committing genocide. im looking at nearly a 10 year long period and deriving my judgement. YOU however, cant seem to see anything beyond &quot;evil nazi aagaghh!!&quot;</p>

<p>Im not talking about Hitler as a whole, im not talking about his place in history, im not talking about whether or not he should be on TIME magazine or being gods gift to man. Im talking about what he did purely as a chancellor and not a dictator as he slowly became.</p>

<p>honestly, im drawing a clear line in the sand, pointing at 1 side, meanwhile youre running around like a chicken with his head cut off amazed at why im not looking at it as a whole. Unbelievable, its like youve never spoke to a human being in your life</p>

<p>You started off by saying &quot;Hitler was a great leader.&quot;  Yes, you have explained that you are &#39;excluding everything after 1939&#39; but you&#39;ve never explained WHY you can just lop off the period where he ruined his country when examining his role as a leader.

There is no poorer show of leadership than leaving your country a crater and shadow of its former self.</p>

<p>You have never ONCE explained WHY taking your country to war is somehow not involved with the role of &#39;being a leader.&#39;</p>

<p>You&#39;re so obsessed with the fact that you hold an unpopular opinion and I don&#39;t that you&#39;re basing your whole fucking argument on it.  I can&#39;t believe that you honestly believe that whether someone takes their country into an insane and self-destructive war is &#39;not a quality you use to determine ones leadership ability&#39; because YES IT IS.</p>

<p>firstly, yes i did. many times. go and read.

<p>yes i have. multiple times and even put it in all caps for you. Go back and read it again. slowly and with an adult</p>

<p>again, i never said that. if youre going to quote me, do so accurately and within context.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re so obsessed with the fact that you hold an unpopular opinion </p>

<p>unpopular opinion? this isnt my opinion, this is fact. The german people loved him for a time. His economy was exploding, everyone had a job and everyone was able to afford a car. Germanys war debts from WW1 were dwindling at a rapid pace. This isnt an &quot;unpopular opinion&quot; this is fucking history, regardless of whether or not you accept it, you simply look like a fool infront of everyone you share your ideas to. </p>

<p>and 3 times , you deliberately quote me out of context, (maybe not deliberate, i find it hard someones this stupid <em>on purpose</em>) spin my view, build your strawman and tear him down. Do you understand how quotes work? clearly not since you failed to use them properly 3 times now. i said clearly sending ones country to war is not a quality to determine ones leadership, not &quot;whether someone takes their country in an insane and self-destructive war&quot; (a statement thats riddled with fallacy since no one knew at the time it was self destructive and the germans had a solid footing for a good portion of it). </p>

<p>You continually go back to his war crimes and whine and complain about why im not making fun of him like youve been conditioned to do your whole life. How many world leaders today went into a &quot;self-destructive war&quot;? none? well shit, i guess we all have perfect leaders since thats your litmus test! oh joy!</p>

<p>what a fucking nut. unless im vilifying him, im considered to be drinking his milk. what a backwards and ignorant state of thinking.</p>

<p>please, tell me again about this war you cant seem to get out of your head again so i can tell you my statement excluded that time period. its kinda fun telling an idiot the same thing over and over again and watching them squirm in their seats because im not insulting the person theyve been conditioned to insult</p>

<p>The only way you could possible make it work is to say &quot;BEFORE 1939, Hitler was a great leader.&quot;  I would disagree with you, but it would at least be some kind of a valid point.  In fact, you&#39;re claiming that IS what you said or something... but it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>I love how you think you&#39;re some free-minded guy and i&#39;m an idiot because I&#39;ve been &#39;conditioned&#39; to believe that Hitler was a bad guy.  You&#39;re a fucking moron.  This is my favorite part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>please, tell me again about this war you cant seem to get out of your head again so i can tell you my statement excluded that time period. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you&#39;re saying your original statement excluded that time period, but you forgot to mention it and we all should have assumed it? Dumbass.  Here is your original statement:  &quot;In the ruling sense, Hitler was a great leader. unemployment was near 0, everyone had a car, and a radio.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;ve just completely made up your own definition of &quot;In the ruling sense&quot; and you&#39;re pathetically defending it despite the fact that no one uses &#39;ruling&#39; to fucking exclude wars started by the leader.</p>

<p>oh im sorry, do i HAVE to start my sentances off like that just so YOU understand? </p>

<p>Secondly, i CONSTANTLY referred to his actions within the country and explicitly stated im not considering his WW2 endeavors. </p>

<p>So lets use 3rd grade logic.</p>

<p>I claim his leadership and state multiple times im ommitting his WW2 actions<br/>
I list and explain economic, social and financial practices hes done  </p>

<p>Now since we all know WW2 started in 1939, and i said im excluding the things done during this time. how the FUCK are you unable to come to this conclusion? &quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>YOU CAN&#39;T FUCKING SAY THAT AND DECIDE TO IGNORE A HUGE PORTION OF HIS LEADERSHIP.</p>

<h2>i can if i said im not analyzing his entire career as chancellor and focusing on a particular part. which i did SEVERAL times, you fucking idiot. </h2>

<blockquote>
<p>So you&#39;re saying your original statement excluded that time period,</p>

<p>Maybe for someone who has to have everything spelled out on a 2nd grade level, otherwise it was obvious. My orginal comment had 7 upvotes until you and other like minded idiots like yourself became buthurt that im not insulting your childhood villan.</p>

<p>you really like taking things out of context dont you? only way you could prove a point.</p>

<p>i then repeated this bit multiple times, and the only way you were able to comprehend it was if i worded it in a way your poorly-grown brain could understand. a phrasing that YOU yourself constructed on your own, so it tells me you very well did understand what i was saying and were pretending to have the thinking capacity of a dieing fish.</p>

<p>it received 7 upvotes, before you and fellow braindeads combined forces of idiocy and conditioning </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing with an open and free forum, you might have to put up with ideas that you find objectionable or questionable.  Everybody gets their say.  Either understand that and deal with it, or ignore what you dislike and move on.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re wrong about people not taking this sub seriously.  If this forum was so inconsequential, there wouldn&#39;t be so many people dedicated to disrupting discussion, vote brigading, and shilling.  People would just ignore this place.

<p>As for Hitler, here&#39;s some food for thought.  If history is written by the winners, it stands to reason that what we learned in school isn&#39;t the whole truth.  Shouldn&#39;t we be allowed to discuss these ideas without being instantly called racists or anti-semites?  Without being accused of supporting nazis?</p>

<p>And I&#39;m right about this sub not being taken seriously. You think people coming here to be disruptive is indicative of you being taken seriously? Absurd. People come here to troll because they feel good about trolling idiots and Nazis. Vote brigading and shilling? Got evidence of that? Or is it possible you&#39;re just making up organized antagonists where there are none because you&#39;ve got a penchant for paranoia? Like, you know, a conspiracy theorist. I assure you. You aren&#39;t that important. The government may have people who manipulate social media. They certainly don&#39;t come here. Why would they? Who are they going to convince? Shills don&#39;t come here, that&#39;s just a blanket term r/conspiracy uses to dismiss the viewpoints of those who demand evidence and value reason before falling lockstep into your absurd, unsubstantiated view of the world.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some food for thought for you: You just defended Hitler by saying &#39;we don&#39;t know the whole truth.&#39; So are you denying the holocaust? Because if you&#39;re not, one thing we DO know about Hitler is that he gases millions and millions of people while making claims that, surprise!, are made on r/conspiracy all the time.</p>

<p>No, you can not say &quot;Hitler wasn&#39;t that bad&quot; without being called a Nazi or an antisemite. If you have a problem with that, take it up with the guy who killed 6 million Jews and made it his main policy platform, who you&#39;re defending.</p>

<p>I&#39;m reminded of a quote too:</p>

<p>&quot;Hitler sucked.&quot; -Every rational person in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to see an example of the type of statement that will get you labeled as a racist, just go back up the thread to the most downvoted comment.</p>

<p>To paraphrase the post:</p>

<p>Germany was better off under Hitler because he kicked out the banking cartels, took control of the source of money, and made a huge improvement to the economy.  </p>

<p>The very next post accused him of racism right away.  My point was that we, as a forum, should be able to explore those ideas without the race card being played.  </p>

<p>Did those things happen as a result?  That might be worth debating.  Can we look at the situation from a different perspective without having to agree with genocide?  All I did was defend the guys right to ask such questions without a barrage of accusations.  I never stated my personal opinion either way, yet was immediately accused of defending Hitler myself.</p>

<p>As for history and who decides, I still disagree.  For example, let&#39;s say Germany won the war.  How would that have affected how the allied forces would have been portrayed in the history books?  Would we have been seen as the good guys that lost, or the bad guys that lost?</p>

<p>How can you say for certain that particular events are not changed to serve an agenda?  Think of all the knowledge of human history that has been lost or destroyed.  What pieces are we missing from our past?  How would those missing pieces change out world view?</p>

<p>The exploration of those ideas, no matter how controversial, was what I was defending.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question over Germanys economic state under Hitler should be examined, but not the way you are making it out to be. And It has been examined.  Richard Evans examined it..and he is an accredited historian. When someone says &quot; Germany was better off under Hitler&quot; its a very strong statement that is just frankly wrong. You can have good economic policy without electing Adolph Hitler to power and his ideology.  There is a lot of information from the past that is &quot; lost&quot;. But that doesn&#39;t mean its deliberately lost or hidden from public showing. The amount of knowledge available today via primary source material and secondary source material is immeasurable..its so massive. More then anytime in History. If Germany had won the war it wouldn&#39;t have changed our opinion of them in the United States. Historians look back over time in a long term approach. Political scientists would make the judgments about good/bad. Our job as historians is to showcase the past without bias while introducing a novel thesis ( argument) into the discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I didnt say you never allowed me to hand out my opinion, I just said that if he&#39;s allowed to post that comment than I&#39;m allowed to post my criticism of is as well. So you&#39;re putting words in MY mouth. I do approach this sub with an open mind, except for when it comes to &quot;Hitler wasn&#39;t that bad&quot; comments. He was that bad. Just because you share a common enemy doesn&#39;t mean you should be rousing to his defense like the comment I replied to was.</p>

<p>Also, non-reader, notice how I specifically said you WEREN&#39;T a holocaust denier, and as such should keep in mind that the Holocaust happened and immediately negates any pro-Nazi sentiment. But please, keep constructing straw arguments like a petulant child.</p>

<p>The facts of this exchange are simple. I jumped on that pro-hitler douchebags comment. You said &quot;keep an open mind.&quot; Am I supposed to disassociate that from Nazis, which is what is being talked about? Especially when you say, and I quote, &quot;As for Hitler, here&#39;s some food for thought. If history is written by the winners, it stands to reason that what we learned in school isn&#39;t the whole truth.&quot; Notice the &quot;As for Hitler&quot; part. Please point out ANYWHERE where you said &quot;Yeah, Hitler was evil but...&quot; You didn&#39;t. You defended someone defending Hitler, specifically using the same argument Goebbels over there used. You have linked yourself to a pro-nazi viewpoint by your own words. You can&#39;t deny that. </p>

<p>As for hissy fits, you&#39;re the one who&#39;s descended into naming calling. So take a step back. Look at what you wrote. Look at what is being discussed. Look at the side you&#39;re taking.</p>

<p>Try not to gas any Jews today because you think they run the international finance regime, ok?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to directly call someone something to imply it.  You asked an open ended question.  If I misunderstood that, then my bad.  But you did accuse me of defending Hitler when I suggested we might not know the whole truth behind the lead up to WWII, which I was not, I was simply stating a neutral fact of all history, that the winners decide what history is.</p>

<p>All I did was defend someone&#39;s right to discuss a controversial subject without being labeled a racist.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I don&#39;t take kindly to pro-Hitler posts. As for abusive language, how about any of the things I&#39;ve been called today? Where&#39;s your indictment of them? If the fine people of r/conspiracy don&#39;t want to be called retards, cunts and assholes (I&#39;ve used each one once by the way, and all in response to people either attacking me for attacking this NAZI or just plain defending him) then they shouldn&#39;t act like such retards, cunts or assholes. If you&#39;re going to be offended by such language than apply your offense with an even hand. The very nature of r/conspiracy is abusive. Take a second an look at what every single thread that mentions him calls the president. It&#39;s not &quot;I disagree with his policies&quot; it&#39;s &quot;he&#39;s a freedom hating tyrant lizard person Jew loving muslim&quot; or whatever. The whole basis of this subreddit is &#39;the people we disagree with not only don&#39;t have valid beliefs, but they&#39;re actively trying to harm us and society.&#39; Can&#39;t you see how that&#39;s abusive to an extreme? Someone from r/conspiracy complaining about abusive language is the best example of the pot calling the kettle black I&#39;ve ever heard.</p>

<p>Is your point that I&#39;ve been overly active in r/conspiracy today? Too much dissent for you? </p>

<p>You, and a slim minority of r/conspiracy, fall far from deserving such name calling, and I apologize if I&#39;ve offended you and if you&#39;ve felt lumped in. However, when I got on this morning a PRO-HITLER circle jerk was forming around the comment I initially replied to. THAT is the group I was insulting. And they deserve it, and worse.</p>

<p>Like I&#39;ve said MULTIPLE FUCKING TIMES, the problem isn&#39;t even fatass22&#39;s comment. It&#39;s the way it was accepted and supported by the community at large here. It wasn&#39;t until I started my little crusade against it that it&#39;s gone negative. I don&#39;t know if I influenced that or not, but god damn if I&#39;m not vindicated.</p>

<p>Also, &quot;fools?&quot; What&#39;s the deal Ally McBeal? You write a mature post scolding me for going ad hominem and then you go and do it in your next post? Be better than that red-light. Be one of the rational ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, and by the way, I DO belong to r/conspiratard. I get called a conspiratard by them fairly often for the simple belief that I have that Israel has WAY too much influence over American foreign policy. R/conspiratard does a great job pointing out the most egregious posts here. I also belong to r/ufos, r/paranormal, and r/skeptic.</p>

<p>I like to keep an open but critical mind.</p>

<p>I think you may misunderstand why r/conspiratard exists... It&#39;s not just because there are people out there so bought into the &#39;official&#39; story they enjoy trolling r/conspiracy. Conspiracy Theorists say incredibly callous and hurtful things in defense of their idea. Ask the parents of dead kids from Newtown. Ask a Syrian. Ask anyone who lost someone on 9/11. Ask malnourished children in the Third World. What the people on this thread say isn&#39;t just idle crazy speculation, it has real, harmful consequences that rightly infuriate people. </p>

<p>The r/conspiratard crowd may be close-minded and they may troll this board and down vote to oblivion the more asinine things on here, but at least they don&#39;t call the grieving families of victims of mass shootings accusing them of being liars...</p>

<p>While our government is quite terrible in more ways than one, I think you&#39;re not seeing that your own country is more than likely similar.</p>

<p>Economy? It&#39;s not just America. The entire global economy is tanking (look at Europe). Surveillance? The UK and Germany are doing the same things, it&#39;s just not being revealed like ours is.</p>

<p>As for searches and seizures, I&#39;m fairly sure that the police in other nations can (and sometimes do) similar. Sure, we go overboard at airports with TSA but that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Our Constitution is the only thing that&#39;s kept us from being completely neutered. I know the current state of our country might seem otherwise but without the Second Amendment we would have lost our guns with the rest of the world. The Second Amendment protects all the rest, it&#39;s just that it hasn&#39;t come to that point... yet.</p>

<p>Again, I ask what country you are from because this is a global issue. We are all in trouble and the elite control everything, not just America.</p>

<p>So when the shit hits the fan, how will you defend yourself? How can you fend off tyranny without being armed? So while every other country wants to criticize America for being &quot;primitive savages all crazed about their guns&quot;, the rest of the world will be wishing they had arms to take up.</p>

One big difference though is that our version of the Federal Reserve (Reserve Bank of New Zealand) is 100% government owned and profits from our junk fiat currency are funneled into the economy to reduce taxes (down from 39% to 33% max with company and trust tax down to 28%).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand America is not the only place with legal gun ownership. However, many countries have faced ban, confiscation, and whatnot. Take Canada and the UK for example. My point is that we have the Second Amendment, which &quot;guarantees&quot; us this right. It&#39;s our legal recourse and defense for the ability to keep and bear arms no matter the attempts at legislation otherwise. Yes, I understand there have been and will continue to be attempts to disarm America but I&#39;m sure it would have happened a while ago without the Constitution there to defend it.</p>

<p>The military itself is sworn to uphold one thing -- the US Constitution, and from enemies both foreign and <strong>domestic</strong>. So which do you think the citizens fighting for their rights fall under... the enemies or the allies? I&#39;d be willing to say most servicemen would defect or refuse orders on American citizens here at home.</p>

<p>I understand that the military/paramilitary police have some powerful toys. However, people in the Middle East seem to have held up pretty well with far less than many gun owners here have. We have numbers and fortified positions on our side. Even if they went ape and decided to bring in the apaches and bombers, I doubt the international community would side with the government.</p>

<p>We call out Assad for allegedly using chemical weapons on his own people, how would it look when our government is destroying its own populace here? What good would it do to be the ruler of no one when you&#39;ve destroyed the entire country?</p>

<p>I was sitting at a bench outside a cafe yesterday when three smokers sat down beside me; I&#39;ve been coughing ever since. At least I could go inside the cafe to avoid them. When I was a kid that wasn&#39;t an option. I really value my freedom to breathe much, much more highly than your freedom to poison the surrounding air (and before you ask, I&#39;d be in favor of banning personal automobiles within city limits as well. And I strongly support the right to bear arms.)</p>

<p>The change in the exchange rate between two currencies has no correlation with that currency&#39;s value. Indeed, it&#39;s a good thing when your currency is low compared to others, because that encourages exports.</p>

<p>And the Fed isn&#39;t a private corporation for any reasonable definition of private corporation.</p>

<p>What a load of horseshit this post is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nah, this post is allright.
about US currency &amp; tax: US dollar have in few years almost halved compared to my country&#39;s currency as well. Taxes can be good, but to tax working salaries so hard compared to corporate tax seems just evil, especially when the taxes goes to financing wars and &quot;corporate welfare&quot;. USA is not the producing and exporting country it once was, when USA was rich, the dollar AND export was way much higher than today. It seems like the solutions the rulers of USA is aiming for are wage-slavery under corporate rule and orwellian mind control.</p>

<p>Okay... that very well may be the case, but it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the value of our currency, which is what OP tried to imply.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>USA is not the producing and exporting country it once was</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The USA has the biggest GDP in the world. It is still the most producing country. And exports have never been higher, both in real and nominal terms.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Uh... that seems like quite a leap there. You certainly haven&#39;t shown anything even close to supporting that statement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a definite irony in pointing out the worthlessness of the US constitution while proclaiming the intent of the revolutionary fighters. </p>

<p>The reasons why we haven&#39;t had another revolution are the same reasons why things are as you point them out to be. It wouldn&#39;t be profitable to the .001% to have another revolution. It was in the 1700&#39;s as they had <em>us</em> fight for the right to pay <em>them</em> taxes. That battle is over - that&#39;s why there wont be another &#39;revolutionary war&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the majority are complacent.  If there&#39;s one thing Americans (I&#39;m one) are good at it&#39;s short-term cost benefit analysis.  Everyone from CEOs to petty criminals think about an action and say &quot;Will I get something for myself out of this.&quot;  If the answer is yes, regardless of the long-term consequences, they&#39;ll more often than not do it.  So this comes into play when talking about a revolution.</p>

<p>Yes, the majority of people are pissed, they distrust the government, the media, and generally anything they can&#39;t see for themselves.  BUT, they can still</p>

<ul>
<li><p>go to their job and make fake money to buy fake shit that occupies them and removes them from reality</p></li>
<li><p>go to mcdonalds or whatever they like and get their food</p></li>
<li><p>have a reasonable sense of security in their home</p></li>
<li><p>scream at their tv, rant on twitter/facebook, without any real consequences</p></li>
<li><p>have running water, electricity, and transportation</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, that&#39;s pretty comfortable.  Even though they hate the government, the government isn&#39;t telling them &quot;you can&#39;t have mcdonalds&quot; or &quot;no you can&#39;t talk shit about us on facebook&quot; or &quot;you can&#39;t make your money and even if you could, you&#39;re not allowed to buy shit with it.&quot;  So the potential costs of a revolution (death, anarchy (unlikely), disorder, no first world lifestyle for a while) are simply too great for people to take their protests off facebook and change.org, and go stand up in the streets.  Look at history-</p>

<p>The first American Revolution was about freedom, and specifically freedom to live your own life.  Not have to follow bullshit rules made by people completely out of touch with reality.  We fought because we wanted to be free from oppression.  It was violent, it was bloody, it was tragic, but the people prevailed over the smaller tyranny because they truly believed in what they were fighting for, and they wouldn&#39;t stop until they were dead, or they won.  </p>

<p>Look at the 60s and 70s.  Before cell phones, before the internet, before all the bullshit distractions, people got in the streets, went to the capital, and said &quot;we&#39;re not putting up with your shit anymore.&quot;  They ended a war because they refused to leave, refused to follow the rules, and eventually TPTB had to cave because if they didn&#39;t, 1776 would have happened again.  </p>

<p>But now, nobody wants to do that.  It&#39;s much easier to pull out your phone, or open your computer, get on facebook and write a rant about how much the government sucks, or GMOs, or the Fed.  People like it, but it doesn&#39;t matter.  A bunch of lazy fucks sitting on the computer are no threat to the elite and their game.  And now with draconian laws and militarized police forces, people are scared.  They don&#39;t believe a true revolution could change anything.  I see posts all the time about &quot;people who think AR-15s will be able to take the military are retarded.&quot;  Well yea, 10,000 people with guns won&#39;t last long.  But if say, 250 million Americans said fuck it and stopped following the rules and started breaking the system, it&#39;s either win by default because the elite can&#39;t overpower them (even by force), or commit murder on an unprecedented scale.  You don&#39;t think if the U.S. government started firing on it&#39;s citizens for trying to overthrow a corrupt system, other countries who hate our government wouldn&#39;t jump in?  </p>

<p><strong>TL:DR</strong>- People are too comfortable to revolt and potentially give up that comfort level, even though it&#39;s inevitable they&#39;ll lose it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all how dare you come over here on holiday and insult this country you are a guest of ours everyone has problems and didn&#39;t you have parents that tought you when you are a guest you respect them.</p>

<p>And as for the rest of you shame on the Americans in here that agree with this asshole I gave 7 long years of my life on a submarine to protect your freedoms so that you can hold your heads high and not take shit like this from anyone.</p>

<p>And as for op if you spent all your holiday in nyc and surrounding you saw nothing of America. This country is so great cause we invite all people in no matter were from we support this only place in the world where you can walk a half mile and hear 12 languages and are free to persue your dreams of being a doctor or a trash man we encourge all diversity. Yeah some of us are releuctant to it but in our core we know this is what this country was founded for as a haven from oppression.</p>

<p>But for you as an outsider that saw only a small part of this great land and fuck all of you that say it isn&#39;t cause it truly is. You didn&#39;t go into small town middle america were grandmas are baking pies and sitting them on window sills or kids are helping elderly cross a busy intersection and it does happen were I am from. You saw the shittiest part of what we offer as a nation and you bought into it I as an american don&#39;t need to touch any other subjects you mentioned cause it isn&#39;t worth my time.</p>

<p>Lastly if you feel you were oppressed in any way then STAY THE FUCK OUT member mother fucker I grew here you flew here and even thou I am not a member of the worlds mightiest military I will defend this country and its people from all enemies foreign and domestic.</p>

<p>Edit. I don&#39;t like to curse at people on here but sorry to all and for spelling and grammer I am really pissed off but I mean every word and I only wish some of my fellow americans feels as i do.</p>

<p>You want to downvote me that is fine this needs to be seen I will repost it till I am told not to be a mod</p>

<p>United States Constitution - Article I, Section 10:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No State shall...make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts</p>

<p>And they violated that by taking us off the gold standard.</p>

<p>United States Constitution, Amendment IV:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And New York City Police violate that every day with Stop and Frisk policies.</p>

<p>And the Congress and Office of the President have continuously violated that since the passage of the first Patriot act with unnecessary and unlawful bulk domestic surveillance, warrant-less wiretapping, and dozens of other programs.</p>

<p>And other domestic police forces violate that all the time with checkpoints, mandatory blood draws, etc.</p>

<p>I think you need to remember one important word in that oath you took:</p>

<p>all enemies, foreign and <strong>domestic</strong></p>

<p>If the above isn&#39;t evidence that the US government qualifies, I don&#39;t know how you live day-to-day.</p>

<p>One thing a lot of outsiders don&#39;t know--but is hammered within this community--is the difference between zionism and anti-Semitism. Zionism is a largely political ideology, whereas anti-Semitism is prejudice against the religious beliefs and blanketed discrimination of Jewish people. </p>

<p>Ergo, I can be against the expansion of Israel and be against Netanyahu&#39;s aggressive policies (anti-Zionist) without hating all Jewish people and their religious beliefs (anti-Semitism). And yet, there&#39;s a systematic effort by groups like AIPAC to link these two things together as one in the same.   </p>

<p>To talk of zionist bankers is far from being the same thing as saying &quot;them dirty Jews control the world!&quot; </p>

<p>all enemies, foreign and <strong>domestic</strong></p>

<p>If the above isn&#39;t evidence that the US government qualifies, I don&#39;t know how you live day-to-day.</p>

<p>&quot;In the ruling sense, Hitler was a great leader. <strong>unemployment was near 0, everyone had a car, and a radio.</strong> &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you know there are many types of fluoride and municipal water fluoridation only benefits a small subset of the population that has poor dental hygiene? Most people would consider this as being medicated without their consent. I pay taxes and utilities for my water I should be able to receive it fluoride free. Intelligent opposition to fluoridation is against the delivery method and the inefficient targeting of treatment. On top of that there are negative consequences from having too much fluoride and long term studies are still inconclusive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there a difference between &quot;natural&quot; fluoride and &quot;artificial&quot; fluoride?</p>

<p>&quot;The claim that fluoridation is one of &#39;nature&#39;s experiments&#39; is not valid because the salts put into the water supply, sodium fluoride or silicofluorides, are industrial products never found in natural water or in organisms. They are, furthermore, notoriously toxic, sufficiently so to be used as rat poison or insecticide. Calcium fluoride, on the other hand, which is the form commonly found in natural waters, is not toxic enough for such uses.&quot; — Dr. C. G. Dobbs, (Ph.D., A.R.C.S.) Bangor, Wales, England.</p>

<p>ou DID NOT start off by saying &quot;for the purpose of this analysis, I am not considering any of Hitler&#39;s actions after 1939</p>
</blockquote>

<p>oh im sorry, do i HAVE to start my sentances off like that just so YOU understand? </p>

<p>Secondly, i CONSTANTLY referred to his actions within the country and explicitly stated im not considering his WW2 endeavors. </p>

<p>So lets use 3rd grade logic.</p>

<p>I claim his leadership and state multiple times im ommitting his WW2 actions<br/>
I list and explain economic, social and financial practices hes done  </p>

<p>Now since we all know WW2 started in 1939, and i said im excluding the things done during this time. how the FUCK are you unable to come to this conclusion? &quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>YOU CAN&#39;T FUCKING SAY THAT AND DECIDE TO IGNORE A HUGE PORTION OF HIS LEADERSHIP.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>i can if i said im not analyzing his entire career as chancellor and focusing on a particular part. which i did SEVERAL times, you fucking idiot. </h2>

<blockquote>
<p>So you&#39;re saying your original statement excluded that time period,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe for someone who has to have everything spelled out on a 2nd grade level, otherwise it was obvious. My orginal comment had 7 upvotes until you and other like minded idiots like yourself became buthurt that im not insulting your childhood villan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You said &quot;Hitler was a great leader</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you really like taking things out of context dont you? only way you could prove a point.</p>

<p>who knows, maybe youre only able to retain 5 words at a time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only way you could possible make it work is to say &quot;BEFORE 1939, Hitler was a great leader.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you already admit to understanding my point, and claim its validity. youre just unhappy about my sentence structure. hahahahaha hahahahaha. what a fucking idiot
I rest my case</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to see an example of the type of statement that will get you labeled as a racist, just go back up the thread to the most downvoted comment.</p>

<p>To paraphrase the post:</p>

<p>Germany was better off under Hitler because he kicked out the banking cartels, took control of the source of money, and made a huge improvement to the economy.  </p>

<p>The very next post accused him of racism right away.  My point was that we, as a forum, should be able to explore those ideas without the race card being played.  </p>

<p>Did those things happen as a result?  That might be worth debating.  Can we look at the situation from a different perspective without having to agree with genocide?  All I did was defend the guys right to ask such questions without a barrage of accusations.  I never stated my personal opinion either way, yet was immediately accused of defending Hitler myself.</p>

<p>As for history and who decides, I still disagree.  For example, let&#39;s say Germany won the war.  How would that have affected how the allied forces would have been portrayed in the history books?  Would we have been seen as the good guys that lost, or the bad guys that lost?</p>

<p>How can you say for certain that particular events are not changed to serve an agenda?  Think of all the knowledge of human history that has been lost or destroyed.  What pieces are we missing from our past?  How would those missing pieces change out world view?</p>

<p>The exploration of those ideas, no matter how controversial, was what I was defending.</p>
