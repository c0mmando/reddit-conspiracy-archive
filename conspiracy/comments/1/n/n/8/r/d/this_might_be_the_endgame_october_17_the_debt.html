       So
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been thinking about this, and it seems like everything is really coming together.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly dont believe that the Republicans are as stupid and insane as the media is making them out to be. They are going to grind the country to a halt and possibly have it default due to the ACA? Seriously?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, this is the 100th year of the Federal Reserve. We are also in 17 trillion debt. The debt ceiling vote is coming up October 17th, and the exact same requirements are being pushed by the Repubs, while Obama is not negotiating on either front.
      </p>

        House Republicans Plan To Link Debt-Limit And Shutdown Into One Fiscal Fight
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if this really is a runaway train, if all options are exhausted, if theres no QE left, if the 100 year 'charter' is up, well then all of this makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        There's simply nothing left to be done
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing the politicians could do, especially the ones who are bought.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would explain unlimited reckless spending, countless acts of aggression, FEMA/DHS/IRS/Police departments militarizing and gearing up (esp for OCT 1, knew of shutdown?) etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       When what they are doing makes sense in a context, it scares me.

       Completely divert attention from the core reason why this country is bankrupt (a criminal financial system and bought politicians) and have the people blame shitty political ideology, whilst being none the wiser.

       Well i could not agree more on how the left/right paradigm is in full force now because of the shutdown. You're completely correct.

       It is crazy to me that it happened so fast because it appeared from the NSA and syria stories that people were starting to see both parties are about the same thing and then this happened.

       Don't be scared. Fear is the mind killer. Being aware while ready and willing to respond is a better mindset to hold. Things have been set in motion for a long time now; we just get to deal with the outcome of the plan. Hold on tight and hope for the best, but never let your fear control you.

       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So that's a pretty good span to get what you need together.  If it collapsed today, and you're holding good amounts of gold, you have about three months to get what you need to survive the post-money period of turbulence.

       The gold standard is worthless and soon, the petroleum standard will be as well.

       There are a few things that have inherent value: the rest are all dynamic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Land, water, food, and medicines have inherent value. Material goods of use have potential value in a collapse. We're not going to see monetary exchanges taking place in the event of a catastrophe. People will barter for goods and services.

       Agreed.  But I was pointing out that the momentum for certain things will last for a time.  People are in the
       <em>
        habit
       </em>
       of taking money for goods.  This can be used to a prepper's advantage.  Trade worthless paper for valuable goods during the first week!

       Indeed. Actually, a good bit of the whole prepping movement goes back to the mid 90's in the years leading up to Oklahoma City. And if you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       wanna get old-school, go back to the fallout preppers of the 50's and 60's.

       ITs all led me to realize that if I'm to survive it all, I will remember that I am human first, and an American second. I don't care if this is the end game. I live by a national forest, I can hunt and fish, and I can defend myself... If this government is too stupid to even function, it's not my problem anymore. I refuse to allow incompetence to affect my daily life and well being anymore.

       Again, I've accepted that whatever happens happens... I know all about agenda 21, but I just am over living in fear of what might happen and letting that affect my life day in and day out. My final reasoning is just being ready to defend my well being, violently if necessary. If that has to happen, so be it. I won't sit around and stress about that potentially happening anymore though

       Here's my answer, but it's just my opinion obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Military take over? Replace this government with a single party elite government (kinda like China I guess).
This is only my guess. I would like to think the men and women of our military would not cooperate, but people like power and to be on the winning side. So that may be enough to keep enough of a military.

       Military take over? Replace this government with a single party elite government (kinda like China I guess).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is only my guess. I would like to think the men and women of our military would not cooperate, but people like power and to be on the winning side. So that may be enough to keep enough of a military.

       The end game would be us being entirely like an ant colony - each human being entirely selfless and pushing towards the greater good of humanity. The only problem would be who is queen?

       Its an interesting thought to turn everything on its head and think that maybe the 1% are not doing things for themselves but for the better of all humanity.

       No one puts it all together, but its obvious what the End Game is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world has problems. For every problem, there is a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       But is there also a budget for the solution? Political alignment? What about the lost opportunity costs for that budget outlay?
      </p>
      <p>
       And then add in bureaucracy and special interests, lobbying and campaigning, and its no wonder nothing ever gets done.
      </p>
      <p>
       You hear people say (even presidents) that things would be a lot simpler if they were a Dictator. Then you could
       <em>
        get shit done
       </em>
       .  Theoretically.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in practice, the dictator of one nation always exists in a larger world competing with other nations for limited resources and geography. So it's not so simple to build monuments to yourself when you need to import the steel from another nation. They may or may not be allies, or may not approve of your uses or you yourself. We lately have called this "Foreign Policy" but it's really just supply and demand, which is really as fundamental as the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if all this is put together, it's obvious that only one paradigm exists for solving world problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       World dictatorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it good or bad? Depends on the dictator. But war, poverty, food and water supplies hound this world's citizens, regardless of their governments, charities, institutions, initiatives, discussions, donations, soap boxes, and blogs.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's missing is global action using global resources to fix global problems. Which is why they perennially persist. But no one has a plan for uniting the world, even by conquest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do they? Lets take a second look at NATO and the UN, and relearn the definition of a rogue state. Lets account for foreign policy of the United States in context.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the United States you have every culture co-existing. And thriving (on paper I'll admit, since we gave poverty too, but feel free to compare to your favorite country (who has not been to Mars, btw)).
      </p>
      <p>
       If that's not a model for a world culture of a united Earth then I don't know what the word united means. Aren't you supposed to lead by example?  And to quote a WW2 general of ours: "By sundown this flag will be recognized globally as a sign of liberty and overwhelming force".
      </p>
      <p>
       The New World Order is our best hope for surviving mass extinction events (such as overpopulation leading to starvation, and asteroids) eliminating war, creating lasting peace, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, who's plausibly planning and advancing world domination everyday? Pinky and the Brain? China? Spiders?
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously it's the United States. And obviously the stakes are high.

       I already live in a disempowered state: unemployment in the first world. When I asked "Why?", I discovered the answer to be obvious. It's on the news literally every night.

      <p>
       When I take all of the headlines on this board (or all the boards) and place them in a coherent narrative, only one story is told. That story's synopsis is above but I could elaborate on any individual point below if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       In counter-point, can you weave a coherent narrative that includes all the facts of the world that you propose eliminate my interpretation of history and foreign policy? Because if so, then you could make a perhaps more accurate model of the real world and use it to make a more accurate description of "what the end game is". And that is the topic now.

       can be explained by confirmation bias and weird disinformation.

       The endgame is a massive redistribution of wealth from the common man to the global elite through taxation of his work to pay for his own "safety". A word used to describe the box he is carefully allowed to exist within, physically and mentally.

       Global Communist Dictatorship would be a nightmare to endure. You'd be a prisoner of your own body. They'd be putting suicide nets up like the foxconn factories in China. This is the road we find ourselves on. Whatever you want to believe about what's posted on this board, examining the growth of the scope of the federal government from the time of the Bill of Rights, and more importantly the massive growth of the military-industrial, agricultural, and educational sectors has proven that trend.

       But what if it is only a means to an end. The whole process as you described is the how of it, not the point. I'd imagine the goal is some harmonious planetary society, such as Star Trek. Could it be more like Wolfenstein? Of course it could. But then the government wouldn't have any one else to blame.

       The truth is I don't know. But my best guess is that the point is ultimately survival... at any cost.

       To throw the soul of humanity under a bus for some goal, however lofty, will not inspire, create morale, or develop instincts. It does the opposite. A global Communist Dictatorship would have an interest in

       Even securing it's very survival as a species would be considered "throwing it under a bus"? (I'm not saying I approve of the means to this end, only that all other avenues of approach have proved unsuccessful historically.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The "Technology-oriented, cooperative, free and open economy where ideas can flourish and be realized" is the western paradigm, lead by America in the present day. Africa is yet to have it's agricultural revolution. The middle east is yet to have basic human rights for women. India just got the internet but still wipes with their bare hands. Most of the planet's inhabitants haven't entered the industrial revolution, and they are being sold smartphones and televisions. America is literally 200 years ahead of most of the world in this perspective. It is a
       <em>
        breakaway civilization
       </em>
       . A
       <strong>
        hyperpower
       </strong>
       . And it stands alone in facing the respnosibilities of such a role, both historically and in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Foreign policy is a politically correct way of describing the intention to make the rest of the world in America's image. For the record, this is a  240 year old idea, with a lot of momentum. It's never questioned that America is mighty, rich, productive, or innovative.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what is the rest of the world's (non-western-allies, that is) problem with America?
      </p>
      <p>
       Our foreign policy, of course. They certainly love Baywatch, smartphones, internet, foreign aid and Michael Jackson. But thy don't like it when we stamp out a Rogue State for whatever reason (even no reason, if you've watched the news in the last 60 years.)
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this would be necessary if reason had any power over the minds of man. Unfortunately, the only universal language appears to be war.
      </p>
      <p>
       But thankfully, we are fluent in that as well.

       To call this society free, open and cooperative doesn't speak well about your abilities of analysis and exegesis. Quick counterpoint - Two-party duopoly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the world's problem with America is that it can't mind it's own fucking business - which is more than big enough to warrant it's full attention. I think that's one thing we can agree on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speak for yourself that you're thankful for America's big swingin war hard-on. It doesn't speak for me.

       You ought to call up Mr. Brzezinski, I think he may have a job for you. In the meantime, the anarcho-capitalist collective of Atlases will remember the manipulative slight of you and your ilk. Those who create and those who destroy have a relationship by necessity of duality. The real lack of necessity is for sociopathy and manipulative people. We do not forgive. We do not forget. We are legion. Expect us.

       I see now why we misunderstand each other. You believe the rest of the world is not America's Business, while I can prove that it very well is effectively our 51st State.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your Randian rhetoric is irrelevant, evident from historical failure to create anything but monopolies. The Unforgiving Legions have been revealed to be ineffective as well, except as controlled opposition. What has been effective is America's Westernization of the 51st state through Cultural and Economic Warfare. They even watch our movies in Korea and listen to our pop music in the Kremlin. They drive our cars in Africa and they eat Mc Donald's in Europe. They use our soft drinks in Saudi Arabia, and they use our Internet, GPS satellites, and operating systems the world over. All the results of collaboration in our free market between scientists and investors and engineers. If we aren't a free and open society, then why is all of our dirty laundry on the world news while the rest of the world staggers from the rate of technological progress we initiate?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the world hasn't even de-segregated and given women rights. What is it that you hate about America so much that you'd root for our enemies and be our enemy yourself? Do you even know who's side you are on?

       In a world where we must all be conscious of peak oil, the dangers of radiation, climate change, and wolves in sheeps clothing [Mossad, NSA, CIA, etc.] I propose a direction counter to that. Counter to the "Strategy of Tension". I propose love, sustainable and deep understanding of nature, of our minds, and a more careful existence for humanity that doesn't leave our planet and people on the brink of self-destruction.

       I know enough about the modern metropolis [matrix], have existed inside it and have dated and been friends with enough of its serfs to know that it is not the way.

       It can be argued that the entire point of globalization, stores like costco, oil, and cheap imports is to separate you from your natural harmonious existence on spaceship Earth. Prepackaged salads have replaced the garden. Little of real value is made in the US [assembled here maybe]. Those people who do make those things have become marginalized and relegated to day jobs by cheap imports and automation. The cities around me are populated by some of the loneliest sods. Millions of them. The walking wounded.

       The passion is gone. The soul is empty. The dream is about to become the nightmare. Are our masters the bankers and financiers, or natural law and higher morality? The fight of the next decade will show us.

       I'm sure there are some folks that hope this happens, but most of our government is bought out and run by corporations look to make a quick buck, or Zionists looking to murder anyone who is part of the Muslim faith (or is related to Muslims).

       A monetary collapse isn't the end of the world.  If you have food water and shelter, you suddenly realize money was just a middleman to these things all along.  If the middleman gets removed, its not end times, its just the end of you sucking on the tit of middlemen for awhile.  Don't panic, just get some things you need together for the time being, while your fake money can still purchase tangible objects.  That's the sort of thing that can prevent the need for standing for hours in a breadline.  If you're in the middle of a giant city, I'd be much more concerned.  The only reason cities can exist is with commerce and trucks bringing in constant supply of goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said all that, I don't think they're going to actually allow a collapse, why would you want this incredible tax farm to end?  Also, the globalists in power need the US to continue as a military farm to control other parts of the world for their own ends.  If the United States loses control, they lose control of the world.

       We're at the debt ceiling, and both parties are stagnant in their renewal. They're playing political theater, but really they know it's time..it's time for financial reset.

       AS dead-end as the debt ceiling appears, virtually all other countries have floating debt limits, so our debt to GDP ratio is well below most other countries, though admittedly, ours is the most telling of a problem that
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       fester into an eventual devaluation (as we know it eventually will.)

       Rest of world is quite happy to buy US bonds or T-bills, as witnessed by the low interest rate on them.  Investing in US is safer than investing in just about any other country.  Where else are you going to put your money ?  China ?  Russia ?  Brazil ?  EU ?

       My workmates and I just found out that appx 1 out of 6 people are employed by the government in one fashion or another.. so yeah.. that's 1/6 of the population whos goign to be spending a lot less on a consumer economy. We very well might be boned.

       Source? Is that including local and state governments that aren't affected by the shutdown? Workers who supply military equipment, such as Sikorsky? I know Sikorsky is laying off about 2,000 employees but that still leaves a lot of people working there...

       Agh, my workmate found it on reddit about 6 hours ago.. not sure exactly. I suppose federal employment? Some derivative of that? This was a news article that included EVERYONE who had ties to the government in the paycheck department. Teachers, public defenders, park rangers, whatever.

       From what I understand, the petro-dollar system must collapse before the dollar can collapse, or else the dollar collapse would have happened a while back. Maybe the establishment knows about some kind of 'terror' attack and are planning on using it as the means to bring down the petro-dollar system? Just a thought, my two cents...anyone?

       Lets imagine for a second that the stories of the US being created by the masons/illuminati are true, and that the ideas was to eventually bring it to its knees after absorbing all monetary gains that could be had. How would this be done, well exactly as you see it happening now. Any attempts to do so through military force etc would result in rebellion. However let us imagine this is purely the result of a monetary system based on inflation and although not intended to bring the country/world to It's knees it has done and will do! What is the answer?! What.is.the.answer!? I'm sorry but there isn't one.....you may not want to hear that but It's true. The first possible cause means a secret force which holds control of all money, military and political powers is in control or a system which the whole world has become hopelessly dependant on is in place, based on constant growth resulting in diminishing resources. We are fucked and we have allowed it to happen... Shtf plan...engaged!

       <p>
        A: Because that is the part we have been contracted to play, in this game. In order to "win" (or more accurately to be successful in) the Game, we must be as Negatively Polarized as possible. Service to Self in the extreme. Violence, War, Hatred, Greed, Control, Enslavement, Genocide, Torture, Moral Degradation, Prostitution, Drugs, all these things and more, they serve our purpose. In the Game.

        The difference between us and you, in the Game, is that we know that we are "playing". The less you know about the Game, and the less you remember that you're a player, the more "senseless" living becomes. In all these Negative things, we are providing you with tools. But you do not see it. It is not what we do, but how you react to it, that is important. We give you the tools. You have the Free Will choice how you will use them. You have to take responsibility. There is only One of Us here. Understand that, and you will understand the Game.

       So I hear chatter every now and then of possible Civil Unrest in Fema Zone III which is the D.C. area, and the people who post always suggest mid October. So with this federal reserve crash coming sometime after the 17th it makes sense that people may march on the capital with their money being worth it's weight in paper and all, not that it isn't already. The federal Government may see this coming and are preparing for the outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of civil unrest Martial Law could be officially declared thereby suspending the constitution and elections indefinitely, and from there it's a cakewalk to dictatorship. This is of course assuming that the individual members of the armed forces blindly follow their orders. Many of them very well may for no other reason than fear. Fear of what may happen to themselves or their families if they do not comply.
      </p>

       It also explains Obama's "Internet Off Switch" which is undoubtedly an effort to control news flow, It can't be completely stopped but word of mouth news travels much slower and is far less reliable than hearing directly from someone at the epicenter of whatever "event" is happening and I don't mean News Corporations but individual people. This forces the only verifiable news people will have access to is the manufactured news which is already biased and selective but remove peoples ability to call bullshit and opinions are easier to control. The protesters will be "Terrorists" as will anyone who disagrees with whatever is being shoved down people's throats.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it may seem a little extreme but it's what is flowing through my head right now
