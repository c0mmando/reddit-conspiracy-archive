       Our current healthcare system had undergone regulatory capture and was simply bloated and too expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obamacare further distorts the market and will result in higher costs and lower quality... a net negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a result of peoples' belief in "the rules" and dissonance... that is, imparting qualities on others that you wish them to have rather than what they actually are and do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we are in a situation where people genuinely believe this is in their best interests and not seeing it for what it is... another brutal regulatory capture on the order of Wickard v. Filburn.

       The most reasonable transition would be to roll back regulation slowly over the course of a decade to allow for more competition and free enterprise in health care.  There are certainly some regulations that need to be kept, but the ones that monopolize and serve certain business and political interests are the ones that need to go.  The important part in this is being very clear about which of those rules are actually relevant to safety concerns and which rules are irrelevant business/political interests hidden behind the guise of safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would further allow people to make their individual decisions about what is best for them.  This results in better market feedback about quality and costs of healthcare; the industry will adapt according to the needs of the general populace through the aggregation of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       The increased competition brings price-pressure and we will see those costs slowly go down and more people having quality healthcare service.

       Alright, I read what you typed, I'm going to re-read it and process it some more, however, off the lip, without really strong regulations, do truly believe it possible that healthcare companies will not be predatory, I mean, our rogue capitalistic system encourages it, like a twilight zone version of natural selection where the rich survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't see this as arguing, I'm not.  I just want to understand because I'm really wanting like the ACA, I live in SLC, Utah and none of my friends have healthcare because they can't afford it, but now they can.

       They all will be.  That is the point.  You can not remove that instinct.  You only make it worse by allowing these companies to be supported by regulations.  If one hospital has MRIs for $500 and the other has them for $8000 (that's how much my insurance was billed for mine a few years back), then which hospital will you choose?
      </p>
      <p>
       Competition brings downward price pressure.  Many regulations are geared towards removing competition.

       I need to correct you here.  There is nothing wrong with "capitalism".  The issue is that we have not actually had true free-market capitalism, but rather a form of crony capitalism where, if you build up enough power and influence, you can use the government or "the rules" to continue increasing that power and influence like a runaway train.
      </p>

       We must never forget the fallibility of our human nature.

       I understand the competition argument and 100% agree.  The regulations I
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       I'm talking about, are the ones of checks and balances and not empowering insurance companies to be predatory and protecting them.  Stark difference, right?  I'm assuming we can have
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       regulations in place, or am I wrong?

      <p>
       That's why I said
       <em>

       capitalistic system, which now that I read your comment, I would like to clarify that I mean the same thing you do, when you say crony capitalism.

       If you have anymore insight, I'd love to read it.   Thank you.

       There are very few regulations that benefit the consumer more than the companies those regulations are enacted for.  The idea of "consumer protection" is kind of a joke when it comes to these huge companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say I pass regulation X.  Many times regulation X results in negligible change in health outcomes at best.  Sometimes they are great and work!  The only thing that unites them are that there is
       <strong>
        always
       </strong>
       a cost and
       <strong>
        the consumer
       </strong>
       always pays for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Companies operate on margins.  If regulation X increases your cost by 5%, then you will typically pass on a cost increase to your customers of 7% to maintain 40% margins.
      </p>
      <p>
       So who is benefiting from those regulations?  Well... the consumer gets to pay 7% more for something they will most likely not benefit from while the company I am paying that money to just made an extra 2% beyond that cost to maintain margins.
      </p>
      <p>
       So who actually wins in that all too common scenario?

       Here's my thoughts, which some might consider radical.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like the idea that people can get insurance for cheap, BUT I'm not into the whole forcing people to buy insurance from a private company.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we really care about helping people, why not just give everybody free healthcare?  It's not like the money involved is actually real, it's just an idea, and ideas can be changed.  We need to reform our idea of currency, then other things will fall in line.  Personally, I don't think general healthcare should be about generating profits, but helping people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either let people buy it if they want, or just give it to them.  Forcing people into it is what turns me off on the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents...

       That would be too efficient for the government. Buying private insurance is essentially small scale socialist healthcare. You pay money, everyone on the plan benefits from the pool, use it when you need it. Why complicate things? People get upset that national healthcare is unfair because you are carrying the burden of others. They forget the same thing happens on a smaller scale with private insurance whether it's health, auto, or home. Plus they are lining the pockets of multiple companies at the same time.

       In my opinion, we're going to have to rethink how we distribute resources in the near future.  Things like robotics, AI, and nano machines will change the way work gets done.  I see a future where people are no longer needed to perform menial tasks for money.  How do you then distribute resources if people don't have or need jobs?

       Labor re-allocates to its needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       96% of labor was used in agriculture in the late 1800s.  Today, we use less than 3%.

       If we, as a civilization, are to evolve beyond our current state of tribal warfare, we'll have to change the way we think about resource distribution.  We won't be able to base the distribution based on job title, if no one needs jobs anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course these ideas are based off of the concept that we'll actually use technology for the greater good, and that we have the ability to move beyond our current ideas of economy, labor, and socio-economic status.

       Ok, enough wild tangents for now.

       Do you think that by forcing people to get insurance, a spirit of competitiveness will be created and costs will be driven down?

       Some people might feel that my thoughts on how money is not real, or that we should focus on providing for those without instead of profits, would be considered radical.  Been called a radical many times for discussing these ideas.  Mostly because it calls into question a system that we've all been born into.  It's hard for people to consider anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the costs, if you force people to buy in, I don't see how that makes the insurance companies compete with each other.  Like many other industries, I suspect they'll rig prices to maximize their profits at the cost of the citizens.

       there's a way to rip people off, insurance companies will do it.

       Well, by definition, conspiracy is more than one person working together to reach a goal. The fact that human nature tends towards greed doesn't mean it's
       <em>

       a conspiracy.

       The health exchange:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        I would pay around $2xx a month for healthcare. Now there are tax credits that would reduce this to about $1xx a month, but there isn't anywhere on the exchange that gives me an option to wait and pay with my tax credit. So my out of cost will be $2xx a month, which I don't really have
       </li>
       <li>
        My deductible would be $10000. This means that any visit, any prescription, and any emergency billed for less than $10000 will be my responsibility. Since I have an additional $2xx a month to pay in bills by law, where do I get the money to pay the medical bills? Hospitals don't take tax credits as payment
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This is a smoke and mirror show, but not in the way each party is presenting itself. It's going to cost workers more for less. Hours that are cut for the law's reason, regardless of right and wrong, hurt the workers. It's money no one can afford to pay, especially with their hours being cut. And with a deductible this high we are paying for nothing. What the smoke is covering is one thing. The majority of the healthy people are paying the balance for the unhealthy now, in hopes that when our health deteriorates, the younger generation will do the same.

       I understand the competition argument and 100% agree.  The regulations I
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       I'm talking about, are the ones of checks and balances and not empowering insurance companies to be predatory and protecting them.  Stark difference, right?  I'm assuming we can have
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       regulations in place, or am I wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why I said
       <em>
        rogue
       </em>
       capitalistic system, which now that I read your comment, I would like to clarify that I mean the same thing you do, when you say crony capitalism.

       In my opinion, we're going to have to rethink how we distribute resources in the near future.  Things like robotics, AI, and nano machines will change the way work gets done.  I see a future where people are no longer needed to perform menial tasks for money.  How do you then distribute resources if people don't have or need jobs?
