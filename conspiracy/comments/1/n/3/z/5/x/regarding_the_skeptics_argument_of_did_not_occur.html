        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is a common argument for a skeptic - simply put &quot;whatever event you are citing as a conspiracy theory could not have occurred simply because it would involve too many people, and the secret would leak out&quot;.</p>

<p>I would present as counterpoint the successful development of nuclear weapons during the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Labs from 1940 - 1960.</p>

<p>The individuals who worked on the Manhattan Project all worked together to produce what was the most powerful weapon at that time. However, individuals were only given enough information to complete the task they were assigned to. Individuals in higher positions knew more, up to the planning committee who was aware of the goal. This was done on a need to know basis. Some individuals knew the entire plan, but this was not disclosed by any of those individuals at that time. It was kept secret.</p>

<p>&quot;The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939, but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US$2 billion.&quot; 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project</a></p>

<p>&quot;During the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos hosted thousands of employees, including many Nobel Prize-winning scientists. The location was a total secret. Its only mailing address was a post office box, number 1663, in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Eventually two other post office boxes were used, 180 and 1539, also in Santa Fe. Though its contract with the University of California was initially intended to be temporary, the relationship was maintained long after the war. Until the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, University of California president Robert Sproul did not know what the purpose of the laboratory was and thought it might be producing a &quot;death ray&quot;. The only member of the UC administration who knew its true purpose—indeed, the only one who knew its exact physical location—was the Secretary-Treasurer Robert Underhill, who was in charge of wartime contracts and liabilities.&quot;
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory</a></p>

<p>Interesting how no-one came forward to the press or public with information pertaining to the goal of this massive project. The soviets managed to penetrate the program, but again - there were no soviets coming forward to the press or public with their information either, because the Soviets wanted to keep it a secret as well. I think that Nationalism / Patriotism played a huge part in influencing these individuals to not disclose what they knew. There was also the extra incentive of not giving everyone the blueprints to the bomb, as that was dangerous information at the time. You can google search for the bomb plans today - it&#39;s no longer dangerous information. But this concept of &#39;Dangerous Information&#39; is very important.</p>

<p>Personal Story Time</p>

<p>My step-grandfather worked at Los Alamos (I can&#39;t provide proof, and I don&#39;t care if you believe me).  Around 5  or so years ago he spoke about what he did there - mostly clerk/office duties - but it was the first time he spoke about it to anyone, since it happened, including his wife of over 30 years. His mindset of patriotism/nationalism is what prevented him from speaking about it for so long, and that patriotism is fundamentally the reason why he kept quiet for so long. This is someone in my family, who I trust and know a great deal, who could talk about his cancer with his wife, but not the work he did at Los Alamos. </p>

<p><strong>This has led me to believe that this is primarily how secrets are kept. Not with bribes, not with threats, but with shaping a person&#39;s mindset.</strong></p>

<p>My step grandfather kept his secret because he loved his country - the same country that would sacrifice him in a false flag incident if it served the purposes of those currently in power. I think a large portion of the American populace (or any countries populace) has a mindset similar to my step grand-fathers. We are taught from birth to love our country, to fight for our country, and to do what is necessary to protect it - &quot;Loose lips sink ships&quot;.</p>

<p>Combine this concept of Nationalism/Patriotism with the concept of &quot;Need to know&quot; and &quot;Dangerous Information&quot;. We can begin to get a glimpse of how a large scale, well funded operation like the Manhattan Project can be kept secret. I use the term secret to be defined as &quot;to conceal the true nature of&quot; rather than &quot;hidden&quot;.</p>

<p>Here are a few observations I have made regarding managing clandestine projects:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Individuals who work on the project are only given enough information to complete their immediate tasks. Multiple individuals are used, their tasks are singular, and often times simple (teach these people how to fly, drive this truck under this building, spray this new &#39;insulation&#39; inside this office complex, etc..). This spreads out liability, and the simplicity of tasks reduces risk of failure.</p></li>
<li><p>The individuals used are &quot;incentivized&quot; to not disclose their participation - this could be a paycheck, recognition, threats, but the most powerful is Acceptance - closely tied to the Nationalism / Patriotism mentioned above. People who strongly identify with their country are much more willing to fulfill orders without question, to remain silent for as long as they are ordered, and to repeat the official narrative, because they feel it is their &quot;patriotic duty&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Individuals who learn too much are either incorporated (think Bush Sr.&#39;s rise to power in the CIA after Bay of Pigs, courtesy of Zapata Corp) or destroyed/smeared. We see this consistently across multiple time periods, from whistle blowers to government insiders. George Bush Jr. summed this up eloquently with &quot;You&#39;re either with us, or against us.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Media campaigns / propaganda / disinformation is always present during these projects, and helps to maintain &quot;the official narrative&quot;. At this point the objective truth is irrelevant to all but the informed parties, so any other kind of information (however false) only helps to bury the real truth, or discredit those who have evidence pointing towards the real truth. Keep in mind that the official narrative will change if needed, and new talking points will be issued. Opposition groups will be infiltrated, monitored, and &quot;handled&quot; if necessary. The Official Narrative will be repeated by all Patriotic Individuals (see 2), and if you are not a patriot, then you are an enemy (see 3). The Official Narrative usually has just enough truth in it to make it sound believable, while obscuring the deeper truth. </p></li>
<li><p>Independent Review - my favorite. Officals, Experts, and Committees will be used to provide support for the Official Narrative. This is in the form of testimony, study, investigation, etc... But at the end of the day, the findings will always align with the Official Narrative, because the Officials, Experts, and Committees are &quot;owned&quot; - bought with incentives from (2). No truly independent assessment will be publicized as much as the official assessment, meaning the majority of the population will primarily know one side of the story, which is &quot;backed up&quot; by &quot;experts&quot;. Who would dare question the experts? Only crackpots and loonies.</p></li>
<li><p>Individuals who do not espouse the Official Narrative will be targeted for re-education. This may come in many forms, but essentially boils down to &quot;Comply with our demands, or we will put you in federal &#39;pound me in the ass&#39; prison&quot;. We&#39;ve seen this most recently with the shutdown of Lavabit, who provided an encrypted email service that a government agency wanted access to. Rather than allow them access, Lavabit closed it&#39;s doors. The Official Narrative there was that every american company will comply with the governments demands, or you will cease to operate as a company, either through law or sacrifice. Others will take notice of these events and plan accordingly, but the options do not change: comply or perish.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The final point I&#39;d like to make is simple: We will probably never know what really happened.
One of the main functions of (4) is the creation of many different subjective truths to conceal the objective truth (disinformation). 
Skeptics are very quick to dismiss any conspiracy theory for the Official Narrative, because it is simply easier to believe what sounds plausible than to imagine the infinite number of possible states that those events could of happened in. In other words, it is easier to accept a likely explanation than it is to exhaustively search all the possible explanations. This does not make the likely explanation right (for example, the likely explanation used to be that the world was flat, because you couldn&#39;t see beyond the horizon) it simply makes it easier to believe. Once we exhaustively searched/mapped the Earth, we realized it wasn&#39;t flat.</p>

<p>Tl;DR Massive covert operations, involving hundreds of thousands of people and billions of dollars, have taken place in America, at least since the 1930s, and have been managed quite effectively using simple principles such as: need to know, patriotic duty, incentives, propaganda/disinformation, faux independent review, and legal intimidation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an historian of nuclear secrecy. I just want to say that indeed, there were press leaks about the Manhattan Project during the war. <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/09/20/worst-manhattan-project-leaks/">I&#39;ve documented one here</a>, but there were many, many others. The voluntary censorship program helped contain them, as did pulling most of the relevant experts into the project (or some other military project), but even then, it wasn&#39;t as tight a ship as people like to make it out to be.</p>

<p>How did it get kept as secret as it did? Because of the 130,000 or so people who worked on it, only a much smaller number knew what they were actually working on. Most of that number were kept in isolated sites and had security thoroughly drilled into them, because they thought they were in a race against the Nazis.</p>

<p><em>Even then</em>, we are talking about a secret that was kept for about 3 years total in the middle of wartime. And even then, we all know it wasn&#39;t really perfectly &quot;kept&quot; — the Soviets knew about it, and there were indeed leaks. Nobody working on the project thought that the fact that the US was working on atomic weapons could be kept as a secret through the peacetime period as well. Most of those working on it thought that even the details of the bomb work could not be kept that long into the peacetime, either. And, indeed, there were leaks and spies in the peacetime as well.</p>

<p>Which is just to say, I think the Manhattan Project can be a model for thinking about the keeping of very large secrets, but it also points out the limitations in such schemes, even for very limited periods of time and under arguably the best of conditions (wartime against a mutually-hated enemy). The program&#39;s secrecy required heavy compartmentalization, vigilant security officers, press controls, a short and definite timescale, and a lot of luck, just to achieve the level of secrecy that it did, which was not as astounding as people often like to talk about, because the myth of perfect secrecy became one of the many clichés about the bomb. Most of the sillier conspiracy theories (e.g. the &quot;Apollo Moon landing hoax&quot;) propose too many people, too much total compliance, and too long a period of time to be taken seriously in this respect. For short-term projects, even very large ones, however, the Manhattan Project can indeed be a useful model — though, again, with limitations.</p>

<p>I do agree with your premise that there is a &quot;culture&quot; of secrecy that is purposefully drilled into the workers, as well. In the current terminology this is known as &quot;OPSEC,&quot; or operations security. It is, of course, about as reliable as you&#39;d expect it to be. It only takes <em>one</em> Klaus Fuchs, or Edward Snowden, or <em>name-your-favorite-whistleblower-or-spy-here</em>, to render the apparatus seemingly pointless. The more people you tell the secret, the higher the chance you&#39;ll tell someone like that. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a conspiracy guy (as you can probably tell), but I&#39;m happy to respectfully answer any questions about Manhattan Project security, spies, leaks, etc. that anyone may have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your comment, it was insightful. </p>

<p>I have to wonder how much information was stolen/leaked that was disinformation, because at the time the govt knew the soviets had penetrated the project. Stating that a leak is a symptom of an insecure project ignores strategies involving the use of prepared leaks, which we see today.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to say that while the Manhattan Project functions as a model for the keeping of very large secrets, it was also one of the first large scale projects of its kind. Rarely does the prototype meet all the design specifications, so I can only assume that the Manhattan Project&#39;s base design was iterated over to further tighten secrecy.</p>

<p>We may never truly know the &#39;limitations&#39; of the Manhattan Project, unfortunately, due to disinformation. Without any animosity, I ask: how do you know what you have learned is not a subjective truth written by the victors to the pages of time? </p>

<p>To your last paragraph - I agree that it takes just one person to expose the apparatus, but in exposing it one does not stop it, rather one becomes a target. The apparatus still fully functions, and is still in complete control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Manhattan Project security people did, at times, traffic in disinformation, but generally they preferred silence whenever possible. The reason is that disinformation means you can get tripped up in lies upon lies, and they&#39;d prefer just being temporarily mysterious to having people starting to engage with whatever they put out there. Keep in mind that the fact that the US was making atomic bombs was never intended to be a permanent secret — they were just trying to hold down the fort until they dropped one on Japan. The most famous case of disinformation, where they tried to convince people in the towns around Los Alamos that they were working on &quot;electric rockets,&quot; failed miserably because nobody cared enough to spread the story. </p>

<p>As for the general question about what is known, what can be known: there are always limitations to any subject. What we do know, though, is that knowledge is rarely isolated. It connects up with other knowledge — there is a &quot;web.&quot; The Manhattan Project generated a tremendous amount of material, with no evidence that any of it was falsified purposefully. Not all of that material has been released or declassified, but a tremendous amount has been, and even a lot that hasn&#39;t been formally declassified has gotten out over the years through leaks and indiscretions... even through the archival records of other intelligence agencies! So while Klaus Fuchs and John von Neumann&#39;s postwar design for an H-bomb is still officially classified in the US, it is not in Russia, and <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/08/23/the-spy-the-human-computer-and-the-h-bomb/">the Russians have published it, in the original English!</a></p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t still things to be learned, or that there aren&#39;t surprises. (My entire job as an historian is predicated on the idea that there are new things to find and that I will find them!) But it does put some constraint on what a likely surprise is going to be. Weird bomb designs, bizarre policy decisions, and purposeful ignorance? Sure! Aliens, UFOs, and Freemasons? Probably not. In this way, it also allows us to rule out some kinds of speculation pretty easily, or at least to say, &quot;well, I would need a <em>lot</em> of evidence to convince me of that being likely.&quot; For more elaboration on what I mean here by the &quot;web,&quot; with some concrete examples dating from the Manhattan Project era, see <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1mre9g/what_are_some_things_that_make_historical/ccc3bl1">this previous comment I made</a> in response to a general question of how historians understand sources and anomalous claims. </p>

<p>On being a target — sure. But it does mean that there are limitations to what can be kept truly secret. Snowden&#39;s certainly a target at the moment, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the NSA has kept its big secrets. Whether the revelation stops the activity is an entirely separate question from whether it really keeps the secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great reply!</p>

<p>My only thought is regarding your last paragraph -
&quot;But it does mean that there are limitations to what can be kept truly secret&quot;.</p>

<p>I humbly disagree. I think those limitations are a function of the technology of our time. I would point to the recent Lavabit controversy, simply because the government agency could not decrypt Snowden&#39;s emails, so they instead used force to motivate the company. If they could decrypt the emails, they wouldn&#39;t have a reason to even contact the company. </p>

<p>This type of secrecy is real, exists today, and you&#39;ll be hard pressed to find someone familiar with cryptography that could sit down and crack that encryption. NSA couldn&#39;t and supposedly they have a 512 qubit quantum computer hanging out in their basement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you are saying, but technical limitations on secrecy <a href="http://xkcd.com/538/">are rarely the whole story</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Manhattan Project is a bad example. Scientists and engineers are not agents or even military indoctrinated and propagandised to follow orders unquestioningly. Scientists and engineers have many different motivations, from money to the technical challenge and all else in between. Many different races, cultures and backgrounds with different priorities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is important because the key is that the leaks DO happen, the secrets are NOT kept. And yet the orientation of public perception is more difficult to pierce or shift; the cultural programming is often strong enough to repel the revealed information. Hiding the juiciest secrets behind mountains of pop culture signal noise, the spin doctors also prepare our pyches to reject certain kinds of information out of hand for the sake of smooth groupthink.</p>

<p>That would actually be my answer to the original question of the thread, using no specific counterexample at all.. </p>

<p>Skeptic : &quot; ____ did not occur because it would be too big to conceal &quot;</p>

<p>Me : &quot; Yes, It was too big to conceal, and it has not been concealed. (Leaks occured / Contradictions were identified), but ignorance persisted.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve not seen any credible leaks in relation to things like 9/11 (the best example of gigantic and hard to hide conspiracy theory).</p>

<p>For example if it were a controlled demolition then I find it hard to believe that none of the, presumably, hundreds of technicians involved in rigging have come forward.</p>

<p>In the case of things like Sandy Hook and the Boston Marathon Bombing where people claim that victims were faked and &quot;crisis actors&quot; employed I find it even more improbable that those things would stay secret. All those people have lived in the real world - there would be dozens or hundreds of uninvolved individuals who could say, for each of them, &quot;hey, that&#39;s not true, I know him - he&#39;s lying&quot;</p>

<p>The examples I see of contradictions from witnesses seem to usually be easily explained by common causes, or simply be taken entirely out of context and misrepresented.</p>

<p>Obviously things can be planned and remain secret, but I think the things that do involve a small group and the secrecy is only assured up to a certain point. </p>

<p>Consider the raid on Bin Laden&#39;s compound - it was only really important that remain secret until it actually happened, even in that case the news of the event leaked at least an hour before it was officially announced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are lots of examples of secrecy control failure relating to 9/11. Even rumsfeld has slipped and said that the pennsylvania plane was &quot;shot down&quot;. Other less &#39;credible&#39; accounts (from a lower rank military) have reported knowledge of the same fact from other perspectives. A number of people have accidentally admitted that building 7 was demolished or &#39;pulled&#39; as well (larry silverstein for one). </p>

<p>And not every failure to ensure complete secrecy needs to come from insiders. Every recorded statement from the day about &#39;more bombs&#39; and &#39;other blasts&#39; in the buildings could be considered an failure of secrecy control if those blasts were indeed made by planted explosives.</p>

<p>The &quot;raid&quot; on &quot;Bin Laden&#39;s compound&quot; is a better example of my point. What your are talking about is a press release from the white house, and I can think of nothing less credible than that. Eyewitnesses on the ground, supported by the pictorial evidence, report that the helicopter that landed at the compound blew up as it tried to take off (The wrecked chopper was some sort of new stealth variety, pictures of the tail rotor which came down over the retaining wall haven&#39;t been matched to any acknowledged design). The wreckage did contain the bodies of up to a dozen men. Who really knows if any of them were bin laden. All the Spin doctors have to do to turn disaster into a plus for presidential approval ratings is play a little &quot;wag the dog&quot;. Now a few hundred million americans have bought into the hollywood version of a &quot;Bin Laden Raid&quot; that never even happened. And Ignorance persists...</p>

<p>One thing I do agree with you about, the secrets that keep involve a small group, smaller all the time. Probably why most of the Seals involved with that &quot;raid&quot; (who probably only pretended to have been there IMO) have now been killed.. </p>

<p>Rumsfeld spoke poorly, but it&#39;s very clear from the context of the quote that he was referring to hijackers not US military.</p>

<p>&quot;Pull it&quot; or &quot;Pulled&quot; are not and have never been terms that are used by anyone, let alone random building owners in conversation with fire chiefs, to mean &quot;demolished with explosives&quot;. To draw that conclusion from the quote requires that you invent a new meaning for the word and ignore the much more likely meaning.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Unless those people had actual definite knowledge that what they were describing were bombs (ie. they&#39;d been involved in putting them there) then there&#39;s no failure of secrecy there, there is simply people being confused in a time of chaos and trying to find words to describe what they are experiencing.</p>

<p>There is a lot we still don&#39;t know about the raid, obviously. But that wasn&#39;t really the point. As far as I&#39;m aware the consensus among aviation nerds is that modified Blackhawks were used. In fact I&#39;m fairly sure the idea that they were stealth modified has been long acknowledged by US sources. </p>

<p>The point was that even that event, top secret, was leaked to media before it was officially acknowledged. And a number of the military members involved spoke to media and others after the raid. And that was an event that was broadly popular and generally seen as justified.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve yet to see any of those claims backed up. Every time it&#39;s confirmed that any member of DEVGRU (&quot;SEAL Team 6&quot;) has died the conspiracy sites immediately jump to claim it &quot;a member of the team that killed Bin Laden&quot; which is baseless. While it&#39;s not known for sure, estimates are that DEVGRU has up to active operators. Of those it&#39;s believed that 24 were involved in Operation Neptune Spear - fewer than 1 in 10. So while it&#39;s likely, I suppose, that a number (probably small) of those on the Bin Laden mission have subsequently died, there&#39;s no way to confirm (and no evidence to suggest) that &quot;most&quot; have.</p>

<p>Almost every 9/11 conspiracy theory I&#39;ve seen, when the logistics and practicalities are considered, calls for the involvement of hundreds of people, if not more.</p>

<p>Often the people those theories involve are people like an FDNY commander that Larry Silverstein was talking to when he used the words &quot;pull it&quot; - the same FDNY that lost hundreds of firefighters that day. To believe that the FDNY or it&#39;s commanders were involved would then suggest that they knowingly sacrificed hundreds of brothers and none of them have ever spoken up on the issue.</p>

<p>How does this pretzel logic work? I&#39;m not aware that any firefighters died in the collapse of building 7, it was evacuated just prior. Being privy to a recorded conversation after the fact wouldn&#39;t constitute &#39;knowingly sacrifing&#39; your phantom martyr&#39;s even if they happened to have actually existed.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll have to agree to disagree on several  other points as well.. Your definition of secrecy control is a bit narrow. What if there was video of basement explosions, instead of witnesses? By your standards without an informed whistleblower from the inside no information leak has occured? I&#39;d rethink that one a bit betterer if I were you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The argument about Larry Silverstein&#39;s &quot;pull it&quot; quote is usually that he was instructing the FDNY to initiate a pre-determined demolition. There are other firefighter and police quotes that are also presented as supporting the idea that firefighters and police knew that the building was to be imploded. </p>

<p>No one died in building 7, but if the FDNY were involved in a coverup of the controlled demolition of that building, do you think they&#39;d stay quiet about the death of 300+ FDNY staff killed in the collapse of the North and South towers? It would make them complicit in the larger conspiracy - the one that cost the lives of so many colleagues and friends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I like to phrase this is that there is a difference between <em>suspecting</em> and <em>knowing</em>. There was ample reason to suspect the USA was building an atomic bomb during World War II, but knowing that it was a fact was a different level of knowledge. Until it was &quot;known,&quot; a lot of people instinctively rejected the possibility, or were unable to pick <em>this</em> particular rumor out of the vast swirl of rumors and suspicions that are at all times circulating. </p>

<p>With the recent NSA revelations, anyone who had followed <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/05/23/110523fa_fact_mayer">the Thomas Drake case</a> would have suspected they were doing all of the things that Snowden claimed they were doing. However having concrete proof that they were actually doing it was what moved it over the hump into the level of knowledge that gets it on CNN and the like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes this is very well put thanks. Of course there is a whole gradient, and in between suspecting and knowing is <em>believing</em>.</p>

<p>I understand why as a historian you have a special responsibility to <em>know</em> concretely but it also makes me cringe sometimes to hear long held beliefs referred to as mere &#39;suspicion&#39;. Perhaps my standards of evidence are simply lower than CNN&#39;s. My confirmation bias certainly works in the opposite direction ;)</p>

They definitely made the security people unhappy, even though they recognized that their actual disclosures to the Soviets about the atomic bomb were quite minor in comparison with what they knew Fuchs had already given away.

<p>I think it works the opposite way really. 9/11 is the best example. If you were involving hundreds or thousands of non-psychopaths to do compartmentalized tasks then it would all fall down on the morning of September 11th when those non-psychopaths realize they (unwittingly) caused the death of 3,000 innocent civilians.</p>

<p>but im preaching to the choir.</p>

<hr/>

<p>since i am here, id like to share a story. On my way home from work, i passed a car on the opposite end of my block that was just parked there. Now, ive noticed thisc ar before, not very often, but a few times and it was always in the same spot. The reason i remember this car because it had 4 rectangle boxes with thick wires leading into the car that appeared to be cameras or sensors of some sort; 2 on each side of the hood, pointing 90 degrees from each other (so they point to the side and front of the vehicle.</p>

<p>My first instinct that it was a cop car, but it was a Nissan Versa, fairly new, with dark tinted windows and it sat there for over an hour. I decided to investigate and after some vitamin THC, i drove around the block to see if the car was still there. it was, so i found a secluded area, parked and took a walk. As soon as i walked the 300 feet to where the car was, i noticed it was gone despite being there for an hour at least and running. </p>

<p>Could be cop, could be some guy with some sort of weird super bright LED headlights, could be gubberment
(if anyones interested i plan on recording my experience and sharing it)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now, lets assume, for the sake of conversation, that the CIA was in that car tracking cars and their movements and tieing them with their owners. how many people drove by that car? how many people stopped to wonder what that car is? how many have ever even thought of the idea of domestic spying in this manner?</p>

<p>None (or close to none). yet if i were to tell someone, &quot;hey there is a CIA vehicle tracking you in your neighborhood&quot; id get some laughs and eye rolls. I guess my point is, it could be happening right in your face and their acts are so outrageous you wouldnt believe it or realize it</p>

<p>That&#39;s absolutely right.</p>

<p>However if the owner of that bunker then goes on to kidnap and murder a bunch of women in that bunker then when he&#39;s caught all those contractors will realise what it was they built and likely go to the police.</p>

<p>In the case of 9/11 - if the compartmentalized people realized on the morning of 9/11 that they&#39;d helped kill 3,000 innocent people then are they all going to stay quiet? As the number involved increases then surely so does the likelihood that some of those people will spill their guts (regardless of money or blackmail) once they realize what they&#39;ve contributed to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Following up on the bunker example you picked up,</p>

<p>Only the murder waited/was caught 10 years afterwards. Do the contractors remember every single plumbing job they did?  secondly, this is a fallacy, if &quot;he is caught&quot; then police have access to all the contractors he used anyways, who built the place is irrellevant and them coming forward is kind of pointless.</p>

<p>9/11 is apples and oranges, and your first sentence is a fallacy. The point of compartmentalization is that you DONT realize. suggesting that &quot;it all came together&quot; when they saw it happened is simply not true and defeats the whole purpose of being compartmentalized in the first place. More compartmentalization doesnt increase the chances of them realizing what theyre doing, if anything decreases it.
If you want to get into the nuts and bolts, one can easily argue only a handful of people ere involved in 9/11, and the rest didnt know better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who was involved in making 9/11 happen, no matter how compartmentalized, would have realized what they&#39;d been involved with once it happened.</p>

<p>Compartmentalizing them help for opsec in that they can&#39;t blow the plan if they are compromised during the planning stages, but it&#39;s not really designed to maintain secrecy after the event.</p>

<p>The number of people potentially involved in a 9/11 conspiracy depends on what you believe, but in most cases it get pretty gigantic.</p>

<p>Anything that involves a controlled demolition element gets pretty big when you consider the logistics of actually rigging that.</p>

<p>If you believe that the BBC reports of WTC7&#39;s collapse suggest foreknowledge on the part of the media then you have to start including some number of media staff.</p>

<p>If you think that there were no planes (!) then you have to believe the hundreds of people taking photos and videos on that day were involved.</p>

<p>For the no planes theory you also have to consider what happened the passengers.</p>

<p>If you like the &quot;pull it&quot; line about WTC7 and the idea that firefighters and police said WTC7 was going to &quot;blow&quot; then you have to believe that some number of firefighters and police were in on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not getting into a 9/11 discussion. Your statement of most cases the people involved becomes gigantic is incredibly incorrect, since they are usually the theories that crumble first, for example:</p>

<p>*BBC reports what they are given, the anchors and editors dont know they simply follow what they are given. whered the reporter get it? from the news team. Whered they get it? their editor (or the equivalent of one in TV), whered he get it? probably from the government or some other entity, who in turn got it from someone else whos job is to sit in a small room and type up these sorts of messages all day. You know just as much as i do that media simply reads the talking points given to them and there is very little actual reporting going on.</p>

<p>*the idea there are no planes is silly, its been documented. live. by everyone. there are witness testimonies and stories</p>

<p>*The firefighters also claimed they heard explosions and bombs, for them to be in on it and then publicly say they heard explosions is a contradiction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anything that involves a controlled demolition element gets pretty big when you consider the logistics of actually rigging that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>*1 person who knows about demolition, 1 CIA team, could be done with a handful of people over a long period of time.<br/>
*Then, just for the sake of argument, a remote controlled airliner(s) (1 more person)<br/>
*and for shits and giggles, 1 more guy to pull the switch even though they could have been timed.  </p>

<p>in reality, 9/11 could have happened with as little as 20 people who actually knew what was happening. anyone involved could simply be bribed, intimidated or even killed shortly after. Think about it, you just helped the government plant explosives in a building and you did it probably in disguise all with the governments blessing and grace and no one around you in your life suspects a thing. And then, you actually manage to accomplish what they planned and did so in secret...is this really a force one would stand up and contest, or would they be stricken with fear for their saftey as well as their families? the latter, clearly.</p>

<p>The point being, compartmentalization DOES work and works very well. its the core of the US intelligence and the primary method to keep secrets of all kinds in all governments. it keeps nuclear launch codes from going public, it keeps secret bunkers from going public. it keeps EVERYTHING from being out in the open, thats why &quot;leaks&quot; are like candy to a child, because someone is crossing some serious boundaries to share that information with you. For something like 9/11, i would not be surprised if everyone who wasnt an elite was killed, infact thats probably what happened</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The popular conspiracy angle with the BBC is that they &quot;read the script too early&quot; - in a breaking news situation they don&#39;t have &quot;talking points&quot; - every news organisation is doing it for themselves getting their own information from their own sources. There was very little official information coming out during 9/11 - most of what we learned on the day was gathered from ad hoc informal interviews etc.</p></li>
<li><p>No planes is silly, but quite popular in various ways.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the bigger WTC7 arguments is that Larry Silverstein told the fire chief that they should &quot;pull it&quot; which is interpreted to mean &quot;blow it up with the pre-rigged explosives&quot; - in turn the supposed explosive demolition of WTC7 is used to support the idea that all the towers were rigged in that way. That would then imply that at least some on the FDNY were aware of the explosives, despite the fact that hundreds of firefighters died that day.</p></li>
<li><p>It took a team of 12 people over three weeks to rig a 26-story building (the largest ever imploded) - each of the WTC towers was 4 times the height. Even if a small CIA team could do the execution, implosion-style demolition isn&#39;t exactly their area of expertise.</p></li>
<li><p>If there was a remote controlled airliner (or two, or four) then someone had to build those. That&#39;s definitely more than a 1-man job. It also poses the question about where the passengers are.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I find it highly improbably that any of the popular 9/11 conspiracy theories could have been excuted with a small number of people. The only exception, perhaps, being that intelligence agencies could have turned a blind eye to the terrorist activities. That would be achievable with a small number of people already at high clearance levels and used to keeping secrets. But even then there&#39;s only so far a person&#39;s conscience will let them go I suspect - people realizing they&#39;d allowed 3,000 Americans to die would have quite the moral torment to deal with.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Compartmentalization is used to restrict who has access to data. Suggesting all bets are off after the execution suggests that everyone who knows anything is suddenly able to draw the whole picture.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in a breaking news situation they don&#39;t have &quot;talking points&quot; - every news organisation is doing it for themselves getting their own information from their own sources</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will repeat this again. They are REPORTERS, they REPORT the news. theyre not journalists and there is a very clear difference that seems to have been lost. What constitutes as news is going to an &quot;official&quot; and asking them what happened and then brining the answers back to the news station and publicizing them, even in a &quot;breaking news&quot; scenario. the BBC didnt send anyone to NYC to write what was happening as it happened, they went to someone else who <em>told</em> them what they eventually said on air.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there was a remote controlled airliner (or two, or four) then someone had to build those. That&#39;s definitely more than a 1-man job. It also poses the question about where the passengers are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Boeings were already built and already have auto-pilot. A handful of lines of code, maybe an additional piece of hardware (even though theres tons of equipment to piggy back on to send/receive the signal). have 1 or 2  guys strap some missiles or explosives on the bottom and you now have a remote controlled airplane that will disintegrate on impact. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It took a team of 12 people over three weeks to rig a 26-story building (the largest ever imploded) - each of the WTC towers was 4 times the height. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And conveniently, the building was undergoing maintenance weeks prior to 9/11. Including changing of wall panels. the idea that explosives were set up hours or even days before 9/11 is silly especially when them spending even an entire month doing it is still feasible. Who knows, maybe the actual construction crews were given strange &quot;new&quot; monitors or devices or equipment to put in the building and they were actually explosives? just an idea but you see what im saying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if a small CIA team could do the execution, implosion-style demolition isn&#39;t exactly their area of expertise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the CIA has toppled governments, framed leaders and public officials, warped public opinion, achieved mind control (to at least some degree for non MKUltra believers) and can easily have some one enter your life as a friend or coworker to spy on you and youd be none the wiser. The CIAs area of expertise is everything and anything. If they dont have access or knowledge on something, you better believe theyd get it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>people realizing they&#39;d allowed 3,000 Americans to die would have quite the moral torment to deal with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some .45 caliber aspirin would fix that right up. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Point being, a small handful could indeed pull it off. Everything needed was already there it just needs to be moved to the proper locations</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I elaborated more in response to someone else. Compartmentalization is the muscle behind it, while things mentioned by the OP (like propaganda/work environment) and blackmail are the skin. there have to be at least a handful of people who know that is going on otherwise nothing would ever get done or it would get done poorly.</p>

<p>For Hiroshima, for instance, whos to say the CIA didnt show up to a select core of scientists homes with knives and baseball bats while saying &quot;shhhhh&quot;? If youre that high up or that deep in the system, you know better and probably will keep silent. Thats why many whistle blowers are usually old farts. They lived their life and only have a few years left and dont care if theyre silenced.</p>

<p>Or with the NSA doing what its doing, they can pull up any conversation youve ever had with anyone ever. Flirted with a different woman while youre married? do some sort of drug? pedophile? &quot;would be a shame if this went public&#39;. everyone has skeletons in their closet.</p>

<p>Or even fat stacks of cash, classic. &quot;heres a shit ton of money, theres more where that came from, keep silent and youll never have to work again&quot; will be magical words on ALOT of people</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a GREAT post.  This is the argument always made by the POP SCIENTIST/New Atheism guys who get paid the big bucks and are told to disparage &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; (Bill Nye, Michio Kaku, Neil Tyson, Adam Savage, Penn Gillete).  It&#39;s such a ridiculous and unscientific argument, but it&#39;s so scientist prone.</p>

<p>Scientists working on advanced technologies are compartmentalized. This is also how large conspiracies work.  Need to know basis.  They&#39;re given a specific task to work on as part of a larger project.  </p>

<p>Religion and secret societies utilize the same method.  Freemasonry and Scientology are great examples.  As you move from one degree to the next you learn more of the story of Hiram Abiff, or you learn more galactic opera.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is and always was a preposterous argument barely worthy of a response. how well a secret is kept is entirely down the motivations of the people who know the secret and how many know it.</p>

<p>regarding motivations: how many cia/mafia/mossad/yakuza/mi6/triad members have volunteered information <em>out of the blue</em> about a treasonous or multi-murderous act they personally committed? ever? why would they? so they can spend the rest of their short life in jail? or be erased before ever seeing a lawyer? along with their entire family and the pet dog? who would they volunteer that information to with a certainty that it would actually reach the public? even the guardian and washington post got snowdens info &quot;cleared&quot; by the government for publication first. wikileaks is a controlled front that picks and choose when and what it leaks.</p>

<p>regarding secrecy: compartmentalization works and works well, there are probably many people who assisted on 9-11 who still do not know it to this day. the classic pyramid where no matter how many people are on each layer only 1 or 2 totally trustworthy people ever communicate between layers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems that a lot of Federal Agents that were not a part of the plan were sidelined. Many of the FBI Agents that would have investigated 9/11 were in California at a retreat. I suspect that a lot of the agents that did work on the investigation were given singular tasks and told to report only to who ever was running the operation. I&#39;m sure many of them heard or saw things that did not fit the official narrative but kept their mouths shut because they knew what would happen if they didn&#39;t. This operation was run by top leadership in the Military, all of whom were promoted after 9/11 even though they were negligent of their duties on 9/11. Donald Rumsfeld, the top military leader on 9/11 refused to do his job even when his subordinates repeatedly asked him what the plan was and after the plane hit the Pentagon, rather than working on a response, was out on the Pentagon front lawn, &quot;helping&quot; carry wounded victims to the ambulance and participating in photo opps. Many of the Military Commanders that were in the chain of command to deal with highjacked planes were missing or unavailable. Two of the commanders were first day on the job. Totally inexperienced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen this argument made before in regard to the likes of 9/11 (where some conspiracies effectively call for the involvement of thousands, including even police and firefighters).</p>

<p>It&#39;s absolutely reasonable that if you <em>were</em> conducting an operation such as those hypothesized by some in relation to 9/11 you would keep operatives isolated and limit the scope of their knowledge. </p>

<p>However all that falls over on the morning of September 11th when thousands of people die in lower Manhatten as the world watches. At that point if you were involved in this conspiracy, especially unwittingly, then there&#39;s a really really good chance you&#39;d realize exactly what you&#39;d done, and a great chance you&#39;d make your involvement known to media, friends, or online.</p>

<p>The compartmentalization makes it even more difficult because you can&#39;t interview all the people you&#39;re hiring to make sure they agree with your aims and will keep their mouth shut after the event. </p>

<p>Also in most cases these large scale secrets only need to be kept secret while they&#39;re being planned. After the fact it&#39;s much less important that their existence stay secret.</p>

<p>Regardless of how little participants may have known ahead of time, or how much they may have been paid, I still find it entirely implausible that potentially thousands of people were involved in staging 9/11 and have stayed quiet about it for 12 years. Even more so if some or all of those people were in the dark about exactly what they were doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since the common person gets and reveals their &quot;information&quot; through electronic means now, it is far more easy to conceal things like never before. The watchers can input a few commands and filter/delete anything from anywhere connected to the web/cloud.

    <div class="md"><p>People get information electronically sure, but that makes it both more and less secure. For a very simple example look at SnapChat - the software and servers take measures to secure the images and delete them after a certain period (more secure than email or IM) but that security is defeated by a screen capture.</p>

<p>The fact that things are transmitted and stored electronically makes the MUCH easier to copy (look at Edward Snowden). I can screenshot an email I receive and save it on my computer, a USB stick, put it on my phone and upload it to a dozen online storage lockers... No one can ever know if they have all the copies. There is no &quot;original&quot;.</p>

<p>And beyond all that - we still retain most of our information in our heads. We can still tell people what we know. Sure, it&#39;s harder to prove, but it&#39;s a start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. It is easier than ever for a criminal conspiratorial act to be concealed from the general public. Data can be easily altered, intercepted, backdated, or just erased altogether. And there&#39;s nothing you or I can do about any of it.</p>

<p>A person&#39;s life is essentially subject to change - at least, their online identity. And doesn&#39;t Facebook/Twitter/Gmail/etc ensure that we all have an online identity? (Yes, most of us do.)</p>

<p>Compare this to the 1940&#39;s or even the 1970&#39;s. Or even, say, 2001. Lots of things were paper-based. Hardcopy records were either more prevalent or the <em>only</em> type of record (depending on which decade we&#39;re talking about). Film was used for photographic evidence.</p>

<p>Now? Everything is digital. A bit somewhere in a non-tangible &quot;cloud&quot; of data. Before it becomes information a person can use, anything can happen to it.</p>

<p>So yes things <em>are</em> different...</p>

We have various forms of evidence of what happened. Any explanatory narrative cannot be true if it is not consistent with the evidence. The official story fails in that regard. Speculating about the unlikeliness of alternative theories does absolutely nothing to buttress the official story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think much of the aspect of &quot;control by patriotism&quot; comes from the decades leading up to the Manhattan project.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the 1900&#39;s behaviorism became a huge scientific study. It became a focus of many psychologists and they basically studied how to get a desired behavior out of an organism. Watson, one the most famous behaviorists, said he could make any man from any baby.</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking, heavy funding was given to people in this emerging field. Even after ww2, the nazi scientists doing similar behaviorist experimentation were brought to the US. Even some apart of the nuremberg trials. </p>

<p>So...our govt has funded and been interested in extensive research regarding how behaviors are formed, effected, and controlled by other variables. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure they could figure out how to keep such helpless, regular citizens under raps without any force or money. Don&#39;t underestimate the power of psychology. </p>

<p>Just observe the JFK shooting. Massive psych operation. Jfk was shot by more than one person. There&#39;s no arguing. You could try, but I won&#39;t stop saying this...Kill shot, from the front. Second shooter. 2 people = conspiracy by definition. Psych op. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, i think the analogy is a bit unfair.  I feel that secrecy about a weapons program during wartime (a pretty big one at that) is very very different from the type of secrecy that may be implied by the &quot;X is to big&quot;.  I guess what I&#39;m trying to say, is that, personally, i believe there would be a lot more internal justification, and a greater chance of success, for secrecy for weapons during wartime, than some sort of false flagish operation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, I mentioned the illuminati lizard jew exactly zero times.</p>

<p>you start by arguing against a point i never made, that the manhattan project&#39;s secrets were never leaked. in fact they were, to at least the russians. however, the secrets were kept from the public until after the successful detonation of a test bomb. in that regard, the program was successful, and successfully kept its secrets secret enough to give the US the upper hand to end ww2. i can only infer that was the desired outcome from the project.</p>

<p>you then berate me with names because you are not intelligent enough to debate me on any point I have raised. indeed it seems you lack the basic intelligence to grasp the subject matter we are discussing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Manhattan Project security people did, at times, traffic in disinformation, but generally they preferred silence whenever possible. The reason is that disinformation means you can get tripped up in lies upon lies, and they&#39;d prefer just being temporarily mysterious to having people starting to engage with whatever they put out there. Keep in mind that the fact that the US was making atomic bombs was never intended to be a permanent secret — they were just trying to hold down the fort until they dropped one on Japan. The most famous case of disinformation, where they tried to convince people in the towns around Los Alamos that they were working on &quot;electric rockets,&quot; failed miserably because nobody cared enough to spread the story. </p>

<p>As for the general question about what is known, what can be known: there are always limitations to any subject. What we do know, though, is that knowledge is rarely isolated. It connects up with other knowledge — there is a &quot;web.&quot; The Manhattan Project generated a tremendous amount of material, with no evidence that any of it was falsified purposefully. Not all of that material has been released or declassified, but a tremendous amount has been, and even a lot that hasn&#39;t been formally declassified has gotten out over the years through leaks and indiscretions... even through the archival records of other intelligence agencies! So while Klaus Fuchs and John von Neumann&#39;s postwar design for an H-bomb is still officially classified in the US, it is not in Russia, and <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/08/23/the-spy-the-human-computer-and-the-h-bomb/">the Russians have published it, in the original English!</a></p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t still things to be learned, or that there aren&#39;t surprises. (My entire job as an historian is predicated on the idea that there are new things to find and that I will find them!) But it does put some constraint on what a likely surprise is going to be. Weird bomb designs, bizarre policy decisions, and purposeful ignorance? Sure! Aliens, UFOs, and Freemasons? Probably not. In this way, it also allows us to rule out some kinds of speculation pretty easily, or at least to say, &quot;well, I would need a <em>lot</em> of evidence to convince me of that being likely.&quot; For more elaboration on what I mean here by the &quot;web,&quot; with some concrete examples dating from the Manhattan Project era, see <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1mre9g/what_are_some_things_that_make_historical/ccc3bl1">this previous comment I made</a> in response to a general question of how historians understand sources and anomalous claims. </p>

<p>On being a target — sure. But it does mean that there are limitations to what can be kept truly secret. Snowden&#39;s certainly a target at the moment, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the NSA has kept its big secrets. Whether the revelation stops the activity is an entirely separate question from whether it really keeps the secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The argument about Larry Silverstein&#39;s &quot;pull it&quot; quote is usually that he was instructing the FDNY to initiate a pre-determined demolition. There are other firefighter and police quotes that are also presented as supporting the idea that firefighters and police knew that the building was to be imploded. </p>

<p>No one died in building 7, but if the FDNY were involved in a coverup of the controlled demolition of that building, do you think they&#39;d stay quiet about the death of 300+ FDNY staff killed in the collapse of the North and South towers? It would make them complicit in the larger conspiracy - the one that cost the lives of so many colleagues and friends.</p>
