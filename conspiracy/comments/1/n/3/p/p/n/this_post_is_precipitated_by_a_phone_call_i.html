        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just a little background info on myself; I&#39;m a retired combat vet of the Iraq war - I was medically discharged in 2011. I was in the infantry. I&#39;ve seen a bunch of reports/blogposts/opinion pieces about government (US) ramp up of in preparation for some large event on or around Oct. 1. A read an article around August about FEMA and the cdc ordering vaccines and then a few days ago an article about three diesel trucks full of &quot;martial law&quot; signs being transported somewhere in Illinois. The first has no sources whatsoever and I wouldn&#39;t expect it to, the second&#39;s sources are shaky at best. I then receive a phone call yesterday from a friend I served with and deployed with of whom I trust completely. He told me he felt uncomfortable with some recent training he was receiving and it felt like he was being prepped for a declaration of martial law. He said the first day of a multi-day class was barrier procedures to block avenues of approach and civilian detaining procedures as well as the types of drugs involved on and around the post he is stationed on. He said they brought in a retired police officer to conduct much of the training. I won&#39;t reveal anything about my source because he needs to remain anonymous. All I can say is that he is active duty and in the infantry. He doesn&#39;t put stock in conspiracy theories, an neither do I for the most part. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gathered that much. I&#39;m not really convinced about the date because there are way to many things going on around Oct. 1 to be able to pinpoint anything. I thought maybe this could be a preparation for some civil unrest if the government shuts down (I use that term loosely as government shutdown creates fear OMG those who don&#39;t know what it means), but that really would make sense to train the active duty soldiers whose specialty is killing things. There&#39;s a national guard and police force for dealing with civil disorder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well your phone call is very interesting.  I think you should look into it as having to do with DHS/FBI fusion and nothing to do with FEMA.</p>

<p>As you are a retired vet, I am surprised you are making so much of October 1:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. federal government&#39;s fiscal year begins on 1 October of the previous calendar year and ends on 30 September of the year with which it is numbered</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, seeing procurements which must complete within the fiscal year is completely normal.  I&#39;ve seen that before.</p>

<p>My guess is that nothing&#39;s going to happen, again.</p>

<p>This FEMA area 3 thing has become viral and not just among internet users. People are sharing this by word of mouth and telephone. It seems very plausible that it could be an engineered leak.</p>

<p>And even then, there are plenty of people in official capacities who don&#39;t want martial law; because they disagree with it morally, or they don&#39;t stand to gain anything from it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That martial law/FEMA stuff isn&#39;t ridiculous, but it&#39;s a long way from happening on any large scale.  As for a small event, just based on the typical 6 week cycle, I&#39;d be more inclined to guess the first week in November.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, I believe we are still going to justify an attack on Syria, and it may not have to be justified until after the attack (that would set an interesting precedent).  If it&#39;s going to happen in October, it will likely be the first week (October 2nd-7th) when there is no moon.  So they may be beefing up security in anticipation of a missile campaign on Damascus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the comment. It&#39;s nice to be able to get some first hand sources, even of yours is anecdotal. The hardest thing with this stuff is trying to find reliable sources and figuring out what&#39;s crap and what&#39;s not. Then again if the sources were reliable they would be conspiracies lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, as well as a bunch of others, believe there is something huge to happen very soon in America. Each and every conspiracy you hear that has some validity to it seems to tie together pretty well when looking at the big picture. I don&#39;t know what your view is on life, as in your spiritual belief, but I do hope you look for the right answers and seek the truth as to where this world is headed. 
I know this will get down voted because of my next statement, but that&#39;s simply because of the events to unfold all around.</p>

<p>I suggest you read the bible and seek Christ, because things are only going to get worse. God bless!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you know so much about the bible, you&#39;d clearly know what Im saying. I&#39;m simply warning and letting you decide for yourself. I&#39;m not trying to convert anyone. 
Before you criticize something, it&#39;s best to actually know what it is you&#39;re criticizing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, do me a favor next time and add an &quot;if&quot; statement next time. As in If you share my beliefs and are Christian I suggest you read your bible and whatnot.</p>

<p>Sometimes criticism is the best way to make your point. Christians wedge their belief structure into too many conversations as it is. As much as you believed you had to make your statement I believe that I had to let you know how I felt about it.</p>

<p>After all.. If you don&#39;t know that you upset someone with your words how will you know if you are following the word in Leviticus? You are to treat others as you wish to be treated.</p>

<p>I doubt you want to hear about my religion. So don&#39;t tell me about yours. It&#39;s quite a simple concept.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re assuming I don&#39;t want to hear about your beliefs? I actually do. Listening to someone shows them love, whereas not listening shows them anything but love. That is not being a true Christian. 
I&#39;m sorry you were upset by me inserting my beliefs into this conversation, but that has nothing to do with the passages you&#39;re mentioning. I simply share my beliefs because I believe them to be true. They show only love, and that is what I want to share. So yes, going with your argument over Leviticus, Im trying to show love to you from God as I am commanded just as I want others to love me too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I had this page filled then realized something. No one get&#39;s anywhere when dealing with beliefs. I can talk till I&#39;m blue in my face but due to your religious bias you will always feel the way you do. I&#39;ll just have to live with knowing that there&#39;s more than one viewpoint when it comes to faith and interacting with others. </p>

<p>Personally, I believe respect for your fellow human negates my right to inject my personal beliefs into a conversation, even if it&#39;s only to wish someone well. I try my best to be culture neutral in most situations due to the large amount of people I deal with on a daily basis. It&#39;s a fact that people become uncomfortable when religion is mentioned, even a simple &quot;bless you&quot;, even those who share your religion may feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Since you asked, my belief system is my own. I have many theories on religions but hold to no modern religion. The 3 monotheistic religions are tainted. None follow the old teachings. Therefore, I&#39;ve decided that humanity and the earth are more important for now. If there were a term for it I&#39;d call it &quot;Humanity in Gaea, Gods in Death.&quot; </p>

<p>Following any of the 3 will eventually lead you on the wrong path. Those religions are designed to usurp your innate belief structure that protects your fellow man. It will eventually corrupt any human, even those with strong moral values. Look at what&#39;s happening with Israel, the US, and Iran. Do you really think that we would even entertain bombing civilians if religious zealots weren&#39;t trying to bring about the apocalypse? They just gotta pull the mask of the beast. Fuck prophecy. Fuck religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been a conscious effort for decades now to cultivate the view that you have about religion AND spirituality. It really is the ultimate conspiracy because the NWO cannot thrive with a spiritually awake population. It just can&#39;t. Look at the Falun Gong folks in China...it&#39;s not even a &quot;religion&quot; and they are cracking down on it because the meditation that they teach and practice liberates their minds from the fetters that the Communist dictatorship needs to maintain control. And that is only a small example of the power that a spiritually aware population has. (Look at the energy they pour into destroying Tibetan Buddhism! Now that is power!) Yes, INSTITUTIONAL religions are all corrupt and are very far from true spiritual perspective but that is part of the effort to divorce you from any spiritual movement.</p>

<p>So GrandpaSkitzo speaks the truth. Prepare your souls and your spirit, make peace with your friends and family, and act accordingly amongst your community. Which means to show no quarter to the fascists and the greedheads!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for not automatically attacking religion or beliefs as most people do. 
I do agree on fixing things now though. Even if one were to know what was to happen, that&#39;s no excuse to not try to do anything to change it. Such as myself, even though I fullheartedly believe in the bible, God, and what He says will happen, it does not mean I am to sit back and watch. I&#39;m right there with you on the battlefield trying to change this terrible world that humanity has created. After all, we all are one in the same no matter how much we disagree with each other. We all have hearts that beat and minds that think, some not so much as others, so we all need to work together and learn to live side by side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very nice. Exactly. PRAYER is a verb and an highly active one. By stopping and talking to some homeless guy and looking him in the eyes with love in your heart is a prayer in itself, but if you only give him food or coffee with no regard to his inner soul and spiritual condition, with your only concern being that he is fed, you are really doing very little to help.</p>

<p>There are a lot of so called &quot;religious&quot; people who simply pray and do nothing and change nothing in their lives and then complain loudly when their lives get fucked up even though they did nothing to stop it. We are not talking about that kind of stagnant selfish spiritual activity. We need to consciously enter into spiritual activity with love and compassion in our heart...and that includes doing things now...but by freaking out and getting things in order in the physical world first will not help. We need both!  </p>
