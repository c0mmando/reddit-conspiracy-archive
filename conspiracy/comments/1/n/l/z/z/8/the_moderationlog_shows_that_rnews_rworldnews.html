       Of course they do. Admins have banned domains from being submitted so there's that.

       I believe your headline is misleading. Just because the mod log shows posts have fallen into the spam filter many times that is an automatic process that mods have no control over. Also, if someone submits an article from a major media source but violates a rule in the sidebar of a subreddit then those posts will be removed. In
       <a href="/r/Politics">
        /r/Politics
       </a>
       at least we encourage users who violate sidebar rules when posting to repost their link while following the aforementioned rules.

       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       blocks, there has to be a way to block them. The filter has to be adjustable. Though maybe the mods message the admins to do it. But it's being done so there's a way to do it.

       The issue here is that ModerationLog still says [spam filtered] even if we remove a post for violating a sidebar rule (like if the post was an image for example). It makes no distinction, so what you perceive as the mods filtering major news sites like WP, NYT, ABC, CBS, Fox, CNN, etc. what is really happening is that the user created their own title or used the word "BREAKING:" in the title or something like that.

       The admins are purposefully discreet about how much information they release about the spam filter and the voting algorithm because the more information they provide the better spammers are at getting around the system. It is common for moderators to get blamed for posts getting removed by the spam filter and it's funny because the busiest mods are the ones approving all the posts that accidentally fall into the filter. Subreddits like ModerationLog do have some advantages but one disadvantage is that it is not a "smart" bot and doesn't often display accurate information.

       I don't have the power to prevent articles from accidentally falling into the filter, but what I can do is ensure that posts that fall in there by accident get removed as quickly as possible. Currently, the filter is clean, but thank you for your concern. Perhaps you should find a way to spend your time more wisely instead of yelling at me about things out of my control.

       It is very pro-obama. But I'm seeing a lot of more Democratic, leftist articles ending up on the moderation log. As a leftist I notice. And since alternet is very leftist, I noticed its articles were suddenly blocked. Thanks to the shills writing "feedback" to the mods and admins about how terrible
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       was. It was the "feedback" of these shills, probably with the kind of multiple fake accounts HBGary described, that got atheism and politics removed from the defaults and got many sources blocked on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . Showing they don't trust the readers, reddit users, to vote up and down and decide what shows. When who doesn't trust us, is the plutocracy and their controlled media. Like
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       is the most censored, rightie sub on reddit now. And it has been pushed for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe there were orders from people higher up on the food chain than the few reddit employees. In which case the reddit employees have to keep it quiet to keep their jobs. Though maybe if one of them leaves or is fired, they can go whistle-blower and tell us what really happened.

       I hear ya, but the Democrats are really not "leftist."  Obama and the Democrats are far-rightward of America on so many issues.  Pretty much anything involving lobbyist money, actually... health care reform, economy, taxes, corporate corruption, military and wars, etc.

      <p>
       That's why this is an issue.  If the Democrats actually represented voters, the shills wouldn't need to control mod positions to try to stamp out reality.

       The Democrats are ENABLING the Republicans.  It's symbiotic.  Obama is praising Reagan.  In 2009, the Democrats could have crushed the GOP... just ruined it.  Obama told us what we wanted to hear, and he beat McCain so badly that the networks didn't even report the final numbers.

       No, I don't have any contempt for whoever "us" nor do I have contempt for the voting system. Just because the system is democratic does not mean it always produces the intended result. People are supposed to vote based on content appropriateness, not whether they agree or disagree. There are fundamental flaws in the system that are clear to anyone who bothers to examine the issue. If you want democracy, vote with your feet and create your own rival subreddit.

       If this continues, at some point someone will make a reddit rival. I know I keep looking. And then they'll be something that sets it off and reddit will go the way of digg. And all the thousands of hours I have spent will be for naught.

       Err, no. Way back when, there was no 'remove' button IIRC. The only way to remove posts was to spam them, so default spam filters are pretty bad in the sense that there are
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       posts that get filtered even though they shouldn't be getting filtered.

       Err... no.  There was plenty of discussion at the time about ways that mods could train the spam filter to block certain types of posts or even users.  I saw it happen to me.  (Thanks to davidriess666.)

       These issues have been mostly resolved at this point. Check
       <a href="/r/ChangeLog">
        /r/ChangeLog
       </a>
       for more info. Certain domains could still be spammed though and certain users could fall into the filter for whatever reason. The mods are not to blame for this. We are the ones lifting posts out of the filter that have fallen in there inadvertently. DR666 is no longer a mod and we have tools now so that if we wanted to block you or a domain no one would need to train the spam filter for any reason. Plus, we are open about what domains we ban and list that information publicly.

       After all the shill bullshit I've seen, the best way to convince us of what you're saying is to add
       <a href="/u/uncensorship">
        /u/uncensorship

       to the mods.  Otherwise, sorry, we've heard it before.

       It was part of a serious discussion, actually.  But yeah, BEP is not to be taken seriously.

       Speaking of seriously, if mods want to be considered trustworthy, why don't they subscribe to uncensorship?

       No, I don't have any contempt for whoever "us" nor do I have contempt for the voting system. Just because the system is democratic does not mean it always produces the intended result. People are supposed to vote based on content appropriateness, not whether they agree or disagree. There are fundamental flaws in the system that are clear to anyone who bothers to examine the issue. If you want democracy, vote with your feet and create your own rival subreddit.

       The Democrats are ENABLING the Republicans.  It's symbiotic.  Obama is praising Reagan.  In 2009, the Democrats could have crushed the GOP... just ruined it.  Obama told us what we wanted to hear, and he beat McCain so badly that the networks didn't even report the final numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democrats could have CRUSHED the GOP... all they had to do was deliver on Obama's campaign promises.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the rest is history.  The Democrats have walked back pretty much everything Obama promised.
