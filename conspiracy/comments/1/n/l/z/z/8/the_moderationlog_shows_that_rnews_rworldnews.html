Just because the mod log shows posts have fallen into the spam filter many times that is an automatic process that mods have no control over. Also, if someone submits an article from a major media source but violates a rule in the sidebar of a subreddit then those posts will be removed. In <a href="/r/Politics">/r/Politics</a> at least we encourage users who violate sidebar rules when posting to repost their link while following the aforementioned rules.</p>

<p>For certain sources to always be sent to the spam filter, like Alternet and all the other sources <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> blocks, there has to be a way to block them. The filter has to be adjustable. Though maybe the mods message the admins to do it. But it&#39;s being done so there&#39;s a way to do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The admins are purposefully discreet about how much information they release about the spam filter and the voting algorithm because the more information they provide the better spammers are at getting around the system. It is common for moderators to get blamed for posts getting removed by the spam filter and it&#39;s funny because the busiest mods are the ones approving all the posts that accidentally fall into the filter. Subreddits like ModerationLog do have some advantages but one disadvantage is that it is not a &quot;smart&quot; bot and doesn&#39;t often display accurate information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is very pro-obama. But I&#39;m seeing a lot of more Democratic, leftist articles ending up on the moderation log. As a leftist I notice. And since alternet is very leftist, I noticed its articles were suddenly blocked. Thanks to the shills writing &quot;feedback&quot; to the mods and admins about how terrible <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> was. It was the &quot;feedback&quot; of these shills, probably with the kind of multiple fake accounts HBGary described, that got atheism and politics removed from the defaults and got many sources blocked on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. Showing they don&#39;t trust the readers, reddit users, to vote up and down and decide what shows. When who doesn&#39;t trust us, is the plutocracy and their controlled media. Like <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> is the most censored, rightie sub on reddit now. And it has been pushed for a while. </p>

<p>Or maybe there were orders from people higher up on the food chain than the few reddit employees. In which case the reddit employees have to keep it quiet to keep their jobs. Though maybe if one of them leaves or is fired, they can go whistle-blower and tell us what really happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear ya, but the Democrats are really not &quot;leftist.&quot;  Obama and the Democrats are far-rightward of America on so many issues.  Pretty much anything involving lobbyist money, actually... health care reform, economy, taxes, corporate corruption, military and wars, etc.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why this is an issue.  If the Democrats actually represented voters, the shills wouldn&#39;t need to control mod positions to try to stamp out reality.</p>

<p>Now, now. Everyone knows most people in r/Politics don&#39;t vote based on anything other than the headline. The more sensational, the better. That&#39;s why we have taken steps to reduce the number of sites we allow which contain sensational headlines matched with blog spam content. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Err... no.  There was plenty of discussion at the time about ways that mods could train the spam filter to block certain types of posts or even users.  I saw it happen to me.  (Thanks to davidriess666.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These issues have been mostly resolved at this point. Check <a href="/r/ChangeLog">/r/ChangeLog</a> for more info. Certain domains could still be spammed though and certain users could fall into the filter for whatever reason. The mods are not to blame for this. We are the ones lifting posts out of the filter that have fallen in there inadvertently. DR666 is no longer a mod and we have tools now so that if we wanted to block you or a domain no one would need to train the spam filter for any reason. Plus, we are open about what domains we ban and list that information publicly. </p>
