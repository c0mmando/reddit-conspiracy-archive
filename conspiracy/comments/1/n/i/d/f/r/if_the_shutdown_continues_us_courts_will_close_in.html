       Ah, my bad. I was thinking of state court. In my state, you can be held 72 hours without being charged. so you can be arrested on wednesday night and charged on friday night. no court on the weekends. so you can be held on a bullshit charge (disorderly, resisting, etc) for nearly a week if the system works how it is designed.

       Why do you assume he was attempting to be constructive? Why not destructive, as in eliminating the incredibly ignorant thing the OP just said from the general conversation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Government shutdowns have happened many times before. Implying a shutdown might lead to some breakdown of the current legal system absolutely shows ignorance, and many would say it could be accurately labeled as moronic.

       I see your point but the shutdown isn't over. Yes it could lead to a breakdown of the current system, how/why are you so certain it can't? Last time it happened was almost 2 decades ago. A lot has changed since then. It's moronic to claim you know what the outcome will be.

       I shouldn't give you anymore time but you must have edited your response to ask me that question. I can only assume you'll respond with the obligatory "

My claim is that something worse

        ...it's important to note that the Clinton-era shutdowns took place against the background of a booming economy. 
Today we have a weak economy, with falling government spending one main cause of that weakness. A shutdown would amount to a further economic hit, which could become a big deal if the shutdown went on for a long time

       There are better ways to manage ignorance than derision. This approach results in people being static in their ideas, which lends itself to a form of fundamentalism.

       There is a better way. Managing ignorance is something we all have in common. It is a good thing to be directed to higher pastures. Why go out of our way to make it a bad thing?

       People are not interested in improving? I do not believe this to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people are not interested in acknowledging that they could use improvement, because to acknowledge such a thing opens them up to those who would use this admission as an opportunity to deride them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone is ignorant. You are ignorant. I am ignorant. Is it bad to be ignorant, when one cannot help but be so? To be ignorant is to be human. I think it is foolish to deride one another for being human.

       Dont know what? What a Gov shutdown is? To say it's happened before so it's fine, is short sighted. Any number of things could happen, especially if this drags out until the 17th. Or better yet, imagine if they dont come to an agreement before they start taking welfare checks away from people. Then, shit actually hits the fan. So, to say nothing will happen is like trying to predict the future....actually it is predicting the future (key word, predicting). You're not magic so maybe you can quit acting like it. I could call you a moron but I dont think this sub needs anymore useless name calling. You can have your opinion but calling OP a moron doesn't help anything.

       Again, I am agreeing with you that you are correct, but you also have to understand that you are only correct until you are not.  Things haven't been exactly "normal" this past year, so I think the natural reaction to be more alarmed is appropriate.

       This doesn't happen every few years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you're thinking of what happened in 2011? Where we came
       <em>
        close
       </em>
       to a shutdown? We've come
       <em>
        close
       </em>
       to a shutdown many times, but seldom have we actually gone over the cliff. The last time was in 1995, and it lasted 21 days into 96. What happens if this one lasts 21 days? The country defaults on it's debt, and we see looting and rioting in the streets. The global markets collapse. What happens after TEN days? The courts shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this will be over in a few days. But you can't legitimately say this happens every few years, because it doesn't. The fact that the government has actually shut down now, even if only for a few days, is in itself is historical.

       If you go to the bank on the 17th and can't get  your money out of the ATM, you'll be pissed too.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, the outcome of a global financial collapse will likely include looting. If you think that when people stop getting their welfare checks they'll just sit quietly at home and behave themselves, you're a retard.

       the two are not related.. the money just doesn't default because the government shuts down for a while.. if you honestly think the world will come to an end and there will be rioting on the streets because congress is a few days late you are crazy

       The two are more related than your parents. The whole point of coming up with a budget before last night was to AVOID running out of money on the 17th. They are necessarily related.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I didn't say "the world will come to an end...because congress is a few days late," I said IF the government stays shut down UNTIL THE 17TH, then the world will come to an end.

       I really feel like you're baiting me here. You CANNOT be this base without being deftly and willfully ignorant or a paid shill, and neither is an attractive option for you. You cannot put words in other peoples' mouths - it's NOT a solid argument tactic and you WILL get called out for it.

       Like I said, the likelihood is this will get resolved in a few days. You can't say "I told you so" for something I also said. And again - I don't know how many times I'm going to have to repeat myself - I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IN A FEW DAYS - I SAID IF IT GOES TO THE 17TH, IT WILL. THAT'S MORE THAN A FEW DAYS AWAY, EINSTEIN.

       I'm not saying "the world WILL end 100% no way around it," I'm saying "if certain criteria are fulfilled, we will certainly see a default on debt and a resulting financial collapse."
      </p>
      <p>
       Your example of France nuking the US is retarded because there's no pretext in place currently for that to happen. It's a fallacy to make an argument like that and you know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pretext IS IN PLACE, however, for the US to default on its debts on the 17th of this month. It's like your FUCKING CREDIT CARD BILL. IF YOU DON'T PAY THE BILL, PAST A CERTAIN DATE THEY WILL CUT YOUR CARD. IF YOU STILL REFUSE TO PAY IT, YOU WILL PERSONALLY DEFAULT ON YOUR DEBT. NOT PAYING THE BILL IS SETTING A PRETEXT. HOW ARE YOU NOT GETTING THIS?!?
      </p>
      <p>
       You CANNOT say to me that if you don't pay your credit card bill, nothing will happen.
