You don&#39;t have to link me to a page saying they do, I&#39;m not criticizing you for saying they exist, I&#39;m criticizing you for using the term as a blanket dismal for anyone who preaches moderation or rationality instead of jumping to your outrageous conclusions without any evidence. So good job making up a straw man to argue against there.</p>

<p>Oh, and I also appreciate how in your next paragraph that you agree with me about how it&#39;s a shitty thing to do. Sorry if you thought I was lumping you in with those who scream &quot;SHILL!&quot; as soon as they read something they disagree with. I can&#39;t imagine how anyone would think you were that kind of person, with you making up a straw man argument about how they exist and all when I never said otherwise.</p>

<p>Please explain how it&#39;s hypocritical. Also this phrase: &quot;steering the conversation towards deriding the validity of discussion of shills!&quot; is word salad. Meaningless. What, exactly, is wrong with &quot;steering the conversation towards deriding the validity of discussion of shills?&quot; You&#39;re damn right I&#39;m deriding the validity of a discussion of shills. You all use the term way too much (You agreed to that, otherwise you wouldn&#39;t mind being &quot;sat in judgment of.&quot;) You&#39;ve made it into a way to dismiss people who you don&#39;t agree with without having to listen to them. The fact that you&#39;re sitting here talking about shills means you&#39;ve made a witch hunt of them. </p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s not at all hypocritical to offer this as a blanket judgement of a group of people with wildly differing views, stances, and debate techniques, right? No, it&#39;s much easier to assume all <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> contributors are of a hive mind, so that you can disparage them all in one fell swoop. Not unlike when some in the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> sub call anyone with an opinion that differs from theirs <em>a shill</em>. </p>

<p>I never said it wasn&#39;t a shitty thing to do. I did say it was a shitty thing to do that which you are accusing others of doing as a way of condemning others for doing it.</p>

<p>Also this phrase: &quot;steering the conversation towards deriding the validity of discussion of shills!&quot; is word salad.</p>

<p>No. It&#39;s not. Actual shills, who do work very hard to steer discourse in this sub every day choose this vector all the time. </p>
