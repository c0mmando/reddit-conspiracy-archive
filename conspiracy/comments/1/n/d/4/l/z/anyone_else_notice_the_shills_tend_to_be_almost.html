       This is a strong example of shill behaviour. Could we do a weekly roundup of the most down-voted posts on r/conspiracy and stick it to the top page? This would burst their bubble in one move...

       EDIT: see the post history of the people in that thread. Almost every single one with positive karma is a regular in r/conspiratard. I saw one who is Jewish and other Israel apologists on there who come to r/conspiracy to fuck up threads about Israel. Not surprising since much of your post was about Israel.

       One theory I've had on it is that the negative attention on the NSA deflects from negative attention placed on other agencies. They're the sacrificial lambs allowing everyone else to go about their unconstitutional business. There were other little clouds on those slides, and everyone ignores them (just like how everyone pretty much ignored the news that the NSA shares US citizens' data, unredacted, with Israel - which to me sounds pretty treasonous...although it's probable we only have as much data as we do because they shared their cache with us).

       I'm totally with you. Snowden's a former(?) CIA agent and has said almost nothing about them. Some of his stories (like "NSA is targrting google") seem pretty suspect considering that fact plus googles close relationship with the cia.

       The "shills" don't seem to have a problem with information that casts the United States hegemony in a bad light. Perhaps the endgame is to deconstruct the narrative of the United States government specifically?

       they are specific agency or corporation/industry focused, hired or told to defend one position or point of view. 'US govt' per se is not on their remit.
      </p>
      <p>
       your average shill 'cubicle warrior' is in their early twenties, wet behind the ears, not knowledgeable about the world at all, not much life experience, they have to be trained to defend an issue, so they are narrow minded and unable to spread their wisdom around on different subjects. (except FPS gaming which is a obvious trait that shows in govt 'cubicle warriors', it shows their age at a glance)

       keen fresh faced kids straight out of college or some DoD training program, after a couple of years they must burn out and get very jaded, the psychologically toll of knowingly defending BS in the face of truth would be horrible.

       The NSA's surveillance is being offloaded to AI - I wouldn't be surprised if the result of this scandal is to 'disappear' the NSA and totally privatize surveillance/security/policing.

       If that's where we're headed, resource shortages, wealth redistribution, and democracy seem like the important issues to focus on. Is it even possible to halt technological progress?

       I think the end result is going to be total transparency. Ironic as it sounds, it may be a form of direct democracy governed by technological information and access. Simply put, it's going to become more difficult for the deep state to continue to operate above the normal state.

       The traditional media (mouthpiece of the establishment) is openly mocked and scrutinized in a way that was unfathomable as few as 5 years ago not just by nutters like you and I, but by pretty much everyone. Most people are still wildly off in their presumptions of empirical reality, but they at least recognize that they're being lied to blatantly and constantly.

       Personally I believe it because this is an actual bone fide conspiracy. Whereas people often get called shills because they are arguing about 9/11 or chemtrails I don’t think anyone can dispute what the NSA has done. Essentially there is no controversy.

       A shill is usually pretty obvious, especially when you look at the comment history. I've seen some who post every hour for 20 hours on one topic every day. I haven't seen one on the NSA.

       is shill behavior, these uber experts with impeccable writings skills and university grammar, suddenly decide to haunt r/conspiracy and other subreddits , why !?, are they super bored for something to do with their life for a day/week/month or on somebody's payroll.

       I eat up the threads from r/conspiracy, but I personally think the NSA scandal has been overdone. Sometimes datamining is just datamining. In order for the authorities to know what is abnormal, they must know what is normal. Everyone has a "permanent record," and it shouldn't be something which causes shame. The American public buys into the convenience of being on the grid. All records are viewed by someone. Not that I give the government my fullhearted support, but there has to be a watchmen. As far as I feel, NSA officials should tighten ethical procedures before hiring. I want the government to know what I am doing, that way I know I'm protected. Not trying to sound shillish, but I believe the datamining is necessary. Let me know if you disagree, I hope for a constructive conversation on the matter

       well I agree with this. But the most important thing with NSA scandal is "dont do it in secret and than lie to your people" The goverment should represent people. If goverment does something against their people and doesnt even gives them the option to make a decision that isnt democracy anymore. And the witch hunting of Edward Snowden just proves that it isnt democratic goverment anymore. That is why it is so important. Not the data gathering, but the secrets, intimidations of companies etc... I know people dont want to accept it. But this basically means there isnt just a corrupt shadow goverment. There is organized corrupt shadow goverment. Which means it have to be built a longer time ago than since terrorists. Which means that all those odd things about terrorism and false flags attack and spying on civil rights movement etc... are 100% more odd (I hate the image of hundreads years old satanistic illuminaty order, but the fact is that on the top there is hidden organized goverment that could be capable of anything. We cant know it if dont know who is ruling and what laws is he making)
