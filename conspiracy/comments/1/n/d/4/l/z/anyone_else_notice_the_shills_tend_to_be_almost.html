<p>EDIT: see the post history of the people in that thread. Almost every single one with positive karma is a regular in r/conspiratard. I saw one who is Jewish and other Israel apologists on there who come to r/conspiracy to fuck up threads about Israel. Not surprising since much of your post was about Israel.</p>

<p>your average shill &#39;cubicle warrior&#39; is in their early twenties, wet behind the ears, not knowledgeable about the world at all, not much life experience, they have to be trained to defend an issue, so they are narrow minded and unable to spread their wisdom around on different subjects.

<p>The NSA&#39;s surveillance is being offloaded to AI - I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the result of this scandal is to &#39;disappear&#39; the NSA and totally privatize surveillance/security/policing.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s where we&#39;re headed, resource shortages, wealth redistribution, and democracy seem like the important issues to focus on. Is it even possible to halt technological progress?</p>

<p>That’s a very good point actually, they are not going to waste their time trying to convert those who have already made up their minds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I eat up the threads from r/conspiracy, but I personally think the NSA scandal has been overdone. Sometimes datamining is just datamining. In order for the authorities to know what is abnormal, they must know what is normal. Everyone has a &quot;permanent record,&quot; and it shouldn&#39;t be something which causes shame. The American public buys into the convenience of being on the grid. All records are viewed by someone. Not that I give the government my fullhearted support, but there has to be a watchmen. As far as I feel, NSA officials should tighten ethical procedures before hiring. I want the government to know what I am doing, that way I know I&#39;m protected. Not trying to sound shillish, but I believe the datamining is necessary. Let me know if you disagree, I hope for a constructive conversation on the matter</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well I agree with this. But the most important thing with NSA scandal is &quot;dont do it in secret and than lie to your people&quot; The goverment should represent people. If goverment does something against their people and doesnt even gives them the option to make a decision that isnt democracy anymore. And the witch hunting of Edward Snowden just proves that it isnt democratic goverment anymore. That is why it is so important. Not the data gathering, but the secrets, intimidations of companies etc... I know people dont want to accept it. But this basically means there isnt just a corrupt shadow goverment. There is organized corrupt shadow goverment. Which means it have to be built a longer time ago than since terrorists. Which means that all those odd things about terrorism and false flags attack and spying on civil rights movement etc... are 100% more odd (I hate the image of hundreads years old satanistic illuminaty order, but the fact is that on the top there is hidden organized goverment that could be capable of anything. We cant know it if dont know who is ruling and what laws is he making)</p>
