       Last month, there were rumors of an unauthorized transfer of nuclear warheads from Dyess Air Force Base to an undisclosed location in South Carolina:
      </p>
      <p>
       '“Dyess is beginning to move out nuclear war heads today. I got a tap from DERMO earlier. He said it was the first time they have been even acknowledged since being put there in the 1980s. No signature was required for transfer… There was no directive. He said that Dyess Commander was on site to give authority to release. No one knew where they were going really, but the truck driver said to take them to South Carolina and another pick up will take them from there.”'
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The very next day Senator Lindsay Graham made some very bizarre statements to the press saying South Carolina may be nuked by terrorists if we do not attack Syria.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And now, three weeks later, it is announced that on the very same day of Sen. Graham's statement, Vice Admiral Giardina, 2nd in command of the US nuclear arsenal has been suspended pending an investigation.

       This ain't no Sorcha Fail bullshit, folks. Make of it what you will, but these events in such close proximity to one another seem highly suspicious to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vice Admirals aren't the type to have a gambling problem so serious that it would put him teetering on bankruptcy, which is the only reason you would have a security clearance revoked for gambling.
      </p>
      <p>
       It reminds me of the same bullshit reason that was given for Gen. Carter Ham and Rear Admiral Gaouette's removal a week after Benghazi went down...one was the head of all US forces in Africa and the other was the head of the carrier strike group that was parked in the Middle East at the time...rumor has it that they tried to disobey the White House stand down order and tried to send a rescue mission:

       This is seriously heating up. I don't like AJ because I think he is a bit of a fear monger. The timing and the coincidences are compounding to the point that it cannot be ignored any more. I am taking this seriously. Chances are, nothing will happen on Oct 1st, but this makes me uneasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       One piece of information is an oddity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two pieces are a coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three pieces make a pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are now seeing the possibility of an event take shape. 1) AJ's story was unconfirmed but sensational. 2) Graham's statements were confirmed, sensational, and came absolutely OUT OF NOWHERE. 3) High ranking military official with oversight of all operations in his domain who was removed from the equation (this one confirmed by several credible news organizations, most importantly the AP).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is pattern. Hopefully nothing will come of this, but I will be watching and waiting.

       I agree with you, something is fishy about this. The Gawker article states that local law enforcement were the ones that opened the initial investigation into gambling.  I'm sorry but as second in command of the United States nuclear arsenal, you aren't going to go down for playing cards, or betting on football games.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama only prosecutes whistleblowers, and those who stand up to him. The Dep. Admiral needs to come public, now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also worth noting, the AP article didn't mention anything about gambling, and I think being the AP and the nature of the Deputy Admiral's job duties discussed in the article, the AP would say if they believed suspension due to gambling problem, but they didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gambling problem is sourced in Gawker article, other MSM outlets are taking the bait. Gawker says two anonymous sources told them, yea ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think we'll ever learn the real truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:
I take that back, just reread the AP article, and they are now saying that 
the admiral was suspended due to events "involving counterfeit gambling chips at a western Iowa casino"
      </p>
      <p>
       Also added is the incident at Minot Air Force Base.

       Nice to know I'm not alone. The awareness we share can be burdensome if not managed properly. I remind myself often that the fear that is inherent to "knowing" is probably intentional and yet another management tool employed by TPTB.
