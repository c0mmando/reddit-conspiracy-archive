       I didn't strongly disagree with my Government until I gained insight from alternative news sources via the internet. If I were still watching CNN, like I was when I was 14, I'd be as ignorant as most Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is my generation, and hopefully newer ones, are beginning to see our government for what it really is; and that truth is mainly propagated through the internet rather than mainstream sources. That shift in control of information is definitely putting a dent in the Government's power to limit what we see.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet is a threat to the powers that be. People are becoming more dissatisfied with their representatives everyday, now that they don't have to rely on biased news sources. Some people may radicalize and choose to resort to a direct attack, but at this point I don't personally care and in the future, if things ever got real bad, I may even support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, they need to control the internet soon. If they don't, we'll be out in the streets and very angry. So they'll push for more control over the internet, and we may let it happen. So far, most attempts at fucking us over haven't gotten too far; I hope it stays like that.

       Yeah, that's not going to fix shit. I'm sure they'll realize that once the Government begins expanding it's powers even more. People can take only so much bullshit before seeing things for what they really are.

       Maybe... but then a whole next generation pops up to make the same error.  You might even argue that politicians require an endless in-flow of ignorant voters in order to flourish.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have heard that this was actually what was behind the big immigration drives in the very early 1900's-- trying to get non-cynical people onto the voter rolls.

       Well, our knowledge isn't going to disappear. My generation has an opportunity to teach the next generations how the world really works. As we get older the best thing we can do is educate the ignorant; if they're not already doing it themselves.

       The internet is also now a bigger threat than ever to those in positions of power. We won't have this free speech for long if we're not careful and aware of the actions our Government takes.

       The NSA bullshit is troubling enough, and a clear sign that they want that control over our freedom. It's quite clear their agenda regarding the internet is malicious, I hope we don't simply roll over when they make their move.

       Right now they're kinda low level and mostly interested in marketing in the more major subs. Many of the gits in this here sub are from conspiratard and WhiteRights. They're not shills so much as losers with a lot of time on their hands. They're unpaid assholes.

      <p>
       Depending on how things go we may find paid shills in this sub.

       I met one online and almost went on a date with her until she described her actual job. Now, she did it more in a freelance context, and for companies that hired her for specific products. But if smaller companies are doing this you can damn well be sure the government, big oil, mil-ind groups etc have armies of these people monitoring and influencing reddit and other forums.

       What?  They are most certainly here now.  And of you can't spot them, you obviously aren't looking very hard.  Look to: Those who support the official lies/government issued conspiracy theory of 9/11. Those who ignore facts wilfully.  Those who support GMO as safe, without any proof to back up said beliefs.  Hell, your ignorance could indicate a certain level of shillery.

       Yes, this. If this behavior was desired, it would be called "a momentous piece of progress in the advancement of our nation" and a bit of hero-worship would ensue. Not to mention that it doesn't matter to the gubment whether or not it's

       Being informed is radicalizing. Knowing about 911 is radicalizing. Knowing how we have been lied to and lied to is radicalizing. The truth is radicalizing more and more people. And you don't have to be young to wake up. That is why the global plutocracy is determined to control the Internet.

       I was shocked and amazed that Will Smith's kid hit the nail on the head a few weeks ago with some twitter comments which gave me hope for today's youth. They are more skeptical about privacy issues and government propaganda/indoctrination and the days of living your life on facebook appear to be on the way out.

       It's building but running parallel to that knowledge is the sense that things are being implemented to make things more difficult for everyone. Right now the US government have the power to declare martial law under ambiguous 'emergencies', they can intercept any communication no matter what it is, they can arrest people in secret under more ambiguously worded laws and they can put out propaganda lawfully to the American people.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this put together a long with the increased militarisation of local and state police, the increasing reach of the DHS and the amount of bullshit they can get away with doesn't paint a good picture. I've seen people dismiss this over the years and pass it all off because "it's been like this for years, nothing has happened". And yeah, nothing has reached critical mass yet - but that doesn't mean nothing is being carefully being put into place, it's just that people seem to not look at things in a broader sense. People think there is some time frame that tyranny has to conform to so if it doesn't happen in ten years, then it's not happened at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since 9/11 and The Patriot Act, look how much the security apparatus has expanded, look how much else has been justified under the guise of terrorism and ask yourself if you think these people in power have your best interests at heart when all they do is show utter disdain for you. They haven't suddenly become empathetic and nice, they just put on a smiley face and say if (insert thing doesn't become law) then bad things will happen. It's always based on an emotional response because the facts don't justify what they want.

       Would make a good episode of Fresh Prince of Bel Air 2 with Will talking to his son at night on the bed, asking his son if he sent out a twitter which is hurting Will's public image, but his son begins to convince him that speaking up about the truth is more important than that.

       Oh please. I went to public schools and public universities. The only thing I was indoctrinated about was the cause of the civil war. (I'm in the south and there were actual laws on the book that public schools couldn't teach slavery was the cause.) But I was always a science major and science minor. Hard to indoctrinate people in a trigonometry or chemistry class. But I had a friend who was a political science major who apparently got the truth. It was only after 911 and the Internet that I understood some of the things she tried to tell me.

       What they can't handle is diffuse, opportunistic resistance: Did the SWAT MRAP come to your shop for an oil change? Shame if it got some detergent in the transmission.  Upgrading the PD's computers? Pity if they got some malware that exfiltrated their private info. Do the kids of some security state goon go to your school? Tough bit of luck if their grades kept them out of good universities.

       No one is innocent when they are actively cheering and/or supporting our destruction.  As we've seen, civil methods do not work.  Much has been wasted attempting to change beneath the imposed and rigged official rules.  We must escalate the methodology used to progress.  Piece by piece, and nothing is too small.  You're hung up on one weak example.  Open your eyes to the big picture.  Be the change, and do whatever you feel is necessary.

       The wealthy want to make sure the people are unarmed and helpless. It reminds me of Japan. When the west first contacted Japan one of the things they sold was guns. It didn't take long before armed peasants started to rebel. A peasant with a gun was more than the equal of a samurai warrior paid and controlled by the wealthy. After a nearly successful rebellion the Japanese closed the country to foreign contact and made guns illegal. So the people were completely subjugated until after WWII.

       Gee. It couldn't be anything to do with the fact that they grew up and watched their brothers and friends recruited straight out of their high schools(which they were required to attend) by paid killers to go off and fight/die in wars which were later admitted to have been based on
       <em>
        lies and complete fabrications
       </em>
       , where 1,000,000 or so have died and tens of thousands of Americans have lost everything, died, or been maimed for life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, the groups of criminals who are responsible for all of these deaths continued to walk free, and the idiots in the "mainstream"(government-controlled media issuing two seemingly opposing sides of one main social narrative) defend them and ignore their crimes while trying to convince us all to keep sending our kids / brothers / friends to die in these illegal wars based on lies. These criminals are also using money they extract from the population at gunpoint to pay their footmen/security details, and if you don't give them 20-50% of
       <em>
        all the income you ever receive
       </em>
       they will send their soldiers/footmen to come knock down your door and kidnap you, or worse if you resist being dragged out of your home at gunpoint even a little bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       No big deal, right guys, just more ruin and death than any terrorist group/gang/criminal organization has
       <em>
        ever caused period
       </em>
       in the modern world. Anyone opposing the war-agendas and questioning the bullshit lies put out by
       <em>
        people who have proven themselves more than capable of lying to the entire country in ways that will result in massive wars
       </em>
       are called "radicals" by the new propagandists(
       <em>
        everyone on television news, as all of those networks are wholly owned by the same corporate overlords that own the US government
       </em>
       ) - because hey, some random angry muslims are scarier than that. ^
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's the fact that trillions of dollars are being extracted from America in secret deals by organizations whose agents will either blatantly lie to congressmen/senators or simply
       <em>
        refuse to answer
       </em>
       questions directed at them about
       <strong>
        THE LARGEST WEALTH TRANSFERS IN HUMAN HISTORY
       </strong>
       . That could have something to do with it, right? Pretty sure "the terists" aren't doing that. The masses are being robbed and the presidency was in the hands of an ex-CIA strongman/social climber named George Bush who then passed the throne to his son, Bush II, who together started multiple wars killing thousands of Americans based on total and complete lies, while giving the Lordship of Florida to another relative - a family that has since bought large pieces of land in a country without a functional criminal extradition treaty with the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then their "opposition" comes to power, does
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       about that, breaks all campaign promises to the people, become the opposite of what they promise to be, and talk about how "the internet is radicalizing people". No, the actions of the criminals who have silently seized power in DC are what is "radicalizing the youth", the internet is just the only as yet uncontrolled outlet they have to receive factual/unspun(not propaganda) information about it. None of our "representatives" use their power to do anything about it aside from an infinite variety of committees they use to make themselves look "tough on crime"/"tough on the bankers"/"tough on issue X/"tough on illegal wiretapping" in the media while doing
       <em>
        nothing about it
       </em>
       as they are being paid by the people they are investigating while in reality we are all being forced to pay them to spy on us and they all know it's "legal" through a backdoor pushed through by King Bush II and his legal aids. We pay or they'll come take us away.

       You've been the enemy the entire time.  That much is clear.  Al Qaeda is the scapegoat.  And the one thing they have always said is true.  They do hate us for our freedom.  They are doing everything possible to remove that freedom.  One world control.  So long as they remain in control.

       Paranoid corporatocracies will never be happy with the amount of control they have over the populous. They know what is coming. They think somehow if they can nip open revolt in the bud, they can maintain the status quo. However, one day the curtain of normality will be pulled back to reveal a barren depleted husk of a planet that can not longer support life in the fashion we have become accustomed. That's when it starts to get seriously ugly, and I really don't think any amount of Internet control, or data collection is really going to make a jot of difference. The rich should probably think about building some fortified cities for themselves.
