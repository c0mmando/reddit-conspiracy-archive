       Pretty much everyone in this sub knows reddit is being compromised.  r/politics was removed as default subreddit.  r/worldnews is now throwing terrible titles out that are "allowed" to stay up.  This is causing the commenters to divide and bicker about EVERYTHING.  The real news is being deleted as they gain traction for various reasons.  irrelevant , nobody is interested, posted in wrong sub.  Fucking sucks.

       This line of reasoning is retarded. Regardless of its initial backing, Tor is an active open source project that has been independently vetted multiple times over by security professionals and outside developers alike.
      </p>
      <p>
       But okay, let's assume that we can't rely on that, because this
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , where paranoia is both most prevalent, and most likely to be realistic. Let's go by track record. Clearly DPR was caught because of flaws in Tor, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope. DPR got his real name dirty all over the place, cross-contaminated account names, all kinds of idiot rookie shit. The truly fascinating thing about it is that he wasn't caught
       <em>
        sooner.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Tor did its job superbly, but in the end, it can only go so far to protect you from your own stupidity. The superpower analogy would be "even if you're using invisibility, people will still notice it if you go around spray-painting BILLY WUZ HERE on everything."

       Who knows... there's more going on. 60% of tor's funding came from the feds. Its founder, jacob applebaum, is a very vocal defender of julian assange, which matters because of

       Snowden is a plant--plain and simple. The telling moment was when he "hid out" at the airport hotel in Russia--yeah right!

       The airport itself gave him some cover from Russian security forces (who would no doubt love to pick his brain) as well since being in the international terminal meant he was not technically in Russian territory...at least, that's how I understood it.

       He wasn't hiding out, he was just stuck there. He couldn't leave as he couldn't get on a plane without his passport, which was retracted by the US.

        He's the msm's favorite whistleblower (no love for russ tice, sibel edmonds, indira singh, michael springman, susan lindauer, etc.)
       </li>
       <li>
        Some of his claims are questionable (bin laden dna ev, nsa targeting google)
       </li>

        He's said almost nothing about the cia and carlyle group

       slow down a second buddy, why would the feds go
       <em>
        out of their way
       </em>
       to proclaim that TOR is safe?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is precisely what they did in the complaint files surrounding the silk road case. there are a host of things that are still very unclear about this whole thing, the Undercover cops that faked the whole murder thing, the "random" search that uncovered the fake IDs, etc. p.p
      </p>
      <p>
       granted, at the moment it looks like DPR made a bunch of rookie mistakes, but you do not know that for certain at ALL. nothing is certain at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, your claim that it is somehow widely accepted that TOR is safe is blatantly false, thre is no consensus on this matter and many "experts" say VPN and then tor is the only way to insure even a modicum of security

       I wonder why such "experts" would say that VPNs are useful for anonymity (even as a stage in the chain), since they generally have distinct IP addresses and a paper trail back to the person renting them.

       well not an expert, but if you have the first and last node of the communication you can get anything. Anyone can connect their pc for communication so if US gov would made a normal size server, they could own many nodes which would rise their % to be an exit node.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I would have to have some knowledge about this to know how to get info on/from the first node, but I think NSA could help with this

       If you mean the next gen of anonymized browsing, I2P probably. It's pretty analogous to TOR, but has some competitive security features.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you mean, "I've got TOR installed, now what?", then it basically boils down to this: don't do stuff that will identify you on the internet. TOR gets the fundamentals handled for you, so as long as you don't do anything in your browsing that ties to your identity, no one will be able to figure out who did those things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, don't "cross-contaminate", meaning associating one account with another. Reused usernames/passwords and all that. Your anon presence is like a Sudoku puzzle - the more numbers you give away (especially in the same box, or the same row, or the same column), the more easily the authorities can discover the relationships and fill in those blanks, tying everything together until it's enough for a warrant.

       You're only half right. Tor held up its end of the bargain, and open source software is almost invariably more secure than its proprietary counterparts (where sabotage is an order of magnitude more difficult to detect).

       On the other hand, yeah, DPR was a moron and managed to get his real name implicated all over the place, not to mention linked to a bunch of alt usernames. Very much a textbook case for leaving a breadcrumb trail right back to your doorstep - it's frankly a bit shocking he managed to hold out as long as he did, which really says something about the competence of federal investigators (not that you should be underestimating them, some teams are obviously more competent than others in a field that wide).

       The good thing is, relevant open source projects are inspected very thouroughly if there are many people developing or learning from it. And if a backdoor is discovered it can almost always be tracked back to its author through version control and he will be excluded from further developements.
      </p>

       But you're right there's no guarantee, that there are no backdoors at all.

        Parallel construction is a police process of building a parallel - or separate - evidentiary basis for a criminal investigation which otherwise would rely upon evidence or tips received either from a confidential source or that might fall under the category of fruit of the poison tree. By building a separate evidentiary basis for an investigation, such as corroborating evidence using other resources or finding other valid reasons to investigate, prosecutors are able to avoid disclosing confidential or otherwise unusable evidence.[1]

       The comments are where you attack.  Pick any link and post the relevant shit that expands the story.  The information cannot be contained.  Take for example
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nmbd9/sopa_didnt_die_its_parts_live_on_as_executive/cck3w8d?context=3">
        this
       </a>
       post that expands what is being hidden regarding the TPP exposing it on the SOPA story.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the mean time, new methods of disseminating information and news links should be sought out.   Expose the mods for burring important links like the NSA and create an alternative sub that competes with the corrupted sub reddits.  Point people to the
       <a href="/r/moderationlog">
        /r/moderationlog
       </a>
       to see what is being pulled from subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The war is not lost, rather the corruption has just changed tactics.  Its simply time to change ours.  If you stand static, the corruption will find a way to subdue the flow of information that poses resistance.

       Either that or people want "proof" even with pictures and shit.  I posted a link once informing the people about african deployments that obama isn't even talking about and even posted a picture of a memo sent out to the unit who received it.  I just didn't show the persons name because this is reddit and we are supposed to be anonymous on here... so I should protect others anonymity as well.  Well a bunch got all butt hurt wanting detailed information of ongoing missions, to show the name of the person who signed it, etc.  Honestly it seemed like a complete setup from someone who watches the subreddit to gather information on the people who post.  Wouldn't put it past them.

       PS. Who gives a fuck who you find annoying. Atheists are annoying if A) you don't like their message, or B) they are just fed up with dealing with dishonest people; and there is no way to believe religion without being dishonest at some point. It is the blatant dishonesty through deliberate ignorance or outright lying that gets on our nerves. Religion is a problem in society and has outstayed its welcome, enough is enough we are smarter than this.

       I would hate to start a conspiracy on Conde Nast, but that's something else entirely. Every forum you go to with any sort of meaningful discussion is infiltrated in some way whether you be looking up deep politics, new age movements, old movements, religious movements, U.F.O.'s, reptilians, alien species, whatever - there's always more truth to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, someone will always try to turn you away from it with misinformation and disinformation as well as straight out propaganda and lies. It is up to you as a reader and researcher as well as free thinker to judge personally on what you can believe and what makes the most sense and if the sources fit.

       is a very typical comment for this subreddit. You can almost guarantee that if anyone brings a "topic to light" to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       there will be an upvoted comment to the effect of "of course" or "didn't you already know that".

       I'm not passing judgement nor imprinting any assumptions. Just wanted to highlight that for anyone who hadn't already noticed it. I'll let you decide what that means to you as a subscriber and be on my way.

       I was keeping a close eye on my post, and within a short period of time that post went from 1 to 6 points while there were only a few comments.  Seemed like a shitty comment that got power voted quick.  Obviously I cannot prove that so take it for what it's worth.

       Is there any information on the pros/cons of a social network that requires a verified ID?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've said some insane alcohol-fueled shit on the internet over the years. But I could do it with impunity... no accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sock puppets are another issue. I could theoretically create thousands of sock puppet accounts on reddit. I have no doubt there are hundreds of thousands of these logged in daily. The military, corporations, special interest groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit will die eventually. The anonymous voting system is dog shit. It will never work... for us. It works flawlessly for the corporatocracy though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just have a gut feeling that to have a truely meaningful discussion -- about anything -- we're going to have to show our faces... to each other. Fuck the corporatocracy. As I said, they already know who we are but we have no idea who they are. That puts them a position to completely game the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's because we stay hidden from one another that these bastards can blend right in with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just thinking while I type. I would like to read anything on this subject though.

       I remember reading about something like a huge local (citywide) network that is separated from the Internet.  Obviously something like this would take a lot of resources and would probably be compromised as well.

       A startup would be difficult to compete with the super saturated and super large youtube.  Storage requirement and legal barriers would destroy all hope.  Same goes for reddit really.  It would be like g+ vs facebook.

       It is up to as a community to upvote the correct material. To be honest, there has been no real juicy information leaked to the conspiracy forums or boards in years. It's all been the same rehashed dribble and a lot of it is coming from the government itself. I would like to see a new so called hidden circle unmasked, but it has yet to happen. I've seen the same players over and over and over again whether it be members of Bilderberg, certain brotherhoods, Skull &amp; Bones, The 300's, Jesuits, Knights of Malta, JASONS, Navy, The Queen, certain Chinese families, Romans, Atlanteans, everything you name it I've most likely seen it. The thing is, we never get any closer to solving things and the puzzle deep down of who's really our self appointed controller or controllers, and that's what troubles me.

       Even DrudgeRport.com has turned. I think the government got to Matt awhile back. Scary to see everyone curving to the pressure.

       To be fair, did you see all the crap on the front page of
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       ? It would look bad for a new user to come to the front page, and see all that shit covered with it; it would make Reddit look bad.

       Thanks for posting this, with any luck this will get top comment and
       <a href="/r/conspriacy">

       in general will change for the better. Instead of comments like this
