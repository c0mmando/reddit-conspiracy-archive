       r/conspiracy is my favorite subreddit. There are many redditors here who have logically opinions. Sometimes we disagree, but when we do, we are able to respect eachothers point as both sides follow logical reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       i also like r/conspiracy because it is the only place to actually conduct active discussions about conspiracies, whether we believe them or not, its fun and interesting to discuss things with like minded people.
      </p>
      <p>
       the discussions that take place here are truely wonderful, even if sometimes a bit emotionally charged.
      </p>
      <p>
       with all that said, it is truely a shame that the one place that exists to supposedly support the discussion of conspiracies tends to be most offended by them. Ive personally submitted quite a few posts, and just like the OP said, immediately they get downvoted. After a few hrs, when real conspiracy redditors actually have had time to digest the theories provided in my posts, there tends to be a lot of upvotes. These upvotes tend to correspond to submitted contributions to the post, while downvotes tend to be correlated with nothing, as if someone read the title, saw a conspiracy was being discussed, and downvoted without any earnest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, if you dont support discussions about conspiracies, you dont go on to those subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like another poster said before me, when you eliminate those people who arent interested and dont peruse this subreddit, the only others left are those who contribute, and those who try and suppress.

       I tried bringing this to their attention... Some posts deserve it but others that only try to get people to discuss ideas should not endure such negative feedback. I'd like to blame the shills but in this case maybe there really are good old fashioned dick heads on this sub who down-vote anything that does not involve popular belief.

       So you are saying that you want the mods to override the will of the community and artificially boost the posts that you are interested in.

       No, its the contrary. Its not about posts i'm interested in. It's about posts that promote discussions and free thinking. Those posts tend to get hammered by down-votes...
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to be confused by suggesting that there is a conventional community to override in the first place. This sub is filled with both serious contributors to conspiracies and shills/idiots that choose to hammer down every little bit of creativity that stands out from those who are bold enough to ask questions. If the community filters itself, so be it to have a system that equalizes everything so everyone gets an equal footing on their own beliefs and ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your sarcasm disgusts me. I am here to defend those who tried to enlighten others with their own ideas and yet I get you with your biased approach pulling an accusatory tone of selfishness.

       Wow, point so very missed. The reason for OP is that the voting is not 'natural' any longer. Downvotes are not made by people who have an opinion and explain it. It is political downvoting that has become so obvious and it has a direct influence on valid posts to disappear. You no see thees?

       I've noticed this as well. Many of the posts that I deem most relevant, informative, and pertinent get downvoted to oblivion quite quickly. And there is absolutely nothing that should be downvoted about a video explaining personal liberties, tyranny, and how we can stop it.

       There has been a Reddit wide move to marginalize thought which does not fit the status quo/consumption for the masses paradigm, and this has increased dramatically over the past few weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed an uptick probably around the time of the Syrian Rebel false flag, but unlike other upticks in shill/bury that thought initiatives, this one appears to have been extended and amplified.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were way out ahead of the Syrian situation, and now the Syrian war has been indefinitely delayed.  What else is coming up that we seem to be out ahead of (power grid drills anyone), and is that the reason for this concerted effort?

       But that's the point of a free and open forum, to discuss ideas no matter how outrageous.

       If you don't like it, then don't participate.

       So let me get this straight. It's a free and open forum, as long as .. I believe the same things as you do?

       Interesting. Do you hear that sound? That's the sound of Robert Anton Wilson spinning in his grave.

       And no, I am not unable to discuss ideas that I don't believe in. I just prefer to stick to topics that I am actually capable of believing, due to their having some semblance of plausibility. It's a little thing I like to call "not wasting my fucking time and energy".

       Fair enough, and I apologize for my tone. If you look at the entirety of the conversation in this thread, you may see why I'm a little tetchy at the moment. I'm not particularly fond of being called a traitorous retard for saying that people are generally reasonable.

       And to be fair, I only used a ridiculous topic to make a point about keeping conversation open and free.  Every day  I see topics that seem outlandish or stupid, but instead of downvoting, unusually ignore them.  Why?  Because this forum should be a place where we can explore outlandish ideas, and I don't want to ruin it for other users who want to engage in said topics.

       The people that want to disrupt this sub would love nothing more than to see the users here fight amongst ourselves, so we can't let that happen.

       Your argumentation is fantastic. He's right. Most posts here are downvoted because a majority of people think a majority of conspiracies are a load of bunk. Then all you do is sling insults and act like a 12 year old when you get the most realistic answer.

       The heck are "most people" doing on this reddit? Wait, they aren't. Only interested parties are involved here. So that makes your argument bunk. Now that we've weeded out "most people" you will see that there are those hunting the conspiracies, and those shunting the conspiracies.

       fair and reasonable until you, and others from the left side of the IQ bell curve, started coming out of the cracks a few days ago. First thing we do is send all the traitors and extreme retards like

       I have been coming to this community as a reader for awhile now maybe 2+ years and I have seen a big drop in valuable content compared to 6-12 months ago?  I would say that far to many people have come from closed minds and ruining this community for what it once was.  I also see this from libertarian sub as well.  I would think we're seeing a shift in some people, sadly those people are bringing over habits of old (it doesn't fit to my narrative so down vote).  Combine this was the attention conspiracy has got over time with shills etc, this is going to happen, and always seems to happen.  As well people may not understand the concept of when to use the up vote and down vote controls.
