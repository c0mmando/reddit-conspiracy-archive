       Okay r/conspiracy. Heres another one.
      </p>
      <p>
       DISCLAIMER: I present this as a hypothesis. By presenting this idea, I do not admit that I necessarily believe this to he true. It is purely for discussion purposes, and I invite scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, we all know whats going on over there at Fukushima. We also know our DHS and FEMA have been stocking up on a shit ton of stuff, most of which is the envy of the ultimate prepper. Blankets, MREs, water, bullets--the list goes on. As a reddit conspirator, I tend to placate myself in regards to the frustration felt when considering the massive amount of funds being spent on seemingly frivolous assets. I do this by offering myself a variety of possible reasonings for these actions in an attempt to make sense of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Fukushima really is as bad as people say it is, I can see how the threat would cause millions of Japanese to be forced to evacuate to evade further irradiation. But, thats talking about tens of millions of people! Where would they go!?
      </p>
      <p>
       It might be a bit of a stretch, but I have a hunch that maybe the US is eyeing them as prospective immigrants. Imagine the electoral support youd gain by saving an entire country through asylum and granting them citizenship. Just sayin. Its farfetched, i know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, where are they going to go? I present the idea that maybe theyre slated to be housed in America. This could explain the reported "FEMA camps." It could be why FEMA and DHS are actively searching for survival supplies in amounts that in any ordinary situation would be frivolous and pointless. With an influx of tens of millions of people immigrating into america at once, it is not hard to realize that there would be much resentment with the locals here. I dont wanna cry wolf, but in lieu of citing chaos as an inevitability, i will conclude my presentation with the notion of martial law possibly being implemented as a safeguard in such an event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like ive repeatedly stated, this is a bit of a stretch. But, this hypothesis ties together so many variables and offers an explanation, in the form of cause and effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/conspiracy, i ask you of your honest opinions about this hypothesis, and invite you to build upon or dismantle (logically) my conclusions in part or in whole. Thanks.

       The Japanese people aren't the kind to desert their land or culture because of radiation, no matter how bad. The elderly volunteer to clean up around Fukushima because they know it's bad and they don't want younger people to be exposed to radiation. The culture still exists of dying with dignity and honor is a huge part. There was a little kid that ran out of a convenience store with a candy bar because he was scared during the earthquake and returned a few days later to pay for it. They would go down with the ship with their heads held high. So I don't think there will be any sort of mass exodus.

       I don't think either one of those peoples are willing to swallow that much resentment, they have practically almost went to war the past few years over a tiny damn Island. Good idea though, its the most logical place I would imagine.

       Interesting concept. I doubt Japan would choose the U.S. out of all the other countries, though. I think the events are just happening simultaneously. I was also scared about the DHS purchasing all that stuff, but what if they're doing it for our safety? Lots of things to consider here.

       In all honesty these events probably are just simultaneous. But, to entertain my hypothesis, ill consider your comment about japans destination. What if they couldnt choose? I mean, if the US is the only country that will allow them in, or even be able to, they would have no other choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       In either case, the governments accruing of these assets probably are "for our protection", that is, not to be used against us necessarily. I see it more plausible for it to be a means to keep the peace in such an immigration event, given the argument that the US is the only option for them.

       What circumstances would make the US the only country capable of harboring the immigrants? And are we really capable of housing 10 million new people? Even with supposed FEMA camps that have yet to be confirmed?

       Those are good questions. And, simply put, i dont know the answers. itd be tough to nearly impossible for ANY country to house that many immigrants at once. Just look at the syria crisis, where just a few million refugees are a huge burden on several countries. What other country would be able to house that many?
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as americas abilities, im skeptical at best that we can house that many. Maybe several countries would be needed to work cooperatively.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only other country i think could have the ability to house that many is russia. Its unclear to me about how they would react to such an event.

       Well, they do have a lot of open land still (not sure how suitable it is for 10 million people but yeah) and with China's large population, it would be a smaller dent and less chaotic, especially with the clash of culture between Japan and America. China and Japan seem more aligned, plus they're right fucking there. It'd be a shame to see any nearby countries say no for purely political reasons.

       Are you completely ignorant of Sino-Nippon history? Asking China to harbor Japanese refugees would be like asking you to harbor your neighbor, who's grandfather held captive, raped, and murdered your grandmother.

       Not a fan of the high-horse intro, but thanks for the info below. Are they still pissed at them for that? That's like African-Americans still being mad at white people for the slavery their ancestors committed.

       Sorry, but to be honest i am quite ignorant of their history. I know next to nothing about Sino-Nippan history. I dont even know that term. Please, educate me on its significance to this hypothetical situation.

       That article should explain everything. The Japanese committed some seriously heinous war crimes against the Chinese after they invaded. It's something that isn't easily forgotten. I'm pretty sure China would rather see the Japanese burn up into irradiated crisis instead of offering them refuge.

       Hmm. Interesting, but then They would have to admit to the FEMA camps, which is something they don't want to do.

       Entertaining my hypothesis, i would say they wouldnt admit it until they had to. There would be a huge political backlash if it became public that the US is preparing to house tens of millions of immigrants. I mean, just consider the financial burden that would place on our already crippled economy. Thats a lot of tax money that the tax payers would get upset about.
      </p>
      <p>
       That could be why they wouldnt admit to the FEMA camps.

       Again, im just discussing possibilities here. I dont necessarily believe this to be true. Im just speculating.

       Not happening. The Japanese elite will make arrangements, and everyone else there will be left to fend for themselves. The US will not take millions in and the west coast will (does) have its own problems with radiation.

       I think you were on the right track until the immigration part. I was thinking something along the lines of the radiation spreads to the Pacific and ends up "irradiating" the west coast. This gives the DHS and FEMA a reason to round up people and place them in camps.
