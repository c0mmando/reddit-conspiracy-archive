        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>H.R. 3210 Bill “Pay Our Military Act” was passed on 30 Sep 13 however there
is no Treasury Warrant to allow payments.  Below is the current message on
the DFAS website <a href="http://www.dfas.mil/pressroom/govtshutdown.html">http://www.dfas.mil/pressroom/govtshutdown.html</a></p>

<p>During the government shutdown, the Department of Defense will have no legal
authority to pay any personnel - military or civilian - for the days during
which the government is shut down.  The shutdown will not affect payments to
retirees and annuitants as those funds come from a retirement trust fund.
Below is the effect the government shutdown will have on active duty
military, civilian personnel, retirees and annuitants, and DoD contractors. </p>

<p>Attention:  We are aware the President has signed the &quot;Pay Our Military
Act.&quot; We are awaiting further guidance from the Department of Defense to
ensure we accurately implement all elements of the Act.  We will update you
with additional information as soon as possible.  Thanks for your patience.</p>

<p>Military: Active, Reserve, and National Guard members will be paid on time
for pay entitlements earned September 30 or earlier.  Military members
cannot be paid for duty performed after the expiration of the current CRA on
September 30.  Once another CRA or an appropriations act is signed into law,
normal disbursement of military pay will resume. </p>

<p>Civilians: All civilian employees will be paid on their normal pay date for
all entitlements earned through September 30.  After September 30, the
following rules apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>   Excepted employees who perform duty during the shutdown will be
entitled to retroactive payments once another CRA or an appropriations act
is signed into law.</li>
<li>   For furloughed employees, Congress will have to provide authority
for retroactive payments to be made.</li>
<li>   Employees whose organizations have available resources such as
Defense Working Capital Fund, will be paid as normal until such time as cash
reserves are exhausted.</li>
<li>   NonAppropriated Fund (NAF) civilian employees:  Your pay will be
processed and paid as normal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Retirees: Military retirees and annuitants are not paid from Continuing
Resolution Act (CRA) appropriations, so those payments will continue as</p>

<h2>scheduled.</h2>

<p>This is regarding the email that was sent out on 03 October 2013 concerning
the military payments and allowances not actually being paid to the members.
Lt Col John Ayres from AFAFO (see email attached) informed us that although
there is a bill that passed (see attached) to pay military personnel, the
Treasury warrant has not been received. The Treasury Warrant is needed in
order for DFAS to actually release the funds and pay the members.  At
present time, there is no clear date as to when or how long this Treasury
Warrant will take to produce and be send to DFAS for the disbursement of
funds. Developing the Treasury warrant is all another process that is being
handle by other agencies. </p>

<p>Possible impact(s) when payments are not made:</p>

<p>• Re-enlistment Bonuses (Initial and Annual)</p>

<pre><code>o  Impact: Financial hardship for the member
</code></pre>

<p>• PCS Advance Payments</p>

<pre><code>o  Impact: Out of pocket expenses, can create a personal debt, and
</code></pre>

<p>financial hardship for the member</p>

<p>•        Security Deposits</p>

<pre><code>o  Impact: Member may not secure adequate housing in the local
</code></pre>

<p>community. Prolonging the search for housing and staying longer at TLA
facility</p>

<pre><code>    §  Note: Member can pay security deposit out of pocket (if
</code></pre>

<p>member has the means). However, if seeking for an advance after the
shutdown, there is no guarantee that the government will pay/loan the member
the exact amount the member paid because of exchange rate differences. </p>

<p>•        OHA Advances</p>

<pre><code>o  Impact: Member may not secure adequate housing in the local
</code></pre>

<p>community. Prolonging the search for housing and staying longer at TLA
facility</p>

<pre><code>    §  Note: Member can pay security deposit out of pocket (if

<p>member has the means). However, if seeking for an advance after the
shutdown, there is no guarantee that the government will pay/loan the member
the exact amount the member paid because of exchange rate differences. </p>

<p>•        TLA Payments, and such</p>

<pre><code>o  Impact: Member will not be able to pay GTC card, exhausting
</code></pre>

<p>credit limit, and other moving related expenses</p>

<p>•        Separation Payments (Final)</p>

<pre><code>o  Impact: Separated member’s will not receive final pay and
</code></pre>

<p>can/will create financial hardship</p>

<p>At the present time, there is no word as to when funds can or will be
disburse. We will send out updates as soon as we receive them.  Thank you.</p>

<p>If the employee is: furloughed or in a fund such as &quot;Defense Working Capital Fund&quot; or a NonAppropriated Fund or retired then they will still get paid apparently. So long as they keep enough army employed to assert compliance power locally they see it as no genuine problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t think it would be that simple. In reality it means that some service members will be forced into debt, because they will not have money for their normal monthly payments. An entire new struggle for military members and their families is upon us. I hope that this doesn&#39;t last more than a few weeks, because if it does. I feel we may see a revolt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell you <em>hope</em> it doesn&#39;t last more than a few weeks because if it does you feel there may be a revolt?  Let me tell you, man:  A revolt - especially a <em>military</em> revolt - would NOT be a bad thing at this point.  Not the way this country is at this point.  Hell I was thinking this current situation might be the very thing the country really needs in order to finally make the military side with the PEOPLE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Although the military is awake. Not so much the new guy, but the crowd that has been in for at least one enlistment or more. Hell, today I was in line to get a package from the post office on base. I was with my wife and I was talking with her about this and other current events. When a grey haired gentleman whom I assumed was an officer, although I cannot be sure because he was in civilian attire. Had overheard our conversation and turned around and said &quot; it&#39;s about damn time we took our country back&quot;. We chatted a bit more and turns out the lack of pay didn&#39;t bother him so much, it was the threat against the second amendment he believed would be the turning point. So in conclusion, I believe we have the desire to revolt. But everyone has a different trigger. Revolution is necessary. Yet only time will tell. The information I posted was sent out via email by the base commander. I just removed the contact information. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Compared to the average citizen, I would say yes.  It&#39;s because many in the armed forces have seen first hand the chicanery, lies, and deceit of TPTB.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Agreed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I would not disagree with this gentleman.</p>

<p>I think we&#39;re getting REEEAALLY close to that moment where we&#39;re going to be needing to act and act soon because if we don&#39;t, it might be too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly do not know exactly. Military, work resumes as normal just without pay. And yes if bills cannot be paid due to no pay then the banks are offering 0% interest loans to keep service members afloat until the shutdown is over. If it ends... As far as civilians contractors go, most have been furloughed to the best of my knowledge. At least where I am at. The housing contractor was just brought back from furlough today in light of this new information in order to contact the hundreds of landlords service members are renting from. To inform them that they may not receive rent payments. The govt. has until the 17th of this month to come out of the shutdown before they will default on their debts. </p>

If we go one month with out pay, we will not be able to pay our rent. Not to mention the people who have a car payment on top of their rent. Insurance and food. Also their is no base housing here. Only dorms for single airman. It&#39;s incredible to me that they cannot pay their employees but that can continue to fly 16&#39;s all day long. Hard times ahead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This article you mention was posted on the 6th of October. I received this information via email from the base commander on October 7th. I simply removed the contact information, while maintaining the integrity of the message. The military, active duty, reserves and national guard will not be paid on a timely basis. Because there is no warrant from the treasury to authorize said payments. However if the military member cannot make their payments for their rent or their vehicle or any other payments they are legally bound to uphold. Military banks such as USAA are offering a 0% interest loan. However one must still call and apply for said loan/ pay check advance. They will not be paying people, but if you cannot survive without putting your self into unnecessary debt you can apply for the loan. Seems to me that this in itself will cause some unforeseen problems to occur. Every military member applying for a loan is sure to cause some technical issues. Keep in mind too that if the shutdown is still active after the 17th of October the US will default on it&#39;s debt, devaluing the currency more than it is already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not how it works-- the Republican House caucus has refused to pass a budget unless and until their demands regarding the ACA are met. So even if the entire NSA ceased to exist, the situation would be exactly the same. And regardless, the bulk of the government&#39;s spending is on social security, medicare, and the military, domestic surveillance is significantly cheaper (don&#39;t need an F-35 to read an email).</p>
