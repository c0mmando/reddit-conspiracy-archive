    <div class="md"><p>Yes. But it&#39;s not that simple. All of the programs we should be worried about are still fully funded and operational. No one&#39;s pulling money from the spying agencies, from the war machine, or from the controlling factions of government.</p>

<p>Right now, the shutdown is mostly cosmetic and designed to &quot;look bad,&quot; but not to &quot;be effective.&quot; </p>

<p>I think if they just pulled the plug on everything, that would be amazing. Wonderful. Chaotic at first, but we would figure it out in better ways than ever, instead of sucking on the government teat while cowering in fear of the head.</p>

<p>As another poster on here said, if you&#39;re a &quot;non-essential&quot; employee, you shouldn&#39;t be on the payroll anyway. Find something better to do with your time, somewhere that you ARE actually essential.</p>

<p>And for the issues with SNAP and WIC and other assistance programs, you know what this is? This is an opportunity for community to come together and prove that connection - rather than division and mistrust - solves the problem. That you don&#39;t need pittances from the government coffers to live your life. That money is nothing compared to community connection and compassion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless there is something going on in the parks they don&#39;t want you to know about. They could also be using the furlough as a rehearsal for their escape plan which is forthcoming. As you see in middle eastern countries, sometimes the people need someone to blame. Those who feel the most guilt assume they will be the first to be blamed, which is actually the wrong assumption, but I digress; those who feel the most blame are planning their escape plan now, because if their next bailout plan doesn&#39;t work they will have no choice but to leave before the structure of their hierarchy crumbles spontaneously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is they want you to feel lik ewe need them. Which is why Obama is making life very difficult for people by shutting down all these parks. Most tof the memorials that we&#39;re closed we&#39;re done by his doing, not by the shut down. He chose to do so in making it look like we need them. Truth is, we don&#39;t. It&#39;s all a sham to get us to hate the shut down and the GOP. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are only blocking all the parks and memorials to try and convince you that the government has to be HUGE and when the government is smaller, everything SUCKS.</p>

<p>I think the best way forward from here is to hand over control of the country directly to corporations with no middle man &#39;Government&#39; to get in the way. The service industry in USA is second to none, and companies actually aim to please their customers, unlike the Government who apparently just like to make things more difficult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. They have blocked off everything and if &#39;you are not being protected by officers at all times you are not safe to be in the parks/monuments&#39;. They are basically putting that forward. Your life will suck if we are not around to protect you. You can’t do anything on your own philosophy.</p>

<p>I could care less about these war monuments, and 15 monuments to the police in my town. But to close it off to the people who do care, because there is no one there to watch them pay respects, is like a mother who takes her baby to the toilet and watches it poop for the first time with great concern the baby might fall into it.</p>

<p>Last event I was at was a small little amusement park fair they had in a huge open park during the summer. It was very small. Maybe 20 vendors/rides. There were 3 cop cars and a group of cops standing there watching everyone. I got hives. Walked around and left. I don’t go to any events. I don’t want to be watched by the ‘protectors’. I don’t need a mother. I have a mother already. </p>
