       Sure, I feel bad for those who don't get paid, well some. Plus, no wants the parks and memorials closed.  Eventually though, the cops will stop blocking entry, and soon memorials will open and operated by interest groups whom have investment in the memorials and parks. If anything, the longer it continues, tthe people will realize the government doesn't have to be so big.

       I think that they are trying to start some sort of emergency, which will require them to evoke emergency powers and roll around in their tanks and shoot people and take their guns from those "terrorists" who resist the will of their betters in the government.

       I wish they shut down the NSA, FBI, CIA, HLS, DEA, FDA, DOE, FCC..
actually I would only like to keep our department of defense and military, NASA, the VA, and the USFS.

       Yeah, just imagine how much money would be saved, if they'd shut down all the domestic surveillance operation. And stop building two billion dollar data centers, to store their illegally obtained information.

       Yes. But it's not that simple. All of the programs we should be worried about are still fully funded and operational. No one's pulling money from the spying agencies, from the war machine, or from the controlling factions of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, the shutdown is mostly cosmetic and designed to "look bad," but not to "be effective."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if they just pulled the plug on everything, that would be amazing. Wonderful. Chaotic at first, but we would figure it out in better ways than ever, instead of sucking on the government teat while cowering in fear of the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       As another poster on here said, if you're a "non-essential" employee, you shouldn't be on the payroll anyway. Find something better to do with your time, somewhere that you ARE actually essential.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the issues with SNAP and WIC and other assistance programs, you know what this is? This is an opportunity for community to come together and prove that connection - rather than division and mistrust - solves the problem. That you don't need pittances from the government coffers to live your life. That money is nothing compared to community connection and compassion.

       Unless there is something going on in the parks they don't want you to know about. They could also be using the furlough as a rehearsal for their escape plan which is forthcoming. As you see in middle eastern countries, sometimes the people need someone to blame. Those who feel the most guilt assume they will be the first to be blamed, which is actually the wrong assumption, but I digress; those who feel the most blame are planning their escape plan now, because if their next bailout plan doesn't work they will have no choice but to leave before the structure of their hierarchy crumbles spontaneously.

       See I've always looked at this from the other side. If there were some type of 'event' taking place, people in urban areas would be making a b-line for the hills.  With all the parks shut down its a lot easier to contain the populace.

       The problem is they want you to feel lik ewe need them. Which is why Obama is making life very difficult for people by shutting down all these parks. Most tof the memorials that we're closed we're done by his doing, not by the shut down. He chose to do so in making it look like we need them. Truth is, we don't. It's all a sham to get us to hate the shut down and the GOP.

       They are only blocking all the parks and memorials to try and convince you that the government has to be HUGE and when the government is smaller, everything SUCKS.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the best way forward from here is to hand over control of the country directly to corporations with no middle man 'Government' to get in the way. The service industry in USA is second to none, and companies actually aim to please their customers, unlike the Government who apparently just like to make things more difficult.

       I agree with you. They have blocked off everything and if 'you are not being protected by officers at all times you are not safe to be in the parks/monuments'. They are basically putting that forward. Your life will suck if we are not around to protect you. You can’t do anything on your own philosophy.

       I could care less about these war monuments, and 15 monuments to the police in my town. But to close it off to the people who do care, because there is no one there to watch them pay respects, is like a mother who takes her baby to the toilet and watches it poop for the first time with great concern the baby might fall into it.

       Last event I was at was a small little amusement park fair they had in a huge open park during the summer. It was very small. Maybe 20 vendors/rides. There were 3 cop cars and a group of cops standing there watching everyone. I got hives. Walked around and left. I don’t go to any events. I don’t want to be watched by the ‘protectors’. I don’t need a mother. I have a mother already.

       To your statment of not needing protection I agree. I am tired of people telling me by use of laws or enforcers what I can and can not peacefully do something. America and by default Americans have become a nation of bitches whining to their mother for protection.  I would rather die by the sword than give up my rights to protect myself from it.

       Could not resist to send you this. Retarded? Not as much as the future generations will be.
