        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Reading the news here, the real news not the media, I keep seeing things heat up to the point where it looks like we&#39;re days from the situation inside the united states going hot. Then things cool down and news gets slow for a week or so and they begin to heat back up and always pause short of what should be complete public outrage and the cycle repeats. But every time it seems that we are getting closer and closer to that flashpoint where things will get messy. Yet it never seems to happen. What&#39;s preventing it? the shutdown hurts everyone and drives the public unrest to near breaking point but soon it will be over, an agreement will be reached and those in power will make themselves out to be heros for solving the shutdown &quot;crisis&quot;.  </p>

<p>But when will people stop being walked all over? I know for 75% of america, maybe more, it would take not being able to eat before they take to the streets and demand a stop to this childish circus of a government we have. Sometimes it looks like they&#39;re baking on a public outlash and sometimes they appear clueless to what the public is actually thinking. But realistically when do you think it will reach the point that no one will be able to deny that there is no turning back? and what do you think the spark will be that lights the powder keg that we are all sitting on?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only problem I see with the snowden leaks is that they are so spread out that it gives the general public time to adjust and become desensitized to what is happening. Most people aren&#39;t as outraged as they were 6 months ago by the snowden leaks about the NSA and then we get fake leaks flooded in to try and discredit the things that matter. Right now, in the heat of the Shutdown and the looming Federal Reserve crash would be the best time for someone to leak information that could cause an uproar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes sense though, so even if he&#39;s taken out then there are backups. the people who want him dead would want to track down those who have duplicate copies first so It&#39;s a smart choice to keep himself alive.
