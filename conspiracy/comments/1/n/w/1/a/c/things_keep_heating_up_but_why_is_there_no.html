       Reading the news here, the real news not the media, I keep seeing things heat up to the point where it looks like we're days from the situation inside the united states going hot. Then things cool down and news gets slow for a week or so and they begin to heat back up and always pause short of what should be complete public outrage and the cycle repeats. But every time it seems that we are getting closer and closer to that flashpoint where things will get messy. Yet it never seems to happen. What's preventing it? the shutdown hurts everyone and drives the public unrest to near breaking point but soon it will be over, an agreement will be reached and those in power will make themselves out to be heros for solving the shutdown "crisis".
      </p>

       But when will people stop being walked all over? I know for 75% of america, maybe more, it would take not being able to eat before they take to the streets and demand a stop to this childish circus of a government we have. Sometimes it looks like they're baking on a public outlash and sometimes they appear clueless to what the public is actually thinking. But realistically when do you think it will reach the point that no one will be able to deny that there is no turning back? and what do you think the spark will be that lights the powder keg that we are all sitting on?

       The only problem I see with the snowden leaks is that they are so spread out that it gives the general public time to adjust and become desensitized to what is happening. Most people aren't as outraged as they were 6 months ago by the snowden leaks about the NSA and then we get fake leaks flooded in to try and discredit the things that matter. Right now, in the heat of the Shutdown and the looming Federal Reserve crash would be the best time for someone to leak information that could cause an uproar.

       You know he released the leaks to a few people. They are just to scared to let it all out. It's beyond anything you would think. It's beautiful and dangerous.

       It makes sense though, so even if he's taken out then there are backups. the people who want him dead would want to track down those who have duplicate copies first so It's a smart choice to keep himself alive. He's the true american hero, the one who one day in the future will either be remembered as the martyr that liberated us or demonized as the one who threw the America that people remembered and romanticized off it's axis depending on who is victorious when the smoke clears

       Not that I'm afraid of the word Revolution, but realistically it's hard to imagine everyone being able to cooperate toward a revolution given our polar opposites at the moment. I imagine utter chaos at first, being the flashpoint then hopefully a revolution comes of that

       [Edit: Assuming that "the system" means the current government] Possibly smaller independent nations that could allow for a direct democracy, and for damn sure no political parties. I know I'm not qualified to set up a new system but you don't have to know how to fix something to see that it's broken. I would not be someone who would want to be in charge of building the whole system, but I would like a say in approving it.

       If you where already in control, having the arsenal that you'd have now -including technological, scientific, and financial- would you give it up to some nobodies without first wreaking havoc?

       The only successful revolution I see is a US military coup against the Executive, shutting down of Capitol Hill and establishing martial Law until shit can be rebooted.

       So I take it the Finger on trigger crowd are the ones anticipating a shutdown but are in support of a government crackdown because they somehow think it will better their lives in some way?

       They are not expecting a government crackdown so much as a government take over remove Obama from office kind of scenario,
Where they get to rush in and take care of any Obama supporters or something like that.

      <p>
       Their thinking isn't real clear on all this, but they are going to prevail!

       It's kind of disgusting, America was less divided during the Civil War than we are today and I feel like the fact that it has gone on so long like this will make it a messier battle in the long run for everyone involved. Hate is being ingrained between Red and Blue that rivals that between the north and south for sure, but one thing that the civil war had that we don't today was at least some level of respect. I mean there were disagreements and they fought for their sides but there was a code of war that was for the most part followed.

       It is a false division created by/with the fact that they own all the media.

       Own the information, own the nation.  These freaks are in fact a definite minority, but they include most of the Forbes 400 richest Americans.
