        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I would like to first thank <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> and my brethren (sisters too, I just like the word brethren) for giving me an outlet to what I see. Right or wrong, I am glad to get it off my chest.</p>

<p>Does anyone else think Syria was a set up too? I mean this talk of disarming every nation over there is just to coincidental. All of the sudden, everyone wants to play nice. I am not buying it. We&#39;ve been set up...</p>

<p>I flip through MSM(except Fox) and other stations while at the gym, because exercising sucks, I still do it though. I heard quite a bit of rhetoric about &#39;we are in more danger now than 9/11&#39; being spouted off. This really unnerved me. I saw people talking about soft targets, and the potential for attacks here, and made me think, &#39;Great, someone is going to hit a mall so we go to war with Iran.&#39; They couldn&#39;t get us to back invading Syria, so I think they think they need a better persuasive tactic, like another false flag. Boston wasn&#39;t big enough, they want more bodies sacrificed to the god of war. This is blood lust and it is getting out of control. </p>

<p>I have a bad feeling about October 1st and beyond.  Too many things drop on that day to make it not a good day to distract the public from a run away Congress and a war mongering President. The budget and ACA, they are distracting us from the main culprits. They know we have no money, they know ACA has clauses in it that do things the American public will not want. The tea party is sabre rattling to defund it, but for the wrong reasons. </p>

<p>Martial Law signs, FEMA Sec. 3 stock piles, foreign troops on our soil, no leave for the military, spread out so thin that they can&#39;t defend us, militarization of local police, even in an Ohio college, something is coming. I don&#39;t know what. I don&#39;t think it will be a FF nuke, that is too much. </p>

<p>The worse part about it will be, if the sheeple don&#39;t realize that the apparatus that is in place doesn&#39;t work and don&#39;t say so, very loudly, we are going to lose everything. They say they are protecting us, that is bull shit on a stick. They are protecting the land, not the people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sun Tzu, never said war was stupid though. </p>

<p>He believed rightly, that it is a valid option for a Government. As Von Clausewitz put it (to paraphrase) ‘War is simply another means by which a Government can impose or implement it’s policy.’.</p>

<p>War is sad and terrible but it still happens because for the winner it achieves their goals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sheeple. How indignant of you. That terminology means you assume that you are better than most other people. For a group of people who want to reach out to people and spread a message, you are very impersonal. that kind of language is what repels people. Call them unenlightened, call them uninformed, but don&#39;t call them sheep. It makes you sound like an asshole. </p>

<p>I mean absolutely no disrespect, it just the terminology, not the message that pisses me off. I do not believe I am better or smarter than anyone, and someone who wants to help people shouldn&#39;t either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more that people aren&#39;t necessarily seeing the big picture about what&#39;s going on in our country and world right now and instead are preoccupied with things that <em>we</em> would consider not as important, like the iPhone, etc. I don&#39;t think everyone is being a &quot;sheep&quot; because of it, but I believe that it&#39;s just a product of the MSM doing their jobs &quot;correctly&quot; by diverting people&#39;s attention away from the real issues and onto things that keep people out of the loop. Feeding people misinformation, or leading people away from the truth is what the MSM/TPTB want. Keep us in the dark so <em>they</em> can can sneak attack us when we&#39;re not looking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely agree with you-- and I think part of that job they are doing correctly is breeding a sort of &quot;thinking isn&#39;t cool&quot; attitude of willful ignorance.  I work at a community college and I see this attitude being totally rampant... Students who try to share thoughtful ideas or ugly truths are literally snickered at, but make a comment about MSM celeb meme BS and you&#39;re downright celebrated.</p>

<p>I see it as, people will only see the world they are comfortable seeing, and if they are taught to see anything outside the prescribed MSM boundaries as uncomfortable, then they will subconsciously (and consciously) back away from any real insight they might be about to have, or reality-about-the-world they are about to realize.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>really? sleeping through life, unaware of the depths of reality, merely checking off pre-chosen sign posts with little or no real opportunity for any consciousness bending discussion. Materialism is not inherently bad, but without balance it is the worst. But fuckit reality is more beautiful and amazing than we can imagine and were lucky to exist. so there is no real concern, but  being ignorant of the beauty and more so being stressed at living is sad beyond words. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those who in all this time and with all this information haven&#39;t woken up to the reality of the world can without guilt be called morons. They are no more or less worthy than any of us, but they are still complete buffoons. And just like the animal that does not show skillfulness and semblances of adaptation so too will this breed of peoples die out by their own ignorance. </p>

<p>The word might in your mind bring about a particular irritation of the senses, learn to recognize however that this irritation is sole your own. When I hear the word sheeple I simply perceive a people who are entrenched in the status-quo and are blind to all things outside of it. </p>

<p>You might not like it, but people who are awake DO know better than those who are still asleep. Ones decisions become more accurate when you have a more complete knowledge of the problem. Those who are fed their information do NOT have a complete knowledge and therefor will make the wrong  decisions, its as simple as that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello Americans! Posting from Iceland, the most peaceful and friendly country in the world. (Google that shit) OP is very correct, from a foreigner&#39;s point of view (everybody hears about every major thing going on in the U.S.) this is going to be another proxy war. </p>

<p>(this is my first comment ever BTW so sorry if I&#39;m ignorant of some sort of Reddit etiquette ) </p>

<p>It seems obvious to me, that the powers that be in The United States, want to disarm ALL of the middle eastern countries, so that Israel can attack them on the U.S&#39; behalf. In world politics, it seems like your country and Israel are one and the same. What shadow hand is steering your people to war all of the time? The media often spreads the notion that Muslims = Terrorists, this is false, Israel and US forces have been fucking up things in the middle east for decades, and I think THAT is the cause for terrorist attacks, If you look up the things that your country and Israel have been doing for the last decades, You&#39;ll understand. </p>

<p>I&#39;m lucky to live in the most peaceful country in the world, 
And I can&#39;t imagine the lives of civilians in for example Afghanistan, 
That place has been bombed regularly for around 40 years now, Automated Killing machines aka drones patrol the country 24/7 in search for targets. </p>

<p>It is very clear to me that THIS is the cause of Arab hate towards the US. Not the Islamic religion, now many times have you heard &quot;allahu akbar!&quot; in some sort of military setting? </p>

<p>...How many times have you heard American soldiers say they do something for God or The Homeland? </p>

<p>My sincere apologies if I offend, That&#39;s not my intention here, I&#39;ve visited your country and I found the lay of the land very beautiful and the people very nice, but the people that control the actions of your country are cold heartless bastards. </p>

<p>We Icelanders KNOW that violence is not the answer, In this country the law used to be &quot;If someone kills someone close to you, you have the right to kill them&quot;  and CHAOS ensued. </p>

<p>It just makes me sad to think that the most powerful and influential country in the world behaves this way, It will be what causes your downfall in the end...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do not need leave to go &quot;home&quot;. Many soldiers live off base and some live in on base housing with their families. Cancelling leave does not mean lock down.   </p>

<p>Some single soldiers may not be able to travel hundreds of miles to their hometown but if they live in off base housing they can go home to their family.</p>

<p>My father was a soldier for 25 years. Even at the height of the Vietnam war, he took leave. My ex-brother in law was a soldier and he took leave and came home from Iraq. </p>

<p>Who said that? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We shouldn&#39;t take their leave away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m stating that removing their leave is detrimental. It doesn&#39;t mean ALL leave or any real amount. It&#39;s a general statement. Just as you&#39;ve suggested it could be relevant to &quot;any job...&quot;</p>

<p>OP said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Martial Law signs, FEMA Sec. 3 stock piles, foreign troops on our soil, <strong>no leave for the military,</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So direct your question at OP.</p>
