    <div class="md"><p>It is the intersection of a couple of different things that makes Monsanto a target of conspiracy theories.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The anti-war movement.  Monsanto in the 60s was one of the manufactureres of Agent Orange.  So you have lots of protesters and anti-war people from that era mad at them.  It hardly matters if was 50 years ago or they were not the only manufacturer or responsible for how it was used.</p></li>
<li><p>The environmental movement.  Iin the 60s-70s Monsanto was dumping PCBs these chemicals are pretty toxic and are still causing problems. They haven&#39;t been in this line of business since the 80s.</p></li>
<li><p>Organic food industry.  Monsanto is one of many companies that produce GM seeds.  For some people GM crops are either &quot;against gods plan&quot; or &quot;tampering with nature&quot; or &quot;not pure food&quot;.  The scientific consensus is the GM crops are as safe as non-GM crops... but of course people just claim a giant scientific conspiracy (see creationist, anti-vax, 911 truther...)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These three main branches are combined with a general &quot;anti-corporatism&quot; found in conspiracy theory circles which is the reason Monsanto is the source of so many conspiracy theories.</p>

<li><p>Monsanto was a corporation with corrupt practices that border on genocide in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s.</p></li>
<li><p>But all of a sudden, in the 90&#39;s with the advent of transgenic technologies, Monsanto was redeemed for all it&#39;s past sins, recompensated it&#39;s victims, and everyone realized that organic food was the real bastard all along. (Lol, jk)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The issue with our food comes down to the ecological unsustainability of conventional, industrial monocultures and the inability of the resulting monoculture diets to provide the proper micronutirents that humans require.</p>

<p>You sound like a corporate cheerleader. How big is your pension?</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the fact that Monsanto still is killing people with it&#39;s corrupt practices. Whilst holding hands with the lizards in Washington, I might add.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not fabricating anything. I leave that up to the corporation. I&#39;m not trying to make anyone here look like a lunatic, except perhaps myself. I obviously am a lunatic though, so trying is superfluous.</p>

<p>You look like a shill pushing a GM crops agenda. You equate anyone who doubts their safety with creationists and cite the plethora of scientific studies performed over the decades, but neglect to acknowledge the potential for long term effects on our ecosystem and our bodies.</p>

<p>You cite &quot;decades of evidence&quot; while &quot;debunking&quot; the occasional studies that provide evidence contrary to your opinion. You point to the incredible outputs that conventional agriculture can provide, while neglecting to mention that those outputs have enormous costs from fossil fuels, soil loss, pollutants affecting fisheries.</p>

<p>You treat the world as if it is a bunch of isolatable little incidences, things that you can observe, manipulate and replicate at will, when the reality is that everything is connected. Changing the fundamental architecture of the planet&#39;s biomass can have severe consequences when we&#39;re only beginning to scrape together an understanding of the intricacies of plant social networks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It takes an incredible amount of narcissism to imagine that people are paid to argue with you on the internet.  Especially by a company that doesn&#39;t even sell commercial products to the reddit demographic.</p>

<p>Like most people favoring conspiracy theories over reality, you miss the conspiracy right in front of you in favor of one that matches your politics.</p>

<p>The reality is that there are people paid to talk about GM crops and Monsanto on reddit.... but they are the activists, not the people debunking a promoting science.  Just do a search on &#39;GMO&#39; or &#39;Monsanto&#39; and count the threads for and against GM crops.  Look at who is posting these links and where the links lead... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit 3: Don&#39;t get me wrong. I understand how &quot;USDA Organic&quot; is pretty much just a &quot;Name&quot; like &quot;Five Dollar Foot-Long&quot; has nothing to do with how big it is. &quot;Natural&quot; is essentially meaningless. Everything &quot;organic&quot; is still &quot;flavored&quot; by god knows what this time. Consider the phrase &quot;Chinese Organic&quot; and wonder to yourself about the oversight that earned this prized marketing tool. </p>

<p>Anti-GMO Conspiracy Theory is what you&#39;re getting at. Mouthpieces talking. People accepting. Health food is a huge market. I mean, you can&#39;t blame people for wanting to eat better and be healthier for it. And why not make a buck? Or maybe stir up controversy? Both? This sub-reddit gives a lot of lip service to TPTB, so who else is willing to entertain this idea of playing the other side as well? Divide, control divisions and conquered. </p>

<p>Who gains from the organic market? The farmers? The people who can afford it? The people who ship it from all around the world? The commission that grants the &quot;organic&quot; label? The parent company of the parent company of the parent company that owns the businesses producing the numbered product on their spreadsheet? And now consider they&#39;re pretty much all one in the same. I call it, the ANTIGMOPRO.</p>

<p>Granted. The Anti-GMOers provide videos (all produced and edited in a way as to promote an idea, obviously) that seem compelling. There was one about BT Cotton in India. Or the legal practices employed by Monsanto and if I looked into it probably DuPont and since this can&#39;t possibly be only an American venture, other business in other countries all around the world. Does Monsanto have the winning business strategy? Maybe, maybe not. But it&#39;s not personal. It&#39;s just business. If anything goes wrong, they&#39;re not infallible gods. They&#39;re just humans trying to figure out the complexities of life and after reviewing the data collected they will do their best to improve upon their humble offerings next time.</p>

<p>Can I have a job now? ;P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your first part: Hasbara. One example of people paid to argue about things on the internet and manage image control (basically).</p>

<p>Second: I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever said conspiracy in this conversation. We&#39;re talking about a business, its practices, agendas, etc. etc. But first and foremost it is a business and has a legal obligation to make as much money as possible no matter what. Well, no matter what until you get caught and then just wrap the accuser up in court for so long you get away with it. Whatever. Plenty of businesses do that.</p>

<p>Third... paragraph?: You&#39;re really trying to convince me that activists are paid to slander and libel Monsanto? As far as doing your research, I took the challenge: MSM and hired guns (sorry, &quot;independent reporters and experts&quot;) write about how wonderful GMOs are and how safe they are. Literally everyone else in the world is writing against GMO and Monsanto practices. Without giving you any of my background information, I understand how a &quot;campaign&quot; works. PR, excuse me.</p>

<p>EDIT: And yes, Monsanto does target the Reddit demographic or you wouldn&#39;t be here. Also, GMO related products (corn, cotton, soy, etc.) are marketed at us as well as lawn care items. Or do you guys not sell RoundUP at Walmart anymore?</p>

<p>Double Edit: Explain your quote:</p>

<p>&quot;Generally people spamming anti-GMO propaganda can be traced back to companies/organizations who has something to gain, usually something to do with organic food (a HUGE industry).&quot; </p>

<p>In this conversation you ridicule the idea of such a person even existing. </p>

<p>There are in fact several spammers on reddit working for groups that oppose GMOs.  It is documented and the admin know about it.  </p>

<p>An Ag company like Monsanto wouldn&#39;t pay people to argue on the internet because they don&#39;t see a commercial product to this demographic and they already have the science on their side.</p>

<p>It is the anti-GMO activists who hire people to spam reddit because it is their demographic and the need the popular support for their position because they don&#39;t have the science on their side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. So you admit that there are people paid to argue with me. Fantastic.</p>

<p>Obviously those people paid are all ganging up on poooor oooold Monsanto. Is that what you&#39;re saying? But wait... wouldn&#39;t Monsanto, who&#39;s science is privately held so good luck looking at it, not want us on their side because if the opposition gains support couldn&#39;t that bite into profits? You&#39;re just confusing yourself trying to confuse me at this point... i think...</p>

<p>No, I said there are known cases of paid anti-GMO activists spamming on reddit.</p>

<p>Actually they are interested in spreading misinformation about GMOs in general.  It so happens that they find a convenient boogyman in Monsanto.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look. I don&#39;t care which direction they&#39;re paid to &quot;spam&quot; in, you admit that it happens. Also you ignored other points but apparently you don&#39;t want to talk about those in such a controlled conversation where you pick and choose what&#39;s being discussed.</p>

<p>So you always talk about &quot;real facts&quot;. Please give me some &quot;real facts&quot; from an un-compromised, unbiased source. You know, the kinds where no one has ever been paid or works/worked for the industry or works for someone paid by the industry. Or whatever criterion you would hold the opposition to. We both know scientists are paid, frequently, to have one stance or another. We both know that &quot;journals&quot; have been compromised. We both know that you can pay someone to say pretty much anything. Hell, you&#39;ve even admitted it ;)</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m entertained. The only thing you&#39;re accomplishing is tarnishing Monsanto&#39;s name even further for people who will go and buy other products IF available. Granted... maybe you work for the anti-gmo conspiracy theorists.... dun dun duuuuuuun. And for something called my saint, it should be hard to tarnish. Buuuuut it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, what in God&#39;s name do activists hope to gain from slandering Monsanto? Are the &quot;activists&quot; the people profiting off of the &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;organic&quot; markets?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am interested in debunking false claims.  It happens that because you are sensitive about GMOs you see this as a personal attack, it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Concerning your question.  Even the European science bodies have stated clearly that GMOs are as safe as non-GMOs.  The reason they are banned in Europe has to do with politics and trade protectionism.  You could ask the same thing about gays, marijuana, women driving cars....</p>

<p>A secondary issue might be that Europe in general has more anti-science attitudes than the US.  This might be ironically related to the lower levels of religious belief; people don&#39;t suddenly become hyper-rational when they lose religion but instead tend to latch on to pseudoscience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if genetically modifying a strawberry to have an amino acid that humans need (fish protein) saves millions of lives? Enhances millions of lives? I used to be anti-monsanto because there was this rumor that said Monsanto had created a crop with a suicide gene termed the killer gene. Ever since that was rectified, the only complaint I had was the use of the round-up. but they are not the only ones. as for the mixing of genes, they get denatured in the stomach. you can eat fish for dinner and strawberry tart for desert, same thing. you are ingesting other biological and extracting resources to be used by your own body. we have to produce high yields of food to feed parts of the world not able to forage or practice agriculture.</p>

<p>people get so attached to their ideas that they can&#39;t see any other side. its the same phenomena that causes wars. So sure that their viewpoint is complete. No one&#39;s is. </p>
