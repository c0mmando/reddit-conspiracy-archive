    <div class="md"><p>How did that change your mind?  I think this warrants some skepticism. Why was she hundreds of miles away from home? without any coworkers knowing. Why was she trying to get near the White House?  Where was she going?  Who was this girl?  I just want to hear some more before completely dismissing it.  I had initially, but it&#39;s weird. 
The cops also lied about her ramming a police car. There&#39;s a video proving the cop crashed into barriers speeding through a busy street.  </p>

<p>In the video I watched, why did she run and then continue to run with a police car chasing her?</p>

<p>I&#39;m only using the information I know. </p>

<p>If the police are waving guns in my face and they tell me to do something then I&#39;m going to comply. Not because I trust them but because I really have no other option unless I can pull a miracle off and get away with somehow not facing any repercussions later. </p>

<li><p>I fully understand police over aggression and brutality. But this is again <strong>in front of the White House</strong>, if you are surrounded by police with their guns drawn you have to know that fleeing will mean they will fire on you.

</ol>

<p>Seriously I am saying this for your own protection. If you are ever surrounded by police with their guns drawn (especially in front of the White House) <strong>don&#39;t flee</strong> or else I am almost positive they will fire upon you. Just looking out for you.</p>

<p>This happened Monday, nowhere near the White House. Almost identical circumstances, same result. </p>

<p>Here is another: <a href="http://mdjonline.com/view/full_story/20972339/article-Cobb-man-shot--killed-by-police-in-Dunwoody">http://mdjonline.com/view/full_story/20972339/article-Cobb-man-shot--killed-by-police-in-Dunwoody</a></p>

<p>This was a friend of mine. Similar circumstances, same result. </p>

<p>The cops see a vehicle as a weapon, and they will judge and execute you on the side of the road because you are &quot;holding a weapon&quot;. It doesn&#39;t matter where, no cop will ever disable a vehicle, they will always kill the driver instead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between disobedience and <a href="http://twitpic.com/dfxeqo">this</a>. What possible explanation could one have for engaging with people who have guns drawn on you in this way? There comes a point where you either need to give up or expect to be fired on, and regardless of anything else, around 3 seconds into this video is clearly that point. </p>

<p>Maybe one day we wont live in a police state, but I still guarantee you as long as there is a President living in the White House, they will be somewhat guarded and you still wont be able to do what we see in this video and not expect to be shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw the video already. There was no footage of the events leading up to guns being drawn on the victim of this event. I&#39;m not one to say whether she was threatening or not to officers. I can only say that violence begets violence.</p>

<p>Hell, even when there isn&#39;t a President in the Whitehouse, (L.B.J. post J.F.K.&#39;s assassination, Dick Cheney while G.W. B. was reading to children while 9/11 happened) we still live in a police state.</p>

<p>Should we have to live in fear? No! Do we? Of course! Perhaps this woman was just following her biological flight or fight response to the high stress environment of having guns pointed at her. Did she make a mistake? Unless she was committing suicide by cop, she undoubtedly made a few mistakes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fucked up. S&#39;all I&#39;m saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if there was no provocation, and you have no idea why a group of cops is surrounding you with guns drawn, it is still suicidal to then flee from them. </p>

<p>Even if you are going to say that speeding away from that group of cops was fight or flight, at some point during the ensuing chase she had to have realized that she was running from the cops and that continuing to flee will only end badly. Also, she just barely misses running over one of those cops, she was in fight and flight mode. </p>

<p>And the point I was trying to make is that lets say hypothetically we didn&#39;t live in a police state anymore and there were only 5 cops left. They would be protecting the president and fleeing from them if they have their guns drawn while you are in a 2 ton battering ram should lead you to believe you will be fired upon. </p>

<p>Even if they were the last cops on earth. </p>

<p>Its always fucked up when someone gets shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So... what do? Argue? Submit? Get separated from your child indefinitely, whilst the child is imprisoned in the foster home system and the mother herself is stripped of her rights, her clothes, her dignity, her child, her mental wellbeing. Tortured indefinitely as a possible terror suspect. Shipped to a CIA, NSA, SS or DHS black site? Smeared in the media as a mentally ill, or a fanatic of one kind or another, whatever they could glean and exagerate to sell stories, make money, and keep the public blind to their doing so at the expense of their humanity!!!!</p>

<p>FOORRR NARNNIIAAA!!!!!</p>

<p>Or she coulda been on shrooms. Equally tragic. Or beautiful. However you see it. She&#39;s probably in a better place now. The real victim is the child, and that cop who crashed his own car in pursuit. The latter would happen to be the lauging stock at the station right now... hahah...</p>

<hr/>

<p>Butreallybra... anything couldl&#39;ve been going through her mind at that moment. It was a high-stress situation. It&#39;s inevitably on those cops for pulling the trigger. You could blame their training, or the trainer, or the system that supports it all... </p>

<h2>But it all just boils down to individual responsibilty for one&#39;s own actions.</h2>

<p>Those cops know exactly who killed that woman. They know exactly why she&#39;s dead. Shooting back at the gangsters is fruitless. Running away is fruitless. Joining them is fruitless. Submitting to them is fruitless. Is there no fruit to be had?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say at that point your only hope is to give up. You&#39;ve attempted to break into the most heavily guarded building in the world, and the no nonsense cops/gang protecting it have surrounded you guns drawn. Yes, regardless of why, you very well may have booked your ticket to Guantanamo and kissed your child who&#39;s headed for a lifetime of psychological trauma goodbye. But to flee, in that particular situation she found herself in, is to court death. A death she may very well have been seeking at that point if she did comprehend the alternatives that you and I have laid out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point of my phrase was to say that it clearly wasn&#39;t a simple <em>car accident</em>.  <em>Rammed</em> wasn&#39;t the best word choice, but she did <em>pass</em> one checkpoint that had lowered barricades she was meant to stop at and attempted to <em>pass</em> another but found herself behind raised barricades. In the video on <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/us-capitol-lockdown-reports-gunshots">this site</a> you can clearly see she went from the front of her car being up against the barricades to smashing into the cop car behind her to then fleeing <em>thru</em> the police standing around her with guns draw. </p>

<p>One way or another it is still my contention that when you are surrounded by capitol police with guns drawn, the foreseeable outcome of speeding away while nearly hitting them is that they will fire upon you and/or chase you down until they have stopped you. The means by which they will attempt to do so increasing in severity with your continued evasiveness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Says the vehicle barricade at the treasury building(which is next to the whitehouse) was rammed and a pursuit took place.  Not so sure this classifies as an attack on the whitehouse.  Better title might be, &quot;female driver with child rams into a barricaded at the treasury building.&quot;</p>

<p>Shots is very likely just the police or secret service agents shooting.</p>
