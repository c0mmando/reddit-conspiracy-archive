       This is an alert, we might be seeing a potential cascade of events stacking up on the horizon. Government shutdown leading into a dollar sell off:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://investmentwatchblog.com/urgent-america-is-only-days-away-from-a-dollar-melt-down-by-flash-trades/">
        http://investmentwatchblog.com/urgent-america-is-only-days-away-from-a-dollar-melt-down-by-flash-trades/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that we have 9 different drills/events scheduled to occur in the next 6 weeks. One of the biggest is a power grid shutdown drill. Of course, if the power grid were to actually shut down, that would stop dollar trading or any other financial transactions from occurring.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://networkedblogs.com/PCMIB">
        http://networkedblogs.com/PCMIB
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note there are other drills occurring as well, as well as drills which were
       <em>
        canceled
       </em>
       in late September. They never put so many drills together at once. The above article talks about all the different laws and executive orders which are in place and what a simple emergency event would trigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget about
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ngaqh/my_uncle_works_for_the_dod_not_sure_what_to_think/">
        that post
       </a>
       earlier where someone said his uncle warned him about the next few weeks on the east coast.
      </p>
      <p>
       We already know that if there is indeed another financial problem reminiscent of 2008, there are no tools left to prevent it from spiraling out of control. There are no more massive bailouts left without destroying our dollar because we've been doing QE/printing for the last 5 years. The next logical thing would be martial law or large war to stave off government collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget about that nuke that was transferred from Texas 3 weeks ago either. At the time we didn't know if the story on infowars was true or not, but we've come to learn that two very significant things happened on September 3rd,
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       <a href="http://www.infowars.com/exclusive-high-level-source-confirms-secret-us-nuclear-warhead-transfer-to-east-coast/">
        Jones' story
       </a>
       was published, which make it seem likely. First, Lindsey Graham made
       <a href="http://charlotte.cbslocal.com/2013/09/03/graham-nukes-in-hands-of-terrorists-could-result-in-bomb-coming-to-charleston-harbor/">
        bizzare comments
       </a>
       about a nuke hitting Charleston. (Jones' had said it was shipped to SC). Second,
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2436621/Second-command-countrys-nuclear-arsenal-suspended-investigated-GAMBLING.html">
        we found out this week
       </a>
       that the second in command of our nuclear arsenal was relieved of duty on September 3rd for gambling problems (makes no sense). So something happened on September 3rd.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know there was supposed to be a war with Syria but it didn't happen. So there might be a plan B that's necessary, it might happen in October/November. Remember, the economic/financial situation is the driver for the timetable of these other events. That's why you have to always watch the financial stuff first and foremost. The wars and drills are reactions to those timetables.

       They are not actually powering down the grid. But they are deploying EVERY domestic armed force we have. GridEx II will look exactly like a martial law dress rehearsal.

       There is a disturbing pattern of drills/attacks at the same time. Hopefully this isn't one of them.

       Dude, read the PDF guidelines listed in the NERC pamphlet. It is an exercise with simulated "war game" type simulations. Roughly about 30-40 key players will sit in a conference room and strategize on solutions. Dont go getting all amped up.

       I read it. There will be "real-time" elements mixed in with the virtual "war game" simulation. The last GridEx drill was a scaled down version. This one will be much bigger.

       The money situation is far more dire than they'd have us believe; the war was supposed to provide cover for martial law when the easing stops and the harding begins. Now it will have to be the naked police state sans velvet glove, and that's what's causing all the murmuring down at the CFR.

       The dollar and market is going to tank when they stop Quantitative Easing. Bernanke has made 2 announcements thus far regarding the possibility of lowering the buy-back program in order to test the market's reaction. It's not good. Other countries are making agreements in order to trade in other currencies, thereby breaking the petrodollar, and removing the dollar as the world's currency. When these all take place, the government will go into default and austerity measures far greater than sequestration and shut-downs will automatically go into effect. All key government personnel will be fired, programs will cease, pensions will be lost and taxes withheld. Half of the country will become hungry, the other, angry.
      </p>

       A war with Syria would be a proxy war through Israel, with terrorist attacks on US soil leading to martial law. With the war now on ice, there is no psuedo reason to roll out FEMA camps, militarized police, and DHS assets. The government has failed to present a narrative of how the police state is only there to help and protect us. The people will know why they are there, and the CFR would prefer to go through with their plans without the possibility of a fight. Or I'm totally wrong ;p

       Like I said, at the time the infowars was very questionable on it's own, but two other events that happened later that day (after the story was published) help bolster it.

       I agree those two events are strange and coincidental in timing, but I think they do little to credit the Infowars story. I know it is frustrating, but it so far is only the word of one unnamed person, by a notably extreme site. Such things still impact my assessment of this month's culminating tension, but carefully weighted with speculation.

       Well, there seem to be two parts to OP's post. The first one talks about how the dollar is going to be fucked in the next few days and the other talks about the nuclear weapon that was mentioned in Jones' story and some other stories which could possibly connect to that one. The first part is highly unlikely and the second one is based on the story from Infowars, a conspiracy site that isn't highly reliable, especially when it comes to stories like this.

       It's not so much about who benefits from what as it is about timing. Information, pubic opinion, financial markets, consumption, budgets, all of these things are fluid. In order to stay on top of things, it is critical that certain things happen at the right time, just like when a computer or car engine runs for example, the sequential order of events must be maintained because there are prerequisites that must happen before something else can happen later.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's not so much about who is benefiting as it is whether things are happening as intended such that control is maintained. Otherwise there is chaos and no one is in control (anarchy).
      </p>
      <p>
       One key thing coming up is the dollar losing it's value. If that happens, our all-powerful federal government becomes bankrupt, they won't be able to afford to pay their military/DHS/NSA/FEMA/IRS, etc. So this martial law/war/FF isn't really about benefiting as it is not losing everything. It's a consolidation, the next necessary step. The main question they have to answer is if now is the right time for it. Are they strong enough to pull it off, is now the best probability of success or should they wait for more things to fall into place? Can they afford to wait?

       I like your speculation. I just want to touch on one thing. The Fed is doing everything in its power to keep the dollar weak, and other countries are doing the same. It is called a currency war. It makes our exports more attractive and imports more expensive, it is seen as a good thing by most economists.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I think you meant to say is the USD losing its reserve currency status in the world. That's the real problem because then these massive deficits that we are running actually start to matter, like it would for a company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as our financial duress increases, we may get a further credit downgrade. This teamed with the fact that the Fed is losing control of interest rates and is the only real buyer of treasuries can cause real big problems as our cost to service our debt starts to compound and printing becomes limited.

       I 100% agree that it's all about timing.  Given that they have tried unsuccessfully to justify attacking Iran, North Korea, and now Syria, it seems they need a dance partner.  If they allow the economy to crash or stage a terror event even larger than 9/11, they will have a reason to have military roaming the streets of the US.  I'm sure I'll see it in my lifetime, and probably a lot sooner than I'm ready for.

       See I don't buy this "unsuccessfully" part about Syria and Iran. What did the people do that they didn't do before Iraq? Remember, there's even a wikipedia about the largest protest the world has ever seen before Iraq - and they went anyway. They have never cared what the people want or say - so why the fuck would they now?

       Agreed. This is what I keep telling everyone. Some peeps around me are freaking out about the coming days but I just tell them that I really really sincerely don't think anything's going to happen. There's just so much more that can be done. Obamacare alone will break the populace - once that happens I really think THAT would be the opportune time to swoop in. Think about it - if people are broke they can't afford guns - that in itself, is a form of round-about gun control.

       impossible to control bitcoin unless you are able to pull off a 51% attack in which you control a majority of the hashing network. Not very likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Silk Road being shut down will have little impact on Bitcoin. If anything, it's going to legitimize it, because now they can't claim "Used mostly to buy illicit drugs online" whenever Bitcoin is mentioned in the news.
      </p>

       Anyway, SR seizure wasn't really about Bitcoin, it was about drugs.

       51%? If hedge funds and big banks get involved... couldn't they accomplish that?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about drugs and legitimizing bitcoin and controlling the internet. They could be going after a lot more dealers and users than they are right now. They probably don't want to draw any more attention to the "war on drugs" than they have to.
      </p>
      <p>
       With bitcoin's reputation polished... "respectable" organizations can start getting involved. Some day, it could even replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't a decentralized network of hedge funds and banks that effectively control the bitcoin market even more terrifying than the federal reserve? At that point, wouldn't it be the bitcoin market running the show?

       The hedge funds as I understand them just provide a means of buying Bitcoin, investing in them. They won't be doing mining.

       Someone in
       <a href="/r/Bitcoin">
        /r/Bitcoin

       could better explain how likely a 51% attack is. But basically it means you are 51% of the mining, which is quite a large scale.

I don't know what the cause is but I read about Fukushima everyday and this link and another was posted in a forum. If you use Google you can't find anything about it

       That's not the point of these threads. That's like saying that riding a bike without a helmet is pointless because you never hit your head in the past. The key thing is awareness of what could happen.

       Was I expecting anything to happen within the next couple days when I posted this thread? I though there was a relatively high likelihood, which to me is like a 1% or 2% chance. Will something happen in October? That's maybe a 4% chance. Those are probably similar numbers to getting in an accident on a given night or falling off your bike. You still wear a seat belt and bike helmet.

       Furthermore, if it's icy outside you may get alerted to the bad weather and take extra precautions. That's what this OP and similar ones like it are about. Why would you not want to be aware of possibilities?

       Everyone one this sub should read up on economics instead of spouting ignorant gold gold gold theories. Way too many people confuse the terms deficit and debt and do not understand what caused the financial crisis. I suggest everyone here researches the difference between monetizing debt and quantitative easing. The Feds policy is intended to decrease short and long term interest rates in order to drive demand. We are actually at greater risk of deflation right now than inflation.

       The dollar will remain the world currency for the foreseeable future. The currency most likely to over come the dollar in the next century is the Brazilian real. No Asian, European or African currency will ever be the world currency.

       let's understand a couple basic things here: when the dollar is "sold off" that means more QE =printing of money=value of dollar is going down, when that is happening the stock market is going UP and gold is going DOWN. When the stock market crashed in 08 the world runs to the dollar for saftey
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at how the dollar responded when the shtf
       <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/04/dollars-biggest-decline-2001-08/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now go back and compare that in time against the SP500  after a period of time the dollar fell even further as the market  came back up

       If you need a weapon just buy a handgun, it's much better to protect yourself because it can be concealed. Save the money for a car, being able to move around is actually a very important survival factor. If anything happens it will be a process that takes months, you need a way to be able to move around and make money more than anything, to be able to move to where the opportunities are and away from bad areas.

       My family has multiple cars. I just feel that the assault rifle is the best tool to have in a shoot out situation. As for money, by the looks of it the economy will be destroyed and money won't really mean much to anyone...

       Only 3% of money is cash. Digital money will be destroyed. Look at Cyprus, banks just closed one day and people couldn't withdraw their money. Then their bank accounts were raided to prop up the bank, and they basically got nothing. People who had cash though were just fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at Argentina. There was a bank holiday and the money was devalued by 60%. People couldn't get their money out of the banks in time. People who had cash though were just fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day the money might not mean anything to anyone, but between now and then, there will be times when it means a lot.

       A missile is a rocket but a rocket is not necessarily a missile thing.  So they could be launching rockets, although if he said they usually carry nukes that would imply they are actually missiles.  Unless they are satellites carrying missiles (SPACE COWBOYS!?).

       The dollar and market is going to tank when they stop Quantitative Easing. Bernanke has made 2 announcements thus far regarding the possibility of lowering the buy-back program in order to test the market's reaction. It's not good. Other countries are making agreements in order to trade in other currencies, thereby breaking the petrodollar, and removing the dollar as the world's currency. When these all take place, the government will go into default and austerity measures far greater than sequestration and shut-downs will automatically go into effect. All key government personnel will be fired, programs will cease, pensions will be lost and taxes withheld. Half of the country will become hungry, the other, angry.

       A war with Syria would be a proxy war through Israel, with terrorist attacks on US soil leading to martial law. With the war now on ice, there is no psuedo reason to roll out FEMA camps, militarized police, and DHS assets. The government has failed to present a narrative of how the police state is only there to help and protect us. The people will know why they are there, and the CFR would prefer to go through with their plans without the possibility of a fight. Or I'm totally wrong ;p
