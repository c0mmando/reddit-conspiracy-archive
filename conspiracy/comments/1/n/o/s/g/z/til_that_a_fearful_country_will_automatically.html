But when I watched videos available, I saw the driver of a car panic and flee from drawn weapons pointed at her car that also held a toddler.  For the record, according to all reports, the toddler was also unarmed.  This woman was later gunned down and killed.</p>

<p>Maybe she had it coming but it makes me physically ill to watch police officers firing at a car that has a toddler inside.</p>

<p>ohhhh, i see it now. Youre taking the &quot;terrorists under the bed&quot; stance.</p>

<p>It doesnt matter what she did, or how she did it. police are NOT executioners, and they were perfectly able to disable her and her vehicle without killing her. she had a child in the car, several people looking <em>inside</em>the car, and were INCHES away from their tires. it doesnt matter &quot;what they were thinking&quot;, they are equally criminal for man slaughter.</p>

<p>if police are able to stop a car going 80+ down the highway with no casualties and minimal damage to property, then the secret service should be able to stop a car in downtown DC.</p>

<p>Dont justify death by cop, it makes you look bad. we took an alleged bomber to court, we can take a black lady with a car to court.</p>

<p>Lets assume that there is no conspiracy behind boston and it happened exactly as we were told.</p>

<p>The brothers were in a firefight with police. killing one, or both then, is well within the law. The 2nd brother was in a boat MUCH later was unarmed and NOT a threat, but was shot at anyways, that is NOT within the law.</p>

<p>see the difference?  the law, perhaps you should read up on it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless you are saying that the police are straight-up lying, then yes, she did. Alhurra TV had video of the initial attempt to arrest her, and there was damage to the front bumper above the left tire. The guard she hit was at that time. She then rammed a police cruiser and fled at high rate of speed toward the Senate Office Building. Police had no way of knowing her intent, or whether she posed more of a threat than just vehicular manslaughter. </p>

<p>She <em>could</em> have had a bomb, which is what those barricades were put in place to protect against. Thankfully, it turns out that she didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>But judging from her actions, she knew what was going on. We just don&#39;t know <em>why</em> she ended up doing this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Violence provokes violence, the key is to obey constitution and law: every person has right to live until court, not a cop, decides otherwise</p>

<p>Someone needs to be smart enough and not shoot unarmed troublemakers to death just to feel safe. Risk comes with the territory as well as some benefits too.</p>

<p>After each case like this, cops are reassured that they did everything  correct, where the truth is: in this case, they just started to shoot with intent to kill, without making a reasonable judgement and attempt to demobilize vehicle instead. It is pure luck that everyone around decided to lay down and noone else got hurt.</p>

<p>Until cops realize that their job is to serve and protect people and not just themselves, it will spiral into more violence. They should be a moral standard for everyone, because they represent law, not be the people who is everybody afraid of and a lot - hate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the comment of what is probably a DC area police officer, explaining why they wouldn&#39;t have simply shot out her tires or attempted to incapacitate her via wounding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll explain from the perspective from the other side of the gun.</p>

<p>Officers are NOT  trained to &quot;shoot out tires&quot; We are specifically told to never, ever try and shoot out someones tires. There&#39;s two major reasons why.</p>

<p>A) discharging our firearm is permitted only to control a &quot;deadly force threat&quot; (imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury to ourselves or others). If we shoot at someone, it better be because we reasonably believe that the subject WILL kill/hurt someone if we fail to act. We are trained to shoot until the threat is controlled. For us, that typically means shooting at a person&#39;s center of mass. why? You ask? Because center of mass is the largest target, meaning we are more likely to score a hit and most likely to stop that subjects deadly force threat the quickest. We cannot &quot;shoot to wound&quot;,because, a wounded subject is still capable of killing or harming you or someone else. Shooting to wound is using &quot;pain compliance&quot; to establish control....but we are using a lethal force control option. WE are using a level of force that is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury, to address a threat that we feel can be managed through non-lethal means. The very act of using a firearm to &quot;wound&quot;, negates your justification for using that level of force. We use lethal force to &quot;stop&quot; a deadly force threat. We are trained to stop the threat in the quickest, most effective, means.   </p>

<p>B) we are responsible for every bullet that leaves our firearms. This includes richochets. If we&#39;re shooting at someone to &quot;stop&quot; their deadly force threat, and a bullet misses and injures a bystander, we are only responsible for the failure to make sure all our shots hit the correct target (whether that is because of a lack of range training, or improper equipment, whatever). Referencing my first point, if we shoot to &quot;injure&quot; their car....well we aren&#39;t stopping the threat. A flat tire doesn&#39;t stop a car, it doesn&#39;t make the driver less capable of getting out and opening fire. We would be using lethal force to control a resistance that we de facto aknowledge can be met with less lethal control. So NOW, that stray bullet   or that richochet, has injured or killed an innocent bystander...when we had NO justification for using it in the first place. That&#39;s why we have things like tire strips..or tazers. Those are ways for us to flatten tires...or stop a threat, that are not &quot;lethal force&quot;. Our failure to have access to less lethal control options is not justification for excessive force.</p>

<p>It is sad what happened to this woman. But honestly, you feel that her behavior was excusable? How was anything about what she did before, during, and after this video reasonable? Reasonable people do not drive into police barricades and strike officers trying to stop them. Reasonable people do not lead police on vehicle pursuits. Reasonable people do not ram police cars blocking them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If she tried to &quot;crash&quot; through a concrete security gate her car would look like the police car that attempted the same feat.  So &quot;crashing&quot; security gate # 2 didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>As to the first security gate she is accused of &quot;ramming,&quot; or in your case &quot;crashing through,&quot; where is the damage to her vehicle?  If she was trying to gain access to the WH grounds why didn&#39;t she exit her vehicle and run through it (with her gun, or whatever she was supposed to be doing)?  Why would she bring her child on this mission?</p>

<p><em>Here&#39;s my speculation about the incident</em>: she made a wrong turn into the security roundabout (at the WH).  The police probably yelled at her through a loudspeaker or something that it was a restricted area and to leave.  Officers, some maybe in plain clothes, immediately come out yelling and pointing for her to leave.  Instead of simply continuing on and making the roundabout turn, she tried backing up and leaving the way she came in.  A police vehicle came from behind to block her exit this way.  She tried going forward to leave the &#39;correct way&#39; but could not make the complete turn, because her car was askew from trying to back out the way she came in, and bumped or stopped short of the poles ringing the roundabout.  All those officers then descended on her pointing their weapons trying to make her exit the vehicle for questioning rather than letting her go.  She panicked, backed up, maybe hitting the police car blocking her from behind, and went forward to exit the roundabout the correct way and then fled the police.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where are you seeing that she was surrendering at any time? </p>

<p>Yes, in this case it is serious enough that I would say shooting is a justifiable way to end it. Cars are still dangerous. I dare say it&#39;s easier to kill someone with a car than with a gun. </p>

<p>That aside, she was already somewhere she was not supposed to be, and she&#39;d already hurt others. They didn&#39;t know why she was there, or what her intent was. All they know is that she ran a security checkpoint, hit a cop with her car, then tried to plow through a barricade where she hit even more cops with her car.</p>

<p>Off of this information alone, I&#39;m pretty sure anyone would have assumed that her actions were intentionally malicious. </p>

<p>What would you have done in that position? Would you have gotten the call that a woman who ran a checkpoint in front of the capitol building, who had rammed through a police barricade when they tried to stop her, and was now speeding down Pennsylvania Avenue and thought to yourself &quot;She&#39;s probably just driving recklessly. Better pull her over and write her a ticket.&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s probably nothing, just a coincidence that this is all happening in front of the nation&#39;s capitol building. We&#39;ll just ride this out and see what happens.&quot; </p>

<p>So now I guess the apologists are going to have to drop the vehicle as a deadly weapon argument and move on to &#39;the police feared for their lives, or the lives of others&#39; as she &quot;fled&quot; on foot.   Hundreds of cops in one of the busiest and most policed neighborhoods in the world couldn&#39;t collar an unarmed mother who allegedly left her child in the car as she &quot;fled.&quot;  Yeah, right.  And I did see other eyewitnesses describe her being shot right upon exit from the vehicle and no foot chase, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say she was surrendering.  I was pointing out her vehicle had been stopped, she exited the vehicle, and therefore the threat had been stopped.</p>

<p>Who knows if she was indeed surrendering.  I don&#39;t trust the self-serving claims in the media she was &quot;fleeing&quot; on foot though.</p>

<p>She was driving dangerously and it was appropriate to stop her vehicle, using appropriate force (boxing her in, shooting at her wheels in a safe manner, using spikes, etc.).  </p>

<p>But after she exited the vehicle she should have been apprehended without lethal force.  If the police aren&#39;t willing to take the risk of apprehending an unarmed woman and feel they need to shoot first then they have no business being officers.</p>

<p>Do you really believe it&#39;s reasonable to shoot a person suspected of reckless driving, assault, failing to obey orders, and damage to a police vehicle when they have the ability to chase her down on foot and arrest her?  Even if this was a murder suspect, once the weapon was neutralized, the police have an obligation to arrest the suspect and not kill the suspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, war fighting and murdering someone are two different things technique wise. If our enemy was compromised entirely out of pedestrians, than yeah, I think we would do better hitting them with our trucks than shooting them. Interceptor body armor can stop .308 rounds, but won&#39;t do shit if a HMMWV rolls over you. I&#39;m sure you even know that this is a stupid comparison to make, and you&#39;re just trying to discredit what I&#39;m saying with a ridiculous scenario.</p>

<p>Can you shoot the tires out on a moving car? It&#39;s hard enough to hit a moving person, much less the tires of a vehicle. Even then, guns aren&#39;t used to incapacitate people. No police or military force has a &quot;shoot to pacify&quot; policy. That&#39;s dangerous. If someone requires being shot, then the police are not going to risk trying to wound the person, then having them still fight back, or missing the shot. If you need to use a gun on someone, you need to stop them right there. You need to drop them. If the person didn&#39;t need killing, then they wouldn&#39;t have used their guns in the first place. </p>

<p>Protocol is to shoot dead someone who attacks you - whether it be with a knife, gun, or vehicle. If a police officer is standing in front of you, and you try to hit him with your car, it is perfectly reasonable for him to shoot you. You just tried to kill him. </p>

<p>On top of that, again, this woman was speeding down Pennsylvania Avenue after trying to enter a restricted area. So once again, they did not know what she was up to. They did not know if she was just a panicking, mentally troubled woman - or someone who was trying to cause actual harm. Initially the police did not know what was going on, so they tried to stop her with a barricade. Was this not sound logic? That a woman who just hit someone with her car and sped off erratically should be stopped by the police? Then she plowed through the police barricade when the officers approached to arrest her. Is is not not sound logic to assume that this woman was up to something? They went with the safest bet, which was to assume she was planning something malicious, that she was willing to run through a police barricade to do it, and that she was dangerous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it didnt <em>break</em> barriers, it went over lowered barriers at a checkpoint it was meant to stop at and then tried to pass the next checkpoint but found itself pressed against the barriers you see in your first image there. That image is the moment after she backed her car, the front of which was pressed against those barriers, into a police car. Then, despite being surrounded by police with guns drawn decided to speed away thru them. I don&#39;t know exactly how much visual damage you are looking for, but you can clearly see this ladder chain of events in the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/us-capitol-lockdown-reports-gunshots">footage</a>. </p>

<p>And as for your other point. They probably did see the child, which is probably why they didn&#39;t fill the car full of holes as soon as she initially backed into a squad car and then attempted to flee <em>thru</em> the officers surrounding her all in front of the most heavily guarded building in the world.</p>

<p>Edit: also both the image you posted and the video I posted are from the beginning of the incident in front of the white house, I&#39;m not sure what is meant to have happened to the car at the capitol where the chase ended but you can see from the second image you posted that there is a knocked over barricade behind her car.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why?  Do you know how many people work and visit that area?  Why is this a Constitution free zone?  There are already a huge amount of police there.  They already have barriers and checkpoints, as we are seeing, making attacks unlikely.  Maybe the paranoia causes more problems because it&#39;s hard for lots of people to think clearly when many men with guns are shouting at you and pointing weapons at you and your child when you don&#39;t expect it because you made a wrong turn in a crowded downtown area.  Clearly, this incident could have ended without any deaths.  Unless you&#39;re telling me these strong, &quot;brave,&quot; &quot;heroes&quot; can&#39;t arrest an unarmed woman with her 1 year old without filling her full of holes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why I said kind of. I&#39;m not sure they had to kill her but when you&#39;re that close to legislators/the president without any knowledge of whether her car had a bomb or something it&#39;s not surprising that they acted paranoid. That&#39;s one of the places that you can&#39;t fuck around with the police.</p>

<p>And see I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s a typical response to having police shout at you and point guns at you. Typically you&#39;d put your hands up and do whatever the fuck they tell you because you&#39;re scared as shit. I think her abnormal response was part of what caused the police to be so jumpy (and hence firing).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t mean to imply you used those words.  I was in-artfully trying to reference the way the Congress and media has treated the police--as &quot;heroes&quot; and being &quot;brave.&quot;  </p>

<p>I think this panic response may be more common that you imagine.  People have all sorts of abilities, reaction times, fears, experiences, etc.  In fact, weren&#39;t these checkpoint killings routine in Iraq, precisely because so many people didn&#39;t react to the extreme and scary force used in a way that the young military men thought was obvious?  </p>

<p>I can see how young men, in general, are going to be accustomed to this type of command (pointing guns and yelling).  But older people with slow reaction times, lots of women, people that had abusive parents that constantly yelled at them, or people that come from other cultures or don&#39;t speak the language, can all react much differently.  Plus, this area is a busy tourist area and lots of people would not expect a military style checkpoint.  If they are going to use military style lethal force checkpoints they should put huge warning signs like they do in Iraq warning that deadly force will be used.</p>

<p>I remember when I was a teenager and worked in a grocery store and I was soooo frustrated at how slow people walked and how pathetic they were about getting out of the way, etc., and that&#39;s because I was a young and had quick reflexes and attuned to what I was doing but lots of people were just shuffling through their day and if you descend on people like this yelling with guns it can cause a fight or flight reflex, or simply frozen panic where the brain doesn&#39;t work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your sentiment, and putting warnings up would probably be good.</p>

<p>The rest I think definitely <em>might</em> be true, but I can&#39;t speak to it. I&#39;m not sure how people react to checkpoints and how often people drive through them incorrectly. In general I do agree cops resort to firearms way too often, and this very well might have been one of those cases.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying, from a practical standpoint, that cops there are obviously going to be on high alert and are going to be much quicker than at less important places. Did they make a mistake? Obviously. Was it there fault? Maybe but it&#39;s less clear, at least in my opinion. With the benefit of hindsight it&#39;s easy to say that they shouldn&#39;t have shot her but the way she was driving around and the unknown of how dangerous she was is a pretty dangerous combination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, they did disable the car but shot her anyway.  </p>

<p>If they shot her to disable the car that is pretty dangerous because that could hurt even more people as she would lose control of the car or even press on the gas as she was dying.  There are non lethal methods to disable a car.  </p>

<p>My understanding is that SOP nowadays leans to either stopping a chase or to back off so the fleeing suspect doesn&#39;t freak out killing more people.  Or, to use spike strips or to box her in using police vehicles.  I wasn&#39;t aware of the shooting to kill the driver method, at least not in war zones.  </p>

<p>Here, I don&#39;t have many issues with the boxing in method and that&#39;s apparently what they did.  But they admit to shooting her after she exited her car.  They claim she was trying to &quot;flee&quot; but obviously since they&#39;ve lied so many other times in this incident we can&#39;t believe it and there certainly were non lethal ways to arrest an unarmed woman (with her child), since the place was swarming with police.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true. In this case the vehicle is now being used as a weapon since it has been used to pass a barrier and collide into another one, damaged a car, and supposedly injured an officer. Plus there wasn&#39;t a clear shot at any time for them to hit a tire, much less successfully penetrate the hood of the car at a side angle and damage the engine block.</p>

<p>The best and, sadly, easiest target in a car is the driver. Anything else will take far too much ammo and larger armament to successfully damage. I really cannot speak for where the child was at the time but there is no question that it was in a car seat and below the windows where they were no doubt targeting to hit the driver at the time.</p>

<p>As for her getting out and shot while running? That is hardly, hardly a new thing and not exactly unheard of.. But it also depends where she was running to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just an unorthodox procedure for police to do such stuff and you never heard of police officers shooting at engine blocks or tires during chases or when trying to get someone out of a car. When they were at that moment, they were far more busy trying to get her out of the car then to unload a full clip into the hood of her car hoping it&#39;d be enough to disable the engine or be able to pierce through the hood.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just not effective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what factors into it. A blown tire does not stop a car from moving on and you can see that in any police chase with a spikestrip deployed and pops all four tires.</p>

<p>Shooting at an engine, best they could do is hit the radiator which would not cause it to stop right then and there and she can go on for long periods with the engine smoking.</p>

<p>Again, these just aren&#39;t effective tactics and very unorthodox for anyone to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A blown tire may not stop a car, but it reduces the threat and makes it easier to stop the car using something like the PIT maneuver.  </p>

<p>You are right, shooting at the engine can be a bit of a crap-shoot.  However, you can&#39;t convince me that it isn&#39;t worth trying a few 12 gauge slugs through the hood.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why they didn&#39;t make a bigger effort to block the car in with police cruisers then go from there.  That seems like the best way to minimize collateral damage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>gotcha, all that makes sense, and I can agree shooting the tires or engine may have not stopped her then.  But c&#39;mon, these guys are trained, and I&#39;m sure, and I hope, they don&#39;t allow rink-a-dink cops near the white house.  They had her against the barricade, there were enough cars where I would think they cold have pinned her in.  Hell you even see cops in other states pin people in.  It wasn&#39;t like she was making some intricate james bond get away moves nor had some crazy type of skill.  All she did was friggin reverse at the barrier.  First instinct would be to pin someone that is in a car if what you say about shooting the tires/engine is true and wouldn&#39;t work.  You pin the person.  They had her stop briefly, so its not like they thought there was a bomb in that car, otherwise they would have reigned bullets right then and there.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>also regarding the tire/engine thing, I forgot that there was a lockdown on the heavily guarded area, and there were semi-automatic weapons on the scene, and I&#39;m sure other type of weapons especially due to the area.  So its not like there was just one LEO with one handgun.  We&#39;re talking multimple LEO&#39;s and semi-automatic guns, shotguns, automatics.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit.  The posts and informed speculation here were more accurate than media reports.  People here were quicker to get the correct facts than pretty much all other media sources and other discussion forums.</p>

<p><em>Let&#39;s count the mainstream media false reporting</em>:</p>

<p>The media reported she fired shots.  They reported that she damaged that officer&#39;s car when he ran into the barrier himself (still today I see many media sources deceptively implying this and using the photo of the damaged car for emotional impact).  They reported she &quot;rammed&quot; the barrier when the video and evidence doesn&#39;t show it.  They reported/implied that she was heading to the Capital building to attack there.  They reported that she hit an officer at a barrier and drug him, or something (this is unclear but I assume they are referring to the WH roundabout checkpoint where maybe she hit an officer&#39;s car as she backed up to flee).  They reported leaks/lies about her mental health, implying that postpartum depression would cause her to do this (how postpartum depression would lead to this behavior isn&#39;t clear.  She wanted suicide by cop for her and her child?).  They reported another adult was in the car with her.  Some media used headlines with the word &quot;terror&quot; and hyped the Congress shutting down and the Congresspersons cheering for the police.  I have yet to see any real critical questions in the media.  Instead they dutifully parrot the police line.</p>

<p>Also, she was from Stamford.

I actually grew up in Stamford, I literally have chilled with my (significantly multiracial) friends on the roof of her apartment building Woodside Green, we used to always chill at the gazebo in the middle of the complex.

<p>If she wanted &quot;suicide&quot; by cop (because of alleged pospartum depression, is the media spin), why not hop out of her car and charge the WH or something?  Her actions don&#39;t look like suicide by cop.  </p>

<p>Plus, she&#39;s not trying to &quot;plow&quot; through them necessarily.  If you look closely the police are standing between or behind those poles that would prevent her from hitting them.  She also makes a turn and she doesn&#39;t aim straight for the police.  Also, she advertises what she is doing but backing up first, and presumably turning her wheel, showing she intends to try to exit, giving the police time to give way to her car, which they clearly do by jumping out of the way.  Lastly, the space is so tight and her car so low that she could do little damage even if she were to aim for them (her car would have been stopped by the poles).  </p>

<p>Most (read everything but black powder rifles as far as I know) firearms use smokeless powder.  So that kind of puts a damper on your comment.</p>

<p>Additionally, the police didn&#39;t &quot;burn through a magazine&quot; so I doubt, even if this did produce a smoke cloud, that there was a smoke cloud present.</p>

<p>Source: I&#39;ve fired more than my fair share for firearms.  Everything from 240G&#39;s on full auto to KRISS Super V on full auto.  I saw a CIWS throw 10,000 rounds at a target drone one time while on ship.  They did not produce smoky conditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t it also make you ill to see a mother recklessly putting a toddler in such increasingly dangerous situations? </p>

<p>She didn&#39;t just wake up one day and find herself with guns pointed at her and fled. She put herself in the situation to be surrounded by cops with guns drawn. She attempted to breach the security of the most secure building in the world <em>with a car</em>. And then when she was caught and surrounded, she further endangered herself and her child by fleeing <em>through</em> the circle of police surrounding her. And then after somehow not getting killed in that incredibly reckless homi/suicidal act, she continued to increase the danger she and her child were in by leading police on a chase.  </p>

<p>As a reminder, <em>unarmed</em> people kill people everyday by hitting them with cars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that the police created the scenario.  If just one of them had taken the time to calmly ask her if everything was alright and if she needed help that would have ended it.  Instead they aggressively continued to escalate the situation until she was in fear for her life and felt the need to flee with her child.  Obviously her fears were well founded.  Perhaps you&#39;re comfortable living in a world where police manufacture crisis and then rationalize the murdering of innocent people but I&#39;m not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes police manipulate and manufacture crisis all the time, it has happened to me repeatedly. But this was not an entirely manufactured crisis. This was the restricted section of Pennsylvania Ave in front of the White House we are talking about. Like it or not, those particular police on that particular piece of road that no one is supposed to be on have very little tolerance for anyone driving around and evading them. She had ample opportunity to grasp the magnitude of what she was doing <em>before</em> she went into the second barricade and then was surrounded by police and then backed into one and then pulled away as they were surrounding her guns drawn nearly running some over and then leading them on a chase ten blocks to the Capitol. It really seems to me like she was the one escalating the situation at each of these turns. At any given point she could have <strong>stopped</strong> and ended the whole thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m saying, evading capitol police in front of the White House like you&#39;ve got a car bomb you want to blow the president up with is basically like wearing a short skirt and speaking to strange men at the public house. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know it was possibly to be met with so many logical fallacies in so little time. </p>

<p>Now that my interpretation of how this woman could have kept her child safe has made me a rape apologist, anyone want to take a swing at my heritage or skin color next? Next someone is going to say that I&#39;m only asserting you should comply when surrounded by armed police instead of plowing through them to get away and lead them on a 2 mile chase because I am an Aries.</p>

<p>Edit: To further answer your condescending question as tho it deserved a response, in law there is a term they use to determine cause: foreseeability. By going out dressed sexy and talking to men at a bar it is not foreseeable that your actions should lead to you being raped. However by being in <a href="http://www.publiusforum.com/images/WhiteHouseCarChase_01.jpg">this</a> particular situation, surrounded by capitol police in front of the White House and smashing your way out of it thru police instead of giving up, it is foreseeable that they would shoot you.</p>

<p>I have not posited any <em>justification</em>. Simply trying to lay out that this woman appears to have been behaving in an severely reckless and arguably suicidal manner. Simply because I feel that the mother and not the police was the one putting the child in harms way does not mean I have lost my empathy. </p>

<p>Watch this <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/us-capitol-lockdown-reports-gunshots">short video</a></p>

<p>Tell me if you, as a hypothetical capital police officer in front of the White House, would not do anything you could to stop this person.</p>

<p>More to the point tell me if you, as the hypothetical person in that car, would not either <strong>STOP</strong>, or expect to be fired upon.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief police cannot shoot first but once she went on that sidewalk toward the barrier it was game over. The police acted in accordance with policy/law by positioning themselves around that car which basically means trying to drive out of their perimeter escalates the situation allowing for use of deadly force.</p>

I wasn&#39;t saying that all people in cars are armed, I was simply reminding that just because one does not have a conventional weapon does not mean that they are not a threat for harm, particularly if they are displaying a propensity to ram cars and police officers with their car. </p>

A crazed person going off the rails (alert the  mind control theorists...), a person with a grievance trying to commit suicide by cop, a person with health issues that has an accident and panics when armed people want her to stop and leave the car that has her kid in... and the reaction of the cops, the possibility of it being a car bomb surely left them little headspace to do nothing but react in a basic manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Source?  From what I remember there are quite a few that came forward saying they NEVER saw a plane.  And why were videos confiscated from nearby businesses that could have clearly shown the plane?  And they were confiscated within an hour or 2 if I remember correctly.  The whole Pentagon hit was the most questionable part of 9/11 to me.  The hole it created, the fact that there has never been any video released and that people have said they never saw a plane.  I am not saying it was a missile, but if you rule it out with no evidence (especially when the evidence actually points to a missile) then you are either gullible or you just don&#39;t want to question what the government says because any other explanation is so fucking scary.  </p>

<p>And just in case you want to check out some video that has been buried <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2011/08/29/911-video-of-missile-hitting-pentagon-leaked/">this clearly shows it was NOT a jet.</a>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah.  Yeah I watched a few of the interviews and the one that sticks out the most is the last video on the page.  The witness heard a plane go overhead.  It was a &quot;small plane flying very low&quot;.  If a 747 or whatever they claim hit the building, why in the world would he say it was a small plane?  We have all been on a plane I am sure and we have heard how loud they are, nobody would say a &quot;small plane&quot; flew overhead if it was 100+ passenger jet flying as low as they claim this one was.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, the video I provided shows a small object striking the Pentagon.  If it was a plane, it would have been a lot bigger than what is visible in the video.  Do some research and keep an open mind about the whole thing please.  I used to deny everything questionable about 9/11 as well, but there is so much shady evidence and circumstances about the Pentagon strike that I just can&#39;t accept it as true unless they release a video showing the plane hitting the Pentagon from the surveillance videos they confiscated.  </p>

<p>It reminds me of the TWA flight 800 story.  The facts just do not match the story.  </p>

You&#39;re using ONE witness who said they saw a plane to try and spin that into seeing a missile, while ignoring the 200 other quotes that said they saw a large passenger plane and dozens naming the correct airliner that hit. You are the master cherry picker.</p>

<p>When a car rams through a checkpoint, especially near the fucking White House, it&#39;s assumed that there is a bomb. These officers did the right thing. It&#39;s sad that this happened, and this woman probably had mental health issues, but the police responded appropriately, and that should be the end of the discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is probably going to get down voted into oblivion, but here it goes...</p>

<p>I watched the video, too.  Yes, she was surrounded by officers and probably panicked.  However, it is to my understanding that the difference between &quot;fleeing the scene&quot; or &quot;reckless driving&quot;, here, is that she was surrounded by officers who were probably announcing &quot;Police!&quot; or &quot;Federal agents!&quot;... or something g around those lines.
She is not, at that point, simply &quot;fleeing the scene of an accident&quot; or &quot;driving recklessly&quot;.  Once you move a vehicle in the direction of officers (or anyone, for that matter) you are using deadly force.  Keep in mind, we are talking about a half ton object that can accelerate faster than walking speed rather quickly.  Most police departments that I know of consider this &quot;use of deadly force&quot;, along the lines of &quot;assault with a deadly weapon&quot;... meaning the vehicle is the weapon.  Driving a car at someone can have the same result as aiming a gun at them.  That&#39;s why the officers used deadly force, in return.  People will say, &quot;Why didn&#39;t they shoot the tires?!&quot;. To my knowledge, that is NOT a standard procedure of any law enforcement office.</p>

<p>Look... I&#39;m as anti-police-state as the rest of the crew here.  But, I&#39;m not really seeing a whole lot of wrong in the way things happened on this one.  Is it shitty that she died?  Yes.  Are we in that situation?  No.  </p>

If the american police cowards rely on killing for whatever reason [apart from actually having a gun pointed at them], then they are not fit for purpose.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There are more deadly weapons than guns.</p>

<p>How about if someone points a crossbow at a cop and threatens to fire? Should he shoot or take the arrow?</p>

<p>What if someone is charging at a cop with a claymore? Or a battle axe?</p>

<p>What if someone is driving a car trying to run over multiple cops?</p>

<p>All of those things represent actual, mortal threats to cops. All of those things should get the perpetrator shot. Multiple times. Immediately. And with no repercussions other than having to fill out a report for the cops who shoot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have LEO&#39;s in my family. Their training (primarily to save their own life when some idiot is trying to end it) is 2 in the chest then 1 in the head.</p>

<p>If they believe they can solve the problem with non-lethal force, then obviously they forego the gun and use the taser or whatever other non-lethal method makes sense.</p>

<p>If an idiot was driving a car at them in an attempt to injure or kill, I expect the response would be to aim at the driver&#39;s head instead of the car&#39;s tires. Cars with flat tires still drive. Drivers with bullets in their head tend to stop trying to run you over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> needs to take a step back and rethink their ideas about the police. Its easy enough to point at extreme and controversial cases and ramp up the hyperbole to a ridiculous extent, but you have to keep in mind that not only is the USA&#39;s police force not the only police force in the world, but that the majority of things that any police do each and every day go unreported due to it being their regular job of keeping order and arresting criminals.</p>

<p>While I am positive that among the various police forces in the world there are a good number of trigger-happy thugs it&#39;s important to realize that most police officers are simply regular people doing their job. Whether or not you personally find the job, or a particular incident distasteful you have to keep in mind that we as a society need people around who are prepared to do distasteful things in order to prevent things getting a whole lot worse.</p>

<p>I am unaware of the specifics of this incident, as is pretty much everyone else who wasn&#39;t there and wasn&#39;t briefed about it. Everything I do know about it points towards the actions of these police officers as being entirely necessary and reasonable. It is sad that someone died, as it always is, but by all accounts this woman was behaving in a very erratic manner and committed several criminal acts. You can&#39;t let the presence of a toddler or the fact she was unarmed obscure the main and most important aspect of this - she was committing crimes and fleeing from the police.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is this country coming to when a woman with a child in the car can&#39;t run over barricades and drive into the white house. She only ran over one secret service agents and they went and shot her. This country is going downhill I tell you what! Back in the old days my uncle used to do donuts on the white house lawn all the time, and u see, back in those days, rich men would ride around in Zeppelins, dropping coins on people, and one day he saw J.D. Rockefeller flying by. So he ran out of the house with a big washtub he&#39;d just used it that morning to wash his turkey, which in those days was known as a walking-bird. They&#39;d always have walking-bird on Thanksgiving, with all the trimmings: cranberries, injun eyes, yams stuffed with gunpowder. Then they&#39;d all watch football, which in those days was called baseball.
We can&#39;t bust heads like we used to, but we have our ways. One trick is to tell &#39;em stories that don&#39;t go anywhere - like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so, I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on &#39;em. Give me five bees for a quarter, you&#39;d say.
Now where were we? Oh yeah: the important thing was I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn&#39;t have white onions because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see it going any other way, but I also disagree that it will stop the violence. It&#39;s evident by now that we&#39;ve all enabled what is now happening more today. By continually letting them overstep boundaries it has become normal, and there aren&#39;t many options on the table as they have taken our voice away from us. They&#39;ve taken it away by propaganda, by silencing, by underhanded political and legislative tactics, by outright intimidation, and all supported by a majority of apathetic or otherwise ignorant citizens who wouldn&#39;t think twice to demonize you if your face went up on the news; another person with mental issues slain by police just doing their jobs. </p>

<p>EDIT: I don&#39;t own a gun, and if I did it would be for defense only. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have it in me to kill anyone unless they were an immediate threat beyond reason. I wouldn&#39;t kill a cop, but there are people who would and it will start happening if this trend of &quot;shoot first ask questions later&quot; continues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Scattered pockets of resistance wouldn&#39;t do much of anything. It would cause a heavy handed response like we saw in Boston. The recent militarization shows what lengths they&#39;re willing to go to maintain what they&#39;ve got. Fully armored combat vehicles aren&#39;t for policing, they&#39;re for controlling. I wonder what it would take to change anything at this point.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Historically violence has been a part of every revolutionary movement. But that has already begun to change with the Arab spring. And I as a pacifist anarcho-idealist believe that we could move to a place where a massive system like ours could change without violence...<em>some day</em></p>

<p>However, violence or not, <em>change</em> would require a massive cultural shift. I think that may be a much more difficult aspect than any sort of physical revolution. People need to be less alienated from each other and less apathetic towards one another. The internet almost equally helps and hurts this process. Capitalism has made us cruel and predatory. Religion has given people reasons to ignore reason. And I believe it is all of these things that impose upon us the real fear that allows us to accept this violent world we live in. Historically, one of the necessary conditions for a revolution to succeed is that the society be willing to accept it. And I think we still have a lot of evolving to do as a culture.</p>

<p>As far as solutions, I&#39;m kinda short on specifics right now, but I&#39;ll say this: </p>

<p>Be kind. Don&#39;t make enemies (particularly when you really should be friends). I think the left can really use this advice. There are so many groups that should unify for common goals and against common enemies. But they can&#39;t get on the same page about their major commonalities because of their anger over their minor differences. I think that a lot of people on both <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> could learn this lesson. The Iranian dissident movement is a great example. So many groups that can&#39;t get together over their common goal of overthrowing the current government because of their differences on what should come next, despite most of them wanting democracy.</p>

<p>So yeah, unity, like queen latifah said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the point.  The first video, there is maybe one point where it might be justifiable to use lethal force (although it would have been more sensible for the police to get away from the car..), once that was over though that justification disappears.  Since when is it OK to use lethal force after a threat has ceased? And yes, it may have cost more in terms of material and time, but stopping a car without killing the driver seems to be something the police manage fairly regularly..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question.</p>

<p>It depends on one&#39;s reasoning.  If one says &quot;That bitch hit my coworker!  I&#39;m gonna make her pay!&quot; then absolutely not.  The action in retribution is absolutely NOT justified.  However, if one were to say &quot;This individual has proven themselves in this moment to be a direct and immediate threat to the public.  We must stop the individual from being a <em>continued</em> danger to anyone else in the vicinity.&quot; then that logic of stopping the individual is not entirely unsound.</p>

<p>Granted they could have shot out the tires of the vehicle initially to incapacitate further movement and not gone for actually killing the driver themselves, but I don&#39;t think that their not having gone for the tires is an immediately damnable thing in and of itself in this particular case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see it going any other way, but I also disagree that it will stop the violence. It&#39;s evident by now that we&#39;ve all enabled what is now happening more today. By continually letting them overstep boundaries it has become normal, and there aren&#39;t many options on the table as they have taken our voice away from us. They&#39;ve taken it away by propaganda, by silencing, by underhanded political and legislative tactics, by outright intimidation, and all supported by a majority of apathetic or otherwise ignorant citizens who wouldn&#39;t think twice to demonize you if your face went up on the news; another person with mental issues slain by police just doing their jobs. </p>

<p>EDIT: I don&#39;t own a gun, and if I did it would be for defense only. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have it in me to kill anyone unless they were an immediate threat beyond reason. I wouldn&#39;t kill a cop, but there are people who would and it will start happening if this trend of &quot;shoot first ask questions later&quot; continues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Historically violence has been a part of every revolutionary movement. But that has already begun to change with the Arab spring. And I as a pacifist anarcho-idealist believe that we could move to a place where a massive system like ours could change without violence...<em>some day</em></p>

<p>However, violence or not, <em>change</em> would require a massive cultural shift. I think that may be a much more difficult aspect than any sort of physical revolution. People need to be less alienated from each other and less apathetic towards one another. The internet almost equally helps and hurts this process. Capitalism has made us cruel and predatory. Religion has given people reasons to ignore reason. And I believe it is all of these things that impose upon us the real fear that allows us to accept this violent world we live in. Historically, one of the necessary conditions for a revolution to succeed is that the society be willing to accept it. And I think we still have a lot of evolving to do as a culture.</p>

<p>As far as solutions, I&#39;m kinda short on specifics right now, but I&#39;ll say this: </p>

<p>Be kind. Don&#39;t make enemies (particularly when you really should be friends). I think the left can really use this advice. There are so many groups that should unify for common goals and against common enemies. But they can&#39;t get on the same page about their major commonalities because of their anger over their minor differences. I think that a lot of people on both <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> could learn this lesson. The Iranian dissident movement is a great example. So many groups that can&#39;t get together over their common goal of overthrowing the current government because of their differences on what should come next, despite most of them wanting democracy.</p>

<p>So yeah, unity, like queen latifah said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the point.  The first video, there is maybe one point where it might be justifiable to use lethal force (although it would have been more sensible for the police to get away from the car..), once that was over though that justification disappears.  Since when is it OK to use lethal force after a threat has ceased? And yes, it may have cost more in terms of material and time, but stopping a car without killing the driver seems to be something the police manage fairly regularly..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If she tried to &quot;crash&quot; through a concrete security gate her car would look like the police car that attempted the same feat.  So &quot;crashing&quot; security gate # 2 didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>As to the first security gate she is accused of &quot;ramming,&quot; or in your case &quot;crashing through,&quot; where is the damage to her vehicle?  If she was trying to gain access to the WH grounds why didn&#39;t she exit her vehicle and run through it (with her gun, or whatever she was supposed to be doing)?  Why would she bring her child on this mission?</p>

<p><em>Here&#39;s my speculation about the incident</em>: she made a wrong turn into the security roundabout (at the WH).  The police probably yelled at her through a loudspeaker or something that it was a restricted area and to leave.  Officers, some maybe in plain clothes, immediately come out yelling and pointing for her to leave.  Instead of simply continuing on and making the roundabout turn, she tried backing up and leaving the way she came in.  A police vehicle came from behind to block her exit this way.  She tried going forward to leave the &#39;correct way&#39; but could not make the complete turn, because her car was askew from trying to back out the way she came in, and bumped or stopped short of the poles ringing the roundabout.  All those officers then descended on her pointing their weapons trying to make her exit the vehicle for questioning rather than letting her go.  She panicked, backed up, maybe hitting the police car blocking her from behind, and went forward to exit the roundabout the correct way and then fled the police.</p>

<p>ohhhh, i see it now. Youre taking the &quot;terrorists under the bed&quot; stance.</p>

<p>It doesnt matter what she did, or how she did it. police are NOT executioners, and they were perfectly able to disable her and her vehicle without killing her. she had a child in the car, several people looking <em>inside</em>the car, and were INCHES away from their tires. it doesnt matter &quot;what they were thinking&quot;, they are equally criminal for man slaughter.</p>

<p>if police are able to stop a car going 80+ down the highway with no casualties and minimal damage to property, then the secret service should be able to stop a car in downtown DC.</p>

<p>Dont justify death by cop, it makes you look bad. we took an alleged bomber to court, we can take a black lady with a car to court.</p>
