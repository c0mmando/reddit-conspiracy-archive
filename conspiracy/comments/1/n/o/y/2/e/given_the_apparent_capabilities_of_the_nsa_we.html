    <div class="md"><p>Thats not the point.</p>

<p>The point is to create a huge upswell that goes against what has been established -- and just simply demand this.</p>

<p>THe truth then reveals itself and the next natural steps take place -- that there is absolutely no way the NSA, the USG and the Banks can withstand the light shining in their eyes - thus the people can no longer support and remain beholden to this system of modern fealty.</p>

A tyrannical force doesn&#39;t give a rats ass about whether the subjects like the oppression they receive. They will keep doing what the hell they want ever if your piece of paper had every bit if 360,000,000  names on it</p>

<p>The only people laughing harder than me right now are the NSA employees reading this</p>

<p>These people are above laws and government, but you think they will adhere to a petition?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must be new here. </p>

<p>Let me explain. Petitions do one thing and one thing only. They get a topic into the zeitgeist if they catch enough steam.</p>

<p>The point is not thinking that the corrupt USG will listen to the petition - the point is to get the idea of making the NSA work for the people and defining what &quot;protecting national security&quot; is, as a topic of conversation and discussion point.</p>

<p>This is not naive - your naivete is in thinking that I was referring to an actual petition being a mechanism to affect the actions of the government.</p>

<p>NOTHING is going to deter the actions of the NSA and the USG. The only thing we can do is affect the actions of the population -- and framing things in a way that the common citizen can understand and get behind is important.</p>

<p>Finally, &quot;petition&quot; is just a representation of &quot;movement&quot; -- so, if you take issue with that particular word - for the purpose of entertaining the core of the idea - then suggest another. </p>

<p>Your inability to see beyond that singular word in the overall concept brings your mental acuity into question, not mine.</p>
