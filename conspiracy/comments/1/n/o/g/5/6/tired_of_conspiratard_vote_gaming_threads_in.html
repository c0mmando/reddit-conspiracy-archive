<p>When I proposed the idea of using the np.* prefix when linking here, they didn&#39;t take to it too kindly: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1dbb7k/may_i_ask_you_guys_to_use_the_np_prefix_when/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1dbb7k/may_i_ask_you_guys_to_use_the_np_prefix_when/</a></p>

<p>Although the users themselves could simply remove the prefix and votegame away, using the prefix would be a goodwill gesture and show that the purpose of the subreddit isn&#39;t to screw with the votes in r/conspiracy.  They didn&#39;t like this idea.</p>

They&#39;re criticising people who authoritatively posit grand, implausible conspiracy theories that are either poorly evidenced or at odds with the best available evidence, and use poor arguments to skirt around the issue.

WTC tower was carefully made to fall in a Goldilocks zone where it didn&#39;t crush the building and didn&#39;t miss the building but instead caused extensive damage and lit a fire. Somehow the fire and damage didn&#39;t damage the multiple shaped charges and hundreds of detcord lines to allow the controlled demolition to proceed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In reality, the inability to see any side, even as a thought exercise can cross all boundaries. I know many pro USA people that hold hard and fast to their ideas as well. </p>

<p>we are all conditioned. All of us. It starts off with our parents and the TV. It is a simple fact that people shy away from. I am merely pointing out that you accept a viewpoint that is in line with what US society has told you. I don&#39;t know if it is because you are young, or you have attention issues or you simply have not experienced anything anathema to what is being repeatedly stated. But if you exist in an environment in which the opposite happens despite what officials are trying to convince you of (fyi the more something is repeated the more they want to believe it i.e. tort reform.), then you are going to be a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; .   only arrogant shallow people assume that everybody thinks the same. and the only reason why you give a shit to argue with a conspiracy theorist is that you fear that your world view is incorrect. so what if someone thinks differently than you? are you that afraid that you have to engage in trying to control someones mind. are you that paranoid? because that is what you are doing. you think you are correct because the group agrees with you the descendants of slaves would like to have a word with you. </p>

<p>anyways, let it run its course. in the end its all an illusion and the conspiracy theorist will realize that long before you do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont see a problem with this, its part of the game.  I hate the voting system, but you cant put weird only spoken rules on it.  I think no downvote is the answer or if you downvote you have to comment.  But thats talking about if it was done throughout reddit or subreddit.  This is the first I have heard that there is some kind of acceptable voting vs non acceptable.  If something is a problem it has to be dealt with by changing the formula, not by complaining and trying to ban users.  I see no problem with someone voting across the board on an issue, isnt that what reddit is meant for.  If some big news comes out why shouldnt aa user be able to go across all subreddits and vote up submissions that are on that topic?  </p>

<p>Also if I remember correctly you have to subscribe to this subreddit to vote or comment, could there be some kind of thing were if a user is only downvoteing things they are banned from this subreddit? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any reasonable person who takes a look at <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> can understand that this subreddit is regularly trolled. If that subreddit didn&#39;t exist many of its users would simply become more regular participants here. They would not be as easy to detect.

<p>I completely <em>dis</em>agree with that. For one thing, that&#39;s exactly what our complaint is about them. For another, giving that sub page hits only increases their visibility. And a third is that it&#39;s a sewer and you&#39;ll just get that crap all over you.</p>

<p>Every day they obsess over our subreddit.  I&#39;ve seen as many as 14 links to our content in one day.  </p>

<p>Why are they allowed to manipulate the vote here?  Because it says not to in their sidebar?  We all know that they do it anyway.  </p>

<p>It also says not to troll in their sidebar, or to get involved in personal spats.  But they do this daily and their mods seem to encourage it.</p>

<p>Why should &quot;destructive&quot; subreddits be allowed to exist?</p>

<p><a href="/r/niggers">/r/niggers</a> was rightfully banned for raiding <a href="/r/blackladies">/r/blackladies</a>, but that disgusting subreddit was allowed to exist until they crossed that line.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> crosses that line every day, but the admins ignore it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/comments/1lvcnf/the_nolibs_banfest_of_2013/">http://www.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/comments/1lvcnf/the_nolibs_banfest_of_2013/</a></p>

<p>One of their prominent users has had 18 accounts banned since august 21st of this year, over 50 accounts banned total.  This is the kind of trash they they are allowing to grow in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>.</p>

<p>Our opinions here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> might not be popular, but we don&#39;t allow vote brigades to originate from here, I remove them personally.   </p>

<p>What else can we do?  Appeal to the admins is the only thing left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, man, But do you really think this is a good idea?</p>

<p>Sure we get brigaded, sure this is probably one of the most actively manipulated subs on reddit (that aren&#39;t mega-subs) but stickying a complain button will do us no favours. We need, if we are going to cleanse the sub (which is ultimately a bit futile) to provide concrete data of evidence of those folks messing up and brigading.</p>

<p>Offering a button to any reactionary but well-intentioned person who posts here will only serve to make us look like a pain in the arse to the admins.</p>

<p>I think you should rethink this sticky, or at least offer a proxy sub/post where we can actually find concrete evidence of brigading before bringing it to the &#39;bosses&#39;. </p>

<p>I mean, conspiracy is a broad subject, quite often I see stuff on here and think WTF this guy is either disinfo or deluded, and I&#39;m sure people think the same of me when I post/reply....Admin dont need a hundred posts a day of our bickering....A conscientous effort to isolate and distill the people who are taking the piss is a good idea, but opening the floodgates will not do our collective rep one bit of good. Too much noise, not enough signal.</p>

<p>just my 2p.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No of course, and without sounding poisonous about the folks who run this machine, they don&#39;t necessarily give a fuck about what goes into it, as long as it makes it run, right?</p>

<p>That said, I think that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has a problem. Quite often some of the most enlightening, interesting and downright groundbreaking links/post I have seen, I&#39;ve found through the new queue, whereas the top (or hot) posts are usually a shitty meme image or some other self-congratulary content that is neither informative, nor particularly interesting.</p>

<p>This frustrates me, but it&#39;s not on the mods nor the admins to fix this, it&#39;s on the users, to browse new and fill the comments with questions and correctly sourced answers to try and legitimise our ideas which many scoff at. </p>

<p>It&#39;s on us to be better than their assumptions of us. We need to be better than sourcing sideline blogs or spurious youtube videos. It&#39;s on us to be better than they assume us to be...</p>

<p>I am not advocating the death of those great self-posts with outlandish but plausible theories, or discussions thereof, but I wish all our top posts were full of indisputable, well-sourced, factual investigation. We can do it, and we should strive for it. </p>

<p>Downvote cheap memes, upvote interesting videos, post sources when replying in comments, don&#39;t just claim &#39;shill&#39;, prove they are wrong.</p>

<p>It&#39;s on us to do better.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my request, take from it what you will. :)</p>

<p>All the best.</p>

<p>I think this sub is also in an awkward teenage phase, where it&#39;s on the &#39;frontpage&#39; for enough users who rarely actually visit subs to upvote the top stuff whereas the lower content has a dearth of attention. I have no idea how to fix that, especially seeing as, the sorta thing you are alluding to, perhaps some of our members have an agenda which is kinda unhealthy and paints us all a certain way.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not rubbishing your sticky idea btw man, and kudos for actually giving a fuck about this place. It&#39;s actually great to have that discourse with ya. And I have no answers, but let me know what I can do to help. :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>R.E: The Admins/default mods:  You know shit runs deeper than that. </p>

<p>Why is it that in <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> every single snowden leak thus far hasn&#39;t reached the top from the original guardian link but from a businessinsider meta-report on the piece, obviously someone is getting paid for those pageviews. It&#39;s not fucking absurd to assume that it&#39;s not coincidence that every time a leak drops the pageviews from this here aggregate site goes via a proxy rather than the original article...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure this is an admin thing, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a paid thing, I&#39;m not sure of anything.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a seperate issue from why this sub gets so much hassle.</p>

<p>I assume it&#39;s because conspiracies attract polar differences of opinion.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing that can be done to quell the vitriol of pissed off people, right or wrong. Our job is to teach or guide them to voice their views in a way which we can all appreciate, be they hardcore libertarians, UFOlogists, centrists, left-wingers, folks with a general sense of scepticism, zealots, anti-semitics, zionists or whatever.</p>

<p>Our insurmountable job is to unite all those dudes to face a common enemy, and I&#39;m sure the truth is more complicated than that.</p>

<p>Still, there&#39;s ways and means man, I think you are doing most everything right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a number of issues with this.</p>

<p>First and possibly most important, linking to =/= vote brigading, if that were true you run an entire subreddit whose purpose is to vote brigade people, often by name, so you wouldn&#39;t have credibility on this issue.</p>

<p>While it&#39;s easy to go to another subreddit and link to it, the purpose of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> hardly seems to be to target <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> specifically. I just went there and there are links to other subreddits including <a href="/r/trees">/r/trees</a> and <a href="/r/whiterights">/r/whiterights</a>.</p>

<p>And lastly, as a mod, you should know better as to point out 1 poorly behaved person that might be at a sub and use that against an entire sub.</p>
