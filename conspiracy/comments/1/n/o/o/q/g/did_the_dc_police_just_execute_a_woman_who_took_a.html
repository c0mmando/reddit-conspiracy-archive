       The mother panicked when guns were drawn and who knows what verbal threats were being said by the officers. It is understandable someone with a child in the car would try and escape when the officers are only moments away from opening fire. Anyway...which brave souls open fire on a mother and child. All in the protection of what? The Australian news reports are saying the woman had psychological problems....who doesn't? There is so much blood on the US government's hands, I feel sorry for the American people. I hope you vote in Jesse Ventura for President. My opinion from Australia.

       Unfortunately....Ventura/Howard fuckin Stern. Ventura's going to go full retard if he does that. His whole idea behind it is that it would be really easy to get the word out. Jesse - there are plenty of other ways to get the word out...

       You're telling me more people listen to Stern on Sirius satelite radio than watch CNN, MSNBC, and FOX combined....
Did you believe Romney was going to win the election too?
It just doesn't make sense.  Tv viewership and Cable News viewership are much higher than radio listenership, let alone one channel on a premium subscription provider like Sirius.

       Well Stern has a massive financial backing and his media empire... and he is a Libertarian... but I feel ya.. I would rather see Judge Nap or John Stossel in there... I think Howard Stern would polarize the voters too much

       Jesse Ventura seems pretty, lets say, slow. He's like those "special" kids at school. Ron Paul, I like a lot of his positions, but lets be realistic, he goes way off the deep end.

       Actually that driver executed basic evasive maneuvers in a fashion that suggested she knew she was coming under fire. The roundabout trick is a tactical maneuver for combative driving.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media is reporting this woman as a postal worker. That's a near mint condition G37 which is well out of the range of most government salaries available from the post office. That in itself is atypical but not necessarily invalidating.
      </p>
      <p>
       What should have immediately occurred to most federal employees is that, when facing other federal employees who are responding to a trained threat, there are procedures. It would be obvious that weapons would be drawn if she was perceived as a potential threat in the area.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are several peculiar things about this incident though. I'm going to listen them:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) A man in a black shirt and beige shorts with a gun is responding to the scene from an unmarked vehicle. It's white and visible on the left side of the frame at 0:27. There is another man wearing shorts with a gun in a white shirt, likely his partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The suspect doesn't attempt to flee until the two plain clothes officers are in view.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The man in the white shirt is the one firing the shots. No one else appears to be firing their weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) There is another officer approaching the scene after shots are fired from the direction of the camera man. He is walking and does not have his weapon drawn. Visible at 0:34 - 0:36 on the left side of the frame.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) The roundabout maneuver made was not in response to a direct blockade ahead of the G37. If there were a blockade then a police vehicle could not be approaching and bypassed from that direction at 00:58-01:00.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) There is a tripod camera set up in the direction of the fleeing vehicle's path by tourists laying on the lawn visible at 01:07.
      </p>
      <p>
       7) At 00:56 we see that virtually none of the observers on the grass are interested enough to stand up, four aren't interested in watching the chase and casually observe the original stop point instead. They're on the left side of the frame.
      </p>
      <p>
       8) We hear sirens are 00:01 but the protestor wearing sunglasses with an unreadable sign does not react until 00:13 when the camera man audibly says something.
      </p>
      <p>
       9) There's a front-left impact mark on the vehicle about the tire well behind the front left headlight visible at 00:26. The indentation appears to have come from an object that was taller than the vehicle, possibly the bumper of an SUV. This is evident because the shape of the impact had a minimum height that was taller than the wheel well of a G37 by about 2-3 inches. The poles in front of the vehicle are not shaped in a manner that would permit this form of indentation. Furthermore, there are no visible scrapes on the paint which suggests this was a single direction kinetic impact, rather than a grazing kinetic impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       9) The only couple reacting to shots fired is visible at 00:42 and actively preparing to seek cover from stray bullets. All observers appear unengaged.
      </p>
      <p>
       10) The is another photographer near the tripod taking shots with a high resolution visible at 01:09.
      </p>
      <p>
       11) There is a stretch hummer parked on the side of the road at 01:04.
      </p>
      <p>
       12) At 00:49 there is another unmarked blue vehicle of the same make and model as the white vehicle the plainsclothes officers emerged from responding to the scene on the adjacent road with an officer running his emergency lights directly behind him. The two roads do not connect at any point between in that direction. They do have a common junction prior to that though and it appears the pair were enroute to block incoming traffic to the area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Goodluck.

       Financing bro, you can get one for like 3-500 a month, I had a $27,000 truck financed when I was 20 and my payments were $500 but it was my first car on my own. I'm sure she could of got a really good monthly payment on one, or maybe she got a settlement or someone left money for her.. not sure where I'm going with this, bored.

       She was a dental hygenist (as far as i've heard), so probably making more than a post office worker. Where did the idea that she's a postal worker come from? As for the "uninterested" people, is it possible they were ducking from gunfire? As for the protester not reacting, I think part of that is that you get really used to hearing sirens in a big city. I know I don't react to them half of the time.

       That was the first report on her identity I heard from Washington Post, one of the first reporting on the scene.

       I'm from a big city. Sirens, yes. Gunshots, nope. You always given a shit about where the gunshots are coming from and you want to know why and who. Because you don't know if some psychopath has a gun and decided today's the day. Maybe the cops want to shoot something in your direction because they hate it. Whatever the case may be one thing is for certain; people suck at aiming and bullets ricochet. So when shots are fired, where, why and how do I get out of the potential path are all really important questions.

       The alternative is "duck and make myself as small as possible". Which one of the people on scene does at around 01:02.

       They will say that she had a history of mental problems, and tried to access 'sensitive' areas of the capitol. They will say that she was suicidal and will "find" online posts from her saying how angry she was at the government and that she intended to 'do something about it'. Some may imply that this was suicide by cop, and she intended for her child to die along with her.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can bet they will make it look like she was an unhinged individual that needed to be taken down because of her murderous intent (her car as the weapon, of course).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm hoping that in the coming days, phone conversations, etc. between her and friends/family will come to light which might explain what happened but unfortunately, if it is simply a case of a panicked woman trying to avoid being killed, we will never hear that as the 'official' story.

       - yep, just saw a story blaming it on post-natal depression. Looks like that may be the official story.

       I agree with this theory. With the info given on her background it seems she lived a very normal life as a dentist, or something in the dental field. And most likely has never had multiple cops draw guns on her and start screaming at her. Some women (not being sexist) when thrown into that situation for the first time I would imagine go with their flight instead of fight sense and try to protect her child.

       I might agree if it were gang members or some militia group drawing their guns on her and her kid, but it's not, it's the police who were only pursuing her because she had already done something wrong and wouldn't pull over.

       You seem to be drawing a rather stupid distinction there. The cops are pretty much KNOWN for doing exactly this - and are in a lot of cases more violent than gangs here in the states.

       Well thank you for calling my distinction stupid, that's eloquent.  And I will try to civilly address the ignorance of your statement without insult.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you are making a rather broad and unsupported declaration about law enforcement.  There have been a number of reported cases of police behaving less than proper, true. And if you visit this sub often, it would seem that your statement is actually true.  But to say that they are worse than gangs is a bit of a stretch and I'm not sure you really grasp what it's like to be a police officer.  You are allowing a small percentage of a group that is bad to bias your opinion. And who is reporting on the good guy cops? You won't find it on this sub.  Maybe if there was more of that, statistically the group of bad ones would be more representative of their actual numbers.

       Street gangs can't commit murder live on camera, while wearing nametags, and get rewarded with a paid vacation afterword. Cops can and do.

       There are no good guy cops. They are the bad guys. All of them. Their job is to prevent the rest of us from

       you must have gotten your logical facilities from the same gene pool as obama. While there are cronies on every level in every agency/department, there are good people there as well. Your umbrella statement that all cops are bad is exactly the same as the statement that all blacks are gangbangers and all muslims are terrorists and all christians are going to heaven. People, like you, who fail to disconnect with their own bias when labelling a population of any group of people, represent the same group of people who are destroying this country. I send you my sympathies, because you must have had tramatic experiences with the police in order to actually believe what you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI, my brother is a state trooper. He is one of the most level headed and fair-minded  people i know. His heart is honest, and his loyalty is to the civilians of this country. I have no doubt that he would sacrifice his own life to save another person, even one like yourself who somehow believes he is the rotten one.
      </p>
      <p>
       My suggestion to you, is to place the blame where it belongs. and it belongs to the individuals who are corrupt, not on the shoulders of the good guys.

       It doesn't matter if she did something wrong or not. When that many pigs draw their weapons on you, you fucking stop what you are doing and put your hands up. It is a horrible situation for all involved, but you just don't do that. I have had multiple guns drawn on me before by police. Having done nothing wrong, I didn't understand why at the moment. But believe I stopped what I was doing and pit my hands up. If they view you as a threat, they
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       shoot you.

       See, I have an aversion to be in that situation. Helpless at the whims of my captors. I have seen plenty of videos and read stories about cops shooting people (wrongfully imo). Hell, my old marine recruiter Sargeant loggins was gunned down by police in cali.

       Derp....like that was neant to be proof of anything... Give your pompous head a shake. It was meant to show you it is not my idea but a truth. What is a gang? The cops are the biggest most well funded gang out there. "Oh my b.i.l. is a cop and he is nice" unless he is witness to a coworkers crimes then see where he stands.

       She panicked. They panicked. She died. Badges should be taken and charges filed. Nobody said being a cop was easy. I feel sorry for all involved, but the police have a responsibility to use the power we give them responsibly. This has to be made into a teaching moment for all of them.

       yes the media immediately turns to arguing that she may have had some sort of psych problem. and that is truly scary. that a persons psych problem or simply allegations of one, can be used as a rational to justify to the public the murder of a person by the state. it was ok to kill her i guess because she MIGHT have been dangerous, even though she was not, because she MIGHT have been crazy, even though there is no hard evidence of that and no necessary connection between the two anyway. the cops were just doing their job, even though they were not and were simply in a panic.

       Guns weren't drawn until after she hit a secret servicemen. So if you got a report saying that one of your own was hit by a car. And then you meet up with this car. And police cars are surrounding it and it is still trying to escape. Would you think it was hostile? If you do. That means guns drawn are warranted. Actually shooting still wouldn't be warranted until she tries to run you over. Which she did to a few officers.

       This is all bullshit.. Took a wrong turn? Lmao she knew what she was doing .. And she didn't get shot at until after she backed into a police car with fucking 10 cops around her telling her to get outta the vehicle ... She deserved what she got and you all can give me as many downvotes as you want .. She was the one running a barricade in front of the capital while it's already on lockdown .. She could of stopped then and got out of the car .. How many times have you watched cops and seen them kill a driver for using their vehicle as a weapon .. Just move on and remind yourself their are dumbass ppl out their just like this lady .. If I just ran through a barricade and had ten cops yelling at me to get outta the car i would, not try to run over ten of them

       It is not sensible to engage in a high speed chase with the police while you have a toddler in your car.

       If she had honestly made a mistake one would expect the reasonable and sensible thing to do would be to raise ones hands, let officers open the door and remove you form the car. Not speed away from armed police just after you have tried to illegally enter one of the most secure buildings in the world.

       Yes, I believe that this is what happened.  The police have been trained in such a way as to turn just about any situation into the worst possible scenario.  Living in a world driven by fear and loathing is no fun at all, and it is the world we live in.  The US Government has made sure of this.

       We can see much of what happens, but your statement that it's 100% obvious that the police are completely in the right is an exaggeration. It's very hard to judge the woman's intentions just from this video.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I can tell from the video for example, there's no major obvious damage from the front of the car that indicates that she was trying to force her way through the barrier. The police's narrative was that she was trying to ram through the barrier. That part of the story seems to be embellished a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there's enough info to make a reasonable judgement on this yet. Maybe the cops are in the right and maybe they're not, but I think your 100% statement is a bit much.

       That she made an unwise decision doesn't imply that the police are entirely in the right either.
      </p>
      <p>
       That area of DC has to have a lot of security cameras. I don't see how anybody could give a conclusive judgement on this incident without seeing more evidence of what happened just before and throughout this incident. There are multiple interpretations that fit the facts as we know them so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, at least one part of the police's narrative (that she was trying to ram through the gate) is demonstrable hyperbole as there is no obvious impact damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are lots of theories, but I just don't think anybody could reasonably make a solid claim here yet with the video that has been released. Maybe there are other videos yet to come out that bolster the police's case, and maybe not. I think anybody who is rushing to defend the police as doing their jobs 100% perfectly is operating prematurely on inconclusive information.

       It would be helpful if some more security camera footage would be revealed. She was supposedly trying to ram through the gate but there is no obvious damage on her car - that's a bit weird.

      <p>
       I'm not making a firm judgement either way. Anybody who is claiming that they know exactly what happened here isn't operating with full information.

       Probably very lost.  It's a confusing area and she wasn't familiar with it.  Who knows why she went there.  She also had an 18 month in the car and after a 4 hour ride I'm sure that was very stressful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her actions are consistent with lost and confused and then fleeing.  She was not aiming her car as a weapon as much as she was fleeing with reckless disregard for the officers.  If she had a death wish why didn't she jump out and charge the WH or do something similar?

       Well I found a way. I do not agree that the police were 100% in the right. What did she do? Hit a cop car in reverse? Then took off and then went around in a circle and then continued on? What makes the police 100% in the right? Because she turned her wheels and moved forward? I think it's more clear to see that if she had intended on harming someone or a police officer for that matter, she would have.

       She's black and guns were drawn. She probably immediately felt that her life was in danger and ran. That is absolutely the instinctual reaction when guns are drawn: run.

       I thought that initially at first too but as some other people have pointed out, you can still drive on flat tires, you just have a lot less control. But I still believe that just shooting to kill is NOT the best option at this point.

       I was thinking perhaps they should have deployed spikes at some point to slow her down/stop the car.  Once slowed/stopped, maybe deploy non-lethal tactics to subdue her, like some spray or tazer.  But nah, lets pump her full of lead with a kid in the car.  Lets not find out why she ran/panicked, just shoot her, hell, they probably got themselves a nice paid vacation for that.
       <br/>
       Fucking cops should always be ready to use non-lethal tactics before executing us citizens.

       The police are chasing her with their sirens on and she doesn't pull over. Her path is blocked by a police vehicle so she attempts a u turn to drive off in the direction she was coming from, but gets cut off by police in that direction. She attempts to inch past the police car blocking her, but the police car in front of her pulls forward. Police rush the car with guns drawn so she reverses into a police car and drives off through an open space between two police cars while the police open fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what happened, there is literally no other way to interpret the events and she was clearly evading the police.

       I'm not debating that she was attempting to flee. I'm debating whether or not the police were in the right for opening fire on a vehicle that had done little to no damage whatsoever, seconds after they observed an innocent child in the vehicle.

       What an idiotic reply. She spun the car around with no regard for the officers who were close to it. She could've easily ran one of them over. The only reason she didn't was because they quickly hopped out of the way. She then proceeded to speed off forcing them to jump out of the way to prevent being hit.

       That shows intent to harm or at the very least disregard for their lives.

       Those on motorcycles were civilians, you have no legal reason to stop for them when asked, a cop however has the right to make yous top your car. I don't know where I sit on the shooting, but comparing this to the Range Rover incident is like comparing apples to oranges.

       Again, it's all about subjectivity and intent.  This woman was already being pursued by police for hitting a barricade, at the White House, those 'bikers' seemed to have provoked that situation and may have actually caused the accident that led to their pursuit.  That's a pretty common insurance scam.  Those bikers were just dicks and clearly thought they owned the road and were driving recklessly.  I would be way more comfortable getting out of my car for gun wielding cops than I would for a couple of hundred ramped up adrenaline junkies with an axe to grind.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no reason for an innocent person to flee police the way she did for a minor traffic violation, so there has to be more to the story.

       Thanks for the insult. The officers were waving their guns around with no regard for the child in the car that they could clearly see. Not to mention then opened fire on a moving vehicle with a child inside. Yes, they quickly hopped out of the way, guess cars can't excel human speed and reaction capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said it was a conspiracy. Just because I replied to a post in r/conspiracy doesn't mean I automatically believe this is a full blown, cover up to come conspiracy. I'm merely questioning the actions of police officers in this exact situation in which we have video evidence of.

       Maybe she was mentally ill. Maybe she was just scared for her and her child's life and went into panic mode and took off, NOT injuring anyone.

       "waving their guns around with no regard for the child in the car that they could clearly see." How the hell can you know that? In a flurry of activity there is no way that is for certain.

      <p>
       "Yes, they quickly hopped out of the way, guess cars can't excel human speed and reaction capabilities." ... So you're saying that a human cannot possibly jump out of the way of a moving vehicle because cars excel human speed and reaction capabilities? Utter nonsense.
      </p>

       "Maybe she was just scarred for her and her child's life and went into panic mode and took off, NOT injuring anyone." The only reason she didn't injure anyone was good reflexes and blind luck.

       How can you honestly watch that video and come to a different conclusion?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't justify using a car as a weapon because some officers pulled a gun on you and issued you orders regardless whether you have a child in the car or not. Having a kid doesn't give you a run down anyone when you're afraid license.

       You are aware that LEOs are trained specifically to look over(at) the driver and the front seat, whereas the rest of the "unit" will look over the rear seating and floor, right? "Flurry of activity", Yes, them yelling at her and her sitting there for that 10 seconds is some seriously nerve wrecking activity.

       Thought I was clear on this one, guess not, I'll elaborate. If the woman had intended to injure or more specifically run over one of the LEO's, she would have, all it took was a bit more of the pedal on the right.

       That's the ONLY reason possible? Really? Why then, pray tell, did she not run them over when she turned around? Why didn't she ram right through the vehicle that blocked her on her first attempt to leave that area?

       She didn't use the car as a weapon. She used it as an escape vehicle in a situation where her and her child's life was in danger.

       Why didn't she do this? Why didn't she do that then? She must've been afraid. She didn't use the car as a weapon. If she did she would've hurt more. The officers are trained to do this a certain way so they must've done it that way. = Speculation

       = Speculation /  MSM Lines that you are repeating without any further evidence. They also said that the completely totaled Police Cruiser was a direct cause of this woman too, but turns out the cop didn't see a barricade and rammed right over/through it, causing the damage all by himself.

       She may have made a bad move and endangered her and her child's life by driving away at that point, I won't argue that it wasn't STUPID but to say someone is justified in being shot for doing so is ludicracy.

      <p>
       A person who acts recklessly with a car is just as dangerous as a person acting recklessly with a gun. If you then proceed to ignore police orders, nearly hit them with your car while fleeing or trying to hit them intentionally (either one) the police are well within their rights to use force to defend themselves and the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       She instigated the force when she refused to leave the vehicle and took off.

       Driving aggressively is not synonymous with driving recklessly, by law at least.

       Yes yes yes, how many times must I tell you I agree that she was fleeing, she
       <strong>
        DID drive at and or towards officers whom had surrounded her vehicle

       I also would like to point out, they immediately surround her car with people instead of the rest of their cruisers. I feel like if that happened, she never would have been able to leave that spot and this whole ordeal never would have escalated to someone's life being lost. This is of course nothing more than opinion.

       A human being scared for their life and the life of their child is more than enough reason to do uncharacteristic and admittedly stupid things. Again, not saying this
       <em>
        justifies
       </em>
       doing the things she did, it still doesn't justify shooting her dead.

       I didn't see gun waving, I saw officers assessing a threat and letting the suspect know that their best option is to get out of the car, now. But she didn't, she forced her way out of the barricade almost hitting officers in the process, she then sped around the round about twice and took off all the while being pursued.  Not the actions of someone who is stable and not a threat to others (including her own child).
      </p>
      <p>
       I abhor actual incidents of police brutality, where an officer uses their power to physically or otherwise harm a citizen who is innocent of wrongdoing.  I also abhor when every time police have to do their job, people immediately cry brutality.  YOU go out there and deal with the threats that exist in the world today and let's see how good your decision making skills are when faced with reducing the threat to yourself and the other citizens you've sworn to protect.  You have seconds to assess and react, and sometimes they get it wrong and sometimes they save lives, lots of them.

       To respond to your statement though, "not the actions of someone who is stable and not a threat to others (including her own child). " is speculation.

       Do you have a child? If you do, have you ever been in a situation where that child had a gun pointed in their general direction and YOU had to react within seconds to avoid you or your child being killed, even by accident?

       I do have a child and I know what a REAL threat to my child is. There is no benefit of the doubt for this woman in particular though.  She was an educated woman, who had a sister who was a staff sergeant with NYPD.  She was more than aware of proper protocol when being approached by officers.  This was mental illness, and as long as she is in a two ton, motorized weapon, SHE is the threat and given her evasive action, there was no opportunity for officers to try and reason with her. She was a threat to herself and everyone in the vicinity including her child. No one knows why she made the trip from CT to Washington with a one year old, accounts are she really had no reason to be there, so as facts emerge, it is very questionable what her motives were.  But ya, the police who put themselves in harms way to protect everyone else, they're the bad guys for sure and should be totally chastised by the public for doing their job.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are looking for an ACTUAL example of police unnecessarily using their weapons, here is a great one:
       <a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iy2zsuRyjaQ&amp;amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Diy2zsuRyjaQ">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably also mental health, but he was alone on that streetcar when he was shot 9 times and then tazed. At the time he was shot he was only a threat to himself, (not like the woman who was in a vehicle) police didn't waste time on talking to him or using other non-lethal means of diffusing the situation, the officer just unloaded his clip.
      </p>
      <p>
       The officer has been charged, and this is a great article on how other officers didn't automatically jump to his defence, they knew it was wrong but the challenge now is to prove that the officer intended to kill the young man or he reasonably felt that he was in danger.

       But that doesn't happen without a reason. When the cops do a good job, very little is said. That's not fair to them, but these types of situations are not the rule, they are the exception. So to write these off as 'sometimes they make mistakes' isn't good enough; sometimes the police DO participate in brutality and lethal force when it's not necessary... and nothing happens. This is what sparks the outrage. We need to start holding police officers accountable for situations like this so there is an impetus for change. While there may have been some small danger to the police at one point in the altercation, by the time they chose to kill her I don't think the same could be said.

       It's all about intent and proving that intent.  In the video she was already being pursued by police for having tried to ram a security gate, the video starts when she was trying to evade them and was barricaded by cruisers.  The video shows her intent to evade, and her willingness to harm anyone who might be stupid enough to get in her way.  There is really no reason to be trying to evade police, in the middle of the day, with a one year old in the car, in front if the white house. I find the mama bear protecting her cub theory in response to the officers guns highly implausible because she would have created the threat to the public to have police chasing her in the first place.   If it was a simple traffic violation, why would you flee?  As a mother protecting my kid, I know that is a way more dangerous option.

       Well, I don't disagree with that.  I agree fear does rule the day and although there are some shady law enforcement out there it must also be a terrifying job right now with the climate of the world.  Bombs going off at marathons, shootings at schools, shootings not far from the white house just a few weeks ago.  Her actions would have been seen as a huge threat and there are pieces of the story missing. What is the bone of contention is people justifying her actions in the video.  If that video is all you had to base things on, with no other details, it doesn't make a strong case for her.

       All of those incidents are shady and the exception to the rule. All had unanswered questions and misaligned facts. You are right in that we don't know how great or little a threat she was, but she was unarmed and I really don't think she had to die. We could have found out what was going on, but she is dead. We'll never know; we'll be told by those who now have something to hide if she wasn't exactly who they thought she was. That's whats frustrating...
      </p>
      <p>
       And frankly, 'scared' police officers is not an excuse. If I was a police officer that was scared to come to work each day, I probably shouldn't be a police officer. We had the same thing here in Canada; some dude from Poland got caught in the airport and didn't know what was going on and he ended up very frustrated and threw a chair and computer monitor at some officers trying to calm him down. They ended up tazing him multiple times and he died. Those officers are now being charged but they are also being protected. Just because you are an authority does not give you carte blanche to make whatever mistake you want because you were 'scared'. Scared police officers make things more dangerous for everybody, and not everyone who's a cop should be. That's how I feel.

       I'm not justifying them, but I am questioning what would make her act this way. I don't see malicious intent towards the police tho... I see somebody not listening to authority. I don't feel that failure to comply should enable the use of deadly force. She was unarmed and she didn't try to kill anybody (in fact, one of the police officers injuries were due to themselves crashing into a barrier... the other was knocked out by an airbag deployment). If we had a dead or paralyzed officer here, i'd maybe understand, but we don't. That's the problem. She died for freaking out and panicking. I don't see how people can claim she was trying to kill police officers or 'smash into the white house' from the same video you say is so conclusive. She was trying to get away, but we don't know why. That was the only crime there.

       The first time I watched it on the news, I thought the windows were blacked out. Watching this made me realize that the police could clearly see into the car, and see the child. At that point the option of pulling hand guns and firing at the moving vehicle comes off the table. It then becomes a hostage situation. They clearly overreacted. She probably did have mental issues, but that not grounds for execution and it's a wonder that the child wasn't killed as well.

       Exactly. Even for a black person who gets shit on. You run, you are for sure going to die. Give yourself up, you might get fucked in the end, but you'll be alive. Nothing this woman did was remotely rational.

       Yea. If she had gotten out and put her hands up, "I'm sorry, this is a mistake," if the cops shot her at that point, yea that'd be fucked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       But she backs into them and tries to run away. It was probably a mistake on her part, but it's a pretty major one and I can see how cops would open fire; she could have pinned one of them against her car and killed them.

       The fact that police waited as long as they did to open fire is almost surprising. The cops and civilians were obviously in danger from her blatant aggressive driving (as seen when the cops are forced to jump out of the way multiple times). Her disregard to stand down when multiple policemen are aiming right at her only shows she knows she's in the wrong, sure, guns are being pointed at her, but they are policemen in the capital of our nation, not some gang trying to jack your car. She then drove in that circle to obviously buy a little time and scope out her options easier.

       This thread is lucky she didn't injure someone because you'd have no argument.

       They shot up two of their own pretty good, and this proves that the police gunfire was by far the more dangerous dimension of what went down that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       If just one of those cops had stayed in his vehicle to use it to block her from driving away, instead of jumping out with his gun to point it at her, then it would have likely all ended right there, but not one single cop had the presence of mind to think of this!
      </p>
      <p>
       The cop car that was so totally destroyed was due to the cop driving it going straight into a barricade all by himself - he obviously didn't even see it in time to avoid it.

        what if she had injured somebody?

       Yeh. But... this is actually a good point. The cops were shooting defensively. In salvos. At the driver. Just think, the kid didn't get shot. The tires didn't? get shot. Bystanders and officers didn't get shot. ?right?

       The video shows the car, stopped, surrounded by cops with guns.  If I made a wrong turn, and somehow ended up somewhere I shouldn't to the point cops had to surround my car, my hands would be up, and I'd do what I was told.  I WOULD NOT flip the car in reverse, ram a cop car and try to flee while MANY guns were pointed at me.  Far more to the story than a simple wrong turn, or the lady was lost.

       I don't think anyone thinks killing the woman was a good idea.  From what information is out there, it looks like a situation that escalated quickly and badly, and probably could have been prevented.  It's tragic.  Just like with plane crashes, it's usually a sequence of mistakes that lead to catastrophe, not an isolated slip-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things are touchy around the White House and the Capitol in general.  If you've ever driven around there, you'll know what I mean.  I got lost in DC in a U-Haul truck, and I had a Crown Vic tailing me as soon as I was within a few blocks of the White House.  And that was in the '90s...
      </p>
      <p>
       So you've got a lady who's driving in that area, and maybe she fucks up and hits a fence.  No big deal.  Cops tail her and she takes off.  Okay, now everyone's got a little adrenaline going.  Then we see what happens in the video.  Cops with guns out brings the adrenaline higher.  Driver doing a 3-point into a cop car pushes it even higher again.  And on and on until tragedy occurs.  It's a fucked situation that
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       involved pushed over the edge.

       I don't see how making up a story about this woman taking her kid to school and getting lost is helpful.
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       seems to be a counter-balance by fetishizing doom and violence in a
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       way from the mainstream media.  To me, a true counter-balance would be political activism, as opposed to internet slacktivism.  Protests, vigils, and awareness raising campaigns immediately come to mind.

       It's scary how the news reporter is trying to justify it... By saying that the shots were fired after the car impacted the police cruiser, causing the airbags to deploy injuring the officer... So the airbags go off, it's ok to shoot the person that hit you? Man that makes road rage look weak.

       This is what I don't get... when did a hit and run demand the death penalty in return? Especially when the person is driving away from you when you actually kill them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of me wonders if this was one of those situations where she was in some sort of shadowy tight spot where she didn't trust the police for whatever reason... Guess we'll never know for sure
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: saw this quote in the NY times story
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What occurred next was not clear. Ms. Carey managed to get out of the car, and was shot by several officers. According to a law enforcement official, she was not armed, and it was not known whether she presented an immediate danger.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So she was more or less executed? Am I missing something here? Also, a better video is going around that shows at least one of the police crashes/injuries was caused by the police car itself crashing into a barrier on its own accord. All I can say is poor kid...

       I gotta agree. Watch the video. She backs into their car. The situation was tense, but I bet if she  had surrendered, she would have just gotten arrested. If it was a mistake of a wrong turn, you could clear it up at that point. Reasonable people don't back into cop cars and try to run.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe she was just dumb? Well, that's a tragedy. Her parents and community should have taught her to not be a fucking idiot.

       I'm brown. I'm asian. I've been pulled over by the cops before in America. I've had a cop drive up around me and some friends and we had out BB-guns, fireworks and beer out. I kept my cool. I knew my rights. I asked if we were free to go. I got lucky without having a hot-head cop.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know they go insane sometimes. I've taken video of them illegally searching black people across thee street from where I lived in Ohio.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying, judging from this video, this girl was the problem in the situation. Maybe something happened before the part we saw which led her to believe the cops weren't going to be reasonable. But there's no evidence of that. From what we see, every decision she made was dangerous, insane and endangered her life, the cops life and the life of her child.

       I guess all the eye-witness accounts of her driving incredibly erratically were made-up. Or maybe when she tried to ram the gates, AFTER evading police by smashing their cars, that was just a wrong-turn too.

       Nope. You're gonna try to tell me a mothers survival instinct when being chased by multiple police cars and told to stand down at gun point, all in the nations capital, was to just blatantly and obviously threaten the lives of the police officers, not to mention her and her child's life, with more aggressive driving?

       There aren't?  Maybe we're just in different universes.  Over here, in mine, we don't freak out and gun down people in front of their children, no matter how confused they may be at the time.  I guess we're just different in that way.

       I heard on the radio last night from a caller who claimed to have a friend who works for the Secret Service that what began this whole thing was the woman telling the officers at the checkpoint that she had to speak with Obama.  They asked her if she had an appointment with the White House and she said No but that Obama needs to finally see her child. (The woman was claiming that the infant with her was, in fact, Obama's kid).  She then blew past the checkpoint and the pursuit began.  I don't know how legitimate this is but I believe this is why the media was saying she was mentally unstable right away before they could even give any information about the woman (as they knew nothing about her yet).

       I definitely don't think that the kid was actually Obama's, but I don't doubt that she said that.  Evidently she believed that Obama was stalking her (according to MSM reports).  It's also a little weird that the police shot and killed her after her car was already wrecked and she was no longer in her vehicle.  When she was driving towards the cops I could see that being a justified shooting as her car was a deadly weapon but once her car is out of the picture they could have made a normal arrest.

       As far as how the shooting went down there were enough witnesses/cameras around that we do know she wrecked her car and got out before the police shot her.  The first time they opened fire when they had her blocked between the barricade and a police car and she rammed the car and then drove thru the officers would have been a righteous shooting.  The fatal shooting was a bit sketchy.  After 9-11 the laws (courtesy of the patriot act) for what constitutes a "legal police shooting" changed in areas within close proximity to the president though so I suppose technically so long as the president is within a certain distance they can pretty much pick off anyone they believe to be a threat, armed or not.  Legal and right are two different things though in cases like this.

       You know this story has turned out to be a great propaganda tool for our potential upcoming police state.  The message I got from the government is: "Mess with us and we're not afraid to kill innocent mothers in front of their 1 year-old daughters..."

       Toddlers don't go to school. And people who aren't working rarely have child care. Though I don't understand how an out of work dental hygienist could have such an expensive car.

       They didn't shoot her because she was using the car as a weapon. If they were going to shoot her for that, they would have shot her when she hit the officers with her car. They shot at her because she tried to get away.

       Ridiculous. She ran from the cops hitting 80 mph in a crowded downtown area, AFTER trying to crash the barricade at the White House. Maybe it was an accident, sure. But running from the police is fucking stupid, especially after you just posed a threat to the safety of the of the President AND hit a cop with your car. He death is the result of her own shitty decisions. That's a fact. That she "took a wrong turn" is pure speculation, and capitol police don't take kindly to you hit and running one of their own.

       That's a big assumption and also is a horrible argument. It has nothing to do with this situation. Cop turns on his or her lights, you stop. You be polite. You can explain "I made a wrong turn." Even most illegal immigrants can get real licenses (depends on your state, but they could get them when I lived in TN).

       So, attempting to run someone over is not legal either, and a car can be considered a deadly weapon. Execution implies the victim/suspect is detained/helpless.

       You are the one splitting hairs, speculating on reasons that its okay to run away.  The officers chased this crazy woman around Washington DC.  When she tried to run the officers over, they responded in kind.  A  kid lost their mom because her mom was an idiot.

       I'm saying that society has become to soft... To make one group happy you piss another off and someone is always going to be pissed. 
About that "original thought"
thing... We are here in r/conspiracy and talking about an issue that should be a mute point. I have been a member of this sub for close to 2 years and if I've learned anything; I would say this whole thing is a diversion. There is something much bigger and more important going on somewhere else and we are distracted.

       Yeah, we've all seen how reliable police testimony is, how they never lie, or classify "resisting" as twitching on the ground with thousands of volts pulsing through ya, or trying to cover your face as they bash your head in with batons and sick dogs on your neck.

       Are you a parent?  If I was looking at multiple men aiming guns at the car I was driving that my son was in, I'm not sure what I would do.  Reminds me a lot of the story this week about a man that got dragged out of the vehicle that was carrying his wife and child and pummeled by a group of raging bikers.

       I'd be concerned for my family in both cases as well.  I would have gone the same route as the Range Rover driver, because I would probably wager that it's safer for me to drive away from an angry bike gang that stay put.

       But police officers at the White House?  I would think most people realize that stopping the car is the safest thing to do.

       I agree.  It is tragic.  A toddler watched their mother be shot to death and dragged from a car.  It is not my place to assign blame but I can hardly think of this as an act of heroism.

       This subreddit is always good for a laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       A video showing an erratic and clearly mentally unstable driver refusing to stop for police officers, and then proceeding to flee without regard for the safety of the officers, citizens or the child in her car is somehow proof of police brutality?She then proceeded to lead officers on a chase until they were able to stop her and prevent who knows what from happening. Her having a child in the car does not suddenly make her innocuous or less of a threat.  People do terrible things to children everyday, why is everyone jumping to the conclusion that the police acted wrongly and not to the conclusion that perhaps she was the one to be feared.  With the navy yard incident just weeks ago, it shouldn't be surprising that someone who almost crashed through a security gate at the Capitol would be scene as an immediate threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can go ahead and paint the poor, immigrant mother with a child was 'executed' picture all you like, I'd like to wait for the facts before crying conspiracy.

       There was more than mockery in that post, and I wouldn't call it mockery, just a general exasperation for people not being able to apply critical thinking and look at things objectively, consider all the facts or possible scenarios before jumping to a conclusion and labelling something. It's funny how people in a thread can all see the same video and see entirely different things.  Some see what fits into the story they want to tell, what their frame of reference allows them to see, and others see it for what it is.

       "waving their guns around with no regard for the child in the car that they could clearly see." How the hell can you know that? In a flurry of activity there is no way that is for certain.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Yes, they quickly hopped out of the way, guess cars can't excel human speed and reaction capabilities." ... So you're saying that a human cannot possibly jump out of the way of a moving vehicle because cars excel human speed and reaction capabilities? Utter nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Maybe she was just scarred for her and her child's life and went into panic mode and took off, NOT injuring anyone." The only reason she didn't injure anyone was good reflexes and blind luck.

       How can you honestly watch that video and come to a different conclusion?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't justify using a car as a weapon because some officers pulled a gun on you and issued you orders regardless whether you have a child in the car or not. Having a kid doesn't give you a run down anyone when you're afraid license.

       Why didn't she do this? Why didn't she do that then? She must've been afraid. She didn't use the car as a weapon. If she did she would've hurt more. The officers are trained to do this a certain way so they must've done it that way. = Speculation

       Video footage of the lady ignoring repeated police orders to stop, narrowly avoiding hitting officers with her car. Officers having to jump out of the way of the vehicle. Proceeds to then flee the scene.

      <p>
       Previously had rammed and passed through a barrier, hit another police officer before said footage was shot. = What actually happened.

      <p>
       Her motivations are unknown at this point, but the police have the right to defend their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also just a final note, the situation only threatened her childs life after she escalated it by nearly running down the officers, regardless if this was intentional or not. The officers didn't start shooting on sight.

       I didn't see gun waving, I saw officers assessing a threat and letting the suspect know that their best option is to get out of the car, now. But she didn't, she forced her way out of the barricade almost hitting officers in the process, she then sped around the round about twice and took off all the while being pursued.  Not the actions of someone who is stable and not a threat to others (including her own child).
      </p>
      <p>
       I abhor actual incidents of police brutality, where an officer uses their power to physically or otherwise harm a citizen who is innocent of wrongdoing.  I also abhor when every time police have to do their job, people immediately cry brutality.  YOU go out there and deal with the threats that exist in the world today and let's see how good your decision making skills are when faced with reducing the threat to yourself and the other citizens you've sworn to protect.  You have seconds to assess and react, and sometimes they get it wrong and sometimes they save lives, lots of them.

       Driving aggressively is not synonymous with driving recklessly, by law at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes yes yes, how many times must I tell you I agree that she was fleeing, she
       <strong>
        DID drive at and or towards officers whom had surrounded her vehicle
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I also would like to point out, they immediately surround her car with people instead of the rest of their cruisers. I feel like if that happened, she never would have been able to leave that spot and this whole ordeal never would have escalated to someone's life being lost. This is of course nothing more than opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       A human being scared for their life and the life of their child is more than enough reason to do uncharacteristic and admittedly stupid things. Again, not saying this
       <em>
        justifies
       </em>
       doing the things she did, it still doesn't justify shooting her dead.
