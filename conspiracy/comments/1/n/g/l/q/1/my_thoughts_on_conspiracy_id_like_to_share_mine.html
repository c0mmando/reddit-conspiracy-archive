        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, let me start off by saying this is one of my favorite subreddits. We all know why we love it. I won&#39;t go into detail, but I just wanted to start off by saying I love this sub.</p>

<p>Conspiracies are awesome, in a peculiar way. It is a sad and horrible thing that men and women alike, using their places in power and institutions to pull the wool over the general public&#39;s eyes and hide the truth to achieve their agenda. I hate that they happen, but I love the fact that so many people refuse to accept the given truth as reality, and question its foundation. If you aren&#39;t questioning the information put in front of you, then why bother doing anything. The moment anyone starts to accept what is the accepted truth is the moment that you should stop using your mind to think. Just go ahead and follow the masses. I&#39;m not going to sit here and droll on about platitudes about conspiracy, but I&#39;ve been noticing a trend among conspiracy theorists and the like (on reddit and in real life). I want to address that.</p>

<p>You should question everything. More often that not, I see people just questioning those in power. I see threads about the government, charitable organizations, corporations, and the like. I see links to other message boards and blogs about how someone has uncovered the truth behind a certain group&#39;s actions. That&#39;s awesome. However, that is inherently a problem. Too many people want the conspiracy to be real, and in turn, easily believe any muse or rambling from any source regardless of if facts exist. Just because you read a quote on a message board by someone who claims to have been there when a certain event happens, does not make them more reputable than another source. The point of all of us questioning the norm is not for us to readily believe anyone who is showing any half-truth as to what the real facts are involving a matter we believe to be a conspiracy. We are supposed to uncover the truth. Every time you find a hidden article revealing some reality to a certain event, you have to question that article as well. Too many people want to believe that something is wrong, evil, or a certain way, and will present &quot;facts&quot; that are more ambiguous and politically spun garbage than the original source.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m trying to say is that we should question everything. If I am to believe that a certain institution is trying to cover up the truth behind an event, then when I read information supporting that assumption, I cannot believe them because I want it to be true. I must be as scrupulous on their information as I was on the original information I was told about the institution. Everything has to be questioned, and not just what I believe to be a conspiracy. Too many times I will read a post about how &quot;XXXX is a lie, here is the truth&quot; and that truth will take me to a source which relies on anonymous accounts of an event, or someone giving me information on what happens when X happens, without providing real truth on the matter. If you&#39;re telling me that XXX smells like banana peels when it explodes, provide me with a source for that. Don&#39;t show me that some ass said that on a message board. Don&#39;t link me to an anonymous source. I&#39;m looking for the truth, and I&#39;m sure a lot of other people are also looking for it. Don&#39;t let your own agenda interfere with the ultimate goal of exploring what is and what isn&#39;t the truth. I come into every thread with the idea that either side could be true. No one needs to be given information that has a predetermined viewpoint on the matter, that is then reinforced by your opinion on the matter, in which none of the presented information can be confirmed in any way. I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t hypothesize and you can&#39;t make assumptions, but just don&#39;t present something as the truth or as fact if you have no way of proving it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how I feel. I&#39;d love to see how other people feel about conspiracies and their discussion. As always, question everything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with this is at some point you&#39;d have to believe something, if you are going so far as to believe what popular opinion is wrong then you have no way to determine what is correct. Every conspiracy here could be just misinformation for all we know and I could be mad. My eye&#39;s could be deceiving me, my mind could be overlooking certain facts. How can we know? So being practical, I think there should only be basics of basics which we can 100% say is correct because without it there aren&#39;t many reasons to go on. </p>

<p>In my opinion, the core belief should be that there is something wrong with this world. Why? Because we obviously aren&#39;t happy. If we were satisfied with the world, then it means everything is as it should be. But then it makes sense to contemplate the question are humans supposed to be happy? Well it&#39;s a difficult question. I think for the majority of humans in this planet are, we obviously always strive for it at least, all of us are always trying to aim for that ideal of the car, the house and money so that we can be entertained. We all strive for happiness in some form or another.Then why are we so critically unhappy even if we get these things? When did the human species become sacrifice at all costs so that we can climb up the social ladder or get shiny bits of metal that everyone covets? When did the costs, environment or social costs become more and more acceptable if it meant we get things we don&#39;t need? </p>

<p><strong>Indoctrination</strong>. We were TOLD we needed to go to school, we were TOLD we needed to live life on a clock, we were TOLD to eat foods that damaged our bodies and are probably worse than what we had centuries before. Could we honestly say that our life style have improved? In some ways, yes, medicine for example have done wonders to lengthen our life span. Security from predators and dangers that our hunter gather origins had faced are almost gone. But does this mean anything if our quality of life is worse? We are being constantly prodded by society to always move, always work, always exceed. If you don&#39;t, you are some kind of failure. Inadequacies built in by media, is it fair that we are held to some impossible standards to live in? I mean unless you are the super rich, our lives are centered around a constant timeline, you follow this timeline until you die. How is this more different than from being a machine? Obviously I am not disputing that learning and hard work isn&#39;t important, to achieve any kind of mastery in life you need both. But this fictitious idea of living your life in time doesn&#39;t make much sense, in a way time doesn&#39;t even exist, the cliche line &quot;you live in the present&quot; is still true. But we live our life in the future, we work so we can get money at a later date rather than because you enjoy what you are doing in the present. Will you be happy in the future? How are you sure? What in the past has shown this to be true? Were you ever fully satisfied for more than the time it took you to spend your money? So then what is society based upon? </p>

<p><strong>Addiction</strong> Like a heroin junkie looking for his next fix, we live our lives constantly thinking about how great it&#39;s going to be once we have that car we always wanted, that house you just passed by and the sexy girl you saw in a club. That is how society works, they give us crack in the form of TV, they give us cocaine in the form of video games, they give us alcohol so we can get wasted and they measure women by their looks so that women will pay ridiculous sums of money to look a shade more beautiful by THEIR standards. But are these intrinsically human qualities? NO. So where has this mass lunacy come from, why has this hallucination taken hold in our brains? </p>

<p><strong>The rich</strong>. Isn&#39;t it strange that while everyone else scrambles to meet to these impossible standards, apart from the few lucky ones blessed with good genetics, the super elite as it were, there exists dynasties of families who seem to be living life without worries. They can get whatever they want, without working, without enhancing mankind and maybe detrimental to mankind. How do these people keep everyone in line? How do they get you to cut their grass, drive their cars and build their mansions? </p>

<p><strong>Money</strong>. But what is money to the average human being? From the dawn of mankind, was money a necessity, was it part of your genetic code? Would you have died if you did not have money? Could you not just survive off the land itself? NO. So then why does it have so much control over us, if it doesn&#39;t seem to hold any intrinsic value to the average person? Sure it has value to the rich, they can do whatever they want with it. While we ration between providing for our families and entertainment which has no long lasting value to us. But so why does it have control of us? </p>

<p><strong>Power</strong>. Money is power. Power over all other humans, with enough money you can buy anything physical, you go down to your store you have the power to buy a packet of cigarettes, a steak if you wanted. You go to a person you can even buy their time, they will work for you depending on how much you give them. But in all of these things, another human being can refuse, they can steal, they can burn the piece of papers. Why they don&#39;t do this? </p>

<p><strong>Government</strong>. They uphold the currency. They do not work for the common people. That is a fallacy, if a person can lose his house because of medical bills to the bank and the government won&#39;t defend them, but a rich guy get&#39;s his Rolex stolen the government will defend them, who are they working for? Obviously its the rich. The system is a game, we all play for piece of the pie while most of the pie is in the hands of the rich. It&#39;s unnecessarily cruel, but arguably fair? NO. </p>

<p><strong>Corruption</strong>. If the game was fair, the concentration of wealth would be evenly distributed. if it was all about chance there is no way only a fraction of a fraction of people would own such a big portion of everything there is to be had. You could argue these men were just smarter and they can systematically play the game better than the average human being. But does that account for the massive wealth gap? NO. </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>tldr;</strong> They beat the game by artificially keeping everyone else down, it&#39;s not that they are the best, it&#39;s just that we have been <strong>Indoctrinated</strong> to run in a rat wheel so that we can satisfy our <strong>addiction</strong> while <strong>the rich</strong> get our generated power in the form of <strong>money</strong> which also gives them <strong>power</strong> over us and this system is protected by the <strong>government</strong> so that we are held down by this <strong>corrupt</strong> system. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my big conspiracy, it&#39;s obvious, everyone can see it, everyone has felt it, but we are powerless to stop it. We are addicts and we are comfortable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man, I&#39;m humbled by the fact I have read/watched/listened to great people who have articulated better than I ever could. The first step (which is where I am at) is trying to find enlightenment, we cling to our realities too much to ever fully understand the truth. If you are interested just listen to some of Alan Watts lectures, I have no doubt in my mind what he says is truth, it&#39;s so profound and resonates with every feeling I&#39;ve ever had. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qptyt0-S9U">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qptyt0-S9U</a></p>

<p>This one is pretty profound to find out what is truth, you don&#39;t have to seek right action, you already know every truth within yourself because the only truth that matters is what you believe to be right and wrong. Every brain cell in your body already knows the correct answer, the only reason there is internal conflict is because you are lying to yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I am tired of it. That&#39;s part of it. I&#39;m having a bigger problem with people being inflexible with discussion in the comments. Often, I&#39;ll see information presented and if its questioned, they become insufferable. If you make a claim, and that claim is challenged, people start attacking. </p>

<p>For example. If I post saying that &quot;UPS is manipulating shipping to control black market organs.&quot;, and you come in and ask questions and propose an alternate theory, not only will I attack you, but others will chastise and dismiss your opinion because it doesn&#39;t fit with the typical conspiracy viewpoint. I believe that it should be an open discussion with presenting of actual information, rather than mysterious and anonymous &quot;facts&quot; taken as truth and without the possibility of disagreement. I&#39;ve seen far too many threads where a user makes a post, the information is shaky at best and when a use comes in to present an alternate view, they are dismissed for going against the perceived conspiracy theorist view. I know you have seen examples of this as well. It didn&#39;t happen every tune, but it happens enough that it prevents actual pursuit of knowledge.</p>

<p>We should all be pursuing the truth, regardless of it is what we want to be true or not. Too many people refuse to accept a view because it isn&#39;t what they want to or already believe. </p>

<p>I hope that clears that up, i&#39;m at work so I can&#39;t keep pudding right now...had to make it quick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wanted to post some clarity. I didn&#39;t make it too clear as to what exactly I meant, so I&#39;ll just add on here.</p>

<p>I was never trying to say that eye witness accounts of whistleblowers should be discredited or ignored. What I wanted to say is that if you present information involving an anonymous source, and the provider of that anonymous source is an internet forum, how am I expected to give any credibility to that? I can go make an account on any forum and post any claim I want. I can&#39;t give any credence to a source that is literally just someone posting on a message board. That is the equivalent of me posting on reddit and giving you &quot;facts&quot; or &quot;eye-witness&quot; accounts of an event. That&#39;s not legitimate.</p>

<p>As far as people commenting about proving something as fact/demanding proof, etc...</p>

<p>I never meant that everyone should be forced to prove their statement as 100% fact. I also didn&#39;t intend for it to be taken as &quot;if you don&#39;t provide all the proof, I won&#39;t believe you.&quot; I just grow tired of comments, topics, and any other kind of post where a user makes a claim, and in that claim present it as a truth, and that truth is far from being a truth. Yes, many of us are smart enough to realize when something is true, plausible, or just an assumption. However, there are people that haven&#39;t scoured the internet and the media looking for the truth and to uncover a conspiracy. If we can improve the way we present our information, we can help others better understand a conspiracy and what is truly going on. That&#39;s the first step to end a lot of conspiracies. Knowledge is power. The more light shed on corruption, the more likely it becomes that it can be fixed. If we all go around acting like conspiracy nuts, making asinine claims and presenting possible truths as gospel, it not only influences are own subreddit population, but negatively influences any possible visitor. As far as I&#39;m concerned, we aren&#39;t here just for discussion among ourselves, but to provide an outlet for others to gain insight to the truth.</p>

<p>To summarize: Yes, make accusations. Question everything. However, keep in mind that not everyone who reads your thread/comment has read every other thread and comment that you have. They haven&#39;t followed every link and uncovered every shred of possible information. You could very well be presenting information that is 100% accurate, but if someone hasn&#39;t read the &quot;prerequisite courses&quot; for your conspiracy lesson, they will be lost, confused, or even dismissive of your thought. If you believe it to be fact, call it a fact. But be prepared, go ahead and provide what you&#39;re using as your sources. I shouldn&#39;t be forced, nor should anyone else, to try and prove your truth for you. I&#39;m not saying that this happens every time, but people frequently post a conspiracy in which they claim to have proof, and that proof boils down to nothing - either by being untrustworthy information from a message board post, or an anonymous internet source, or an eye-witness account in which I can&#39;t find a recording/writing providing it. And when that &quot;proof&quot; is questioned, people dismiss the question, and I believe its based solely on the fact they are disagreeing with the general consensus of the conspiracy community. </p>

<p>I hope that clears up my stance. I&#39;m on my phone at work so I couldn&#39;t get too into it, but I think that shores up my idea. </p>
