    <div class="md"><p>Some people stretch to conclusions. We have the best military of all time. The greatest spying agency of all time. Billions spent on DEA, billions spent on policing. Black budgets. The spying is not only domestic, but foreign as well. But the word tragedy is used more than anything else, and terrible, stoppable things are still happening. We (some) just try to follow the money flow. Names, dates. Everything i do is recorded, but I should have nothing to hide. And then I&#39;m told things are classified information, I believe they should have nothing to hide. I&#39;m told statements with no information. Classified is synonymous with illegal, if you disagree show me one example of declassified information that isn&#39;t someone doing something really shitty. Anytime I&#39;m told something from the government, telling me something and that they care about me and my fellow citizens, and its RELENTLESS, something is up. There are billions spent on keeping drugs off the streets, but if you go to your local high school you can find any drugs you would want. And drugs still make it into prisons, supposedly a highly secure areas. And if you&#39;re caught with drugs in prison, you stay there longer. Just because the names and companies change, doesn&#39;t mean the game has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is like trying to say that a particular puzzle piece is from the wrong puzzle because it doesn&#39;t fit the part that you are working on. Granted, there are plenty of bullshit puzzle pieces being thrown in here by TPTB, trolls, and ignorant people. The challenge is to distinguish the specific instances and point them out so we can work toward a common solution. I see this place as a pool of knowledge to come to and try to find the pieces that are missing to my own puzzles, and to share what I have learned with others. So join us, shoot down the bullshit, build your own puzzles and come back with a clearer picture to help the rest of us solve what we&#39;re working on and together, maybe we can turn things around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing: over the past 50 years, the majority of &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; where information finally came out, turned out to actually <em>be</em> conspiracies. Whether it&#39;s Jonestown, MK-ULTRA, Project Blue Book as a disinformation campaign, the Gulf of Tonkin, the &#39;92 WTC bombing, even fucking Pearl Harbor. (And these are just off the top of my head.)</p>

<p>Superimpose that into the modern world where the government has to have hearings to decide if some government official&#39;s breakfast is a State Secret, and you have a lot of people who don&#39;t trust anything the government says...</p>

<p>Now couple that with the shady, practically laughable situations surrounding 9/11, 7/7, the NSA spying that some of us have been talking about for 20 years, and let&#39;s just say the argument that there <em>isn&#39;t</em> a conspiracy behind every closed government door starts to look a little &quot;retarded.&quot;</p>

<p>I personally can&#39;t think of the last time something truly tragic happened in this country that wasn&#39;t an &quot;act of god&quot; that wasn&#39;t suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you even post this....unless..... -_- </p>

<p>You&#39;re posting this in a effort to get people to think &quot;Oh yeah, maybe everything ISN&#39;T a conspiracy&quot;. </p>

<p>Once you have planted this seed, you will make more posts poorly disproving previous theories with poor photoshop skills and fake scientific sites registered with the web host under one of your relative&#39;s names, originating from the same ISP as your own, in your home town. Eventually, you will have wiped all conspiracy thoughts off the internet.</p>

<p>You&#39;re end game?</p>

<p>You want to be the only person to come up with new conspiracy theories that are much less scary than the real ones we post about here (Operation Northwoods, for instance). Things like &quot;Steve from blues clues was using his &quot;clues&quot; to send encrypted messages to prison inmates who were in his organized crime ring telling them to snuff out opposing gang&#39;s drug lords so he could expand his own territory&quot; and stuff.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on to you....-_-</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the ability to separate empirical reality from the indoctrination we&#39;re all a victim of is an essential component for a thinking man in the 21st century. Many people point to history as a reliable foundation upon which to build their world view and I don&#39;t necessarily discount the usefulness of it, however, there are 2 major caveats one must be aware of... </p>

<ol>
<li>History is written by the winners.</li>
<li>There is no historical context whatsoever the level of instant information and communication that nearly every human being on the planet has access to.</li>
</ol>

<p>I was tempted to say more regarding the use of fear as a method of control and authority only exists because you believe it exists, but I&#39;m out of scotch.</p>

It&#39;s brilliant psychologically because it creates straw men all over the place that make it difficult to focus on ACTUAL conspiracies.  If everything is a conspiracy than nothing is an abnormality and things can proceed as normal.  The best way to shut down people pointing out truths is to infiltrate and make the concept so far fetched it can&#39;t be taken seriously.</p>
