       So, my uncle works for the Department of Defense, I'm not sure what his job title is or exactly what he does. He has been with the D.O.D. for a while now (over 15 years) and was also a high ranked officer in the Marines for years before he started with the D.O.D. Anyways, he came in town from  Atlanta this weekend to visit and was acting extremely odd the whole time he was around my family. The whole time he was home he seemed to be preoccupied, not very talkative,  and just acting strange in general. Last night before he went back to Atlanta he sat down with my grandparents, cousins and other uncles and said some offbeat shit that really made me feel uncomfortable and scared. He told us all he needed to talk to us, (I was thinking he was going to tell us he was getting remarried because he has been getting pretty serious with a woman he has been dating.) He told us that within the next month there is a high chance that things are going to "get ugly" on the east coast (where we all live). He said he wasn't sure what is happening or what is going to happen. He said that within the next 2-3 weeks he is being relocated to Virginia Beach from Atlanta because it is possible that they will need some help in that area. I asked him if they thought we were going to be attacked or if it was an economic issue or what? He told me that he truly did not know, but the people in his "department" had been warned of "citizen uprisings" and possible "domestic and/or non-domestic disputes" and that many of the D.O.D. officials with high levels military experience were being moved to port areas along the east coast. I was asking him every question I could think of and he really had no answers for me and seemed to be in the dark besides what I have already shared with you. I also asked him that if this were an event of any significance then what type of plan should we have and where should we go? He said, that if any significant attack or uprising really did happen that everything would be locked down, but with all the emphasis that the D.O.D. is putting on the east coast the he would definetly head West if anything were to happen and travel was allowed.  I am normally a pretty skeptical person and do not believe everything I hear without some sort of proof or documentation to back it up, but this is seriously freaking me out as it came from a family members mouth and he was serious as a heart attack when he told my family. Does anyone have any idea about what this could be over? (the possibilities are endless, i know) I apoligize in advance for not having any sort of proof to back this up, b/c I  know most people in this subreddit are skeptics just as I am. I really do not want to put my uncle at any risk for anything he has said.. Plus I am not sure how to prove a conversation. If anyone has any possible information or insight on what this could be over, please share. Or if anyone has seen or heard anything out of the norm on the east coast in the past month please share. I am freaking the fuck out over this and trying to make some sense of it. I realize that this could be some sort of preparedness drill, and that nothing may happen at all and that is what I am hoping, but any info is appreciated.

       How much space on average per person do you think that data would occupy (and let's assume it's stored in a database that can return queries within a tolerable length of time)?  We'll do the math right here and now.  10MB per person?  100MB?

       Thanks for the compliment.  I'm talking storage space, not computing power.  Those two things are
       <em>
        distinctly

       different.  So... we're just going to fuck around and not try to objectively see how much storage it would actually take to hold all the information?

       You have the processor power, and the length of time it takes to process a query on any given user. This, coupled with the common knowledge that it entails a three-hop process to track all individuals should provide you with the storage dedicated to any given user - given, again, that you're a math genius.

       Only you have endowed me with the math genius title.  I'm talking of physical storage space, about which you have still not replied.  Lets quit yanking our cocks and get down to business - How much physical storage would it take to store information on every person in the U.S.?  We can start with a rough estimate of how many TB or PB of storage would be needed (we first need to make an estimate of the average storage requirement of the data of each person, then we can multiply that by the number of folks in the U.S.).  We can then see about what kind of hardware requirements would be necessary to store all of the information, and go from there.  Not talking about parsing the data just yet, only figuring out the storage requirements.  We'll get to the good parts soon enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I say 1GB per person would be about right.  What do you say?  Too much?  Too little?
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S.  That "three-hop process" you made up doesn't help us figure this shit out at all.

       If you don't know by know that the NSA is building profiles on everyone, and if you really can't be bothered to do the research to verify three hop, you're not worth my time. Anyone who is interested can easily find these facts with a Google search, first page. I'm not your dad, and I'm not going to do your homework for you.

       Not to mention that he said "that within the next 2-3 weeks he is being relocated to Virginia Beach from Atlanta because it is possible that they will need some help in that area".

       I'm not sure anyone of significance would give two shits that, even if it were all true, the 500 or so here saw it. The entire strategy is marginalization and cognitive dissonance. What OP said is a conspiracy theory, which is automatically wrong, because if it were true, people would talk about it. But when OP talks about it, he is labeled a conspiracy theorist. It is a beautifully constructed catch-22 that makes most censorship completely unnecessary.

       You don't paint a target on the person who tries to help you, idiot! This is why journalists don't reveal sources, nor do cops reveal informants. Now, at the very least, he will not be made privy to pertinent information, at the worst, he gets shot up in a false flag event, car accident, hangs himself... you get the idea. I doubt such hyperbole will pertain to this man though, as he didn't reveal any details.

       If you know there's a sniper taking people out, you don't stand up and wave your arms in "bravery" - that's stupid as fuck. Check out my comment history and you'll see I'm doing it anyway, because I actually give a shit about us as a whole.

       You are almost a bit correct though, in that this is specifically the goal of the NSA, to make us censor our speech, this eventually leads to self-censorship in all parts of life, and then self-censorship of thoughts. Things are getting hairy friends.

       Be open to the possibility that all these "leaks" on the Oct 1 issue can be engineered leaks designed to quash the alternative media/conspiracy theorist.
      </p>

       Not only can the MMS report on all the recent loony toons prepping but they may also engineer a "domestic terrorist" event linking to this misinformation as their reason for "self radicalization".

      <p>
       Just putting this out there as this specific "theme" has had more doomsayers spreading this than anything I've ever encountered. So either the threat is real or someone REALLY wants this "information" released.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're all alive tomorrow and nothing happens, *mark my words. This will be used against alternative media and "conspiracy theorists".

       I dont think so, the people who take this stuff seriously already do. and the people who believe in mainstream media already dont take it seriously. Its not like conspiracy as a trend has much credibility to lose. Good to spread the word. it just is mates. no sense worrying on ego issues over its truth or untruth, it will become self apparent either way. buckle up or ignore it.

       I can think of at least three reasons why this October 1st thing could be disinfo.  1)  Its scary.  It scares people away from conspiracy theory.  2)  It makes it so that conspiracy theorists look like they are always the boy who cried wolf.  3)  It distracts people from theorizing or analyzing the government shutdown.  On the other hand, a shut down of all Federal Agencies with the exception of military ones sure seems to have some implications of its own.

       As far as possible catastrophes on the east coast are concerned, the only one I've heard of is the collapse of the volcanic ridge of Cumbre Vieja on La Palma Island in the Canary Islands. This would supposedly send a "mega tsunami" crashing against the east coast of the US. Stan and Holly Deyo, who are also into disaster preparedness, discuss the possibility on an

       The MSM can report whatever distorted stories it wants. As long as people believe that they can veg out on their couch and passively be handed the truth by staring at their television for hours, "they" will maintain control of the population.

       Did you ever consider that it is just a bunch of paranoid "conspiracy theorists"? Perhaps there is no attack and there is no government conspiracy to spread misinformation and its just a bunch of people who read a conspiracy online and all of a sudden think they start seeing "signs" and go back to the internet and stoke the flames so to speak.

       From what I'm hearing, it sounds like a red herring, and perhaps OP's uncle is going to lose his security clearance for leaking this info, even if it is fake. If you can't be trusted with fake intelligence, you certainly can't be trusted with real intelligence.

       Guys. Its going to be a false-flag nuke attack aimed at DC but affecting the east coast. Mossad is already working to make this happen behind the scenes, blame it on Iran, and we invade.  What do you think happened to the missing nuke?  Goal accomplished.  Thanks Netanyahu.

       This should be at the top. We already know nukes supposedly went missing in texas and were transported to south carolina. We know the neocons all agree that we need another big FF. We know that there will be no war with syria and iran like there was supposed to be, if things keep going the way they are. We know that we can't sustain the debt monetization for much longer, and there are no tools left to stop another 2008 if it happens (except massive war?). We know that people no longer believe mainstream media. We know there are a number of domestic issues that are having undesirable outcomes (nsa spying exposure, marijuana legalization, failure of gun control). The clock is running out.

       Please note: Linsdsey Graham's comments, the reported transfer by AJ, and the suspension of the 2nd in command

        all happened on the same day

       They already have shown they are obsolete. Their "job" is to prevent attacks like sandy hook, boston bombing, navy yard shooting, etc and all of these events happened so what good are they? This is besides the point each of these were pre planned by TPTB

       Sandy Hook and Navy Yard were lone wolf attacks, these are not the kinds of attacks the NSA could prevent, don't blame the NSA, blame the social stigma against seeking help for mental help and gun owners that don't know how to lock up there guns.  The FBI really dropped the ball on Boston, that much was obvious and made the national news.

        Here's a helpful site in learning a bit more about the affects and damage of a nuclear blast, based on ACTUAL detonations from history, and current nukes in various nations' arsenals.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Using D.C. as an example, and the B-83 as a possible nuke (the largest in the US arsenal),
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KtkupkX.jpg">
        the fireball itself would vaporize most of D.C. proper
       </a>
       . Radiation would saturate the entire area up to a 5 or 6 miles from the blast itself. I can imagine in the outlying areas, there'd be many people with 3rd degree burns, blindness, cuts and bruises from walls and windows crumbling due to the shock-wave.

       That's part of why I didn't say it was a sure thing. Just that probably, you would. The resulting fallout is bad. And if you're outside or near a window when it goes off, expect to be blinded
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       temporarily. Its also possible, though depending on your location that could change, that the blast wave would hit you and hour house, reducing it to rubble.

       20 miles out? You'd likely survive the initial blast, and most likely the wind/fire storm immediately thereafter as long as you're not in a high rise of some sort. I'd be more worried about the shit after the blast. You'll probably wish you had died.

       Didn't the head of US nuke forces just get relieved?  Saw a post on reddit recently... others that come to mind is several military officers relieved without explanation other than "lost confidence" the implication was "lost confidence that they would follow orders to fire on US citizens".

       I don't think it's that easy any more.  In 2001, obviously it was that easy to just plant a big FF, blame whoever the administration wanted, and then have the entire country clamoring to go to war with that made up adversary.  I don't think it's that easy anymore - even if tptb DID nuke an entire city and even if there were even more casualties than there were on 911.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people, the citizenry know a LOT more about how shitty tptb are now.  We know just how evil and against us they actually are.  I think even the average person would begin to question the validity of who the administration would say is responsible for an attack.  Their FFs are starting to not have the same effect on the "dumb masses" as they once did...because the masses are beginning to slowly wake up.
      </p>
      <p>
       As fast as tptb ignite a FF attack and get their MSM to start beating the drums of war on whoever they want to attack? that's how fast it's seeming the alternative media is beginning to punch holes in the administration's stories.  All the more recent FFs haven't had as great an effect as tptb have wanted because the masses are seeing through them as being nothing but murderous attacks on the people themselves and so we're not going for the attacks as quickly if at all.  We're not taking their bait.

       Well, yes.  We

       pretty stupid - we keep going around and around like gerbils on a wheel - but the fact of the matter is that, as I said above, a lot of the FFs TPTB have engaged in as of late

       been greatly questioned by the people and the alternative media, etc - so that's not a bad sign that the people - stupid and indoctrinated like sheep as so many of us are - are not starting to buy the administration's rabble as much as before.

       worse than your sister I'm sure - but...well, she either had to stop being my gf or start waking up because I kept questioning and thinking critically and talking about all these issues, and she began to realize through conversations we had and fits and starts that a lot of things really don't add up at all.  She's still not as focused as I am in that area, but she's a
       <em>
        lot

       more aware now than ever.

       Reddit is by no means the only source of information as it pertains to calling tptb out on their bullshit.  Independent of reddit - or, more specifically,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and similar subreddits (as many other subs, I would say, suck balls majorly) - there is, like I mentioned, the
       <em>
        alternative media
       </em>
       .  THAT calls out their bullshit often as well - not just
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       - and information can be had there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, however, even if NO ONE goes online after a nuke attack - which, of course, would be ENTIRELY understandable - or even
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       go online, the fact of the matter is that the general public I would say now has a general feeling of distrust and great skepticism with regard to pretty much anything the administration says is the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost like this:  If something bad happens - a nuke goes off, some horrible terrorist attack, or whatever else - and you want to find out exactly who
       <em>
        DIDN'T
       </em>
       do it, then hurry up, turn on the tv, and listen to who the MSM immediately rushes to blame and calls for the American people to "attack in retaliation".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       bad, and a lot of people are beginning to wake up to know this.  Some of us know this so well now that we don't need anything like reddit to tell us this.  We already
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       .  We don't need to got to reddit to understand this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no.  I don't think any "reddit surfing" would be necessary at all in order for people to begin to really question who the administration says is to blame if a nuke went off in an American city.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       I'm not super certain it would matter any more.  I mean I'm certainly not speaking for everyone here - or really anyone other than myself - but I know that I certainly WOULDN'T be buying the government's story about who it was (
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       if they rush to blame the "obvious American enemies" in Syria or Iran or Russia or China, for example).  I've seen too much and have researched too much at this point.  There's a lot I'm ignorant about, but I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       know that the government and those ptb that are way above the government controlling it are NOT on the side of the public
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       .  I don't need reddit to know that.

       I am willing to bet cold hard cash this will not happen and you are talking shit. This subreddit is like an open asshole of pseudo intellectuals just dribbling shitty facts into ears wide open to receive shit. Anything with an anti-American agenda is gobbled up like a thanksgiving turkey.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comment disregards the recent news of Iran saying they will never build nukes and the beginning of talks between the USA and Iran. Of course this could be a load of rubbish designed to trick everyone but I doubt it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said there is no way your idea will happen and if it is, well the millions dead will be proof enough that I was wrong. In the meantime you are a fear mongering fool.

       The problem with your theory is that any nuclear detonation will have a specific radiation signature, which reveals the nuke's country of origin.
      </p>
      <p>
       A U.S. nuke used on American soil will be identified very quickly as a false flag by the monitoring stations and satellites of most major powers.

       And that is fine if you do not believe me.  I am not stating anything WILL happen nor am I saying that he has any idea of anything happening. I hope nothing happens and that this is for a "training drill" or for something that the D.O.D. is overshooting or misinterpreting. I am just sharing info that I thought could be important. Will it be? I hope not, but it may be.

       People don't have money to spend. Think of the effect this will have on foodstamps in the long run if it continues. They are only promising October maybe using contingency money to go through new years. If govt. shutdown continues past that it will be chaos when people cannot afford food. A lot of americans are on food stamps. If you control food you control the masses.

       FEMA must have infrastructure ready to fulfill its duties. That includes camps or whatever you want to call them, for whatever possibilities they deem reasonable to address.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, your second cousin may quite be right. On the other hand that doesn't imply anything is would happen just because FEMA is ready.

       Please don't take this wrong, I'm not trying to be a jerk.  I'm guessing the down votes are based on your formatting (lack of).  Please remember to use paragraphs.  I tried to read through your post a couple times but I use a small laptop, having a wall of text is simply a pain to read.

       Not trying to be an asshat, but people that will downvote info of potential importance because it's not paragraphed is rather lacking in perspective. my confusion is not at your point but at the people who will downvote this due to formatting. It's always been a big issue for me that a lot of redditors would actually spend the time to downvote a post that was confirming that a nuke was about to be dropped on their head for the post's bad formatting. Blow's my mind.

       Also your point is a valid one and it's not your post I have the problem with, just the people that fulfill what your post says.

       No, thats vote hiding and is done by the subreddit mods as an effort to fight "bandwagon voting", vote fuzzing is when they pad the total downvotes and total upvotes to throw off spammers, the exact voting algorithm is a secret and the only part of reddit code that isn't open source.  The net votes are accurate, however.  A post that shows 42k up and 40k down in reality might have 2.5k up and 500 down.

       Downvoting to save your uncle's ass, dumbass. Have a feeling this is fake thou. If real follow up in 2 months and we'll see how much our government has seen here.

       I read this a few hours ago, and when I got home I made a call...
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a friend in the military who lives in the Virginia Beach (Hampton Road) area, gave the run down of this post to him, he told me they're running all kinds of new equipment drills (mainly electronic stuff) on their ship, but nothing out of the ordinary as all the drills have been coming down the pipe for months. He gave his dad a call. his dad works for the DOD in the area, same kind of background as your uncle (former high ranking marine, turned private sector after retirement, got into the DOD about 15 years ago), and he doesn't know of any major plans but says in the event of a large scale people revolt, there isn't a person in his sector that would stand up against them (being the revoltist), he says there has been a lot of "watercolor talk" and wouldn't be surprised if something is on the horizon which could be scary to some people, but as long as the UN stays out of the US, we have (and i quote) "a shit load of people ready to back a revolution" so that's my two cents...

       Heard something about this today. Urban warfare and riot control, learning English and learning how to operate US electrical devices and weapons. If there was going to be a New World Order it seems to me the UN military would be their world military they would use to take control.

       But would a UN force, even that large, stand a chance against a well armed and trained (lots of ex military) populous?  Add to that the US military who would support the revolt. I don't think it would matter if there were million UN soldiers.

       "The Kaibiles are infamous for their reputed practice of forcing recruits to kill animals, which includes raising a puppy and bonding with it before killing and eating it, as well as biting the heads off live chickens. In addition, recruits are shot and forced to perform field surgery on themselves, and to drink water out of recently fired artillery shells. As part of the course's finishing ritual, every recruit must drink "Bomb", a mix of tequila, whiskey, rum, beer, water, and gunpowder, served in a bamboo glass with a bayonet tied to it. Soldiers must drink it carefully, so as not to get drunk and cut themselves with the bayonet. Once they successfully complete this ritual, they are inducted into the Kaibiles"

       That is interesting and relieving at the same at the same time. I just wonder, if things are compartmentalized and not everyone knows everything? Again, my Uncle swore he knew nothing else. I don't think he would hold back from us, I very seriously doubt it.

       I'm not one to get spooked, and draw up hasty conclusions or do my best to paint a paranoid picture with the little information I have, but a strange thing happened at work.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you work retail you always get a few crazies, but I work at an upscale home decor/appliance store and I had a customer mentioning something about "shutting off the power grid. . . happen very soon" to a co-worker of mine. The guy seemed well dressed, and sane, but something had him very uneasy. He didn't have that crazy kind of "we're dammed to hell" kind of attitude, but he really wanted to share what he knew.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it turns out to be true, let's ride this wave, it should be interesting. If not, it's a cool story.

       Take it with a grain of salt. As a former Army Officer I had the opportunity to attend a Dining In with a 4 Star Army General. He said to all of us that he could not divulge his sources but that within the next two years WWIII  would begin and we all needed to be prepared.

       The amount of people in this sub who 
A) Have no idea what the fuck is going on
and
B) Use the absence of knowledge to insert their own fears
is really ridiculous.

       How about this for a no-evidence theory. OP is actually from 4chan having a grand ol ball poking all the scared people here. Not to say I've ever done that before with conspiracy theorists or anything. :-\
      </p>
      <p>
       The skittishness of this whole thing... when something finally does happen the lack of rigor here makes any of your suppositions useless. Its the boy who cried wolf. The internet and expecially these chunks of it are not helping anything, you aren't warning people, you aren't getting a message out.. you're fear jerking. Evidence, or gtfo.

       I'm here because I love mysteries, strange things that don't add up. I was really into things like the Bermuda triangle, bigfoot, etc when I was young, and I never really got over the sadness that when you critically investigate any of them, they're just stories. Mundane things usually with simple explanations. People being people. So these places are where I go to read about stories and mysteries we don't know.

       Yeah, I have read about the Gov. Shutdown and was thinking about that. But, from what I understand that has happened almost 20 times since the 60's. And, usually isn't as big of a deal as people make it out to be.. I'm not sure what they may be preparing for but it sure is nerve racking.

       Gov. Shutdown on Oct 1, followed by continued congressional bickering, leading to a failure to figure out the debt ceiling problem that's coming due on Oct 17, leading to layoffs in large numbers as companies struggle to stay afloat without the support of Federal grants/backup leads to people getting fed up and taking to the streets.

       Most likely fear of the D.O.D. in my opinion.

       As for East coast- financial sector's in New York. D.C. is over there, high concentration of the people that are blamed for the problem. Once one city rises up, others will likely follow nearby (as opposed to random rioting being spurred on in LA due to people flooding the streets in Virginia).

       This is the most logical possibility based on the information available. The Govt. shutdown is just a sneaky way of pushing austerity in America. The whole economic system is a farce and the Fed can't keep printing funny money forever. By masking it as the product of a petty dispute between Dems/Repubs they manage to keep the populace divided on the same nonsense party lines, but as a backup they would prepare for any mass protests/ unrest by getting the DOD ready to violently suppress any backlash.

       To be quite honest I'm surprised more people, especially this subreddit, hasn't heard more of them. They have an entire album on why the Iraq War was retarded and Orwell's Boot Stamping on a Face... Forever. Very truth-minded antigovernment types.

       Agreed. BR was the reason i first started questioning the things I was being taught during my formative years, especially my place within the catholic church (I don't remember hearing how Moses reacted when the innocent first born sons laid dead). I had a feeling i was being fed bullshit and they were the first people to tell me it was okay to ask questions and disagree with the status quo. Highly recommended for anyone who has a feeling that something is very wrong with this world.

       I'm in coastal VA, and there are plenty of people in Va beach and the nearby area who work in government and military support jobs who might be affected by a government shutdown. There are also plenty of people who either aren't quite up to speed or have political biases, and if there's any specific reason for your uncle's re-assignment to the area, my guess would be that it has to do with the potential pissyness of defunded workers

       This actually worries me a bit, as I live in Hampton Roads and work in VA Beach.  The fact that the beach was specifically mentioned is bothersome, especially with all of the military bases around here.

       Depends how long it lasts.  The FedGov is now a huge part of the economy...if it goes away for two weeks a lot of people will be hurting.  4 weeks, it'll start to look like a crisis.  The economy is on edge already.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, this could be the excuse needed to crash it, as it beats "the Federal Reserve went bonkers insane for a couple of decades..." as an explanation for why we hit Great Depression Mk2.

       yes this government shutdown thing.. all a stage from obamacare to now, all building up to this moment.. but for what? what happens during a shutdown? legislatively, what powers lay where, and who can do what? what privileges are there? is it easier to assume martial law? are certain laws enacted during this time that would be otherwise concealed? i want to know, and we need someone who really knows their shit in and out to answer these questions.

       I just don't bother getting into anything of that sort on the internet. I'm fully aware that a good sized chunk of folks on the web are liars. Probably more than not. But bringing that up turns into a back and forth shit show that goes absolutely nowhere. My reply assumes he is telling the truth, but I'm not.

       JUST nothing. I mean, I don't know if I believe this. I used to be a trucker and though a pretty conservative lot are very independent minded- even the company men. I guess you could get enough drivers that will stop taking loads to the DC area to cause a shortage of something (probably fuel). Its shitty enough that I'd never have driven there again.
      </p>
      <p>
       But think about who would be getting hurt. Certainly not the elites who can simply leave or be shuttled, choppered (emergency tunnel under the Patomic?) out. Now I used to drive reefers- refrigerated trucks so I did a lot of food loads. Your typical grocery store (or any at this point) uses a "Just in Time" inventory system to reduce shelf time and increase profits. It also means that once a local emergency is declared, that store is out of food in less than a day. 2 or three under normal operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not as certain of distribution centers- there are all types and sizes- hell Kraft even has a 200 foot deep underground city-sized facility with 100 foot tall ceilings in Springfield Missouri that sees hundreds of trucks per day. But I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, once the tractor trailers stop moving- for whatever reason- you have maybe 2 days at the most before the food riots start- and like I said, less than that once word gets out. Food doesn't move from loading docks, from intermodal transfer centers in railyards and harbors, all the food you have left, is whatever you have. And the larger the affected the region, the longer the infrastructure to end or prevent the inevitable bedlam will take to re-establish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those of you that volunteered at the Points of Distribution handing out food, water, and ice after Hurricane Ike know what I'm talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a little story: FEMA dropped the ball, 'misplacing' 3 million cases of MREs from regional warehouses, that which was left went towards feeding first responders, local shelters and those evacuated from the worst hit areas- Galveston, San Leon, Bacliff, people that lived in Galveston bay through Baytown IIRC. The Red Cross brought some in- but they were privatized. Regional store chains actually stepped in and saved the day. HEB, Kroger and Piggly Wiggly put together I have no idea how many commercial meals made from their own stocks. They even provided most of the trucks as you can see from this pic:
      </p>

        http://i230.photobucket.com/albums/ee82/Dayanx/IKE/POD1.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This line was about half a mile long; wrapping around the block to a Point of Distribution. The problem is people were still going without because the PODs were placed politically, with local councilmen fighting over them and placing them where trucks had the worst time getting in or out. Trucks were getting stuck, and with fuel hard to come by, they were running out. The other problem was that some PODs were getting food and ice but no water, or water but no food. and there were some ridiculously unprepared and pissed off people that were going without food for that day. (They would only hand out only enough food for that day, and only for two people for each person that showed up)
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the wall of text, but I helped with security, and have seen just how little it takes to knock people off that sagging branch they call civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, here's a gas line- there were cardboard bales and carts set up in barricade to try to prevent fights over gas. At that point I think that was one of only two or three places that had gasoline in the entire city of Houston.

       Here's the thing. Highway weigh stations, and even some of the Ez pass lanes are outfitted with Geiger readers, or other devices for measuring radiation. Any kind of nuke or dirty bomb would be detected, supposing it isn't a false flag and the people that would detect it are the people utilizing it.

       Not necessarily. I once did a story at a highway weigh station and trucks were routinely coming in with loads of up to 80,000lbs or more. The weigh stations never check the cargo against the bills of lading; they just weigh the truck and pass it on thru if it's OK. A truck lined with lead weight, but otherwise empty, would simply truck on down the road with no problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT. This is how loads of car batteries move around, too. A truck will only be loaded up about halfway, maybe 750 batteries or something. Each one weighs maybe 80lbs...

       Right, in a completely different place--a different state--with completely different personnel. Not at Sandy Hook and having no connection with it. How could anyone think there was a connection?

"Active Shooter Drill
The official government website for the state of Connecticut (ct.gov) lists the drill on their calendar;

The government drill that took place on the same day of the shooting between the same hours was located down the road about 14 miles at the following location:

       That was a FEMA class, not a drill in any way. You can also take the class

       if you want to see what it's about. It's a very high-level introduction on how to plan for children in disasters. There's nothing about active shooters in there. It's more about remembering to include diapers in flood shelters.

       Raptors get the NBA too.  Wait, the Toronto Maple Leafs?  They play in the C league as well as the N?  Or do you have a separate Leafs team? I imagine all remaining teams would default win their respective league but there wouldn't be another season.  Unless you think the TML will just join the Cannie league?  That's a reasonable idea.

       I live in Brooklyn and can not believe the amount of military helicopters shaking my house at all hours.37 years in the area and now all of a sudden I wake up to black hawks flying low.
I do live close to Floyd Benett Field but still,this is new.
I asked around and the most common answer is training but I don't see them training someone to Black Hawk Down over King's Plaza Shopping Mall

       Big Island Hawaii checking in. We too have seen a lot more activity with  helicopters on an almost daily basis. Also at night over the ocean. This has been at an alarming rate for over 6 months now. We do have a huge military pressence here true but not on these flight patterns and to this extent ever.

       Well, since everyone else is "checking in," i thought id report as well. Iblive something like ninety miles south of DC, and recently visited DC. Saw two black unmarked helicopters flying fairly low. This was around the time the UN General Assembly was in time. I also saw a "normal" grey helicopter (looked like a blackhawk).
      </p>
      <p>
       But, probably three weeks prior to that, i saw three of the same flying just over my town of 26,000 people. Also, just a few days ago, i saw a C130 (those military cargo planes) flying quite low for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, keep in mind i live almost right in the middle of three huge military bases. Ive seen military planes before, but it wasnt ever really this often, its not a usual occurance. But, ill reserve my conspiracies till further evidence is acquired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, lastly, during the NASA launch in sept at wallops island, va (their second launch, sept 17th i think?) I saw a fighter jet cruisin the skies. He was alone from what i could see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, even with all the military planes ive seen, ive never seen the black unmarked helicopters before. Ever. That was the weirdest of them all. Straight black, no markings.

       Pretty sure those are the President's helicopters. He flies in one but two others accompany him so if it's a target, nobody knows which copter he's in.

       I was in a helicopter unit in the USAF and they do "TDYs" where X amount of helicopters do specific drills, i.e. seawater rescues, at various locations around the US.  Not saying it is that, but it could be.

       Ground troops will be needed to 'calm' survivors. It worked somewhat in Boston with marshal law because not many people own guns. I the south a much higher percentage owns firearms. I personally don't think it would be a smooth operation. There would be loss of life on both sides.

       After reading this, and for the sake of the topic I am considering it to be true, I am now really worried that the US will start a world war against the citizen's will.

      <p>
       What you are describing is the gvt preparing to defend themselves against the population because they are about to do something that the people don't want to happen.

       This was my previous prediction on the october event subject:

       But if what you say is true then I really believe in an impending WW, let's hope that this and my previous prediction never come true.

       Rising conflict throughout the citizens of this great nation against the government makes this a near possibility. All you see on the internet anymore is revolutionary talk. And yes it may be talk now, but slowly rebellion in the real world is occurring. Which who knows if it's propaganda or fact. I'm just going to sit back and drink a beer and if it all burns it burns.

       That line of thought really puts the ammunition shortage in a new light. I don't spend a lot of time on this subreddit, so I'm not up on what theories there are on the ammunition shortage, but as a legal gun owner, it's borderline impossible to find basic ammo calibers. When you do find a place that has .38 or .22 or 9mm, you're limited to 2 boxes at prices that are double what they were before Sandy Hook. :/

       Everything seems to be pointing in this direction. Everyone pulling their gold out of the fed, all of the disputes over this that and the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my cyber community prospective, this is what we are all seeing. I was told the other day to download what information I could from the Internet, from a very significant source in the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       My friend doing super computing just had all of their deadlines moved up at oak ridge to finish what he was working on.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my prospective, something is up. I don't know what it is, but it would seem something relatively large. I don't buy the civil shit due to the fact America is too stupid to even realize half of this stuff, but I don't see something not happening by the end of the year. It scares the shit out of me.
      </p>

       I have a place to go that is self sustainable with fallout shelters, because some people are even more paranoid than me. This doesn't add up though.

       Not really man. It's just good to have multiple backups of documents. Every now and then I do it anyways, probably once a quarter, but he basically said he ran his, and it would be a good idea to run mine. So it's just stuff like certain data dumps and simple things like a wikipedia backup.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also realize power is relative. Someone will have power, and someone will have power regardless... you hear the term "non-essential".... there you go. I mean unless you're talking about just a gigantic ass EMP, then that is a different story. However, I have a hard time believing anyone has the capability to EMP something the size of the United States in a quick swoop. It would take some serious space hardware to do that... and keeping it concentrated through the atmosphere... Impressive it would be, doubtful it exists I am.

       This puts me in mind of the thread that appeared in this subreddit about a year ago, a month before hurricane Sandy hit the East coast.  The woman's husband was in the army and got called into a meeting about an "event" happening that would "put much of the east coast under water", or something like that.  I used to have it bookmarked on my phone, but that phone shit the bed, and I don't have the link anymore.  Does anyone else have it?

       Remember how Hurricane Sandy was a reason Obama was re-elected? I remember now how after the storm hit, everyone was praising Obama's response to it and the undecided voters were suddenly supporting Obama because of it. Just the timing of it and that past article made me think about the media surrounding Obama's reaction, and how it seemed to edge him in front of the election race. Not sure how much weight this holds, but it's something you gotta wonder about.

       Sort of. The FBI used a JavaScript exploit to take down Freedom Hosting. Nobody with any sense would use JavaScript with Tor. It's pretty well known how many security flaws there are with JavaScript. There are zero-day attacks at least once a year on it. Pedophiles were the only ones dumb enough to use JavaScript while trying to remain anonymous. The Silk Road appears to be uncompromised still, which suggests Tor as a whole is too as long as you keep JavaScript blocked.

       No, but I still don't think the FBI cracked Tor. In fact, I don't think they're anywhere near doing that. Have you read how sloppy DPR was? Here's a good summary:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1nl7p9/sr_shutdown_fallout_discussion/ccjlwgp">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1nl7p9/sr_shutdown_fallout_discussion/ccjlwgp
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, I think this shutdown shows just how secure Tor must be. It took the FBI 3 years to catch someone who was this fucking stupid. Imagine if the Silk Road was run by someone that knew what they were doing. He didn't do any web admin work behind Tor. He did it all on a VPN at a coffeeshop right next to his house. He ordered fake IDs to his house, which got seized. He made a post on a forum on the public Internet saying how he found this site that's like Amazon for drugs SIX DAYS AFTER HE LAUNCHED IT. He registered for this forum with his personal email address. He mentioned in an unencrypted chat message on the Silk Road that he was in PST. He had an account on StackExchange that used his real name. He changed his username 30 seconds before making a post to ask a question about how to administer hidden services. Why wouldn't you use a new account for something like that? He narrowed the search for the feds by an order of magnitude with that move. It seems like nothing, but that's a big deal. It blows my mind that someone could be this careless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this assassination nonsense sounds like someone managed to hack the Silk Road's servers and get a bunch of identifying information because again, DPR was completely clueless about security. I can't believe that someone running a $1.2 billion drug market was such an amateur, and I can't believe he was stupid enough to stay in the States this entire time. This wasn't a hack or anything like that. They simply investigated the earliest mention of the Silk Road on the public Internet and put the pieces together.

       Maybe you're right. Maybe all of those pieces led them to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again though, if he created an account, or any post behind tor, it should be anonomized. Using a public connection over  would make it more secure actually.

       I agree, but he didn't use Tor for web admin work on the Silk Road. I have no idea why he didn't, but apparently he only used a VPN over the public network.

       interesting. Where I work has a big meeting tomorrow concerning emergency health and human services. I thought it was due to widespread changes in the health services sector due to Obamacare but from what little I've directly heard there are reps from FEMA, and possibly DMAT attending. I don't know if it's about an exercise or policy changes, but the timing is sure interesting. We're in FEMA region 2, but between 1 and 3 so right in the thick of things.

       I've been reading lately about nuclear weapons being secretly transferred to the east coast and preparations happening for a major event. Thing is, most of the reports are based off of information from secret sources or from misreading government reports and not understanding how federal procurement operates. What I do know is the country has been prepared for years for something really big -- whoever is pulling the strings and setting up events like 9/11 is NOT done yet. The plan is for global "full spectrum" domination, and it can't be accomplished as things stand now. Too many people know too much about false flag attacks and neo-con warmongering. So you create a situation where those people can be removed from society. Nothing like a national emergency to give cover. Why do you think NSA is collecting all that information off of social media? To know who you are, what you believe, what you'll do in an emergency, and whether you're a threat.

       I ran into a exmarine a few weeks back and he told us somthing similar to this. He said that on November 13th they where shutting down the electric grid on the east coast. He said he was gearing up for war and trying to warn as many people as possible. He also told us that they where going to offer people shelters in fema camps, but that they would imprison the people in them like they did during Katrina. I don't know how I feel about this I'm trippen balls yo!

       I work as a DoD contractor.  We just had a briefing that all GS and ANG employees are furloughed until further notice.  That means they are not coming to work tomorrow, or the next day, or the day after that, until whatever is happening financially is resolved.

       Good fucking question.  The orders are to come to work tomorrow morning, unpaid, to sign the paperwork and go home indefinitely.  Draft paperwork is already in hand, official paperwork will be emailed around midnight Eastern Time.  Though there is supposedly a three day window, the word is they want everything signed by noon tomorrow Eastern Time.  The words "orderly shutdown" and "keep calm" were used more than once.

       So based on this, the furloughs you speak of may be unrelated to the bill the Senate is voting on now. I wonder how many other government furloughs happened today. I attempted a google search, but can't sift through all the current shutdown mess.  I wonder if they're hiding something. It just seems like something is going on. I can see and smell it all over the politicians and anchors.

       I dare say they are related.  It was made clear that what was happening was attributed to what is currently happening in Washington D.C.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was mentioned that there was a microscopic chance that the situation would resolve before midnight, however the plan stands that folks would be leaving promptly after signing something tomorrow morning.

       EDIT:  The discussion went so far as to speak about the possibility of receiving unemployment after several days (I believe 7 or 8 was the number used).

       I keep a level head and make an effort to not be an alarmist, but I think it might be some slightly serious shit.  Watching a majority of my co-workers lose their job for an unknown duration of time (however long or short it might be), has left me somber this evening.  It was stressed that this has happened 17 or so times since the 1970's, but that isn't very consoling to someone losing their job indefinitely.

       Your description sounded quite a bit more than "slightly" serious though.  I'm not saying we need to go crazy if it IS serious shit - cuz we most certainly

       Yeah.  I imagine it isn't much consolation for the person losing their job at all.  However - and I don't mean to sound crass saying this or mean
       <em>

       offense, but - it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       actually a bit of a relief to find out that "this has happened 17 or so times since the 1970's" and we're all still here, you know?  In other words, would I want that many people losing their jobs to mean that:
      </p>
      <p>
       A) They are now unemployed "just because" (government cutbacks, scaling down, etc) and will simply have to find work elsewhere?
      </p>
      <p>
       or that
      </p>
      <p>
       B)  They are now unemployed because some possibly
       <em>
        majorly
       </em>
       catastrophic shit is about to happen to the East Coast?
      </p>
      <p>
       No offense, of course, but I would much rather have A than B.

       I don't think they can be legally paid by the government at this point, and it seems that someone had a clearer picture of that before they did.  I'm told I'm good until my contract expires, though I can't imagine what I'll be doing with so many pieces of the puzzle removed.  I'm sure many of them will attempt to find work elsewhere if this continues for more than a week or two.  Some are most definitely pissed off.  Given all of this, choice "A" seems to be the most likely answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no knowledge that anything catastrophic will happen on the East Coast.  I've heard about FEMA Region III being under some sort of alert, though I'm unsure about the particular reason.  The talking heads in D.C. seemed really fucking stressed out tonight, though I don't normally watch television so that could just be normal operations in brainwash-land.  That said, I'm glad I'm nowhere near the East Coast right now.

       Former World Bank Senior Counsel for the World Bank Legal Department Karen Hudes also agreed, in an interview with this writer last week, that, based on her direct experience, the Western financial system was run by high level racketeers. According to her, when the Federal Reserve Board refused earlier this year to return 300 tons of gold Germany had entrusted with them, she advised the Germans this was similar to a declaration of war. The Germans appeared to have agreed and recently sent a shot across the bows to the Americans in the form of German helicopters flying so low over the US consulate in Frankfurt that china was rattled off the shelves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hudes also independently confirmed that top level cabalists were indeed trying to start World War 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       To prevent this, Hudes says that
       <em>
        380,000 American, Russian and Chinese troops are preparing to move into Washington D.C. in October to arrest the criminals pretending to be a government there
       </em>

       Maybe they are worried about the government shutdown and demonstrations regarding the debt ceiling impasse. I think its extremely unlikely that there will be major unrest, but the busy-bodies in the Pentagon have to prepare for every contingency, no matter how remote.

       I'm seriously wondering if something is up. If the government shutdown occurs (by the time you read this it will probably either have been averted or not), then it could be that they are testing the waters to see how far they can push the American people -- if my theory that this is all just political theater and both sides are sick of being ignored and looking incompetent (lowest government approval rating in years).
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that our economy cannot afford a shutdown of the government for any length of time, and this is going to cause economic collapse. I'm not the first one to think this, a lot of economists on both the right and left are saying that a government shutdown would spin the U.S. economy out of control.

       Whether or not this is all engineered is beyond me, nor do I care. Something is up, shit could get real very soon if the government does shut down and it goes longer than a couple of weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what your uncle is getting at is that in general, the DoD is expecting shit to go south and are preparing for that to happen in the event of a government shutdown. Whether or not it happens is anyone's guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if this is real and your uncle is who you say he is and has access to clearance stuff, you could have just fucked him over unintentionally.

       Here's the wall broken up a little:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So, my uncle works for the Department of Defense,
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm not sure what his job title is or exactly what he does.
       </p>
       <p>
        He has been with the D.O.D. for a while now (over 15 years) and was also a high ranked officer in the Marines for years before he started with the D.O.D. Anyways, he came in town from Atlanta this weekend to visit and was acting extremely odd the whole time he was around my family. The whole time he was home he seemed to be preoccupied, not very talkative, and just acting strange in general.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last night before he went back to Atlanta he sat down with my grandparents, cousins and other uncles and said some offbeat shit that really made me feel uncomfortable and scared. He told us all he needed to talk to us, (I was thinking he was going to tell us he was getting remarried because he has been getting pretty serious with a woman he has been dating.) He told us that within the next month there is a high chance that things are going to "get ugly" on the east coast (where we all live). He said he wasn't sure what is happening or what is going to happen. He said that within the next 2-3 weeks he is being relocated to Virginia Beach from Atlanta because it is possible that they will need some help in that area. I asked him if they thought we were going to be attacked or if it was an economic issue or what? He told me that he truly did not know, but the people in his "department" had been warned of "citizen uprisings" and possible "domestic and/or non-domestic disputes" and that many of the D.O.D. officials with high levels military experience were being moved to port areas along the east coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was asking him every question I could think of and he really had no answers for me and seemed to be in the dark besides what I have already shared with you. I also asked him that if this were an event of any significance then what type of plan should we have and where should we go? He said, that if any significant attack or uprising really did happen that everything would be locked down, but with all the emphasis that the D.O.D. is putting on the east coast the he would definetly head West if anything were to happen and travel was allowed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am normally a pretty skeptical person and do not believe everything I hear without some sort of proof or documentation to back it up, but this is seriously freaking me out as it came from a family members mouth and he was serious as a heart attack when he told my family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Does anyone have any idea about what this could be over? (the possibilities are endless, i know) I apoligize in advance for not having any sort of proof to back this up, b/c I know most people in this subreddit are skeptics just as I am. I really do not want to put my uncle at any risk for anything he has said.. Plus I am not sure how to prove a conversation. If anyone has any possible information or insight on what this could be over, please share.
       </p>
       <p>
        Or if anyone has seen or heard anything out of the norm on the east coast in the past month please share. I am freaking the fuck out over this and trying to make some sense of it. I realize that this could be some sort of preparedness drill, and that nothing may happen at all and that is what I am hoping,
       </p>
       <p>
        but any info is appreciated.
       </p>

       Nothing. He is in VA Beach. Spoke with him about a week ago and he said that rumors have been swirling but no one knows what is going on. Right now he said he has been doing a lot of paper work. He told me if he heard anything new he would let me know. He has to be in DC in two weeks for a training seminar.

       Also keep in mind there are 3 very large comets due to pass  close to earth starting oct/nov. Comets L.I.E. = Lovejoy, Ison and Encke. If you look at the trajectory of all 3 superimposed it appears they may collide, or at the very least come extremely close together.

       True however with the 2 other comets coming into play strange magnetic pulls are possible. Look at comet Ellenin.  My thought is this. The grid shut down drills correlate pretty close in timing when all three are in our solar system. Perhaps some strange cellestial event could be used as a false flag ? If the grids did go down naturaly, due to solar flare, or man made disaster things would go downhill pretty quickly.

       Well since I have experience in Virginia Beach this kind of doesn’t make sense. Virginia  Beach area has like 7 military bases and I would say that 80% of the residents are related to someone in the military. So that being said If something were to go down and it was "citizen uprisings" then that says to me its Military rising against itself, as most of the citizens in this area are military.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if this is true “Virginia Beach” may be code for somewhere else… hopefully not 3 hours north.

       EDIT: Downvoted eh? Typical in this sub.

       This is the most accurate statement with regards to Virginia Beach, coming from the native. It's rare to meet someone who isn't related to the military, or a tourist.

       Take it for what it's worth, but there is a Department of Agriculture emergency preparedness exercise scheduled for Oct 9-10 here in Manhattan, KS. It is to practice the plan for if livestock were to become infected by a fast spreading disease. We have been told that there will be an influx of federal, state, and local authorities in town.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just kind of odd that all of these exercises just happen to be happening this close to each other. Thought it might be relevant in some way, interpret it however you see it.

       What i hope will happen is that: Soldiers who are ordered to strike on American citziens will come to realize what they are doing, and that they are slaughtering their friends and family. Hopefully they will ban together and take out these corrupt commanding officers that gave them the orders in the first place

       It's not US soldiers we have to worry about. It's the 386,000 UN peacekeepers that are currently training for urban warfare/riot control, learning english, and learning US military weapons systems, in the US.

       There seems to be an undercurrent of chatter right now concerning this area and it's interesting to me that OP seems unaware of this chatter.  I caught the butt end of an interview on Ground Zero about a week ago where the caller was saying there's a threat to the east coast but that she couldn't say more for fear of her life(!.  Anyway then there were a couple other callers saying they had heard of people having premonitions of an asteroid off Puerto Rico coast.  Since then I've been listening for tidbits like this.  Just startpage "region 3 warning" and a bunch of stuff comes up.

       That's an interesting point. What I find more fascinating is that this sort of thing always happens on /conspiracy. Is the post or comment a government shill attempting to sway the debate this way? Or is it a real post/comment with credible information? It's like we live in the panopticon, and we can send and receive messages to the other prisoners, but we don't know if it's a guard or inmate that we're talking to.

       That whole area has been a hot bed of speculation the last few weeks on all the forums, something about FEMA section #3 and I guess it goes hot starting tomorrow. Not really buying into it, no offense but, the last few yrs. have been loaded with uncle threads and not one of them has held up. But still a sucker for them though, thanks.

       i know this is kind of unrelated, but i go to school in honolulu and they have been doing a TON of military drills recently (like over the past couple of weeks). huge helicopters flying across the city almost daily in groups of 2-4 (a couple of days ago there were at least 6), and i've seen quite a few very large military planes taking off from hickam AFB lately...

       What did your uncle recommend you do? Obviously he wanted to warn you, but if he literally knew no details as you say, it seems to me that by talking to your family he is only raising unfounded fears/putting his job at risk for some sort of confidentiality breach.  But did he just tell you be prepared to move west... just in case?  I just struggle to follow the motivation of your uncle, especially to react so adversely to apparently such little evidence.  I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and if this is serious and not a joke, I would say don't worry.  If shit didn't go down in 2012, no one can predict when things will go down.

       I don't know if anybody has mentioned this but I live in the DC Metropolitan area and I ride the metro to go to work everyday(except the days I get off). I have noticed that their really is no security and blowing up metro trains would be a fairly easy task to accomplish. This information just worries me that their could be a possible "terrorist" attack a.k.a the government blowing up the metro and blaming it on a country which they wish to invade. Syria? Iran? I don't know maybe this is al BS but I have been thinking about it a lot lately and want to get a car soon cause it worries me.

       about a nationwide blackout drill that many corporations are taking place in. It also suggests that an ex-CIA official about missing a flare from the sun, by a week, that would have fried our power grid. Maybe this is what they are preparing for. It explains the electrical tests on the ships. I have the idea that maybe they are trying to prompt a revolt in order to get rid of a large mass of the nations population but its just an idea.

       The thing about the sun is that it has pretty much been laying dormant and still is so there was no truth to what he was saying. It is thought that it was a form of doublespeak referring to the blackout drill.

       When the government lays people off in a situation like this, it is called a furlough. Sorry, but it is what it is. They are not laid off because technically they are still Federal employees, they just aren't getting paid. Your uncle works for the DOD, so there's a 50% chance he'll be furloughed. Because he isn't in some operation situation, it's actually more likely. So give him a call. He's probably at a bar somewhere, drinking his problems away.

       I live in this area, actually closer to where we house a number of heavy munitions. This area has 10s of thousands of civil service and military. We have 7 or 8 military bases in a 60 mile radius. Shit will likely hit the fan. My mother in law is fucking furious as she is a civil servant. Will it be a revolution? Likely not.

       Just my opinion, but if I were the  government, I would be keeping an eye on r/conspiracy. I think the fact that this post remains up is a sign its probably not true.

       I think it's the government spreading fear within their own ranks. They know that the people are slowly awakening and won't take this much longer. They basically know their gig is up.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't mean though that there will be violence or "uprisings" or any kind of turmoil except for the high-level perpetrators being arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many influential people in the know and they are trying to make this transition as smoothly as possible. Of course the "bad guys" have plans to turn it into something terrible, but they will not succeed.

       Was just down in va beach for work and I know there are a ton of bases but there were fighter jets doing training all day while I was there. Touch and goes and more advanced flying. Could be normal for the area(east of Norfolk) but I'm going back tomorrow so I will let you know if its still happening, maybe I'll ask some locals if it's normal procedure.

       Definitely normal procedure. Jets flying in and out of Oceana Air Base are a regular thing, locals call it "the sound of freedom" and barely acknowledge it outside of a few "I ♡ Jet Noise" bumper stickers.

       I'd guess the DOD is worried about the citizen reaction to the shutdown.  If it goes on too long you're going to have 800k people on furlough, and a lot of businesses put out due to the reduced government activity.  Protests - even armed ones - are possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, part of the DOD's pidgin is predicting how politics shake out.

       I think that the most likely possibility is a nuke false flag attack on the East Coast. This will provide the reason for an attack on Syria/Iran, and stimulate the US economy. The stimulus has been sucked up by the Banksters and the economy is dead in the water. The Fed can't taper. There is no industry left. They are trying to reinflate the housing market, but they are not having much luck with it. The only thing left is the only thing that they know how to do, which is wage war. They also want what oil is left in the ME. It might be something little like an electrical grid shut-down, but to really scare the sheeple, a nuke would do the trick! I can almost hear the TV talking heads calling for all true American boys to sign up to fight in Iran to save the US from Islamic aggression.....

       What an interesting thread! I live in virginia beach. My parents are both DoD employees. I work for the enemy MSM ;) and my boyfriend is in a Navy helicopter squadron. 
My mother was sent home from work yesterday as she is a non-essential civilian. My father's work will continue. Neither was warned of any uprisings or anything other than the fact that they won't be paid. My boyfriend is active-duty and has been at work. No suspicious helicopter movements around here. They're always flying around. However, many squadrons are prepping to replace those that are already deployed AND prepping for winter so there's a little more activity but nothing is say is out of the ordinary. 
I guess since I work for the MSM though, everyone assumes government puppet strings are controlling me anyway. But really, it's not like that at all.

       Youtube, confirming the electric comet if you are interested in comet ISON.  This is a new comet that has never been into the inner solar system so it is caring a large negative charge, when it comes into the positively charged environment of the sun it should really brighten up, we pass through the comet debris tail in January, but nothing bad will happen, just a really good show and confirmation for the electrical aspects of comets.

       Virginia Beach? Ahg....I live in Hampton. Can't really see what the problem in this area would be, though. Aside from Langley AFB there isn't much here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: And the Norfolk Naval Weapons Station etc. But still, I wouldn't see these as what I would call high value targets to potential terrorists out there. We didn't get targeted during 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: If this potentially has something to do with the gov. shutdown, I sincerely doubt anything will come of it. Either they will fix it fast or the workers will just sit on their asses and do nothing (except now they won't get paid for it).

       Yeah, but none of it is centrally located. It's all miles and miles apart from each other. It wouldn't be like the white house or the pentagon, where it's all in one place. In my mind it just isn't ideal.

       I think it could be linked to the "government shut-down" that is inevitable. I hate to say this as an independent conservative, but this government shut down, if long enough could cause a catastrophe.

       I had a cushy job as a DoD contractor with the highest clearance.  I left the DoD and joined the non-DoD work force in the states.  I left for two main reasons...  first, the gubbment's actions went against my morale beliefs...  second...  there are better opportunities out there when you no longer support the agendas nor believe what your "boss" is doing, is right.

       All of us medically uninsured people are going to revolt because of the next phase of Obamacare going into effect.  Don't worry, it won't last long because we won't be getting treated at any hospitals after the uprising due to fear of going into debt further so we'll just bleed out.

       keep in mind I only looked for 5 minutes through old posts here, there is definitetly going to be hundreds more threads about predictions based upon very vague information from an anonymous internet poster who heard it from their distant family member

       A guy I went to summer camp with works for the DOD, stranger things can happen.  And for what it's worth, he works on the east coast and hasn't said anything similar to OP.  In fact he's quite jovial about the possible government shutdown.

       I would love for you to find this story anywhere else. In fact, I challenge you to do it. I have no idea what "lop" is. If you aren't going to contribute to this thread then don't comment. I understand that none of you know me and shouldn't trust everything you read, but I have no reason to make a story like this up. Anyways, I would love a link to this "very uncle story" from a couple of years ago.

       So based on this, the furloughs you speak of may be unrelated to the bill the Senate is voting on now. I wonder how many other government furloughs happened today. I attempted a google search, but can't sift through all the current shutdown mess.  I wonder if they're hiding something. It just seems like something is going on. I can see and smell it all over the politicians and anchors.

This, coupled with the common knowledge that it entails a three-hop process to track all individuals should provide you with the storage dedicated to any given user - given, again, that you're a math genius.
