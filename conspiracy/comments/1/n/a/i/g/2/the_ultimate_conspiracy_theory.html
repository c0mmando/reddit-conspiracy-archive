       Okay guys, I have to admit I'm a bit high right now. But let me propose the ultimate conspiracy theory to you. Fucking get this: there is in fact an inner circle of powerful people who run the world. You know who they are: the Bushes, the Clintons, the Gates, all the families of politicians and billionaires. You think these people acquired their positions through merit, or perhaps luck? Ha. Fuck no. They, and families like theirs, have been in charge for a very long time. They've been in power and they're gonna stay in power. Democracy is a complete and total lie. Who counts the votes? You think they would let someone truly disinterested and unbiased do that? No, the inner circle will decide that. It doesn't matter who wins anyway. Democrats and Republicans? They are both complete fabrications. They've figured out our psychology - that some people are more open-minded and curious (liberals), while others are close-minded (conservatives). They created these two parties in order to make these two groups of people feel "represented," when in fact, they are anything but. Only the inner circle of billionaires is represented. It's a brilliant strategy: divide and conquer the masses by turning them against each other: liberals versus conservatives. Why do you think the conflict between rich and poor is so absent in the mainstream media? Do you know who owns the mainstream media? The fucking rich people. Why would they allow any questioning of the fact that their inner circle is in power? They have become fucking geniuses at controlling the 99%. They know how to distract us - Netflix, anyone? Do you know of a better way to complete distract anyone from even
       <em>
        thinking
       </em>
       about revolution? They worked real hard to develop that shit. They have us trained like fucking hamsters. Go to high school, the college, then grad school, then get your "real job." You think rich people care about that shit? Fuck no, they've got trust funds, bitch. They invented this whole "career" thing to keep you working for the man. Again, they've figured out your psychology, by studying Freud and shit. They've even come up with strategies to deal with us misfits and malcontents. Yes, I'm proposing that reddit is in fact a government experiment. It is a way to completely waste our time with inane bullshit - otherwise, all of us together might have started a revolution. The NSA was designed specifically to spy on
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       . The NSA scandal? Edward Snowden? That was designed to scare us, to keep us from becoming too radical. You never know when the government might be listening, so you think twice before saying anything too radical. If you marched on the streets in protest, you are a fucking idiot, because you just identified yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything you assume to be true about society and the government is an elaborately constructed lie. You think you are an equal citizen, that you have an equal right to vote which soldiers shed blood to win? You were never an equal citizen. You are a slave. The 99% works purely for the benefit of the 1%. It has always been that way, and it always will be...unless we we realize this truth. And that's the truth that the 1% so desperately wants us to prevent us from realizing. The 99% is a lot of fucking people, and they can easily overwhelm, through sheer physical force, the tiny elite 1%. The elite position is actually fairly precarious. That's why they want to keep you distracted at all costs. Under no circumstances should you think about revolution, or rich versus poor. Even thinking about such things is kind of a revolutionary act. They will try
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       to keep you from thinking about that. You can't trust anything that you regard as "given" in our technologically advanced society. Television and the internet were not invented by mere chance. They are the result of decades of feverish study by government-funded science. What's the rush? They had to invent something to distract us before it was too late. People were striking in the factories in the 1920's. Now - not so much. The new generation does not have the memory of mankind's former freedom. So they are easier to control. It must be really convenient for those rich bastards. To have us all working to serve them.

       I agree with you OP, however the real elite are not the politicians and administration - those are just puppets. The true ruling party is a shadow government operating in the same way a secret society does, with degrees of separation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overthrowing the government would not remove the shadow government, who would infiltrate any revolutionary movement that grew big enough to be a threat anyway, so that they would control any new government that replaced the current one.

       I have played with that perception, but just can't get on board. I see it as a small few hold the secrets of thousands of years of scientific advancement in all areas. Once society got to advanced they lost control, so they trigger wars to knock society back to the stone/dark age. Then erase history, keeping themselves super advanced while everyone else is figuring the same stuff out over again from scratch. With guidance they control the advancement. And that is why certain scientific things are off limits if a scientist wants to keep his career. Like curing illness, free energy, antigravity, microwave mind control....

       Except for all the billionaires like Steve Jobs, Larry Page, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk among others who generated their wealth through tenacity, ambition, and hard work. In regards to wealthy families, someone had to earn that wealth e.g. Andrew Carnegie was an incredible businessman. But then what excuse would we have for why we are wherever we are in our lives.

       Wow thank you brother for starting up a conversation the likes of which should be had daily on this forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see why so many brothers posting here are averted to the idea that we are slaves.  In fact, knowing that I'm a slave makes me extremely excited, because having realized my chains I'm now in the process of breaking them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't know how so many brothers posting here consider our possession of ultimately useless toys created by distant techno-gods such as TVs, video games, etc. marks a high standard of free living.  To my eyes, that shows more honest contemplation of the human condition must be taken up.  Your 'standards' keep you locked in a frame.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is my dear brothers we are all slaves of some sort.  Whether it's to debt, to drugs, to TV, to the internet, to whatever, all of us are fallible and can easily be swayed, manipulated, programmed what have you by the slightest pressure point.  Why do you think having a voluptuous 2D woman staring at you from a billboard is such a timeless way of getting someone to do something suggested to them?  These pressure points stem from realms of unenlightened impulse within our own psyche.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you become defensive or agitated when someone calls your attention to your slavery, YOU ARE A SLAVE.  A real free human is aware of themselves.  A real free human would not argue with the man who calls him a slave, because a real free human would take that as a blessed reminder to further understand the nature of freedom, and to have gratitude for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       See my brothers, we are all locked up in the hull of a sinking ship.  The storm of our lives is upon us.  If some of you want to debate the finer intellectual qualities of what it means to be a slave while you're locked up naked in the dark of a sinking ship, you have your free will.  Nonetheless, I want to work with those brothers who simply hate chains, who can smell the beautiful ocean salt from the cracks in the woods, and who remember they know how to swim.

       I agree with the sentiment, but I think some things may be exaggerated.  The battle is not over, the battle is being fought.  There are always issues with entropy, where things break down, different moving parts, people and economies and things are volatile.  It's like running a business, but how many business continue to grow and grow for decades and decades?  They get stagnant, resources and power shift, etc.  Also, there are always different competitors. There are other factions in the world that want total power--there are continual entities, people, and allegiances to be bought and paid for.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I believe you are right in the sense that we have hit critical mass, and enough power and resources have been combined such that the  puppets of public perception outnumber the innocents on the stage.  At this point, we are probably too far gone without drastic effort and regular people uniting our forces which can outnumber and overwhelm the concentrated elitists.
      </p>
      <p>
       They may use everything in their arsenal, but not everything is controlled like that: they didn't invent science and technology and the field of psychology--all of that was not their tools of creation.  Of course they pervert it and use it against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the point of Microsoft.  What you see there, in the behavior of collusion and repressing competitors--that is just a sad side note of something that pretty much all business end up doing--which is a miserable thing to do of course--but it's because they stop innovating.  You could say Microsoft died, and the remaining shell of the company simply exists to control their piece of the pie and fight off all competitors at all costs and stranglehold their customers in the process. Sadly every company pretty much switches to this philosophy once they get a piece of the pie.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, the true globalists, elitists, world governors--we really don't know their names. We may know a few, the Bush family and associates, but we don't know most of them by name.

       That last point about workers striking in the factories, they went on strike because they were working 12-13 hour days in dangerous positions, often seeing (on average, if I remember correctly) one co worker die every day.

       Yes. I've always thought that the pioneers were looking to gather into like-minded groups. I mean, I could, I'd build an area for all the "rule makers" to live in, if they would promise not to "make rules" outside their circle/territory.

       They really haven't.  Microsoft has hindered the progression of computing more than anything.  Bastardizing standards, charging for what should be free, and knowingly releasing buggy/problematic software are just a few of the long list of things they have done to slow progression.

       Loses face with you maybe.  Others, not so much.  I don't care how he comes to realize the truth.  And it's spelled "legal", not legel.  Have you ever had an epiphany while drinking?  And no, I

       Actually I would say that most of my realisations about life, the universe and everything else have been when I was high. Then I take those ideas and run them over/ research sober to see if I was right.  I find that cannabis in my personal experience (and I have smoked for about 12 years on and off) is a very good bullshit detector and its only the stigma that alters your view. We need to rid the stigma in my opinion... but thats just my experience

       Simply because you will be a victim of violence if you refuse to follow the rules. Don't pay rent? Eventually someome will come remove you.with violence. Want to build a house in the woods? Same thing. Take crops growing in the ground to avoid starving? Same thing. The whole system from top to bottom is built on violence and the only way to oppose it in any meaningful way is to send it back up the heirarchy.

       Yes, but essentially. If you decide you're a slave (which you are) and you don't want to live as a slave any longer, it is nearly impossible to eventually not find yourself in a position to be a victim of violence. That was my point. We are all slaves. And we are all kept in line by the looming threat of violence.

        they get wealth is exchange for labour. That's not slavery.

      <p>
       Except it is when the vast majority of people only get enough wealth from their labour to ensure they are able to continue to work for the one percents benefit - They are only given enough wealth for food, shelter, transport and some mindless entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       This really isn't very different to ancient slavery. A slave was still provided food and shelter and the tools to carry out his work, the only difference is that today we have to buy all this ourselves with worthless monopoly money that the banks can print at will. It's an illusion to make us think we aren't slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose you would have made the same arguments back then to justify your own slavery as you are now - "but the boss gives me food! And shelter! It's mutually beneficial!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost every single country, and government in the world is in debt to elite banking families. This debt is incurring interest at a far higher rate than it is being repaid. - Do you understand what this means?

       Democracy is a sham. We are debt-slaves to a system we cannot change.

       You're correct that this is not the cause of the free market.  That's due to there not being a free market; it doesn't exist, never has and never will.  Due to the incredible advantage that comes from being a gangster over the alternative, as soon as a market is established it is fettered for the advantage of one gangster over any other interest (fair or foul)- and this is how and why the State is inevitable, as it is merely gangsterism with the illusion of legitimacy.

       They really haven't.  Microsoft has hindered the progression of computing more than anything.  Bastardizing standards, charging for what should be free, and knowingly releasing buggy/problematic software are just a few of the long list of things they have done to slow progression.
