<p>So I&#39;m gonna just assume aspergers here. A big part of <em>accusations</em> is that <strong>they don&#39;t come with a fucking disclaimer.</strong> </p>

<p><a href="/r/niggers">/r/niggers</a> was supposedly banned for vote brigading. SRS has been doing that LITERALLY the entire time it has existed. They are notorious for it. You can almost immediately tell when SRS has linked a thread in their subreddit.</p>

<p><a href="/r/creepshots">/r/creepshots</a> was supposedly banned for taking photos of girls without their consent. I believe there was one suggestion that one of the girls was underage, despite nothing in the picture actually being illegal. CFP does the same thing. Its the same subreddit. <em>I&#39;m not saying, I&#39;m just saying.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt that will happen. The subs that got banned were banned because of TOS violations (or in the case of <a href="/r/niggers">/r/niggers</a>, because one small sub was disproportionately filling the rest of reddit with hate speech). <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a pretty big community to swing the banhammer at unless the admins had some kind of good reason to do it. Pretty sure we would have heard about it if such a thing was looming. And we haven&#39;t. So carry on, I suppose.</p>

<p>And while we&#39;re on that- if you see anyone doing something that violates the TOS here- something that could threaten the subreddit itself, shoot me a message and I&#39;ll look into it.</p>

<p>Did anyone else notice this? </p>

<p>I thought they might be setting up a buffer in case sensitive material is posted they&#39;d have 10 minutes to delete it, but there could well be a more mundane reason for it.</p>

<p>I made a controversial comment early on in a big news story thread, which wound up being 100% correct. My next 40 comments went completely unnoticed in a subreddit where every comment I make garners a response.</p>

<p>My comments were hidden. Period. I don&#39;t care how it happened. I don&#39;t care if there is a different kind of shadow ban that people are not yet aware of, but it is not even remotely in question that my comments in that subreddit were being hidden. </p>

<p>Hopefully, if that does occur, we individuals move on to another subreddit.

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> won&#39;t be banned. It will be destroyed from within through shills and false flags. All you really need to do is infiltrate this sub and popularize ridiculous and inane BS. Never let this subreddit gain any credibility and constantly torpedo real and meaningful discussions. Attacking from the outside is too blatant and ineffective, the best way to destroy something is to do it with the help of an insider. So I guess we&#39;ll have to wait to see which one of our moderators are compromised.</p>
