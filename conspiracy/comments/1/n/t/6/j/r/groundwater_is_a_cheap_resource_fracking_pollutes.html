<p>I&#39;m just suggesting that it&#39;s likely that many people view the pollution produced by fracking as an opportunity, not a problem.</p>

<p>When most of the groundwater in the USA is undrinkable, then people will have to buy it elsewhere, and there&#39;s a lot of good in that for people who own bottling plants.</p>

<p>I meant cheap to extract.</p>

<p>No, it would be pretty hard to kill all species.</p>

<p>It might kill us off, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that if you view Agenda 21 through the lens of government control and the lockdown of resources that could allow people to be independent then it makes perfect sense.  With this perspective it makes sense to simply tell people that they can&#39;t use land and then with water the easiest approach is to pollute it so that it is not usable unless one purchases technology to clean it.</p>

<p>When heavily polluted water is the common experience then quite a number of people will be buying from a centralized water factory.  Hell then add in health standards and protocols for the cleaning of the water and anyone else creating competing water solutions can be shut down.</p>

<p>That&#39;s illegal in many states.</p>

<p>And, in any case, many homeowners don&#39;t have much of &quot;their own land&quot; to call their own ... if fracking poisons municipal supplies, then there might be an opportunity for corporations to step in and lend a hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oil comes from the same reservoirs as ground water. The oil itself is decomposed life from such reservoirs. This fracking scandal thing is simply Exxon trying to strengthen their hold on the oil market. That&#39;s because Exxon sells it&#39;s reservoirs as soon as they need any secondary recovery. Fracking is done by small businesses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These water supplies are ALREADY &quot;polluted&quot;, did you read my comment even? Where the fuck do you think oil comes from? Water reservoirs. Even fresh water lakes have oil in them, oil is a natural substance. You have oil all over your body and without it you would shrivel up like a sun dried tomato. </p>

<p>Secondary recovery is when the reservoir is already dead, by this time the reservoir was already owned by a big oil company like shell or exxon. Then it was sold to various smaller businesses, so that shell/exonn can move on to other BIG projects. Who then water flood, and eventually frack. </p>

<p>Fracking is not for big fish. Big fish simply drill brand new reservoirs that have been untouched, like Horizon... </p>
