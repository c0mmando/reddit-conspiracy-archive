<p>You may want to see how many edits these wiki pages get in the coming weeks. I was under the impression that only the president can sign treaties. And only treaties that don&#39;t infringe on the constitution are actually valid..</p>

<p>Also congress is supposed to vote on almost all treaties in some form or fashion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t this sub be for this treaty? Aren&#39;t you guys supposed to be against countries sending weapons to conflict zones and playing dumb? Aren&#39;t you guys constantly railing against the U.S for selling weapons overseas or sending them to rebels?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/03/world/arms-trade-treaty-approved-at-un.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/03/world/arms-trade-treaty-approved-at-un.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>proponents say the treaty would for the first time force sellers to consider how their customers will use the weapons and to make that information public. The goal is to curb the sale of weapons that kill tens of thousands of people every year — by, <strong>for example, making it harder for Russia to argue that its arms deals with Syria are legal under international law.</strong></p>

<p>“It will help reduce the risk that international transfers of conventional arms will be used to carry out the world’s worst crimes, including terrorism, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes,”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are concerned about the 2nd amendment, it will have no effect:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a bow to American concerns, the preamble states that it is focused on international sales, not traditional domestic use</p>
</blockquote>

<p>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The National Rifle Association and other American gun-rights advocacy groups still object to the treaty, contending it infringes on the Second Amendment. They have vowed that it would never be ratified by the Senate, <strong>even though language in the final draft specifies that nothing in the treaty could infringe on any nation’s constitutional rights.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>even though the language in the final draft specifies that nothing in the treaty could infringe on any nation&#39;s constitutional rights</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that is true. Our constitution says something similar. It says that no law shall be passed that is counter to the constitution, and such a law would be null and void. Yet, that is not stopping the gun-control advocates from trying to pass legislation that would infringe upon the second amendment.</p>

<p>to avoid confusion or the possibility of diction warfare, i will include the oxford dictionarys definition of &quot;infringe.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>verb (infringes, infringing, infringed)
[with object]
actively break the terms of (a law, agreement, etc.):
making an unauthorized copy would infringe copyright
act so as to limit or undermine (something); encroach on:
his legal rights were being infringed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The key here is the term &quot;limit.&quot; </p>

<p>So, with that said, it seems appropriate to be suspicious of the ATT, and the agenda of those who are for it. The majority of which are the gun-control advocates. Regardless of the few lines in the legislature that says no nations constitutional rights should be infringed upon, those who are for gun control can and most likely will use the ATT as another weapon for their agenda--a segway for another excuse to limit our second amendment rights. Its not farfetched to believe they will use the ATT to state that we need to conform to &quot;international law&quot; and limit our gun rights.</p>

<p>this is where people are having a problem with the ATT. And, as a note, most people who are against the ATT are also against crimes against humanity and the laundering of weapons to tyrants to use against unarmed citizens. Just because they are against one provision in a very large piece of legislature, doesnt mean they are against stopping weapons from getting into the wrong hands. To believe so would be the definitionbof ignorance.</p>

<p>Somehow you completely missed the definition of conservatism and are severely misguided. Pop open a dictionary and look up &quot;conservatism&quot;. Elimination of government is an anarchical idea, NOT of that of a conservative</p>

<p>Secondly, show me 1 senator, congressman or representative from the past 40 years that said they are for the elimination of government. Clearly someone like yourself should have no problem finding a plethora of examples.</p>

<p>Somehow you have missed the entire conservative/Republican message of the last 40 years, eliminate government, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Somehow you completely missed the definition of conservatism and are severely misguided. Pop open a dictionary and look up &quot;conservatism&quot;. Elimination of government is an anarchical idea, NOT of that of a conservative</p>

<p>Secondly, show me 1 senator, congressman or representative from the past 40 years that said they are for the elimination of government. Clearly someone like yourself should have no problem finding a plethora of examples.</p>

<p>grant states rights to not accept certain parts of the U. S. Constitution</p>

<p>You do understand how the Constitution works, dont you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>religion for example</p>

<p>Religion isnt even the Constitution.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Youre clearly trolling or were dropped on your head as an infant and am not going to even use a single braincell to further respond to your comment and give it validity. every word dripped from your lips is completely incorrect. I dont have the time to have some child with a 3rd grade understanding of the Constitution and politics actually dictate to me about history</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>even though the language in the final draft specifies that nothing in the treaty could infringe on any nation&#39;s constitutional rights</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that is true. Our constitution says something similar. It says that no law shall be passed that is counter to the constitution, and such a law would be null and void. Yet, that is not stopping the gun-control advocates from trying to pass legislation that would infringe upon the second amendment.</p>

<p>to avoid confusion or the possibility of diction warfare, i will include the oxford dictionarys definition of &quot;infringe.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>verb (infringes, infringing, infringed)
[with object]
actively break the terms of (a law, agreement, etc.):
making an unauthorized copy would infringe copyright
act so as to limit or undermine (something); encroach on:
his legal rights were being infringed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The key here is the term &quot;limit.&quot; </p>

<p>So, with that said, it seems appropriate to be suspicious of the ATT, and the agenda of those who are for it. The majority of which are the gun-control advocates. Regardless of the few lines in the legislature that says no nations constitutional rights should be infringed upon, those who are for gun control can and most likely will use the ATT as another weapon for their agenda--a segway for another excuse to limit our second amendment rights. Its not farfetched to believe they will use the ATT to state that we need to conform to &quot;international law&quot; and limit our gun rights.</p>

<p>this is where people are having a problem with the ATT. And, as a note, most people who are against the ATT are also against crimes against humanity and the laundering of weapons to tyrants to use against unarmed citizens. Just because they are against one provision in a very large piece of legislature, doesnt mean they are against stopping weapons from getting into the wrong hands. To believe so would be the definitionbof ignorance.</p>
