    <div class="md"><p>Number 5 is the most interesting in my opinion if you read the whole article.  In the case of every shooting, the victim had no means to defend themselves.  The criminals were the ones with the firearms.  <del>Also, where did the security guard disappear to?  In 12 years no one has seen this man?  Was there ever even an attempt to alert the nation to be on the lookout?</del>  Everyone said it was uncharacteristic of him.  From what I read, he seemed to have known what he was doing, especially for someone so young.</p>

<p>Edit:  <a href="http://murderpedia.org/male.F/f/ferguson-joseph.htm">http://murderpedia.org/male.F/f/ferguson-joseph.htm</a></p>

<p>&quot;Status: Committed suicide by shooting himself after a high-speed chase and police shootout on September 10, 2001&quot;</p>

<p>Edit 2:  It gets even weirder -</p>

<p>&quot;Burns officials said Ferguson was suspended after his ex-girlfriend, fellow security guard Nina Susu, said he vandalized her car after their breakup. The officials also notified the FBI that Ferguson might be dangerous because he made threats after the suspension. An FBI check revealed Ferguson had no history of violence and nothing was done.&quot;</p>

<p>Edit 3: I&#39;m just going to post the highlights of this article different from the OP</p>

<p>&quot;As Sacramento authorities frantically searched for rampaging killer Joseph Ferguson, police and Burns officials evacuated employees from their homes and escorted them to safe houses. However Ferguson did appear in the home of a Burns supervisor who had not been evacuated where he filmed a video suicide note before killing the supervisor and stealing his car. In the video, Ferguson said he would soon kill himself. &quot;I&#39;ve taken four victims, this should be good enough to last about a week on the news. It&#39;s time to feed the news media.&quot;</p>
