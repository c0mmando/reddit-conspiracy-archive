    <div class="md"><p>Well,, you could do what I did.  Spend around 6 hours a day for 10 years reading about it (stopped doing that a few years ago), then you get a pretty good BS detector and enough facts to say why  you believe (or don&#39;t) what you do (or don&#39;t) and you also know when to say: &quot;Maybe, I don&#39;t know.&quot;  Just don&#39;t ask someone to wave a magic word-wand and then you can know what some people spend their lifetimes working out.</p>

<p>And yes, Alex Jones is a liar who is probably doing this largely to make people who question the official line look crazy.</p>

I found most to be utter nonsense but a few I found to be very interesting.  Nothing from AJ was any good.  It&#39;s just hyperparanoia.  Thanks for the input.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You shouldn&#39;t believe Alex Jones because he&#39;s about 20 miles past nonsense into the &quot;intentionally misleading bullshit&quot; zone.  He&#39;s a tool for the government and powerful people to cover up actual nasty things they do because whenever they do something truly fucked up, like Watergate, or MKULTRA or anything along those lines, there&#39;s a huge community of straw man conspiracy theorists to lump those who have some knowledge of conspiratorial and illegal acts into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to get away from the mind control of the mass media before any of the conspiracies really start to penetrate your politically correct defenses. The media presents a fictional narrative that the public accepts unquestioningly as reality. It becomes their reality. Most of these conspiracy theories don&#39;t fit into this manufactured media reality.</p>

<p>But once you turn off your television for a few months, and stop watching network news, stop reading the newspaper, stop reading news magazines, you can begin to think for yourself, and when you consider these conspiracy theories in that condition, some of them make a lot of good sense. Some of them make a kind of half sense, but still are loaded down with a ton of nonsense. And some of them never make any sense, because they were silly to begin with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you&#39;d do very well to understand that Agent Jones is NOT telling the truth.</p>

<p>He is a disinformation mouthpiece for the Zionists--specifically his employers--Stratfor and rabid Zionist Jeffrey R. Smulyan, CEO of Emmis &#39;Hebrew for Truth&#39; Communications, the owner of Jones&#39; flagship station.</p>

<p>Remember that good disinformation is 90% truth and 10% out-and-out lies. I&#39;m not sure about Agent Jones&#39; percentages but one thing&#39;s for sure...the guy is NOT who he claims to be. He&#39;s just a fountain of more Hasbara disinformation who has been put in his position to discredit people involved in the &quot;conspiracy movement.&quot; Simple as that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See I remember when he first started with the Waco stuff way back in the 90&#39;s and even then there was just something I didn&#39;t feel was right about him.  I honestly kind of put him on par with other extremists.  Plus I&#39;ve found his followers tend to be rather just nuts or druggie nuts.  At least the ones I met were.  Thanks for responding.  I didn&#39;t realize who his employer was and it&#39;s funny because alot of his followers blame jews for everything and here he is getting some hebrew funding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is getting a LOT of Hebrew funding. Like...ALL of his funding that is not provided by the idiots that purchase his shit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m Jewish and I could care less who funds the guy...I wouldn&#39;t care if Adolf Hitler&#39;s relatives financed him...IF what he were saying wasn&#39;t targeted disinformation. Also, it would NOT surprise me one bit if the whole Infowars site is just one big honeypot--as in &quot;these are the people that &#39;we&#39; will go after FIRST.&quot;</p>

<p>I just wish that he&#39;d be honest about it. I wish that he wouldn&#39;t cut off guests/callers if he even gets the <em>hint</em> that Israel may be brought up in a harsh light--then he invariably goes on a tirade about BIG crimes but substitutes the words &quot;Saudi&quot; for &quot;Jewish&quot; and &quot;Saudi Arabia&quot; for &quot;Israel.&quot;</p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t know that Agent Jones is fully allowed under right of return laws to become an Israeli citizen <em>whenever he wants to</em> thanks to his 100% Jewish wife. So if/when TSHTF and he needs to escape the US you know where HE&#39;LL be going, but of course. He does EVERYTHING that he can so that he doesn&#39;t piss off his Zionist bosses and fellow future countrymen.</p>

<p>Please also note that Agent J did NOT &quot;infiltrate&quot; Bohemian Grove--his bossman Jeffrey Smulyan (CEO of Emmis &#39;Hebrew for Truth&#39; Communications) is a member and attends the &quot;Cremation of Care&quot; ceremonies annually.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just like when he panicked hundreds of thousands of Americans on 12/31/99 when he announced on his show that &quot;Russian ICBMs&quot; were inbound and that the world was about to end. </p>

<p>Or what about his little stunt <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-PzvWJE_sE">here</a> where he disrupts a peaceful pro-second Amendment rally for no good reason whatsoever??</p>

<p>This man, more than any &quot;public citizen&quot; I have ever encountered, just <em>screams</em> COINTELPRO. There is literally no doubt about it. Good disinformation is, of course, at least partially true, so if you have a very good bullshit detector (and can deal with the fat gasbag&#39;s voice) you CAN get some good info from his show. However, this information is VERY hidden and tough to find by design.</p>

<p>I think that it&#39;s best to let it go at this: he&#39;s a bullshit artist, he is Zionist-controlled, he lives in a fucking MANSION (do you? Neither do I.), and is being paid VERY well by Stratfor/Emmis...who, if you think about it, simply STEALS their money from the USA in the form of $20 million per DAY in cash (and FAR more when the weapon and durable goods are accounted for) in the form of &quot;aid for Israel.&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing that we can do about Israel&#39;s continual theft from the US and the FACT that Israeli/Jewish citizens are actively TRYING to destroy this country...however, we CAN spread the word about Agent Jones in the hopes that he stops becoming filthy rich on the backs of suckers that, just because they hear ONE true thing on his &quot;show,&quot; assume that it must ALL be true--when IRL it&#39;s completely the other way &#39;round.</p>

<p>tl;dr--Agent Jones is COINTELPRO disinformation--funded by Zionists and technically an ISRAELI citizen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate even MORE that you took the time to read it; it&#39;s always my pleasure to let people know the truth about Agent Jones.</p>

<p>Bill Cooper was completely right--he&#39;s a bullshit artist, a windbag, a &quot;plant&quot; put out there to make people think that anybody who doesn&#39;t &quot;buy&quot; the official BS about 9/11, Sandy Hook, etc. is simply &quot;like that Jones guy&quot;--out and out nuts.</p>

<p>Even if I wasn&#39;t 100% sure about him and his motives I certainly WOULD have been after the Piers Morgan interview. He literally went COMPLETELY out of his way to look as batshit crazy as possible...the only &quot;worse&quot; thing that could have happened in that interview would have been if he actually physically assaulted Morgan--and if you remember he came VERY close--actually asking him to fight!</p>

<p>What an idiot. Still, I don&#39;t pity him; he&#39;s making BANK. I pity the people that scrimp on their kids&#39; birthday presents so they can afford the useless shit that he hawks on that train-wreck of a radio show that he has. THEY think that they are &quot;awake&quot; when, in actuality, its they that are the most asleep.</p>

<p>Cheers to you sir and thanks again for the intelligent conversation. I give thanks for people like you who can see through the misdirections thrown in our faces (like Agent Jones) and aren&#39;t afraid to ask questions...especially, as in Jones&#39; case, when the trail of money leads right back to a shitty little piece of stolen and occupied land in the Middle East.</p>
