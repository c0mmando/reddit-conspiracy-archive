        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Well if anyone didn&#39;t know yet that the politics mods are a bunch of democratic operatives, now you know.</p>

<p>They have blatantly and secretly banned reason.com without any public info or comments as to why they have banned the libertarian website. Could it be they don&#39;t want real stories about the NSA, TSA, Checkpoint, unconstitutional wars, and the fact that the left-right paradigm is a cattle slaughter and people were reading reason.com and getting out of the delusion, out of the matrix of control and leaving their democratic tagline, becoming independant liberty minded people?</p>

<p>I sure think so, they&#39;ve also banned a lot of smaller libertarian leaning websites as well, which is just outright censorship, pure and naked, they are literally democratic party operatives who get paid. This needs to be exposed and all of the mods there ousted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why? I mean what is so special about the Koch that globalists like Warren Buffett and his globalist whore wife get people drooling over them, George Soros never being mentioned, Bloomberg being adored as some saint or whatever, but people who actually aren&#39;t globalist, who don&#39;t want insider trading, who don&#39;t want high taxes, who don&#39;t want giant government, who aren&#39;t perfect and who&#39;s business practices may not be heavenly, but who need to compete in a certain way to stay in business get all this hate?</p>

<p>I mean there are a lot bigger evils than them, while not perfect the Koch brothers haven&#39;t funded war, haven&#39;t funded regime change, haven&#39;t supported one world government, haven&#39;t funded globalist missions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, and IDK what power the mods actually have as far as access to personal information (email addresses, passwords, etc) but I got into a pretty heated exchange a while back on there with my old account and woke up the next day with a deleted account, a changed password on my email and a twitter account that was deleted.</p>

<p>Nobody has that information but a few websites and I doubt ESPN fantasy insider hacked my accounts for losing every fantasy game. So idk, I&#39;ve had my doubts about the legitimacy of the mods over there and they may not be able to get that information but I think it&#39;s a little suspicious that after a few hours or bickering with liberals that I wake up the next day to all that shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Censorship&quot; is specifically a <em>government</em> action. A private enterprise - no matter how &quot;publicly&quot; used - that is making editorial choices is not &quot;censoring&quot; anyone. It may seem unreasonable, but Reddit has as much of right to ban certain political opinions from being linked as, say, Facebook has to ban nude photos. (If Reddit was banning reason.com links because of government pressure or legislation, that <em>would</em> be censorship.)</p>
