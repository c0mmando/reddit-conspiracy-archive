       Well if anyone didn't know yet that the politics mods are a bunch of democratic operatives, now you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have blatantly and secretly banned reason.com without any public info or comments as to why they have banned the libertarian website. Could it be they don't want real stories about the NSA, TSA, Checkpoint, unconstitutional wars, and the fact that the left-right paradigm is a cattle slaughter and people were reading reason.com and getting out of the delusion, out of the matrix of control and leaving their democratic tagline, becoming independant liberty minded people?
      </p>
      <p>
       I sure think so, they've also banned a lot of smaller libertarian leaning websites as well, which is just outright censorship, pure and naked, they are literally democratic party operatives who get paid. This needs to be exposed and all of the mods there ousted.

       Yeah, they are the bad guys, the main stream media said so and they always tell us square and never try to distract us with boogie men and since we don't think for ourselves we just believe whatever we're told.

       No, but even if they did what does it matter? They are one the biggest supporters of libertarian ideas, guess to be mainstream you have to be collectivist and communist these days.

       Why? I mean what is so special about the Koch that globalists like Warren Buffett and his globalist whore wife get people drooling over them, George Soros never being mentioned, Bloomberg being adored as some saint or whatever, but people who actually aren't globalist, who don't want insider trading, who don't want high taxes, who don't want giant government, who aren't perfect and who's business practices may not be heavenly, but who need to compete in a certain way to stay in business get all this hate?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean there are a lot bigger evils than them, while not perfect the Koch brothers haven't funded war, haven't funded regime change, haven't supported one world government, haven't funded globalist missions.

       They just spend their time impoverishing the American people with their shitty cheap goods from shitty Chinese labor camps.  And Bloomberg is a fucking piece of shit too (I've spoken out against stop and frisk and his anti gun laws too, but you assumed that "liberals" must be too stupid). But guess what, Warren Buffett and Soros might be rich as fuck but they acknowledge the class warfare, and that's better than your astroturfing tea party fuckwads who want to see us buying their economy class shit products the rest of our lives. They can speak out against big government but the only reason they say that is to fool idiots like you so they can take advantage of the American worker and the American populace while they gut that "communist" red tape.

       Yea, and IDK what power the mods actually have as far as access to personal information (email addresses, passwords, etc) but I got into a pretty heated exchange a while back on there with my old account and woke up the next day with a deleted account, a changed password on my email and a twitter account that was deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody has that information but a few websites and I doubt ESPN fantasy insider hacked my accounts for losing every fantasy game. So idk, I've had my doubts about the legitimacy of the mods over there and they may not be able to get that information but I think it's a little suspicious that after a few hours or bickering with liberals that I wake up the next day to all that shit.

       "Censorship" is specifically a
       <em>
        government
       </em>
       action. A private enterprise - no matter how "publicly" used - that is making editorial choices is not "censoring" anyone. It may seem unreasonable, but Reddit has as much of right to ban certain political opinions from being linked as, say, Facebook has to ban nude photos. (If Reddit was banning reason.com links because of government pressure or legislation, that
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       be censorship.)
