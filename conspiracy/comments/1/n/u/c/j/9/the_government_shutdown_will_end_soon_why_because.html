<p>Still, two major elements of the law remain. Insider trading is illegal, even for members of Congress and the executive branch. And for those who are covered by the now-narrower law, disclosures of large stock trades are required within 45 days. It will just be harder to get to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A pay cut is actually a bad idea.</p>

<p>If anything, they should be paid more.</p>

<p>Hear me out.</p>

<p>If they were paid even less, the only people who could/would become politicians are the already wealthy.</p>

<p>If their pay was on par with, say, what an exceptionally bright young American can make in the finance world, it would attract more intelligent, capable people to choose politics rather than finance and leave less room for the smarmy, fast-talking used car salesman/whore type.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying these fucktards deserve more money. They don&#39;t. But cutting politicians&#39; pay is not a good idea in the long run. It may seem like a good way to punish the current crop of assfucks, but it&#39;ll only hurt you in the end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think a pay cut would make a difference.  The guy I replied to suggested the pay cut.  My position is that their salary doesn&#39;t matter at all.  They don&#39;t make their money by being in Congress (for example).   They make their money by passing laws that benefit/not allowing regulations that&#39;ll hurt people who fund them (corporations).  I understand the point you are making thought.  The only thing I would offer to that is to say that pretty much everyone who wins an election is already wealthy or heavily funded so if you made a million bucks a year being a Senator, you still wouldn&#39;t win that seat unless you already had the money to run.</p>

<p>Term limits can be manipulated by astro-truf. People vote out of fear. They fear abortions or no-abortions. They fear Wire-tapping or not enough law enfrocement. they fear guns or no-guns. They fear religious influence or liberal. It is fear that is driving the voting base. That is the key issue. It is no coincidence that smart technology came out right after  9-11 and after the start of its subsequent wars. We were adrenaline junkies because we were in   constant state of fear. So, to prevent us from talking about it, they gave us really neat and entertaining gizmos that helped fuel our state of alert.. So here we are, most of us still attached to our smart technology (it is nice) and not talking about what happened to us. </p>

If they are not in there long enough to get these cushy positions, they are more inclined to work for the people. Here is an Idea: When someone is elected, their possessions are sold off and the money put into the over all economy. If we are going to treat America like a for profit corporation, then the assholes making decisions that affect the outcome need to have more at stake. We all do well, they do well. Everything crashes and burns, thy lose it all. We call that incentive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over half of congress should be tried for treason against the American people.</p>

<p>They&#39;re corrupt hypocritical liar thieves who pretend to have morals by CLAIMING to be Christian republicans that would &quot;never do such things&quot;.</p>

<p>But they&#39;re snakes like the devil himself.</p>

<p>Hell, even if you don&#39;t believe in hell or the devil or God, you can&#39;t deny that there are people who do believe in all of that and worship either God or Lucifer.</p>

<p>That being said, there are quite a few people in positions of power who actively do worship the devil (though if they&#39;re a public figure it&#39;s always in private and never in public, they always claim to be Christian like George Bush but that man is anything but Christian as can be clearly seen through his war mongering child murdering actions ).</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not saying all of congress is evil and worships the devil, but I am saying that most of them, even the ones that claim to have morals, are completely devoid of morals and only seek to serve themselves, for their own personal gain be it financial or power-status.</p>

<p>Which who cares about either because no matter what you die, Matthew 6:20 - but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a real shame to see people in positions of such incredible power who claim to be servants of Jesus doing absolutely nothing but working to serve themselves.</p>

<p>And so is the folly of man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yeah, but there are lots of things that people like having that are human constructs. Grind the world into dust and you will not find a single atom of justice, freedom, or human rights. I think most people would be upset, however, if their oppression was justified with the quip that &quot;In the end, your right not to be tortured to death is just an idea&quot; (even if it is technically true).</p>

<p>Hell, for that matter the concept of &quot;this country&quot; is a human construct as well. Nationalism is a relatively modern invention (with previous countries based off of race, tribal, or dynastic lines). &quot;This country&quot; exists just as much as &quot;the government&quot; does.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong: the government is an absolute mess. However, all <a href="/u/blackbutters">/u/blackbutters</a> seems to have done is throw together a bunch of positive and negative sounding terms and proposed a simplistic solution that won&#39;t do what he thinks it will (at least by itself). </p>

<p>Anyways, thanks for answering that. That&#39;s what I thought he meant but it seemed really weird for a person to dismiss the government as &quot;just an idea&quot; and embrace the American citizenry (also &quot;just an idea&quot;) uncritically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At some level, you are correct;  The belief that we cannot survive without being able to trade our labor for necessities is a powerful belief indeed, and insofar as I can conceive an absolutely true and justified belief.  We are, fortunately or unfortunately, within a system where trade is denominated in currency.  That part is supported by a social construct that requires belief.</p>

<p>But the systems that have emerged from that social construct involve trading our labor for currency from those who have it, and those systems create schools and bureaucracies and so forth;  They exist objectively.  They will not cease to exist if we stop believing in them.</p>

<p>But yea, we could change what we denominate our trade in.  And that would result in a dramatic change to who calls the shots (who can hire) and therefore the emergent systems that arise out of that trade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all true but it&#39;s even deeper than that. I believe it started when natural property and resource rights were outlawed. That is not to say that property rights themselves are necessarily immoral but that we should not have a system that allows one to claim the &quot;surplus&quot; value of others labor as their own. Furthermore the idea of intellectual property has been corrupted for the enrichment of the few and has become far removed from it&#39;s intent to enrich society as a whole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually don&#39;t disagree with you, but the person I&#39;m replying to&#39;s comment draws a false dichotomy. That there is such a thing as the American citizenry and that they make the country great. No, there&#39;s just a bunch of people who have an imagined shared identity. And they are no more inherently different than any other group of people. In fact if there is anything different about them it is the result of the body politic, which is corrupt as shit. So this whole &quot;Americans are what make America great&quot; is nonsense. What the fuck is an American? By definition: a human living under the American government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are some really great people in this country, some real class acts. People that are great innovators, leaders, teachers, artists, scientists, doctors etc. A lot of these really great people don&#39;t get the recognition they rightfully deserve because our perceptions are skewed. Our views are constantly shaped by the technology we&#39;ve accepted as part of our lives, by the people that broadcast these signals.</p>

<p>This country is full of great people but the people that run everything aren&#39;t great. They pretend to be, they only know how to feed themselves at the expense of others giving themselves the illusion of greatness. You don&#39;t make yourself great by having power over people, you make yourself great because you can empower people to be great. Somewhere along the line we lost sight of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree somewhat, BUT government institutions are made up of lots of people. Are you familiar with the idea of reification? It&#39;s the sociological idea that our manufactured institutions affect us in very real ways. I think the first comments language is misleading in two ways, one it assumes that all we have to do is think of a different government and it&#39;ll all be different. This is neither true nor realistic. And two the idea that &quot;America is great because American are great&quot;. Neither clause in that sentence is true. And both the idea of America and &quot;an American&quot; are JUST as imagined as the concept of government or language. Would you disagree?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are getting more and more convoluted but basically I don&#39;t disagree. These are arbitrary concepts.  </p>

<p>I quit being an American when I no longer felt any empathy or identification with what is going on in our government. I was raised by a strict religion but as I got older I began to realize that each time I disagreed with what was being espoused, taught or endorsed or interpreted from scripture I was given labels and threats of hell. At some point I began to modify my personal identity until today I don&#39;t even see myself as being part of thier religion at all. </p>

<p>When asked by border patrol what my citizenship is I now refuse to answer. Any answer is wrong. If I say, &quot;American&quot;, then it&#39;s an offense to my own feelings because I am identifying with a tyrannical government that I can not empathize with. If I state my real feelings then I am held up and harrassed for hours. I&#39;ve learned that BP is becoming aware of these feelings and when they are confronted with non answers to their question they are learning to ask questions like &quot;Are you (your name)?&quot; and then wave you on. Or &quot;where were you born?&quot;. 
So by social pressure we can change the way things are. And it only takes a few of us pushing back. </p>

<p>I have no reverance for USA or America as some people say. Or even the flag anymore. I&#39;ve seen patriotism used to subvert and violate the rights of people. Good honest hard working people are getting stomped on by the &quot;government&quot;. 
But I do think you missed the point that the Government is just a delusional concept spoon fed to the people along with doses of Obey and Cooperate. The federal government and Law Enforcement have jumped the shark and now become the ugly side of repression and tyranny. Yes they are real people. But the authority in them is imaginary. Sure they can do horrible things to you if you fail to submit. But the legitimacy of these actions is highly debatable. </p>

<p>I hear Obamacare is now the law and legal. But so were hitlers policies. Stalin had good things planned. So did Mao. And Pol Pot. But they all had one thing in common. Raw, Brutal force. Tyranny is real. Tyrants are real. Thier right to exist is imaginary. These things only exist because enough people agree on these things to make it possible. These things will cease to exist when enough people stop believing in them. Stop feeding the pig. Don&#39;t bow down to the system or aid it in word or deed. If you don&#39;t understand these things with out having them spelled out to you in pain staking detail then you are hopelessly lost. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t even begin to address the problem if you can&#39;t understand and see that it exists. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t see a better way in your own mind, then look outside your own mind. If you can&#39;t imagine a better way of life for all people then I can only hope to somehow escape the reality that you embrace and I can at least hope you are happy in your chains. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because politicians do not think of themselves as common people anymore.  The founding fathers were regular people first, politicians second.  They farmed, had plantations, actual businesses, etc.  They were not <strong>career</strong> politicians.  With the way campaign finance works now, it&#39;s all about pleasing the corporations.  Considering politicians solely earn their living from keeping their seats, it makes sense that they would do anything to keep the corporate money flowing for their re-election, despite how much it fucks the country over. </p>

<p>And then there&#39;s the party rivalry.  Dems fuck republicans over one term, reps have to get back at them next term.  Ego plays a huge role in why politics is so fucked up now. It&#39;s like they&#39;re a bunch of 6 year olds- &quot;he broke my toy so I&#39;m going to break his.&quot;  Instead of &quot;he broke my toy so how can we figure out a way that no more toys get broken in the future.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I learned (or was reminded, rather) that our government - and the way it is financed - is little more than a massive Ponzi scheme.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/10/06/obama-lew-congress-debt-ceiling-sunday-shows/2931187/">From a USA Today article quotingTreasury Secretary Jack Lew</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lew again warned that Oct. 17 -- a week from Thursday -- is the day the government hits the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling and <strong>loses the legal borrowing authority to pay existing bills</strong>.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m telling you that on the 17th, <strong>we run out of our ability to borrow,&quot;</strong> Lew said on CNN&#39;s State of the Union.</p>

<p>That would damage government programs including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans programs and disability programs, Lew said during appearances on Fox News Sunday, CBS&#39; Face The Nation, and NBC&#39;s Meet The Press.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Lew warns not that we are &quot;running out of money&quot; (<em>we have no money</em>), but that we will be unable to &quot;borrow&quot; <em>more money</em> (on top of the 16.7 TRILLION we&#39;re already in the hole). </p>

<p>We NEED more money! </p>

<p>For what?</p>

<p>To make payments toward existing debts and obligations.</p>

<p>Where will we get this money?</p>

<p>Borrow it.</p>

<p>From where?</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>Where will the Fed get the money to &quot;loan&quot; us?</p>

<p>They&#39;ll invent it - create it from nothing (the new &quot;money&quot; is new <strong>debt</strong>, nothing more)</p>

<p>Will we have to pay it back?</p>

<p>Yes - and with interest.</p>

<p>And where will we get the money to pay it back?</p>

<p>From the taxpayers (where else?)</p>

<p>Every &quot;new dollar&quot; that the Fed &quot;loans&quot; us is nothing more than an obligation &quot;secured&quot; by the government&#39;s power to TAX - to take larger and larger percentages of the <strong>real wealth</strong> (the fruit of our labor) and funnel it into the hands of the .001% that have created this system with the intent of enriching and empowering themselves.</p>

<p>Ponzi Scheme. House of cards. Musical chairs.</p>

<p>How did we get here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The folly is to assume that it&#39;s <em>only</em> government that&#39;s a ponzi scheme and to ignore economics itself. That debt, indeed <em>all</em> debt exists as another parties wealth. Once it becomes insolvent then <em>neither</em> should exist. Of course the problem then becomes who should &quot;atone for their sin&quot;, the debtor or the debtee? The popular notion is to impose &quot;austerity&quot; <em>only</em> on the debtor when clearly <em>both</em> have participated in the same shared delusion. That is to say that both believe that something that does not currently exist <em>might</em> exist sometime in the future. The debtee furthers the absurdity by attempting claim something over and above this mystical, non-existent surplus which <em>itself</em> has no guarantee of existence either. How can both fail to see that it&#39;s a suckers game? </p>

<p>In reality that is no, the loans and interests will never be paid back. How could they?</p>

<p>You can imagine the system as a money fountain, the numbers just keep getting bigger but the overall situation is the same. Government is just closest to the fountain and we are the men powering the money pump, so the laws work in opposite ways. We need to pay but they dont.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a constitutional crisis.</p>

<p>It is not a partisan matter. And it has absolutely nothing to do with the ACA (Obamacare), though that&#39;s what partisans and the media would have the public focus on. The issue is one of separation of powers. </p>

<p>The House of Representatives is asserting supremacy over the Senate and Executive and Judicial branches. </p>

<p>The ACA is law. There were negotiations during House and Senate debate sessions. Bills were passed in both legislatures and the President signed a resulting final bill. That law is now a US government <em>obligation.</em> </p>

<p>Similarly, the US budget is law. It was already debated by each legislature, both the House and Senate, and then reconciled in conference. A final bill was then signed by the President into law. That budget is a US government <em>obligation.</em> </p>

<p>In the current shutdown, the Executive is most directly affected, so it&#39;s portrayed as a legislative versus Executive battle. But this threat by the House is really directed at the Senate. In refusing to meet these current obligations, the House is essentially seizing legislative authority the Senate and thus disrupting the balance of power between the two legislative bodies. For by tying a standard operations measure with retroactively changing settled law, the House essentially claims authority to undue prior conference committee agreements. </p>

<p>But if the House fulfills its promise to refuse to pass a debt ceiling bill, then the House leadership will have abrogated their constitutional duty to secure the &#39;full faith and credit&#39; of the US government for all debts public. That&#39;s Article IV Section I of the US Constitution. Those who engage in this tactic would have directly violated their oaths of office. For if the US defaults on its debt - something that has never happened once in the history of the republic - then the House leadership would have failed to fulfill its core constitutional fiduciary duties.</p>

<p>By tying this to a short term partisan matter, the House leadership is walking the United States government into the worst constitutional crisis since secession. </p>

<p>Forget about Obamacare. <em>That is not the issue!</em>  The central issue here is that one legislative body is asserting power over another that it never constitutionally held since the republic&#39;s founding. This matter is extremely serious. Not just because a default would have enormous financial ramifications. But because if the House succeeds in setting this precedent, it will forever shift the balance of power between the House and Senate - regardless of which political party holds leadership control over each. </p>

<p>No. No. No!</p>

<p>The House has power of the purse in line allocations during the budgetary review process. They initiate the budgetary process by passing the first budgetary bill. The Senate then passes their own bill. Those two bills then go to conference where differences are ironed out before the President signs the yearly budget. <em>That&#39;s the process.</em></p>

<p>And don&#39;t talk Madison here. He was referring to the budget allocation process, not strong-arming legislative retroactive change through threats of US Treasury default.</p>

<p>Which also ignores my point. It is true. That is what the Constitution says, but it ignores the context of House actions in this situation. The House is demanding extra-constitutional authority to change duly elected law through refusals to fund already agreed upon operations and threats to default on US Treasury debt. </p>

<p>Those appropriations were already duly passed into law with Senate reconciliation. By taking this action, the House is asserting authority to post hoc nullify Senate agreements made in conference during the passage of <em>any law</em>.  Under threat of default, a direct violation of Article IV Section I. Should this become the norm, it would nullify traditional balance of power between the House and Senate. There is no way the founders - Madison in particular - would approve of this approach. </p>

<p>Your counterarguments - while true - do not challenge my point. In fact, they support it. </p>

<p>You&#39;re saying that Article IV Section I only proscribes the responsibility for state government fulfill its duty in debt obligations, and only gives power to the judiciary to resolve private disputes over debt obligations, but does not require the federal government - and congress as the budgetary authority - to fulfill its fiduciary duty to US Treasury borrowers. </p>

<p>In essence, you&#39;re saying that a debt default is not unconstitutional. That it&#39;s perfectly constitutional for either legislative body - the House or the Senate - to refuse to pass a budget and thereby default on US Treasury debt obligations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much, we can default on our debt, if a judge (or anyone really) were to say different he would be drawing money from the treasury which he doesn&#39;t have the power to do. We can&#39;t however say we don&#39;t still owe money to the creditor.</p>

<p>Except full faith and credit, is more about rulings in one state stands in another state, you can&#39;t run from debts and ruling by going to another state, that state must honor obligations ruled on by other states, and enforce it. For example, if your custody ruling for your child says you owe 1/3 of your income by moving to another state where it&#39;s only allowed to be a 1/4, you still have to pay a 1/3, the state must honor the ruling, same if you have other non-monetary judgement, such as visitation or school record access. That I don&#39;t need a different drivers license to drive in another state, that I&#39;m <em>credited</em> with being a legal driver, I may have to retain residency for that though. That if I make a deal to make you widgets then move my company to another state, I still owe you widgets. </p>

<p>Try thinking of it this way, if governments go into debt it means they don&#39;t have the money to pay for something, you can&#39;t make a law saying that you magically have money for it when it&#39;s due. (Well we technically can do this &quot;magically&quot; with fiat currency but that&#39;s another complicated story) The fact that the US can borrow money implies the fact that we don&#39;t have unlimited money to spend, and thus we may find we don&#39;t have enough to pay that debt, so the idea of default is already part of borrowing in the first place, that loaning money implicitly has a risk that it may not be paid (on time).</p>

<p>The Fourteenth Amendment, in its fourth section, explicitly declares: &#39;The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law , ... shall not be questioned.&#39; While this provision was undoubtedly inspired by the desire to put beyond question the obligations of the government issued during the Civil War, its language indicates a broader connotation.

    <div class="md"><p>So now you&#39;re arguing that Perry v. United States only refers to debt allocations of a gold backed currency. <a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/defaults-debt-ceilings-14th-amendment">Robert Levy of the Cato Institute</a> disagrees with you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perry plainly states that authorized and existing public debt must be paid. But proponents of the debt ceiling argue that Perryis irrelevant because the ceiling refers to new obligations that haven’t yet been authorized or issued. The counter-argument, to which I subscribe, is that Congress’s appropriation of funds for subsequent expenditure is equivalent to authorizing debt that would finance the expenditure. Note that the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 bars the president from rescinding spending. In other words, Congress has implicitly authorized the executive branch to borrow; and a statutory ceiling on that borrowing — even though signed by the executive — cannot be harmonized with the spending directive.</p>

<p>Debt ceiling advocates also assert that Perry involves repudiation, which is more draconian than merely defaulting. Repudiation is a declaration that the money is not owed. A default, by contrast, declares inability to pay, which may even be accompanied by an acknowledgment that the debt remains valid. As long as the debt is not formally repudiated, so the argument goes, default does not automatically render one’s debt invalid.</p>

<p>Once again, I subscribe to the counter-argument: If a friend refused to repay my loan when due, while assuring me that he would get around to it at an indefinite future date, I would be hard-pressed to intuit that his default — although not a repudiation — left me with a debt of unquestioned validity. A default undeniably affects the integrity of public obligations. And that, said the Supreme Court in Perry, is not permissible under the 14th Amendment: “[T]he expression ‘the validity of the public debt’ [embraces] whatever concerns the integrity of the public obligations.”</p>

<p>If that logic were extended, however, Section 4 of the 14th Amendment might also mandate higher taxes, sales of public property and budget cuts. Without those funding sources, the validity of the public debt might also be called into question. Yet, clearly, enactment of those policies is not constitutionally decreed. Instead, consider this more plausible interpretation: Congress is precluded from capping all sources of funds that could be used to pay the debt, but not from capping somesources. Accordingly, a debt ceiling is constitutional as long as other funding is not statutorily barred. That means, of course, Congress and the president would be compelled either to reduce spending, raise taxes, sell the Treasury’s mortgage-backed securities ($100 billion) or gold ($389 billion), delay principal and interest on debt held by the Federal Reserve (16% of total debt) or simply revalue the Treasury’s gold certificates at the current market price (a gain of $378 billion) by amending the Par Value Modification Act. The choices to avoid default are numerous, notwithstanding a debt ceiling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not arguing that, the court said specifically that the Perry decision didn&#39;t have a question of default in it, and so it was not answered, and frankly still isn&#39;t answered (as far as I know) because we haven&#39;t defaulted, so no one has standing for the suit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that if we default, we still owe and are obligated to eventually paid that debt, and can incite a penalty. But the courts can&#39;t order congress to borrow money (they don&#39;t have that power, only congress does), just as it can&#39;t/doesn&#39;t force an individual to borrow money to pay a debt. In order to do this the court would in essence force an individual or government to incur more  debt, (and it would have to force some third party to make that loan and there are problems with that, or force the congress to issue more currency another thing it can&#39;t do, or sell assets I guess)</p>

<p>So what? The whole point of a constitutional republic, and in particular the US system, is to limit federal powers by instituting checks and balances between the varying branches of government. The House - as an institution - is overstepping its authority. Should this precedent be set and normalized, no law is settled through traditional legislative process and thus Senate power is diminished. <em>Regardless of which party holds control.</em> Forget about this partisan fight and think to a future when political control shifts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly right. In the current budget impasse, the House is holding up a continuing resolution by adding riders about unrelated legislation. The effect of this is to stop executive funding. That&#39;s the first issue. </p>

<p>The second issue is far more serious. Should congress refuse or be unable to fund operations to the point of US Treasury default, they will have violated their core duty of office. The House is directly responsible with proposing initial budgetary bills. To fail in this responsibility and bring about a fiscal default is a direct constitutional violation. </p>

<p>For if the US defaults on its debt - something that has never happened once in the history of the republic </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The US has defaulted on its debt several times in history.</p>

<p><a href="http://etfdailynews.com/2011/07/25/the-united-sates-has-effectively-defaulted-at-least-six-times-gld-slv-tlt-tbt-uup/">The United Sates Has Effectively Defaulted At Least Six Times</a></p>

<p>I would also argue that just the act of knowingly creating more debt than existing money supply with each subsequent borrowing from the Fed is essentially defaulting on the notion that the debit could ever be paid. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Article IV Section I of the US Constitution</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Constitution has become a joke, it is so badly interpreted and or ignored.  Just look at how they outsource their obligation to coin money and regulate value to private for-profit banksters.  There are 100 other examples.</p>

<p>The House historically has refused to fund existing laws and existing federal departments.  That is the power of the purse, given to the people&#39;s house, that branch most closely reflecting the will of the people.  Obamacare is wildly unpopular and the Politicians in the House know it.  </p>

<p>Their motives probably are not with the people however, most likely on the side of the corporate oligarchy hurt by Obamacare, but their actions so far are within their Constitutional powers.  </p>

<p>Have you heard talk of taking the House to the Supreme Court for this shutdown?</p>

<p>Now the argument is that in order to protect the constitution we must throw out the constitution because it is, in your words, &quot;...a joke...&quot;? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you heard talk of taking the House to the Supreme Court for this shutdown?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is possible. If the congressional constable&#39;s office arrests those representatives unwilling to fulfill their duly elected duty to apportion debt to fulfill spending obligations passed into law, that may well go to the Supreme Court and the case could be argued before the body. This would be a good thing. It would pass authority away from legislative to the judicial branch where a separate body could make the decision on constitutionality of their conduct. Even if this SC determines that refusing to allocate debt to pay for budgetary allocations is constitutional - thereby affirming the House and shifting the power balance away from the Senate - it would at least have given secondary constitutional review to the House and created a check-and-balance to the House&#39;s actions.  </p>

<p>If they do default again, count on weasel words to define it as something else.  It is the same way they declare victory and retreat from a lost war.  Never admit the truth.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll agree with #5 and state the reason for that is because enough of that 300M people vote exactly as their preachers and bosses tell them to vote that the politicians only need to worry about who&#39;s paying them.  Because those are the same people who are the bosses telling people how to vote and who are paying the preachers to tell people how to vote.</p>

<p>Infinitely better off.  Every international war that America has been involved in since the Civil War, had said involvement begin as a result of a false flag attack by the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No thanks I will stay on this sub. I love this sub and the alternative views it has on world events. It has pretty drastically changed the way I see things. I think the spirit of the sub is to question everything and look for more logical and reasonable explanations. I agree with a lot of what is said on this sub and have formed some of my own conspiracy theories subsequently. But when people like you make claims that I don&#39;t agree with I will question them and hope to get an explanation of their theories. Most of the time this results in a sharing of ideas and opinions that I find informative and help to allow me to draw my own conclusions that often align with the ones I once disagreed with. Unfortunately, every once in a while I run into someone like you who is more interested in unsubstantiated claims that make no sense and when I ask for explanations about the the motivations behind your theories you call me a shill and say I am just a sheep. Well, some of what is posted on this sub is untrue and believing every thing you read (no matter where you read it) is what really makes you a sheep. Oh yeah and that guy you mentioned me and him are spying on you and plotting to discredit you via reddit... so, you know, be on your toes.</p>

That there is such a thing as the American citizenry and that they make the country great. No, there&#39;s just a bunch of people who have an imagined shared identity. And they are no more inherently different than any other group of people. In fact if there is anything different about them it is the result of the body politic, which is corrupt as shit. So this whole &quot;Americans are what make America great&quot; is nonsense. What the fuck is an American? By definition: a human living under the American government. </p>

<p>For if the US defaults on its debt - something that has never happened once in the history of the republic </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The US has defaulted on its debt several times in history.</p>

<p><a href="http://etfdailynews.com/2011/07/25/the-united-sates-has-effectively-defaulted-at-least-six-times-gld-slv-tlt-tbt-uup/">The United Sates Has Effectively Defaulted At Least Six Times</a></p>

<p>I would also argue that just the act of knowingly creating more debt than existing money supply with each subsequent borrowing from the Fed is essentially defaulting on the notion that the debit could ever be paid. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Article IV Section I of the US Constitution</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Constitution has become a joke, it is so badly interpreted and or ignored.  Just look at how they outsource their obligation to coin money and regulate value to private for-profit banksters.  There are 100 other examples.</p>

<p>The House historically has refused to fund existing laws and existing federal departments.  That is the power of the purse, given to the people&#39;s house, that branch most closely reflecting the will of the people.  Obamacare is wildly unpopular and the Politicians in the House know it.  </p>

<p>Their motives probably are not with the people however, most likely on the side of the corporate oligarchy hurt by Obamacare, but their actions so far are within their Constitutional powers.  </p>

<p>Have you heard talk of taking the House to the Supreme Court for this shutdown?</p>

<p>The House of Representatives is asserting supremacy over the Senate and Executive and Judicial branches. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was actually the way it was designed. The house is the closest representation of the people, they were always meant to be elected directly by them. The Senate originally was meant to represent state rights (elected by their legislatures and not the people originally), and the president was just there to run the army, and enforce laws passed by congress.</p>

<p>The house gave up a lot of power over the last few hundred years, and gave the executive a lot of power it wasn&#39;t supposed to have.</p>

<p>The house has an absolute right over the purse of the nation, it was designed this way, there is no constitutional question here. </p>

<p>Note: I do not agree with what they are doing, they however have all the authority to do it. </p>
