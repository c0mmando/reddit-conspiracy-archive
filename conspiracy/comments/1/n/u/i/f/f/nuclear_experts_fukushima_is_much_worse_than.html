       Fukushima leak is 'much worse than we were led to believe'
      </p>
      <p>
       A nuclear expert has told the BBC that he believes the current water leaks at Fukushima are much worse than the authorities have stated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mycle Schneider is an independent consultant who has previously advised the French and German governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       He says water is leaking out all over the site and there are no accurate figures for radiation levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile the chairman of Japan's nuclear authority said that he feared there would be further leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       But some nuclear experts are concerned that the problem is a good deal worse than either Tepco or the Japanese government are willing to admit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are worried about the enormous quantities of water, used to cool the reactor cores, which are now being stored on site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some 1,000 tanks have been built to hold the water. But these are believed to be at around 85% of their capacity and every day an extra 400 tonnes of water are being added.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The quantities of water they are dealing with are absolutely gigantic," said Mycle Schneider, who has consulted widely for a variety of organisations and countries on nuclear issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       "What is the worse is the water leakage everywhere else - not just from the tanks. It is leaking out from the basements, it is leaking out from the cracks all over the place. Nobody can measure that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "worsening situation" at Fukushima has prompted a former Japanese ambassador to Switzerland to call for the withdrawal of Tokyo's Olympic bid.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a letter to the UN secretary general, Mitsuhei Murata says the official radiation figures published by Tepco cannot be trusted. He says he is extremely worried about the lack of a sense of crisis in Japan and abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
       This view is shared by Mycle Schneider, who is calling for an international taskforce for Fukushima.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Japanese have a problem asking for help. It is a big mistake; they badly need it."

       Covering up nuclear meltdowns, plutonium leaks, and nuclear waste dumped into the ocean for years that contaminates the food supply (in yet unknown ways) and poisons children, etc.... then telling doctors that they can't report on the large number of thyroid anomalies, increasing birth defects, and child cancers... and this is just the start... that waste is going to be around for centuries to millenia.

       Whoa, how did you make your way to intentionally contaminating. I would not be surprised if they decided to downplay the contamination in order to prevent mass evacuations, which would be criminal. But I don't see how anyone let alone the Japanese govt would profit from this disaster.

       Well see, there's your problem.  You're not thinking critically.  I didn't say that the caused the disaster in the first place (unless you count their criminal negligence in maintaining a vulnerable, outdated reactor with huge amounts of fuel right next to the shore in an earthquake zone).
      </p>
      <p>
       I was referring to the fact that they covered up the extent of the contamination so that nothing could be done to stop it, or protect people.  And don't let's forget that they are still hushing up doctors and professors from telling the real story.
      </p>
      <p>
       So even in your scenario, where you say it's quite possible that they contaminated people by preventing mass evacuations... that sounds like "intentionally contaminating" people to me.  How many of those people are little children?  How many play in playgrounds or on fields where they kick up contamination ever day?  How many of those people were pregnant?  How many have eaten seafood, rice, or other crops that even the EPA now outlaws importation?

       Genocide - "the deliberate and systematic destruction, in whole or in part, of an ethnic, racial, caste, religious, or national group". You can call it whatever you want, but if what you think is happening is actually taking place then it does not line up with the definition of genocide. It would be more like using people's lives as a means to an end. You are looking for a bad guy and in this situation I don't think there really is one. Maybe incompetence is in the mix, but to me it seems like these guys are doing the best they can short of abandoning the entire nation of japan (which would probably be going overboard).

      </p>
      <p>
       Really, let's go with your scenario that they refused to evacuate citizens (Tokyo!) and this led to them being contaminated.  (And somehow you think that's criminal, but there are no "bad guys."  Yeah, ok.)  That sounds like "deliberate and systematic destruction" to me.

       Ok, I don't believe that the there is a conspiracy here. I don't believe that the Japanese govt is intentionally allowing its citizen to become irradiated to the point that they will not be able to reproduce. I don't think any of that makes sense. I think there as been an accident caused by a natural disaster that is very hard to undo. You believe that someone is allowing all of this crazy shit to happen for "profit". I don't see a way in which that is likely or even possible. You seem to want to create an evil rich guy at the center of all of this that is collecting "blood money". Guess what every once in a while bad shit happens for no reason (like earthquakes) and good people have to try to fix a complicated problem. So, if you can, please explain to me who exactly is behind all of this and what is there motive. Why would the Japanese govt want to decimate its own population.And most importantly how is this blood money being created and how could I collect it. Also are you suggesting that I am not human... maybe a robot or an alien?

       I agree with you on this, personally. But everyone on this whole sub thinks there is a hidden agenda behind literally everything. This isn't really the place to be arguing for a logical conclusion tbh. Yesterday they were talking about how the cops "executed" that woman who rammed the barricade and injured all those people and led the cops on that chase because she wouldn't stop. It's kinda nuts around here, sometimes. Any voice that says anything that
       <em>
        doesnt
       </em>
       relate to it being a huge cover-up or massive conspiracy is immediately downvoted.
      </p>

       Then again, this is the conspiracy subreddit, idk what we should expect.

       Yes. Research "Jim Stone Freelance + Fukushima" and educate yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTPslY8ATZk">
        This is an amazing interview
       </a>
       if you can look past the glitchy audio. He goes over the entire event. The Magna BSP cameras, the 9.0+ tsunami which struck right as the central controls were having problems. The water comes crashing into cities with full-standing buildings - a 9.0 didn't knock over any buildings? No structural damage at all? Way too many coincidences surround this event. Search in YouTube for Jim Stone you will find many interviews where he talks about Fukushima.

       Regardless of all that, their inactivity at stopping this potentially world ending disaster is obvious and says a lot. Their handling of this points to a purposeful controlled poisoning.

       This guy claims the earth quake was triggered (not that far fetched in my opinion) but also that Israelis put nukes inside the facility (pretty damn far fetched). Surely he can't believe both to be true.

       The Israeli security firm Magna BSP likely put a nuclear device in reactor 4 disguised as a stereoscopic camera. It was detonated long after the tsunami hit, masqueraded as pressure building up within the building. There were not multiple nukes in the facility but it is likely that this one oversized camera was an explosive device.

       So they triggered an eathquake(from his other stuff i guess they did it using HAARP) off the coast of a nuclear power plant. They wanted to scare the Japanese into submission but for some reason being able to trigger earthquakes wasn't enough so they placed and exploded a nuke within the facility. Also they infected the plant with stuxnet, just for the fun of it i guess. And they were jews.

       There was some structural damage, cracks and such. But the most important thing to remember is that although the quake was a 9.0 at the epicenter, it was felt as a 6 along the coast.

       I should have known Israel was responsible. They must have just been waiting for the earthquake so they could finally covertly eliminate their fiercest adversaries.... THE JAPANESE. That was rather educational. Thanks for the lesson.

       As a guy that has operated a nuclear reactor, saying the leak is "much worse than we were led to believe" means absolutely shit to me unless there are numbers to go along with it.

       At no point in the article do they state a leak rate, contamination levels, or radiation levels.  It's just conjecture.

       This reminds me of a story in one of Malcom Gladwell's books, where airlines noticed that south korea air had 2x the crash rate of any other airline in the world. The planes weren't bad, and the training was just as good for the pilots. So what was the problem?
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out South Korea has a very hierarchical society, and so the co-pilots were afraid to override their captain until it was often too late. If the captain was just sleepy or not paying attention or whatever, the co-pilot would neglect to inform him of the upcoming mountain until the very last moment when it was already too late because he assumed the pilot had things under control because they strongly trust authority. This exact thing actually happened more than once.
      </p>
      <p>
       They changed their training program to emphasize the importance of the co-pilot being able to openly communicate with the pilot, and the crash rate went down to normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to the Fukushima story, I think Japan is doing something similar. They're trying to pretend it's OK when it's very much not OK, but they neglected to consider how much they're shooting themselves in the foot by giving the world a false signal about how well-controlled this problem is. They've put their pride in front of their need for help. But their culture is an extremely prideful and reserved one, so it makes sense this would happen.

       Because this isn't really fixing anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have three separate coriums which have burned through their own containment, burned through the concrete floor, and are now chemically reacting right into the core of the Earth. No human or robot can get close enough to see how far down they are, or somehow stop the chemicals from reacting. These three coriums have already hit critical mass and so pouring more water to be stored in tanks nearby is hardly a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       This situation is practically beyond fixable - my big question is how long can ignorant people just literally keep ignoring the problem pretending life is gonna get better?

       You can ignore reality but you can't ignore the consequences of ignoring reality.

       It's reported but not honestly. Television news is controlled by Zionist interests, bribery is the reason it's not being discussed as an ongoing crisis. And again these news anchors think they're so fucking smart, but they are not immune to the effects of radiation. Same with politicians. These types of people lie to themselves saying that life will get better and we'll fix the problem, until it's realized that maybe we can't.

       We're all slowly being irradiated and honestly you will never get the truth from your television.

       Experts alike do not
       <em>

       know how bad this is. We can speculate all we want but quite frankly it's beyond measurable. New hidden black-ops technology or aliens are probably the most realistic solutions, and that's saying something.

       Unless we actually eat irradiated food the amount of radiation we're talking about - over the course of a lifetime, mind you - is less than a single transatlantic flight, or a few years living in Denver. I'm not saying it's totally insignificant, or that Japan isn't looking bad right now, or even that it doesn't need to receive more help and attention from the world community - it does. I'm saying that this is nowhere near a world-ender or even a significant game changer. This is maybe - maybe - a dozen Chernobyls at worst.

       You're right, if we get rid of the Zionists, the news, and the government, you won't get irradiated anymore.  The sun, bananas, medical procedures, the earth; none of those things expose you to radiation at all.

       Actually, it's neither. If you're working at Fukushima, sure, there's a significant impact. On a worldwide scale, it's negligible.  I've operated a nuclear power plant. The radiation level in my basement would set off alarms in the plant I worked in. My lifetime radiation exposure from the reactor is less than I get on a cross-country flight. As far as leaking into the ocean, dilution is the solution. Yes, the immediate area will be affected, but worldwide? Nope.

       I'm not sure what this proves about Fukishima.

       That's wonderful. Fully functional Reactors are relatively safe. Now, what's that have to do with Fukishima?

       How big is the 'immediate area'? The plant itself? The city? All of Japan? The majority of the Pacific? And based on what info? Also, I'm glad you're certain that a never ending leak in to the ocean will be forever diluted. We could use more certainty in this incident.

       Interesting. I'd question the legitimacy of this site though since they're selling things and quoting the bible(and have all of japan at the lowest radcon level). I'm going to look for a more official source of this type of information though. Does anyone have something offhand?

       Edit: Sorry, the site in question is
       <a href="http://www.netc.com">
        www.netc.com

       which is the only site that has the bay area listed at radcon5 currently.

       yea, I never heard of this site until the other day, and it doesn't smack of legitimacy, especially given their readings in Japan.

       There is more conspiracy than you thought; the real conspiracy is that Japan is brewing a nice brew of nuclear rain clouds to send toward the US. Is a kind of payback type of thing for you know... Hiroshima.
