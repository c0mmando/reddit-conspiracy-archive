       Judging by some of the ridiculous shit that gets posted here, I'd say that such an operation does exist, and if you believe that the government is involved in disinformation, this is one of the easiest and cheapest ways to continue driving the wedge between people who ask questions and people who believe the media.

       One person's "valid question" is another person's crazy theory. That's why we have the tools of critical thinking to evaluate theories. Many people seem to actually believe that 9/11 planted explosives is a valid question, i.e.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny that conspiracy theorists find a conspiracy theory that trips their own bullshit detector, so they invent a conspiracy to explain why those crazier theories exist, rather than realize that perhaps some of their own "valid questions" don't stand up to reason.

       Those two things don't necessarily contradict each other and I don't really understand the point you're trying to make. I'm just saying that if I was the CIA and I wanted to spread misinformation, I would spread it on sites such as this, because it's cheap and effective.

       I disagree with the idea that the CIA would plant crazy stories in fringe settings like conspiracy message boards. Maybe in mainstream sources...but conspiracy communities are little self-contained bubbles that don't gain mainstream traction.

      <p>
       I think it's more likely that those fringe theories have true believers behind them.

       Whenever I read things that ask questions such as these, I think back to a company I worked for several years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       In very short, the owner had some great tooling technology that literally the entire world wanted. The company went from ~900K per year in sales to over 40 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       800 people either working or contracting for the company. Three mom-and-pop shops planned and began multimillion dollar expansions. International travel, Big Names: Busch, Coors, to name a few. We were all riding high, feeling very secure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Owner sells to bigger company, retires at 34, 800 people out of a job and three companies down the drain because they had no work to recoup their investment on the expansions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one man in one city with one company can fool that many people into thinking that he was going to help us all retire, I can't even begin to try to imagine what a large org like the Gov't. and Lobbyists could be capable of.

       It would be real easy to do. And if you really don't want a lot of people to accept something or consider speculative evidence, make the first page on Google contradictory information and you'd have me fooled 99% of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not it's done by the CIA or whatever assholes want to confuse people who take interest to things falling under the "conspiracy" category, the word 'conspiracy' has become an immediate turn-off to a large section of the population.

       I don't know exactly who David Icke is, but what is it with him and the reptilians?  It seems like a whole bunch of people respect him, but... how?  It's kind of like that "Thrive" movie.

      <p>
       When I saw the 'theory' that there were actors at the Boston bombing pretending to be injured, I knew it had to be a plant, because crazy people wouldn't be able to come up with something that deliberately offensive to so many people. It is, however, a fantastic way to convince people that this entire subreddit is a clusterfuck of lunatics and that the mainstream media is the only reliable source of information after all.

        Here
       </a>
       is a medical professional who has spent their life dealing with traumatic injuries blatantly calling out
       <em>
        just one
       </em>
       of the actors used in Boston.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please explain to me how this man was alive after a traumatic injury as the one he supposedly "just went through"--the author of the article seems to have vast experience in the field and disseminates the phony story used in Boston frame-by-frame.
      </p>
      <p>
       So...we know that, for sure, at least
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       actor was used in Boston. When using one...why not more?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please think about this a bit more critically.  Dismissing something so obvious out-of-hand is dangerous for everybody involved. Just because YOU don't like the fact that actors were used does NOT invalidate the
       <em>
        fact
       </em>
       that they were.

       Well, you can have your opinion...but EVERY PIECE of evidence proves me correct--from the obvious blood packets on the ground to shredded clothes with no skin injury underneath.

       Agree that they were almost definitely CIA patsies though--even though there is ABSOLUTELY NO evidence that "the boys did it" and a WHOLE LOT of evidence proving that the inverse is actually true.

       The dumb fuckin meme's that somehow reach the top everyday make me suspicious. As well as the badcop bullshit (divide and conquer at its finest). Add the fact that any post that genuinely touches on the real conspiracy is downvoted seconds after it gets posted and umm yeah.

       Just look at how the US military runs "news" websites targeting foreign audiences that paint the US in a friendly light (e.g.
       <a href="http://www.setimes.com">
        www.setimes.com
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://www.magharebia.com">

       The thing that makes me suspect something like this might exist is the persistence of the "planted explosives" theory about 9-11. It is completely absurd, yet it won't go away. Why? Who keeps sustaining this nutty theory? Is it because they wish to distract attention away from the Saudis and the Israelis? This theory has made any intelligent discussion of 9-11 impossible. The minute you bring up 9-11, here comes the crazies with their planted explosives lunacy, and that's the end of the discussion. Maybe that's why this nutty theory is being sustained on the Internet -- to make any other discussion about 9-11 impossible.

       Its not "nutty" but its not the be-all-end-all either, nor wtc7. Focus on indisputable massive questions and coincidences like why cheney and bush blocked an investigation for as long as they could, kissinger chosen to chair it, norad fails, pentagon defence fails, the $2.3t, forces on afghan border before 911, patriot act written before 911, PNAC, dancing israelis and on and on and on...

       The "dancing Israelis" are THE smoking gun of that day.

       It is SOLID proof that Israel/Mossad at least knew what what going to happen
       <em>
        exactly when
       </em>
       it did.

       hate to break it to you, but the "dancing israelis" story is most likely a run away internet meme, the
       <a href="http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Dancing_Israelis">
        source material
       </a>
       is much less nefarious than how the story evolved over time.

       I saw them on an Israeli talk show (not all of them--I believe it was Silvan Kurtzberg and another guy but the others were in the audience) where they say, in plain Hebrew, that the purpose of them being in the park in NJ was to "document the event." And this they did--with cameras rolling
       <em>
        BEFORE
       </em>
       the first plane struck.

      <p>
       Let's not forget the van
       <strong>
        packed with explosives
       </strong>
       found near the GW Bridge ALSO connected to the Israeli cut-out Urban Moving Systems and driven by Israelis. It was quickly buried in the MSM, of course, but you can look it up.

       You see this a lot with 9-11 conspiracies.  The theories range from "people in the government knew an attack was imminent and were complicit in it happening to get us into war" to "There weren't any planes.  They were holograms."  Because of this people in the prior are lumped in with people in the latter making it all equal bullshit.
