    <div class="md"><p>Possibly because United 93 was, for whatever reason, unable to make its pre-scheduled stop at WTC7.</p>

<p>There are numerous reports that people in WTC7 were told to evacuate because &quot;another plane was incoming&quot;.</p>

<p>If it was wired for collapse (like the other two towers may have been), it had to be destroyed.  When United 93 didn&#39;t arrive, they may have risked being exposed due to the evidence of the explosives remaining in the building.  (As well as all the other paperwork stored there to be destroyed).  Also, if WTC7 was a staging area for coordinating some aspect of the attacks, that would be incriminating as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wtc7 was the third tallest building so there is a reason it collapsed in dramatic fashion. It was over 600 ft tall. Also, one thing I&#39;ve learned is that just because you observe something and have a strong hunch doesn&#39;t make it true.  You are no scientist in the area of falling buildings that are more than 600 ft tall and spending a few hours a day on a conspiracy theorist website will never make you one!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but a building demolition and a building falling down look nothing alike. It would be a one in a trillion chance for any collapsing building to fall neatly in its own footprint, let alone for it to happen 3 times in one day. The pyroclastic flows at the site of 9/11 are also a dead giveaway.  One does not witness pyroclastic flows anywhere other than a controlled demolition using powerful explosives to move enormouse amounts of material, and a volcanic eruption. Also, WTC 1, 2, &amp; 7 are the first steel framed buildings to EVER collapse due to fire (even though jet fuel doesn&#39;t burn hot enough to melt steel).  </p>
