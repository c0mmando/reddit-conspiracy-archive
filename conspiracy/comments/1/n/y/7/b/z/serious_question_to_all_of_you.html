       I see three options
      </p>
      <p>
       First: An agreement is reached and we have business as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two: we default and the world economy panics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three: Obama raises the debt without congress using dictatorial powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt the second option will happen.

       We owe money to everyone, we borrow nonstop to pay the debt which makes more debt. No clue where we would come up with the money to pay it but borrowing more just makes it worse.

       if the government is shut down and we default, people will panic, riot and more. Over time if things get worse, the bad seeds will group up in certain areas of the country which arent maintained or monitored anymore. Just an opinion.

       I go to laugh at the spectacle, same as when a storm is coming and the masses are running to the grocery store for that last loaf of bread, and it's not there. I know, I have a sick sense of humor, but I also like to document it to use to encourage others to prepare..... for life, not teotwawki

       Do you not realize that there is a good portion of people out there with devious intent? who would steal, kill, and more for these things, especially in a crisis?

       it's social engineering... those who would kill, have been conditioned by the rule of law, because of an unequal society, he/she hate others because of what he/she doesn't have, but when that time of crisis comes, who's gonna want shiny air jordans?

       those same ones who would steal for it even before all this? What makes you think they will get some change of perception or their hearts filled with the objective to go do good? not happening.

       It is the warped views that our controlled society has implanted in our brains over generations that gives you faith in humanity. Humans as creatures are savages. Sure if we live in a collective long enough we develop better ways of life but when it comes down to the basic instincts, we are only concerned with our own survival. You wouldn't have a clue what was moral and what wasn't if it wasn't fed to you from birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately following the collapse, the shock of sudden lawlessness will revert a good percentage of mankind back to bandits and outlaws. Not having any authority types to keep order, those "no go spots" OP was talking about will be a very real thing. The places that are more likely to maintain a level of civility, are the small communities in the country, away from the cities and suburbs. The cities and 'burbs will be the spots that will attract all the "bad seeds" because, again immediately following the collapse, they will be trying to loot and pillage everything that used to be valuable, forcing the "civilized folk" out of the area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever this inevitable collapse happens, it will drastically alter the moral compass of every individual and change our set of values. It is impossible to say what any of us will do when put in that situation because none of us have ever been there. All we can do is look back at what history shows us, and history shows us that the weak will not inherit the earth.

       Not true. Humanity chooses living vs. death and violence in the grand scheme of things. I understand wars and yada yada, but if humanity didn't know how to deal with it, we wouldn't be were we are today. You have to understand that something like complete government collapse, would cause a good kind of chaos. Yes shit would be crazy, but people still want to exist. What I think has been ingrained in to peoples heads, is that failure in the economy equals the failure of humanity. Its nothing. Thats how it should be. We should not have to rely on a "government" and pointless currency to live. Life will go on, better them what youre programed to think.

       depends on the area, some like to use somalia or other mid eastern countries as an example. which they are good examples, for those who lead that life style, I don't think it represents americans. but I do not disagree with primitive instinct either. After Katrina, I saw many looters, mostly dumbasses looting TV's and such, even though there was no power or water, etc. natural selection is heading for a reset, don't get in the way.

       this is because people still don't seem to know what they're fighting for... they put value on material needs and don't seem to value food, water, &amp; shelter.... dumb dumb dumb... everyone can work together and take down a dinosaur to eat, just like an ant colony defending off a scorpian

       being from a rural area, people fear not necessarily the government coming to get their guns, but hungry people coming from the city looking for food and shelter and invading the countryside. I don't think it's that far fetched if SHTF

       just for the sake of others, don't bother to respond. People in Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal, England, pretty much any where there is a people that have been oppressed and those same people do not want to shoot their fellow man. Riots are pretty much reserved for the unarmed and those with out the organization to wage a meaningful battle. Riots happen out of anger, usually with government. You asked who riots, people with a cause and nothing else to lose. Those who have lost all. People who will not self immolate, but want to live, free from dictates of the wealthy, free from oppression. It used to be us, our founding fathers rioted.

       I think citizens and local communities will step up and take on the responsibility to police themselves. kinda like it was before the 80's. decentralized community based policing. not the bullshit we have know. I am not a huge fan of policing anyways. I believe protection should be our own responsibility and if you are a re victim, that it's most likely your own fault. some people need protecting, the young and elderly, but is that societies job, or family?  just saying it won't be the same as it is now, if this happens which is less than probable.

       dude, I hope selling out your fellow man is worth it to you. Either you are a shill, or just a dumb person. Either way, you have sold out future generations. By working for the oppressors, or just by being uneducated. First, you have no command of the English language, or any language that I am aware of. The whole point of language is to be able to convey your thoughts to others in an understandable way. Second, your comment history is poor, you offer no viable input to any conversation, seems like "bro" talk at best. If you cannot spell hating and WTFE "dissin" is, I have no time for your petty thoughts. Thank You, and good day sir.

       I do not thionk this will be a full blown waste land, many countries have defaulted, either by not paying bonds, or inflation. I think inflation will be how we default, won't be a walk in the park, many will die by their neighbors hands. I think great depression style, only worse, because no one can produce or store their own goods. pantries run dry, people will get desperate. however this is one of the most generous nations. some will help others out, until they realize help is not on the way. just my opinion, and I hope I am wrong.

       I think we're going to martial law within a year if not sooner. I'm suspecting there will be numerous economic dislocations and a bank run. Bad holiday sales will take down at least one major retailer.
