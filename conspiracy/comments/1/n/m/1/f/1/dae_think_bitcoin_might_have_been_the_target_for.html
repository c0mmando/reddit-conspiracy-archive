    <div class="md"><p>Depends on what you believe bitcoin is. If you believe some anonymous good Samaritan named Satoshi created it to usher in a future economy free of central banking control, based on privacy and anonymity then it that fantasy is quashed. If you believe bitcoin is the newly issued company store coupons, with zero privacy then no difference. I think the encryption of btc is as secure as any. But it&#39;s clear at this point that adoption will include destruction of privacy beyond any current system. The power behind the central banks only care about the control they can harness from an economic system. They are not in the business of accumulating money. Bitcoin is the seed to the next level of control. The current system is being taken offline in a somewhat controlled manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it hard to believe that people still think the way you do. You believe the people that PRINT money collect it? For what purpose? So they can buy things? Printing money is a HASSLE for them. They own actual things of value. They own everything. They own all debt. They own land, nations, leaders, people. The money they print are company store coupons to make things happen inside the prison planet they operate. It&#39;s the grease, along with violent domination that keeps the cogs turning. It&#39;s how they get things done. They already OWN the bitcoin ecosystem because any value going into is what they already own or created. Bitcoin ecosystem is not creating value, value is being transferred into it. How does bitcoin help them? Why would they create it? Control. There is a roadmap of adoption and complete switchover to bitcoin. Ending in everyone having a bitcoin wallet address that is directly tied to their identity. And you say NO WAY! Well when you have put your own value into XBT and want to participate in their economy.. walmart, amazon, bank loans, mortgages, pay bills etc. etc. you will sign right up.. unless you want to not use your bitcoin. For now enjoy the anonymity.. Same as pioneers of the public internet did. Now the internet is nothing but a giant surveillance WEB. Which was always it&#39;s express purpose. That is why DARPA created it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s institutional buying because this is how things are done. The people taking down SR work with and for the people that are doing the buying. They MAKE news that effects the price of things and trade accordingly. If you were about to take down SR would you buy BTC? Regular bitcoin users had no idea SR was about to be taken down. But some people did. And those people operate funds and trusts for mom and dad&#39;s 401ks.</p>

<p>The good news is, if you are rooting for bitcoin adoption and a raise in price against the USD then understand that is exactly the plan. But ANY level of mass adoption will come with the identity/trust lynch pin. And when it comes to money and convenience they KNOW you will do it. When your mother and father are using bitcoin understand they will be using for a whole different set of reasons than the bitcoin early adopters did. They will only understand it as the new money they have to use and nothing else.</p>

<p>No it&#39;s not.  For banks wanting to create dollars out of thin air, it&#39;s as easy as changing numbers on a computer screen.  This is not the case with bitcoin.</p>

<p>I was looking at the exchanges all day yesterday - there was no movement on the price of bitcoin before SR was taken down.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If this does happen, the price of bitcoin will skyrocket! and bitcoin users will see each bitcoin shoot up in price to more than $100,000 per bitcoin (this is because there will only be 21million bitcoins that ever exist).  I don&#39;t see why banksters would want this to happen unless it&#39;s their goal to make bitcoin nerds very rich.</p>

<p>No one is forcing anyone to use bitcoin.  Also, it is not that hard to hide identity when using bitcoin.  If the banksters in power want bitcoin to be widely adopted, why would they make it harder for people to send and receive money from mtgox? <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mt-gox-bitcoin-exchange-shut-down-2013-5">www.businessinsider.com/mt-gox-bitcoin-exchange-shut-down-2013-5</a></p>

<p>Sorry, but I don&#39;t think you have your facts right about bitcoin - at least try to back up what you are saying with sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think printing money and managing money laundering and counterfeiting is not an issue? it&#39;s a useless hassle. Banks don&#39;t like private cash transactions. </p>

<p>Why would you expect the price to move before the news? They bought when the satoshi believers sold. Take a look at the volume.</p>

<p>Is facebook an NSA asset? Is Zuckerberg rich? Is he free and anonymous? hahah. If amazon accepted bitcoins would you spend them? Would you dump your bitcoin into a wallet hosted by Paypal? What if Paypal buys blockchain.info? What if you can directly link your bank account up to your btc wallet? Will you? Will you spend your bitcoin? How many bitcoin that you bought under 100 will you still own buy the time they are worth 100k each? Think.</p>

<p>You can have semi anonymous transactions now because your identity is not tied to your wallet or coins. But for wide adoption to take place, the kind of adoption that would result in a world where one btc is worth 10k.. all coins/addresses will be tied to an identity. A black market can and will likely still exist.. but at some point that black market will have no relationship with the legitimate widely adopted market. trying to use your btc address and coins that are not accounted for won&#39;t be possible at places and for things that fiat is currently used at. </p>

<p>So any &quot;bitcoin nerds&quot; that held out that long will gladly get in line to claim they holdings by offering up their identity. They will want to use the bitcoin wealth they managed to hold on to.</p>

<p>Acutally, &quot;satoshi believers&quot; didn&#39;t sell, they are the ones who bought when the price was low.  It was the speculators trying to make a quick buck that sold and lost money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If amazon accepted bitcoins would you spend them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, why not</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would you dump your bitcoin into a wallet hosted by Paypal? What if Paypal buys blockchain.info? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I wouldn&#39;t trust anyone to hold my bitcoins.  I hold them myself - some on a piece of paper that holds the private key, some on a brainwallet (that only exists as a passphrase in my brain), and some on my computer.  <strong>This is why your claim that banksters want to push bitcoin doesn&#39;t make sense - with bitcoin, you don&#39;t need any bank or company to hold your bitcoins.  Bitcoin removes the need to trust a bank! and if bitcoins are used by everyone, bye bye banks!</strong> - ALSO <strong>no more big corporations or banks acting as middlemen</strong>, bitcoin transactions are done <strong>directly</strong> from person A to person B with no bank/visa/mastercard/paypal in the middle - nothing! - So again, it really doesn&#39;t make sense for them to want to push bitcoin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many bitcoin that you bought under 100 will you still own buy the time they are worth 100k each? Think.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I might be holding on to half of them. Who knows, only time will tell.  We don&#39;t even know if it will even reach 100k/btc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can have semi anonymous transactions now because your identity is not tied to your wallet or coins. But for wide adoption to take place, the kind of adoption that would result in a world where one btc is worth 10k.. all coins/addresses will be tied to an identity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wallets can be created on any computer - even computers that never connect to the internet - <strong>this way, it is always possible to make a wallet that is not tied to any identity.</strong>  So, if you are like me and don&#39;t trust anyone holding your bitcoins, you can just choose to hold them yourself - it&#39;s easy enough.</p>

<p>Also, if a certain number of bitcoins are tied to an identity, there are services called bitcoin mixers that will mix your bitcoins with everyone elses - no longer possible to tell who&#39;s bitcoin belongs to who. - this is how the drug dealers of silk road never got caught (it is likely they will go to another black market website).</p>

<p>And on top of all that, bitcoin devolopers are working on additional layers to bitcoin that would make it much more anonymous - one such example is <a href="http://zerocoin.org/">http://zerocoin.org/</a></p>

<p>So I have done my thinking, and I have concluded that it does not make sense for a government that is anti-privacy and wants to control everything to want to push a currency like bitcoin, which does the opposite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How will you spend your bitcoins at Amazon if they do not accept bitcoins from an anonymous wallet? You won&#39;t. How will you pay your mortgage? How will you pay your taxes? How will you shop at walmart? These are all things your mom and dad like to do with money.</p>

<p>None of that will become a reality while your wallet and coins remain anonymous. If you want to keep your coins anonymous they will eventually become valueless because you won&#39;t be able to spend them anywhere. Meanwhile, adoption will grow and those coins associated with an identity will be the one&#39;s people will buy, sell, trade. The one&#39;s the actual economy recognizes as legitimate. </p>

<p>Sorry, bitcoin is going to become widely adopted and if you want your bitcoins to have value in the economy you will eventually relate your identity to them. Mark this posts. See you in 5-10 years. The central banks, the real authority behind them, created bitcoin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disinformation or ignorance.  Probably both.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take them in order of appearance.  </p>

<p>HTTPS relies on a specific key to encrypt all traffic.  If I want to put a SPI (stateful packet inspection) firewall on my corporate network that looks for intrusion attempts inside of HTTPS encrypted packets all I need to do is get the key from the web server admin and plug it into the intrusion detection software so it can magically see everything inside the packets.  </p>

<p>Now, who has or can generate that key?  Only your CA (Certificate Authority).  They have a higher-level key that is used to generate that key.  There are higher level keys used to generate the CA&#39;s key if they are an intermediate authority with a higher level CA vouching for them.  </p>

<p>We also know that the intermediate keys have been compromised for a large portion of SSL certificates, and we can assume that money and legal threats combined with a gag order have liberated quite a number of other keys from other CAs.  </p>

<p>This means that the NSA/CIA/FBI/ETC just need to plug in the right key to their SPI monitoring systems and see the traffic inside.  If I can do it with snort for free given access to the key, and they have billions of dollars and access to the keys, we should safely assume they are doing this. </p>

<p>So, HTTPs is not more secure than TOR.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tor was designed to get around firewalls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False.  TOR was designed to create plausible deniability as to the true source and destination of HTTP requests.  It does this by creating extremely complex chains of tunnels between multiple nodes.  This is like using multiple dynamic proxy servers at random to create a complex interconnected web of proxies which route by random selection instead of any predetermined routing table.  </p>

<p>Now let&#39;s talk about proxy servers.  I can rent a virtual server, install a proxy application on it, and &quot;leak&quot; that proxy information into message boards and usenet postings.  Once people start using it I can see everything they do.  Especially if I prohibit HTTPs.  </p>

<p>In fact, using a proxy server is putting a red flag on yourself by demonstrating that you are wishing to obfuscate the nature of your actions.  The operator of the VPN or proxy server sees both your IP address and the content of the sites you are visiting.  He knows who you are and what you are trying to hide.  </p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s talk about a TOR hidden service.  This is like HTTPS in that there is a key involved.  However no central authority issued this key.  You did.  No central authority has the ability to re-generate your unique key.  It&#39;s yours.  That means when someone forwards a packet destined for your hidden service nobody can see what&#39;s inside of it except for you (or anyone you give your hidden service key to).  They don&#39;t even know if you are asking for yourself or just forwarding the packet for someone else.  </p>

<p>Your statements are simply false. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There really is going to be a strong market for virgin Bitcoins that have never been spent.  You see when they are first created they are registered or cryptographically signed to a random code that the creator generated.  At this point they have not been tied to anybody in the real world.  So they can be spent into the system in a way that the spender is unable to be tracked simply by the Bitcoin registry.  In theory it could be possible to keep spending them in a way that they were only being touched by fresh cryptographic keys that had not elsewhere engaged in commerce but it would be impossible to know this so it would have to be assumed that it was now trackable as far as that was concerned.  Anyways if you were transacting in some seriously consequental shit then both parties would have an interest in dealing in virgin coins.  I full expect a future James Bond villain to be paid in these virgin Bitcoins coins in the next ten years.</p>
