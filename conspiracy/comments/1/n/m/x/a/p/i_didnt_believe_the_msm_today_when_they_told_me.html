        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I couldn&#39;t believe my ears this morning when the news media said that the Capital Police were going to arrest 80-90 year olds who flew from Ohio to see the WW2 memorial called Honor Flight.</p>

<p>This made me incredibly furious, so I immediately got in the car and drove to see for myself. By the time I got there, the veterans had already left, and the WW2 Memorial was locked up tight with a visible police presence.</p>

<p>I then proceeded to walk down the Mall and was encouraged to see people in the Korean War memorial. I passed through the gates, and walked through the memorial without any police harassment. In fact, the K9 pictured was a sheriff officer who brought his dog with him, and he too opened the gate and proceeded to walk through the memorial. At one time a park police officer drove up and looked, only to turn around and let people walk through.</p>

<p>I left the Korean War memorial and walked toward the Lincoln memorial, passing the Vietnam memorial on the way. I stopped into the Vietnam war memorial, again pushing the fence out of the way, joining maybe an additional 15 people, again with no police harassment.</p>

<p>After leaving the Vietnam war memorial, I walked up to the Lincoln memorial, which was blocked off, with a big iron gate, and to add insult to injury, a park police officer inside the memorial! They were working, but keeping the people out, it was infuriating that the government would pay someone to work while keeping We The People out.</p>

<p>No action there, just disheartening to see a group of school kids not be able to visit such an amazing building as the Lincoln memorial! I left and headed back to the WW2 Memorial.</p>

<p>Back at the WW2 memorial, There were a group of people outside the Memorial, no visible police present. I saw an older vet there who tried to open the fence, and I immediately ran over to help him. I opened the gate and walked into the Memorial with him. </p>

<p>We were soon joined by 10-15 others who went into the Memorial. We all were walking around for maybe 5 minutes before the Park Police came and threatened to arrest everyone.</p>

<p>The vet that I originally went in with was completely irate that he could walk freely through the Korea War memorial, Vietnam War memorial, but not the World War Two Memorial. How can you explain the picking and choosing of memorials? Who do you blame for this, Republicans or Democrats?</p>

<p>Finally I will add that right after everyone left the Memorial peacefully, the GOP party chairman came to give an announcement that the GOP had offered to fund private security for 30 days. I honestly felt that we were kicked out more for the cameras then the police actually wanting to do it.  I feel both parties may secretly want this to re-engage their constituents in thinking that both parties are fighting for them. The whole thing was surreal. What do you guys think?</p>

<p>This.  It&#39;s theatre.  Consider it as a performance.  </p>

<p>In my mind, it&#39;s leading up to the debt ceiling debate.  That&#39;s the one that can actually screw them, so they&#39;re priming the pump for fear-mongering.  They need to kick that can or the jig will be up.  </p>

<p>So it&#39;s basically fear based propaganda coming in in advance. You&#39;re right that the main message is &quot;We&#39;re fighting for you.&quot;  The other message is &quot;The two parties are very different.&quot;  That&#39;s important because even the dummies were starting to see that the two parties could agree on NDAA, NSA, and USA PATRIOT Act.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well said. I think your totally right about the message also being the two parties are very different, when in fact your right, the appearance is they are more similar then they are alike. </p>

<p>Have to keep people fighting amongst themselves don&#39;t they? In terms of the debt ceiling negotiations, I think the writing on the wall is already there. I don&#39;t think they are going to kick the can any further.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for sharing your story and pics. It&#39;s all very sad. My uncle is the head of the VA here on Big Island Hawaii. He was so upset opon finding out the VA benefits/medical/and mental health programs are not promised after October. He sat here at our house and cried after the govt. shutdown occured. It all breaks my heart.</p>

<p><em>This</em> is the sort of thing that should be crowdfunded. I know it&#39;s not our fault, but a lot of us would care about our Vets a damn sight more than the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Friend, all of it is just for show. The left / right paradigm is a mean task master and &#39;they&#39; don&#39;t give a damned about these veterans, the kids, the sick, the poor, the indigent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. What is the final outcome of this though? Do you think the military will take a role in this show? Will they take Washington back from the bad politicians? I felt like it was exactly that, a show. </p>

<p>I missed the Honor Flight group by the time I made it there, apparently there were quite a few politicians there that &quot;stormed the gates&quot; with the veterans. For the cameras at least. Michelle Bachmann was there, who voted against the Amash Amendment to defund the NSA, obvious poses in pictures I saw.</p>

<p>The fact that other memorials were open really opened my eyes to the fact this was indeed theater.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a thought here. DHS specially goes out of their way to say veterans are the biggest threat to national security on record. What better way to attract your enemy then disrespect their dead, and the ones that survived?</p>

<p>This is so provocative, and infuriating that it almost guarantees that veterans will amass at these memorials. </p>

<p>Will the Obama administration then crush the revolt with a false flag attack on veterans, his admitted biggest threat?</p>
