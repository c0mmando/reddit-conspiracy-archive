    <div class="md"><p>This has happened before and they (big-pharma) claims that it cannot happen when it absolutely did happen with Polio in the 50&#39;s. The formaldehyde failed to kill the LIVE virus completely and they actually SPREAD the polio virus around through the vaccine! Yet to this day most official sources claim that is not true. The worst is the nasal spray flu &quot;immunization&quot; which does contain a live virus...read the package inserts before you consent to a vaccination. This is not a popular thing to do right now but if you want to know what is going into your body those manufacturers&#39; inserts will tell you a lot of stuff that doctors and nurses and pharmacists won&#39;t. And the fucking military definitely uses it&#39;s soldiers for testing these out...can anyone say Gulf War Syndrome?</p>

Like Sister Kenny who could rehabilitate a polio patient in WEEKS...and she did NOT follow the current medical authorities methods that made polio patients WORSE!</p>

<p>&quot;Question everything. but don&#39;t blindly fear progress.&quot; ???......that sounds like everyone is equal but some are more equal than others! Question everything BUT the things that they authorities tell you NOT to! Ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In fact, not vaccinating develops their immune system so that they are stronger and more able to combat diseases. The fallacy is that vaccines HELP develop the immunse system when in fact the adjuvants sometimes aggravate the immune system and hinder natural development. My son caught whooping cough from his VACCINATED friend. We treated they symptoms with vitamin C and he is now immune to whooping cough for life...whereas his friend who was vaccinated will be susceptible to it again because the vaccine interfered with the development of his natural immunity....this is why we have whooping cough outbreaks amongst VACCINATED children...because the pertussis vaccine is not effective and is destroying natural immunity and hindering the growth and development of children&#39;s immune systems.</p>

<p>My point of this post is to point out that TRUST IN AUTHORITY must never be legislated...I am not calling for a ban on vaccines I am just saying that we CANNOT put our trust into the AUTHORITY, especially  when it comes to medical procedures and INJECTING serums past our natural immune systems...and we certainly CANNOT have medicine legislated into our bodies because then we live under medical tyranny as mandatory vaccinations takes away our right to choose how we take care of ourselves.</p>

<p>And no, the meningitis vaccine led to her contracting meningitis and I just got the story straight from the girls mother, she was was older than 3 months. But that aside vaccine injuries happen.</p>

<p>As you implied it, she caught it at three months old and had her limbs amputated either at that time or not long after. That was what confused me. I never said that it can&#39;t lead to her getting meningitis, as the vaccine can, it&#39;s a listed risk factor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch this (<a href="http://youtu.be/Twch-T-n8Ns">http://youtu.be/Twch-T-n8Ns</a>) and then tell me that the scientists are infallible and that we should move from medicine that WE choose to put into our body to medicine that is LEGISLATED into our bodies! The AMA and all allopathic medicine CAN get it wrong and it is immoral and unethical to mandate injections on a population. Not to mention the fact that we are in r/conspiracy here and there have been endless discussions about the authorities experimenting with poverty stricken populations and vaccines. What&#39;s to stop them from experimenting elsewhere when you are legally required to get vaccinated?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude this is already in the planning stages and NO it is not right. Keep an eye out in the media for it...they already want to force medical staff in hospitals (lower echelon staff of course, Nurses and the like...not doctors or administrative executives nor the patients that visit the hospital) to do so but right now it seems to be on hold...B.C, Canada is an example. They made it mandatory but then suspended the mandaotry flu vaccination because of the grief they will suffer from lawsuits, grievances, opt-outs etc. I was told that they will enforce it soon but when is anyone&#39;s guess. But it is on it&#39;s way and only an informed and educated public can defend themselves from this.</p>
