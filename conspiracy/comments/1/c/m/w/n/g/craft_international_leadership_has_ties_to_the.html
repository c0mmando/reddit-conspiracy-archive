        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://thecraft.com/craftLeadInstructors.html">Instructor bios</a> and a snapshot of <a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/people.asp?privcapId=117650330">key executives</a> from earlier in the year.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rigo-durazo/15/40a/b30">Rigo Durazo</a> is Craft&#39;s Director of Combatives and Lead Combat Instructor. In his skills &amp; experience he mentions &quot;Homeland Security&quot;, and in <a href="http://www.thecraft.com/courses/2013_8_26-28_CombativeTransitions__Centermass.pdf">this</a> release, it is said that he has &quot;spent years translating [his expertise] to operators including SWAT officers, <strong>Secret Service Agents</strong>, DEA Agents&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rich-emberlin/16/959/748">Rich Emberlin</a> is another lead instructor and is a 25 year veteran of the Dallas Police Department. According to his LinkedIn, he has an active top secret clearance and works for the DPD&#39;s <a href="http://www.dallaspolice.net/divisions/criminalIntelligenceUnit/index.html">dignitary protection unit</a> as the Foreign Consulate Liaison. According to his &quot;independent coursework&quot; section, he has also participated in an FBI SWAT training program as recently as last year.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mark-spicer/11/38b/32b">Mark Spicer</a> is a legendary British sniper and a co-founder of Craft International, as well as Craft&#39;s Director of Training. He is also the current Director of Specialist Projects at <a href="http://lpresg.com/About.aspx">LPR Elite Securities Group</a>, which has personnel with experience in &quot;the United States Special Forces, Department of State, Department of Energy, Department of Defense, U.S. Secret Service.&quot; One day after the February 2nd death of his pal Chris Kyle, Spicer was back to work making the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ospreygroupusa">YouTube Channel</a> for his new private contracting firm, Osprey Group USA. According to Spicer&#39;s profile on Osprey Group&#39;s <a href="http://www.ospreygroupusa.com/about-us/mark-spicer">website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has served worldwide with the British and UN forces on real world deployments, and has vast experience of counter terrorist operations. As an instructor he has taught many of the worlds elite unit snipers and served as one of a small selected staff at the UK Sniper School. In 2002 he was also seconded to the French Foreign Legion, at their request, to help train their snipers during an operational deployment for the UN. He has also qualified as a USMC sniper deployment officer and advanced sniper as well as a German Army Alpine sniper <strong>and since leaving the military</strong> has trained a middle east Royal Guard counter sniper unit, a Scandinavian sniper unit and several US Military and Law Enforcement unit snipers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spicer&#39;s penetration into the world of defense is so deep that <a href="http://www.fighttimes.com/magazine/magazine.asp?article=429">the FBI contacted him</a> to work on a task force as an expert witness in the 2002 sniper attacks in the Washington DC area.</p>

<p>With all of that said: why were these Defense Contractors who are trained by the cream of the crop <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cjmoc/urban_combat_troops_all_over_boston_marathon_who/">crawling all over the Boston Marathon</a>, yet were completely ineffective at spotting suspicious activity at the finish line? This is not to accuse Craft International of the bombing and less still to degrade the past service of its members and leaders, but the ineptitude of these supposedly expert contractors should definitely be a cause for concern and further investigation.</p>

<p>Most disconcerting, perhaps, is the <a href="http://www.thecraft.com/craft_skull.html">slogan</a> they adopted in the wake of Chris Kyle&#39;s removal from the picture: <em>&quot;Despite what your momma told you...Violence does solve problems&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted this in another thread, but it also seems relevant here.  This is just a thought, but say that the bombing was carried out by Craft International.  They were wearing khaki pants, black jackets, and one guy clearly had a Craft International hat on.  <a href="http://media.khou.com/images/468*264/boston_marathon_bomb_suspects_video_620x350.jpg">One</a> of the two suspects the FBI is currently pinning this on is wearing attire that is nearly identical to that of the CI guy laid out in the photos by <a href="https://images.4chan.org/b/src/1366284427802.jpg">4chan</a>.  So say they have an eye witness see this individual plant the bomb.  It would make sense to find someone who looked identical to pin this on.</p>
