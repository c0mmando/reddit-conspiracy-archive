        He has served worldwide with the British and UN forces on real world deployments, and has vast experience of counter terrorist operations. As an instructor he has taught many of the worlds elite unit snipers and served as one of a small selected staff at the UK Sniper School. In 2002 he was also seconded to the French Foreign Legion, at their request, to help train their snipers during an operational deployment for the UN. He has also qualified as a USMC sniper deployment officer and advanced sniper as well as a German Army Alpine sniper
        <strong>
         and since leaving the military
        </strong>
        has trained a middle east Royal Guard counter sniper unit, a Scandinavian sniper unit and several US Military and Law Enforcement unit snipers.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Spicer's penetration into the world of defense is so deep that
       <a href="http://www.fighttimes.com/magazine/magazine.asp?article=429">
        the FBI contacted him
       </a>
       to work on a task force as an expert witness in the 2002 sniper attacks in the Washington DC area.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all of that said: why were these Defense Contractors who are trained by the cream of the crop
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cjmoc/urban_combat_troops_all_over_boston_marathon_who/">
        crawling all over the Boston Marathon
       </a>
       , yet were completely ineffective at spotting suspicious activity at the finish line? This is not to accuse Craft International of the bombing and less still to degrade the past service of its members and leaders, but the ineptitude of these supposedly expert contractors should definitely be a cause for concern and further investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most disconcerting, perhaps, is the
       <a href="http://www.thecraft.com/craft_skull.html">
        slogan
       </a>
       they adopted in the wake of Chris Kyle's removal from the picture:

       I posted this in another thread, but it also seems relevant here.  This is just a thought, but say that the bombing was carried out by Craft International.  They were wearing khaki pants, black jackets, and one guy clearly had a Craft International hat on.
       <a href="http://media.khou.com/images/468*264/boston_marathon_bomb_suspects_video_620x350.jpg">
        One
       </a>
       of the two suspects the FBI is currently pinning this on is wearing attire that is nearly identical to that of the CI guy laid out in the photos by
       <a href="https://images.4chan.org/b/src/1366284427802.jpg">
        4chan
       </a>
       .  So say they have an eye witness see this individual plant the bomb.  It would make sense to find someone who looked identical to pin this on.
