        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Two high profile pedophilia cases have come to light in recent years, the abuses of Jerry Sandusky at Penn State and those of famed British entertainer Jimmy Savile. While both cases certainly garnered their fair share of media attention, their time in the spotlight has ended and we are led to believe that their horrific abuses were the result of a lone pedophile preying on children, while esteemed institutions turned a blind eye to their discretions.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, the media would pick up on a story such as “Jimmy Savile was part of satanic ring” <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/370439/Jimmy-Savile-was-part-of-satanic-ring">1, EXPRESS UK</a>, or “Jerry Sandusky was part of pedophile ring, victim claims” <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/united-states/120929/jerry-sandusky-was-part-pedophile-ring-victim-cl">2, GLOBAL POST</a>. These stories seem absurd at first glance. Yet if they are investigated further,  we are lead down a horrific and disturbing rabbit hole of pedophiles populating positions of power in government, finance, and entertainment.</p>

<p>This post will lay out the evidence for an international pedophile ring of massive proportions. <strong>The information contained within is of tremendous importance, for we are sitting on our very own modern holocaust, a holocaust of children. I promise that this statement is by no means an exaggeration</strong>, and urge you to not be scared away by these walls of text, which are as concise as possible while still conveying the necessary information. Throughout, I will be completely transparent with my sources, and will not beat you over the head with conclusions, but rather present you with evidence and let you decide for yourselves.

    <div class="md"><p><strong>THE DUTROUX AFFAIR</strong></p>

<p>I will begin in Belgium, with a case known as the Dutroux affair. This case is important because it illustrates how investigations can be undermined by a cabal able to place its members in crucial positions of power, and how powerful people can be implicated in abusing children. The Dutroux affair is was covered extensively by the mainstream media, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/16/news/16iht-brussels.2.t.html?pagewanted=all">3, NY TIMES, I use the MSM as most of my sources</a>  and was HUGE <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/21/world/275000-in-belgium-protest-handling-of-child-sex-scandal.html">4, NY TIMES</a> news in Belgium, where 350,000 people took the streets to protest the handling of the case, known as the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_March">White March</a>, from a nation of just 10 million.</p>

<p>The case begins in 1995, when multiple young girls began disappearing around the area of Bertrix. Young girls had been disappearing in this area for a couple of years but the BOB (equivalent of the FBI) was unable to develop any solid leads. A breakthrough was made when a suspicious white van was reported, and the police were able to trace it to Marc Dutroux, a known pedophile. Dutroux had been released from prison just a few years earlier, after serving a third of his sentence, despite reservations among those involved in the hearing and his own mother, who had warned the parole board that he would certainly cause harm again <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3522367.stm">5, BBC</a>. It was also revealed that Dutroux, though unemployed and receiving welfare from the state, owned seven homes and lived quite lavishly <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4422016/#.UW5SDyc3uqY">6, NBC</a>, from his involvement in selling children and child porn. It turns out that his mother was right, and Dutroux was responsible for the recent abductions. Girls as young as 8 reportedly starved to death in a makeshift dungeon in his basement, after months of sexual abuse <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/feb/28/childprotection.dutroux">7, GUARDIAN UK</a>.</p>

<p>The horrible transgressions committed by Dutroux are widely available knowledge and thoroughly documented, and though disturbing, are not important enough to focus on this case. Now, I will attempt to highlight the incompetence of the investigating police, and the subsequent cover-up of evidence by the state. Police had investigated Dutroux multiple times without any arrests. Once, they entered his home and witnessed the outside of a makeshift dungeon in his basement, while two girls were being held and starved inside. They even reported hearing voices, though they said they believed Dutroux&#39;s story that the voices were coming from the street outside <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/02/18/court-keeps-convicted-pedophile-killer-marc-dutroux-in-prison-in-belgium/">8, FOX NEWS</a>. Police ignored a tip from an informant, who said that Dutroux offered him between 3,000 and 5,000 dollars to kidnap young girls <a href="http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/dutroux/evil_1.html">9, CRIME LIBRARY</a>. Again and again, police failed to act on information, or acted with complete incompetence. Incredibly, Police had in their possession a video tape of Dutroux constructing the makeshift dungeon in one of his basements, and would have saved the lives of two girls who were being tortured while the police held on to the evidence, had they viewed the video tape and acted on it <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/1999/jun/17/stephenbates">10, GUARDIAN UK</a>. </p>

<p>By September 1996, the official body count had reached 8, and public outrage over police incompetence mounted <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/1999/apr/21/stephenbates">11, GUARDIAN UK</a>. Why had a known pedophile been released so early from his original prison term, and allowed to terrify a country while the police stumbled about, seemingly complicit in the carnage?</p>

<p>When the case transferred from the police to the courts, the coverup became much more egregious. The lead prosecutor, Jean-Marc Conorrette, was dismissed from the case, which drew huge criticism from across the nation <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/15/world/belgian-hero-dismissed.html">12, NY TIMES</a>. Conorette became a hero because it was his initiative that led to the police actually finding two girls in Dutroux&#39;s captivity. He also was instrumental in finding the bodies of four more girls. Conorette would later break down in tears in court while describing the death threats he received when he was still involved with the investigation <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/1456107/Judge-tells-of-murder-plots-to-block-Dutroux-investigation.html">13, TELGRAPH UK</a>.</p>

<p>Fuel to the fire would be added when a highly regarded childrens activist, Marie France Botte, claimed that prosecutors were sitting on a politically sensitive list of high profile customers of Dutrouxs thousands of video tapes <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-02/news/mn-39974_1_death-penalty">14, LA TIMES</a>.</p>

<p>Marc Verwilghen, the Flemish parliamentarian who became the most popular politician in the country after leading the inquiry into Dutroux, claimed that many in the Belgian establishment, including heads of government, refused to cooperate, and sought to stifle and ridicule his report. He claimed that magistrates and police were officially told to not answer certain questions, in what he described as a &#39;characteristic smothering operation&#39;. He was further quoted as saying &#39;For me, the Dutroux affair is a question of organized crime&#39;. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/1999/apr/21/stephenbates">15, GUARDIAN UK</a>.  A parliamentary panel revealed the names of 30 government officials it said were complicit in the hiding of Dutrouxs misdeeds, none have been punished <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jan/03/news/mn-4579/2">16</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most important information on the case comes from a victim of Dutroux. Regina Louf was the first to come forward, and was candid about the abuse she received at the hands of Belgiums child abuse networks. In 1996, she named and described in great detail, to a specially assembled police team, the people and places involved in the paedophile ring. Senior judges, one of the country&#39;s most powerful politicians - now dead - and a very influential banker were included. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent_europe/1962244.stm">17, BBC</a>. The BBC article [17] says, “The sessions not only involved sex, they included sadism, torture and murder; and again, she described in detail, the place, the victims and how they were killed.” She corroborated that one of Dutrouxs associates, Jean-Michel Nihoul, was instrumental in the abuse parties. &quot;At these parties Nihoul was a sort of party beast while Dutroux was more on the side.&quot; Nihoul had significant connections among Belgian political and financial elite. He confessed to organizing an orgy at a Belgian chateau attended by government officials <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/belgians_shocked.html">18, TELEGRAPH UK</a>. It emerged that Dutroux and Nihoul were part of a long distance child trafficking ring that imported children from Slovakia <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent_europe/1962263.stm">19, BBC</a>.</p>

<p>Lets get back to the questioning of the witnesses. The primary witnesses to step forward all suffered from Dissociative Identity Disorder. In 98% of DID cases, the person suffered extreme sexual abuse as a child <a href="http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/mental_health_disorders/dissociative_disorders/dissociative_fugue.html?qt=&amp;amp;sc=&amp;amp;alt=">20, MERCK WEBSITE</a>. The abuse that the Dutroux witnesses attested to is beyond comprehension. Louf, and other witnesses, recounted being raped by dogs and snakes, and being forced to witness the murders of other children which were captured on video tape <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/7563984/get">21, REGINA LOUFS BOOK</a>. That Louf spoke the truth about witnessing these murders is laid out <a href="https://wikispooks.com/ISGP/dutroux/Belgian_X_dossiers_of_the_Dutroux_affair.htm#Questioning">HERE</a> in an excellent manner. She gave a tremendous amount of detail to her prosecutors that she simply could not have known without being there herself, and there is simply way too much evidence to lay it out here. I recommend reading the whole page, which is as long as a short book, as the research is simply phenomenal. She also reported being involved with Satanic rituals, which I will address in greater detail later in the post.</p>

<p>Despite evidence that linked Dutroux and Nihoul to abuse parties and murder snuff films, the prosecutor that replaced Conorette, Jacques Langlois, completely dismantled the investigation. He sent police out on false tips and helped spread disinformation in the media. Although nearly 100 high profile people in government, religion, entertainment and finance being accused of involvement in child abuse <a href="https://wikispooks.com/ISGP/dutroux/Belgian_X_dossiers_the_accused.htm">22, ISGP</a>, no one of significance other than Dutroux was ever jailed. 9 police officers would eventually be arrested in connection with the murders <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-11/news/mn-42591_1_police-officers%5D%20but%20none%20of%20their%20superiors.%20%5BTHIS%20LIST,%20ISGP%5D(https://wikispooks.com/ISGP/dutroux/Belgian_X_dossiers_alleged_assassinations.htm">23, LA TIMES</a> contains dozens of suspicious deaths among those who were helping the case. I have only presented a small picture of what amounts to a mountain of documentation on Dutroux. For further reading, look <a href="https://wikispooks.com/ISGP/dutroux/Belgian_X_dossiers_of_the_Dutroux_affair.htm#142">HERE, ISGP</a> and <a href="http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/dutroux/evil_1.html">HERE, CRIME LIBRARY</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that my discussion on the Dutroux affair does not validate any of the claims in the title of this post. It is only one small piece of the puzzle. It shows how, from the bottom level of police work to the top level of prosecution politics, people complicit with pedophiles can be placed into key positions to ensure that investigations never bear fruit. Now I will briefly highlight pedophile rings that operated parallel to Dutrouxs during the same time period, again in which no high level officials were brought to justice, although they undeniable participated, to illustrate how widespread the child porn and child abuse epidemic is. I will then move on to more important cases. In Latvia, three top officials, including the Prime Minister, were named in connection with a pedophile ring in which 2000 children in the country were abused <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/19/news/mn-526">24, LA TIMES</a>. An online ring known as Wonderland was busted and yielded 750,000 images of children <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1109787.stm">25 BBC</a>. From the article [25]: “Wonderland originated in the United States but also operated in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and Britain.”  None of the men charged in relation to the ring served more than 30 months in jail, and only two were put on the sex offenders registry (in the year 2000!!!) <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2001/feb/14/internetnews.childprotection">26, GUARDIAN UK</a>. A child porn ring in Mexico was busted and said to have thousands of clients in the United States <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/31554.stm">27, BBC</a>. Child porn videos reportedly made a Russian ring 410 million dollars being sold in Germany, Italy, and the United States <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/sep/29/philipwillan">28, GUARDIAN UK</a>. A Dutch ring was discovered in which images and videos of abuse of infants were circulated <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/19/world/dutch-say-a-sex-ring-used-infants-on-internet.html">29, NY TIMES</a>. A magistrate leading an investigation into an Italian pedophile ring denounced what he called a “paedophile lobby” of powerful politicians which he said openly obstructed his investigation <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/italian-politicians-obstructing-inquiry-into-child-porn-on-net-635183.html">30, INDEPENDANT UK</a>. French police arrested 250 people associated with child pornography within a year of the Dutroux affair [31, NY TIMES](<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/14/world/french-police-arrest-250-men-linked-to-child-pornography-ring.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/14/world/french-police-arrest-250-men-linked-to-child-pornography-ring.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>THE LINCOLN, NEBRASKA SCANDAL</strong></p>

<p>From here on out the post gets more surreal. These child abuse and pedophile rings are not by any means limited to Europe. Rather, the United States has perhaps the biggest child trafficking epidemic in the world. It is important to note, before I begin the next segment of this post, that the FBI does not track statistics for missing children. Of all the statistics it keeps tabs on, rape, homicide, domestic abuse, what amounts to perhaps the single most important one in terms of citizen safety is ominously missing. Perhaps they simply do not want us to know how bad the epidemic is? It should also be noted that FBI prosecution of major child trafficking rings had been virtually non-existant.</p>

<p>Take a good look at <a href="http://www.tomflocco.com/Docs/Wt/WashTimes1989-1.jpg">THIS, WASHINGTON TIMES</a> frontpage story, published on June 29, 1989. The first chapter reads: “A homosexual prostitution ring is under investigation by federal and District authorities and includes among its clients key officials of the Reagan and Bush administrations, military officers, congressional aides, and U.S. and foreign businessmen with close social ties to Washingtons political elite, documents obtained by The Washington Times revealed.” The story never fully hit the streets, as agents grabbed the copies from newstands in the early hours of the morning. Another good article for background before I move on to American organized pedophilia and satanism is <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-05-17/news/9102140259_1_child-abuse-advocacy-parents">THIS, CHICAGO TRIBUNE</a>. The first paragraph reads: “All nine children tell the same story, a grisly tale of being taken out of school and abused in a blue house. They name the same culprit, a school administrator who, they say, performs satanic rituals as part of his twisted routine. In the 14 months since the first child came forward, police said they have conducted 150 interviews and cannot substantiate the claims of the children, who range in age from 5 to 9. Prosecutor Stanley Levco is more blunt: He doesn`t believe them, and he plans to publicly clear the accused.”</p>

<p>I will now talk about America&#39;s own Dutroux affair, which began in Lincoln, Nebraska, in the late 1980s. A good part of the story, minus the satanism aspect, is covered in a documentary called <a href="http://www.franklincase.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=category&amp;amp;layout=blog&amp;amp;id=17&amp;amp;Itemid=12">The Conspiracy of Silence</a>. The documentary was set to air on the Discovery Channel in 1994 but at the last minute, it was pulled and destroyed. We only have access to it now because of a “cutting room copy” leak a year later. The story begins with Omaha businessman Lawrence King, who was a rising star in the Republican party at the time. In 1988, it was revealed that he had diverted millions of dollars from the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union, the investigation of which spawned an investigation into a pedophilia ring of mind blowing proportions <a href="http://www.franklincase.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=16:king-expands-into-food-service-something-on-every-burner-jan-12-1985-&amp;amp;catid=6:news-articles&amp;amp;Itemid=14">32, OMAHA WORLD HERALD</a>. Soon enough, investigators into the embezzlement scandal began receiving reports of sexual abuse <a href="http://www.franklincase.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=26:king-expands-into-food-service-something-on-every-burner-jan-12-1985-&amp;amp;catid=6:news-articles&amp;amp;Itemid=14">33, NY TIMES</a>. Omaha newspapers were running stories of how young boys from Boystown were being prostituted among local business leaders and sometimes traveled to Washington. Parties would include sex, and abuse such as “beatings with extension cords while naked”[33]. Immediately, the FBI began claiming that there was no substance to the sexual abuse allegations <a href="http://www.franklincase.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=42:king-expands-into-food-service-something-on-every-burner-jan-12-1985-&amp;amp;catid=6:news-articles&amp;amp;Itemid=14">34, OMAHA WORLD HERALD</a>. The stories of the victims told a drastically different story. “The older sister alleged that King arranged for her to fly to parties in Washington, D.C., and other cities where men engaged her in sexual activity,”<a href="http://www.franklincase.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=42:king-expands-into-food-service-something-on-every-burner-jan-12-1985-&amp;amp;catid=6:news-articles&amp;amp;Itemid=14">35, OMAHA WORLD HERALD</a>. Apparently, the abused were all foster children, and they would miss weeks of school each year taking these trips [35].</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The head of the investigative committee, known as the Franklin Comittee, Gary Carodori, was also convinced of the rampant child abuse and was determined to bring perpetrators to justice. As a side note, you can view Caradori&#39;s interviews with the victims <a href="http://archive.org/details/GaryCaradoriInterviewsOfFranklinScandalVictims">here</a>. Early on in the investigation, Gary Caradori would meet an untimely death, during a flight on his way to Chicago to review new evidence. There was a scattered wreckage pattern, indicating that the plane broke apart in the air, and not upon impact <a href="http://franklincoverup.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;do_pdf=1&amp;amp;id=43">36, OMAHA WORLD HERALD</a>. The new head investigator would repeatedly lead the committee in the wrong direction, away from child abuse and satanic ritual claims. A state senator resigned from the investigative committee and said, “&quot;I really don&#39;t think the things Larry King knew will ever be made public,” <a href="http://www.franklincase.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=141:king-expands-into-food-service-something-on-every-burner-jan-12-1985-&amp;amp;catid=6:news-articles&amp;amp;Itemid=14">38, OMAHA WORLD HERALD</a>. He also cited concerns about the change in leadership.</p>

<p>A New York Times article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/25/us/nebraska-inquiry-is-given-file-on-sex-abuse-of-foster-children9.html">39</a> confirms that state investigators were given thousands of files regarding sexual abuse from children and testimonies from people involved in the foster care and education system. What happened next is amazing. Instead of indighting the accused perpetrators to develop cases against them, Grand Juries twice ordered the thousands of files to be sealed, and then brought charges of perjury against some of the victims! <a href="http://www.salem-news.com/articles/december292012/boys-town-scandal-tk.php">40,SALEM NEWS</a>. The mainstream media did their part to defend the grand jury and to marginalize the testimonies of the victims <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/29/us/omaha-grand-jury-sees-hoax-in-lurid-tales.html">Example, NY TIMES</a>. One of the victims was sentenced to 9-15 years in prison, and spent two years in solitary confinement!!! [40]. 8 years later the woman in question, Alisha Owen, was denied a hearing to commute her sentence <a href="http://www.franklincase.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=165:king-expands-into-food-service-something-on-every-burner-jan-12-1985-&amp;amp;catid=6:news-articles&amp;amp;Itemid=14">41, OMAHA WORLD HERALD</a>. Lawrence King, however, would leave prison after just 10 years, being found guilty only of financial crimes <a href="http://www.franklincase.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=170:king-expands-into-food-service-something-on-every-burner-jan-12-1985-&amp;amp;catid=6:news-articles&amp;amp;Itemid=14">42, OMAHA WORLD HERALD</a>. As with the Dutroux affair, I have again only shown a small portion of a truly mind blowing and exceptionally well documented story. Many victims in their interviews cited being forced to participate in satanic rituals, and had named King as a participant. What I hope I have laid out here is that there are certainly child prostitution rings in the United States and that kids are transported across the country for high profile customers. When people get in the way of these activities, they are silenced or killed.

    <div class="md"><p><strong>PRESIDIO MILITARY BASE ABUSE</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the next step in this expose takes us to truly bizarre and disturbing places. A particularly disturbing child abuse case involving a military day care center came to light in 1987 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/16/us/army-will-close-child-care-center.html">43, NEW YORK TIMES</a>. Allegations of abuse involving 60 children, some infants, surfaced at the Presidio military base in San Francisco. I would like to point out that this article claims that child abuse allegations had surfaced at more than 30(!!!) military day care centers across the country in the previous 3(!!!!) years before its publishing, including some of the most esteemed bases such as West Point and Fort Dix. It would be impossible to lay out the cases for each one here, but I would like to share this quote from the San Jose Mercury News: “Children at West Point told stories that would become horrifyingly familiar. They said they had been ritually abused. They said they had had excrement smeared on their bodies and been forced to eat feces and drink urine. They said they were taken away from the day care center and photographed. “ [44]. At the Presidio, at least 4 children were found to have chlamydia, and up to 60 had shown clear signs of abuse. The most important exposes into the Presidio case were written by Linda Goldston of the San Jose Mercury News. In an article titled <a href="http://truthontatelabianca.com/threads/abuse-case-at-presidio-quietly-closed-by-u-s.248/">44, “Abuse Case at Presidio Quietly Closed By U.S.”</a>, the events are told in chilling detail. The first victims to come forward were aged 3 and 4. Interestingly, the Presidio child care center was not closed until over a year after these allegations came to light. Initially charges were only brought against one man, Gary Hambright, a civilian employee. Later, however, it was revealed that police were investigating a man named Michael Aquino, a Lt. Col.  Aquino was the founder of a satanic church known as The Temple of Set. Army documents showed that children were often taken on unnanounced trips outside the center, and many children could accurately describe Aquinos house. The search of Aquinos house got investigators thousands of videos and photographs, and what appeared to be a soundproof room, but charged were never brought against him. [44]</p>

<p>The <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1037/h0079332/abstract">American Journal of Orthopsychiatry, 45</a> wrote an extensive analysis of the victims of the Presidio. They stated: “The severity of the trauma for children at the Presidio was immediately manifest in clear cut symptoms. Before the abuse was exposed, parents had already noticed the following changes in their children: vaginal discharge, genital soreness, rashes, fear of the dark, sleep disturbances, nightmares, sexually provocative language, and sexually inappropriate behavior. In addition, the children were exhibiting other radical changes in behavior, including temper outbursts, sudden mood shifts, and poor impulse control. All these behavioral symptoms are to be expected in preschool children who have been molested.” [45]</p>

<p>The San Jose Mercury News expanded on the story a few months later with an article titled <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/aq2.html">Army of the Night, 46</a>. This article dives into the satanic aspect of the child abuse at the Presidio. Satanism had apparently surfaced at the Presidio years earlier. Military Police had investigated some buildings after reports of a man dressed in all black holding a little girls hand had been reported. An MP was recorded as saying: “We kicked the door open and here&#39;s this nice little bedroom. In a corner was a mannequin with a gun aimed at the door. On the left side there was a bunk against the wall. There was a pentagram on the floor, a huge one. There were dolls&#39; heads all over the ceiling, just off-the-wall stuff... We were sitting there, we&#39;ve got a cult on the Presidio of San Francisco and nobody cares about it. We were told by the provost marshal to just forget about it.” As a side note, in February 1987, Aquino appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show and gave a passionate defense of his Satanic beliefs. On the Autumnal equinox of 1987, an occult day of importance, fire would strike a building adjacent to the day care center, destroying many records relating to the center. A month later, fire would destroy the day care center itself. The ATF found that the causes of both fires had been arson, contrary to the Army which claimed faulty wiring. Prosecutors would once again bring charges against Gary Hambright, but suspiciously they did not include the allegations of children with serious documented abuse such as missing hymens and rectal lesions. Apparently the children were chosen on the basis of who would make the best witnesses. The strategy did not pan out, the judge ruled the charges as “too vague” and Hambright walked free, and no charges were again brought against the Presidio military base day care center [46].</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>FALSE MEMORIES SYNDROME FOUNDATION</strong></p>

<p>The next case I will address is known as the McMartin Preschool abuse scandal. But before I delve into that, I need to address the False Memories Syndrome Foundation, FMSF. They are a prominent group promoting the idea that children who claim they have been abused in satanic rituals have either wild imaginations, or were prodded along by zealot psychologists. They have been tremendously successful in their mission. Recently a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/search?q=false+memory&amp;amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;amp;sort=top&amp;amp;t=all">Reddit post</a> promoting the false memory theory received over 2000 upvotes in r/TIL. Members of FMSF have been called to appear as expert witnesses in dozens of court cases. I have already established that there have been hundreds of different children reporting satanic abuse not only across the country, but in different continents as well. This alone should be enough to make the false memory theory very flimsy. However, there is a lot more interesting information about the FMSF to discuss. A huge amount of members of the FMSF have not only been accused of pedophilia themselves, but are also a part of the military industrial complex. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_J._Freyd">Peter J. Freyd</a> founded the FMSF after being accused of sexual abuse by his daughter. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_F._Dinges">David Dinges</a>, a member of the scientific advisory board of the FMSF, was involved with Navy Intelligence. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Lief">Harold Leif</a> was involved with CIA mind control experiments. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._McHugh">Paul McHugh</a> has been a very vocal critic of Dissociative Identity Disorder and has worked at many military hospitals. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Theodore_Orne">Martin T. Orne</a> was funded by MKULTRA <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1978/2/11/harvard-and-the-cia-continued-pbabnother/">Harvard Crimson</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Underwager">Ralph Underwager</a> claimed it was &#39;gods will&#39; when adults engage in sex with children. There are more suspicious members of the FMSF but I feel that this list suffices. I will end this paragraph with a quote from the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071216011151/http://backissues.cjrarchives.org/year/97/4/memory.asp">Columbia Journalism Review</a>: &quot;Rarely has such a strange and little-understood organization had such a profound effect on media coverage of such a controversial matter. The [False Memory Syndrome] foundation is an aggressive, well-financed PR machine adept at manipulating the press, harassing its critics, and mobilizing a diverse army of psychiatrists, outspoken academics, expert defense witnesses, litigious lawyers, Freud bashers, critics of psychotherapy, and devastated parents.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>MCMARTIN PRESCHOOL ABUSE</strong></p>

<p>Now, on to the McMartin Preschool case. The McMartin preschool, located in California, was the center of a massive child prostitution and pornography ring, and appears to be the center of an equally massive coverup. Concerns began in August 1983, when a mother told police that her two year old son had been sexually abused <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1988-05-01/local/me-3161_1_mcmartin-case">47, LA TIMES</a>. By 1984, 360 children had come forward claiming abuse <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/24/us/longest-trial-post-mortem-collapse-child-abuse-case-so-much-agony-for-so-little.html">48, NY TIMES</a>. A significant number showed physical evidence of abuse <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/24/us/longest-trial-post-mortem-collapse-child-abuse-case-so-much-agony-for-so-little.html?pagewanted=2&amp;amp;src=pm">49, NY TIMES</a>. These kids also described wild satanic rituals they were forced to participate it, such as eating feces, necrophilia and coprophilia, with some claims as bizarre as a babies head being chopped off, and being forced to drink the blood <a href="http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/psychology/mcmartin_daycare/3.html">50. CRIME LIBRARY</a>. The children told stories of being transported in underground tunnels. The mainstream media did their best to discredit the tunnel theory. However, archeologist E. Gary Stickel, PhD conducted a study of the McMartin preschool grounds, which you can read <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/stickel.html">here</a>. The survey was conducted in 1990, after the property had been sold, and long after charges against the abuse perpetrators had been dropped, and the victims thoroughly marginalized in the mainstream media, with help from the FSMF. Stickel found two extensive tunnel complex systems underneath the preschool, which accurately reflected the testimonies given by the children. In summation, the media and government would have us believe that 360 children all invented false memories of horrific satanic abuse, of participating in rituals in which adults sheathed in black ceremonial robes uttered chants, that they lied about being transported for prostitution across town, and that they lied about being photographed and videotaped for child pornography, despite verification of physical abuse in most of the children as well as the existence of tunnels under the complex. Again, the victims were marginalized in the press, the FBI denied any legitimate claims, the prosecution harassed victims endlessly in court, and all charges were eventually dropped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>THE FINDERS</strong></p>

<p>In 1987 the New York Times ran a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/08/us/inquiry-spreads-on-6-children-and-cult.html">story, 51</a> about a little known cult called “The Finders”. The first paragraph reads: “Police officials here said today that six disheveled children found in Tallahassee, Fla., might be the offspring of members of a little-known cult, but the officials said they had not ruled out the possibility of kidnapping.” The Finders had previously been described in the media: “In appearance, the Finders—mostly middle-aged men, always in dark suits—wouldn’t be out of place managing a local funeral home. But the behavior of the handful of adherents has people wondering whether they arrived by flying saucer. Townspeople say the Finders constantly walk the streets, following people home and taking extensive notes and pictures. They often appear at local council meetings, never saying a word but simply observing the scene. At other times, they plunder the visitor’s center of brochures, maps, and local travel guides. And they haunt the courthouse, scouring land deeds to find out who owns the local real estate,” <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/10423/finders-keeper">52, WASHINGTON CITY PAPER</a>. Who are these suspicious people, and what were they doing with 6 undocumented children, transporting them across the country? The children were found to show signs of sexual abuse <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-02-09/news/8701100820_1_sexual-abuse-school-for-brilliant-children-finders">53, CHICAGO TRIBUNE</a>. Customs agents raided one the Finders compounds, and found detailed instructions on obtaining children for unknown purposes and several photographs of nude children <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/931227/archive_016338.htm">54, US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT</a> .The US News and World Report article continues: “The more the police learned about the Finders, the more bizarre they seemed: There were suggestions of child abuse, Satanism, dealing in pornography and ritualistic animal slaughter. None of the allegations was ever proved, however. The child abuse charges against the two men in Tallahassee were dropped.” The stories about The Finders quickly died down, but would not disappear entirely, as rumors linking The Finders to the CIA persisted. According to the US News and World Report, “Customs Service documents reveal that in 1987, when Customs agents sought to examine the evidence gathered by Washington, D.C., police, they were told that the Finders investigation &#39;had become a CIA internal matter.&#39; The police report on the case had been classified secret,” [54] Florida congressman Tom Lewis was quoted as saying: “&#39;Could our own government have something to do with this Finders organization and turned their backs on these children? That&#39;s what all the evidence points to,&quot; says Lewis. &quot;And there&#39;s a lot of evidence. I can tell you this: We&#39;ve got a lot of people scrambling, and that wouldn&#39;t be happening if there was nothing here.&#39;“ A connection was produced, and confirmed by the CIA: A firm that provided computer training to CIA officers also employed several members of the Finders. Anyone researching the CIA will come to the conclusion that the organization does not contract training out to other sources, it only ever creates proprietary organizations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>CONCLUDING THOUGHTS</strong></p>

<p>I would love to be able to say I have exhausted all there is to know about organized pedophilia. Unfortunately, the truth is that I have only captured a glimpse of the epidemic. For example, I have not even touched pedophile rings in the United Kingdom, of which there are many well documented cases I hope that every single person who reads this post will be spurred to do further research, and help bring to light the child holocaust that is happening under our noses. I will end this post with a list of questions for further thought.</p>

<p>*How can pedophiles and sympathizers exist at crucial positions to prevent investigations from ever gaining steam?</p>

<p>*Why do so many people with a military intelligence background seem to have a vested interest in marginalizing victims of ritual abuse?</p>

<p>*How could victims of satanic ritual abuse exist in such diverse geographic areas and from such different walks of life?</p>

<p>*Why has the FBI and CIA failed to ever bust a major child trafficking ring? And why aren&#39;t missing children counted?</p>

<p>*Is it suspicious that  the transgressions of Americas notorious serial killers are so similar to the claims presented by victims of Satanic Ritual Abuse?</p>

<p>*Should we further investigate the social connections of high profile pedophiles, such as Sandusky and George Bush, and Savile and the Royal family?</p>

<p>*Should this information make us rethink the Feds recent push for gun control?</p>

<p>*Could organizations that traffic children also be involved in terrorism?</p>

<p>*What can I do to spread information about this epidemic?</p>

<p>*Is it possible that intelligence agencies or satanic cults would provide children to politicians with a purpose of blackmailing them?</p>

<p>Some final notes. This account is brand new for anonymity purposes but I am a long time redditor and have been actively contributing to this conspiracy subreddit for a period of time as well. Feel free to repost this essay as you see fit, anywhere, without worrying about credit. I do not care about recognition, I only want this information to be made public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll point out that there is a reason for involving and keeping people in such rings -- ability to blackmail them. </p>

<p>That is why 3 letter agencies when they do their screening of job candidates try very hard to find if there is any embarrassing things about their past that is <em>secret</em>. Because the adversaries can also find out and then use that as blackmail in order to force the agents to become double agents.</p>

<p>Now that is all obvious and clear, but this setup instead of being prevented can be specifically designed to entrap and solidify ones membership in an organization. Then the loyalty of the members is guaranteed under a threat of exposure.</p>

<p>There was another case where a politician was kidnapped, drugged with some drug cocktail that made them super horny and crazy and then was filmed engaged in some weird sex acts. Then when the drugs wore off, he was shown the video and was told that he needs to resign, otherwise the video would be made public. Now that is what the rumor was not evidence of such video was found as far I know but in theory the setup seems somewhat plausible.</p>

Graham Spanier (president at Penn State) had to step down after all the accusations but I find it oddly interesting that before he was President of Penn State he was President at Nebraska when all the child molestation rings were being connected to the Bush Administration. That alone should bring media attention his way, but no. In fact, rather than his career coming to utter destruction, he now holds a position within Homeland Security.

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, this is a lot of very powerful, very good information.  I may be missing something, however, because I don&#39;t understand what your thesis is?  It&#39;s evidence that pedophilia is a problem, yes, and child trafficking is a problem, yes, but we knew these things.  How does this all fit together to reveal something greater than the sum of the parts, which seem to be more a collection of lurid, tragic tales that our society certainly needs to address more effectively.  Your questions at the end largely identify gaps in information, but gaps are not proof.  They&#39;re simply avenues that need further exploration, by which proof may then be found.

    <div class="md"><p>What you left out is Jeff Gannon. Though technically that is part of the Franklin scandal.</p>

<p>But what makes it more credible than any other story, is that there are pictures of young kids, tied up, being sold. <a href="http://able2know.org/topic/159313-1">Franklin Case File: Jeff Gannon is Johnny Gosch!</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Noreen Gosch reports that it was to be years before she learned that the CIA was part of the International kidnapping and pornography ring. She and others have attempted to obtain copies of the catalog of children for sale,</p>

<p>There has never been a single reply to any request to produce this document&quot;. She also attempted to obtain from the Washington Press Core photographs from the hearing, also with no success. Noreen Gosch reports that Paul Bishop was in his early 20’s and called her, &quot;Mom&quot;. She now wonders if he was one of the &quot;lost&quot; children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that Gannon has not been questioned by police, his DNA taken to establish his identity, and compelled to tell what happened to him and to the other boys, shows that this group has power enough to stop the investigation. </p>

<p>Now Gannon/Gorsch survived. But what of the other boys? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.newyorkslime.com/gannon.html">Conservative White House &quot;Reporter&quot; was a GOP Plant</a></p>

<p>Gannon was probably tricking with Bush or Rove or both. </p>

this when

    <div class="md"><p>There once was a site for an organization called Project For The Exposure of Hidden Institutions (it&#39;s defunct now, but the site was at pehi.eu) &amp; it had the actual evidence dossier for the Dutroux Affair available online, supposedly provided by &#39;disgusted insiders&#39;.. It was the stuff of <em>nightmares</em>. My friend got so freaked out by it he formatted his C drive the next day. I never visited the site from my own computer after that, &amp; then it soon went offline for good.  </p>

<p>Any time I can post this quote, I will. Former CIA director William Colby, giving a warning to his friend senator John Decamp (not an insider;was a Vietnam war hero who got elected with strong local roots ), in regards to his campaign to get to the bottom of the Franklin Savings&amp;Loan scandal:</p>

<p>”What you have to understand, John, is that sometimes there are forces and events too big, too powerful, with so much at stake for other people or institutions, that you cannot do any­thing about them, no matter how evil or wrong they are and no matter how dedicated or sincere you are or how much evidence you have. That is simply one of the hard facts of life you have to face. You have done your part. You have tried to expose the evil and wrongdoing. It has hurt you terribly. But it has not killed you up to this point. I am telling you, get out of this before it does.”</p>

<p>This shit is real people. Kids are having their lives ruined every day &amp; it&#39;s only allowed to continue because of who these people are &amp; the network of protection they have, which in many ways is <strong>paid for by us</strong> </p>

<p>Thanks for your work OP. Fight on &amp; may you be protected!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly what makes it so horrifying. It&#39;s not even necessarily just the police on their side--it&#39;s the fucking CIA and parts of the FBI.</p>

<p>Something that I&#39;ve been thinking about/wondering is this:</p>

<p>My personal take on a lot of this &quot;Illuminati&quot; stuff is that a lot of the time, psychopaths and people with psychopathic traits are attracted to positions of power. Now, it&#39;s not to say that all psychopaths are pedophiles and vice-versa, but a pyschopath would probably be <em>attracted</em> to pedophilic situations if given the chance because it&#39;s one more avenue for control and abuse of another human being. That&#39;s why so many of these government connected pedophilia reports aren&#39;t even really <em>sexual</em> in nature. They&#39;re much more violent and abusive.</p>

<p>Back to my point, I think that these pedophile rings are ways of not only controlling the most deviant politicians, but also <em>finding</em> them. A long time ago someone figured out the connection between psychopathy and governance, and created the perfect &quot;honey-pot&quot; for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The motive behind this ring is control.  When a high ranking politician is involved in pedophilia and people have the evidence on him or her, they can completely blackmail that person.  They will promote his candidacy knowing that he is completely under their control.
   Prior to the 1960&#39;s there were rumours of a homosexual mafia, homosexuals promoting each because of their shared secrets.  Spies were also recruited in this manner.  Now with so many gay people (and fetish people) proudly out of the closet, that doesn&#39;t apply anymore.   Pedophilia is so heinous that it has become the new blackmail secret.  There are people who would sell their soul to the devil in return for fame, wealth, and power.   The devil wants more than a signature, he wants actions.  Blood in.. blood out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, this insight really is a strong case for why pedophilia might be more prevalent among these high ranking positions than you&#39;d suspect! It might even be used as an oath ritual... It&#39;d be a very compelling way to make a new initiate to the secret gang loyal, to make him commit pedophilic acts and file some photos and videos of it in the archives of the secret gang. Rationally thinking, even if not morally thinking, pedophilia is a very powerful tool. I never realized this before your post! Amazing insight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. Hardly anything is known. All I know is he dropped off the radar for a while, someone talked to him on the phone and he said he feared for his life... then he showed up suicided somewhere... right? I don&#39;t really remember the specifics...</p>

<p>And yeah the Johnny Gosch story is tragic. Allegedly he showed up later, as an adult, involved in the White House prostitution ring... but that was never confirmed.</p>

<p>edit: i mean, why would he be there? hes the one you usually invite for depiction of a certain subculture, like the hells angels allowed it. sounds like the exact opposite of someone you could trust in this matter. anyone could take pictures for them, who is probably more trustworthy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly have no idea, and I love HST... I hate to think he was involved at all. But it&#39;s in DeCamp&#39;s book. Bonacci describes the photographer and filmer as someone who seriously matches HST&#39;s description, but I don&#39;t think his actual name was ever stated. I can&#39;t remember how it&#39;s phrased in the book... let me try to dig a source up for you. Will edit this comment once I do!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Alright, I found one source for you: <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/goschgannohuntertrublingtale05apr05.shtml">Johnny Gosch, Jeff Gannon, Hunter Thompson and the Unraveling of a Troubling Tale</a></p>

<p>This is just as a starting point for you. I can&#39;t really tell you how well supported this article is, but it does quote the book accurately. I guess HST&#39;s name was given. Here&#39;s a snippet from the article. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his book, DeCamp relates many interviews and discussions with Paul Bonacci, the young man who claims to have been involved with the kidnapping of Johnny Gosch. Bonacci told horrific tales of being forced into sex with adults and other children. In one case he recalls being flown into Nevada with another young boy whom he did not know. They took on another passenger there and headed to a secluded location where Bonacci says he was forced to have sex with the younger boy. The young boy, Bonacci claims in this book, was also forced to have sex with adult males, who then killed the boy with a gunshot to the head. Bonacci says he was then forced to have sex with the corpse.</p>

<p>The passenger they took on in Nevada filmed the entire thing, and Bonacci recalled that his name was Hunter Thompson.</p>

<p>&quot;I think it&#39;s kind of strange that Hunter Thompson would commit suicide at this time,&quot; says Gunderson. &quot;Several kids told us that he directed snuff films. I think it&#39;s a strong possibility that he was murdered and I strongly suspect that it&#39;s all connected.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for digging up sources, i did some research about the matter too.</p>

<p>i dont disagree that bonacci believes it happened this way. as someone who had a psychotic break once i know that wrong perceptions and false memories DO happen, even though it seems like this phenomenon gets shamelessy abused to cover up all kinds of shit. this false memory foundation is indeed very creepy. but i think its possible to remember hst there when it was in fact someone else or even to place this memory there afterwards when mind control plays a role, like bonacci claimed.</p>

<p>as for hst committing suicide because of his alleged involvement: he was known to suffer from strong depression especially since g.w. bush turned the country into shit and he felt that all his rebelling against authority became meaningless and that his generation finally lost the war. at least thats what his wife said. thats a pretty good reason to hit the sack at some point. especially since he always said that he is gonna commit suicide once he feels the good times are over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t think they are above the law. To them, this whole pedophile thing is just something they do in their spare time. They aren&#39;t getting in to positions of power in order to cover up their pedophile ring, the ring formed around power. These people are the law of the land. This is how our authorities blow off steam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your research is very much appreciated.  We must all take note of these sources and summaries to inform our peers.  There was a video posted the other day that featured former FBI chief Ted Gunderson on false flags, which was very informative.  From his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Gunderson">wikipedia page</a>, I found that he also warned about the existence of these pedophile rings and their links to satanic ritual abuse...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He also investigated a child molestation trial in Manhattan Beach California. In a 1995 conference in Dallas, Gunderson warned about the proliferation of secret Satanic groups, and the danger posed by the New World Order, a shadow government that would be controlling the US government.[9] He also claimed that a &quot;slave auction&quot; in which children were sold to men in turbans had been held in Las Vegas, that four thousand ritual human sacrifices are performed in New York City every year, and that the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was carried out by the US government.[9] Gunderson believed that in the US there is a secret widespread network of groups who kidnap children and infants, and subject them to Satanic ritual abuse and subsequent human sacrifice.[10][11]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done an immense amount of research into SRA and the whole scare back in the 80&#39;s and 80&#39;s. Yes, there was a lot of hype and stories were certainly made up. But the founding members of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation have really sketchy histories. I don&#39;t feel like going all the way into it, but you can do your own research.</p>

<p>Gunderson covers many topics in this presentation, so I&#39;m lead to believe you didn&#39;t watch the whole thing. For one, McMartin was definitely NOT fake. They found the tunnels, and rituals tools and animal skeletons under the school. Proof was found, it was just found too late.</p>

At the very least, the gov claims that most missing children are runaways or abducted by family members, implying that this cannot be malicious <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/196465.pdf">example</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>You should definitely read this book if you haven&#39;t yet. I&#39;m guessing OP is familiar with the authors work, as he is one of the few that have touched upon this very important and very censored topic. Once you understand this systematic worldwide abuse perpetrated by maniacs and covered up for by other maniacs in positions of power and influence, everything else starts to make sense. I mean, is it hard to believe something like the Boston marathon bombing or the sandy hook shooting may have been staged affairs when governments are clearly capable of much more horrid and calculated acts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really?  Seems counter intuitive of them to have attacked so many government sites, then.  Or maybe this is the old straw man?  I don&#39;t know, man.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_events_associated_with_Anonymous">If you just look through the attacks organized and carried out by Anonymous, it looks much more like they&#39;re a collection of talented people with too much time on their hands and much less like they&#39;re some sort of back pocket government task force fighting a war for America on the internet.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but even someone <em>with</em> definitive protocols and guidelines have things slip through the cracks.  But Anonymous is vindictive.  If they uncovered even a shred of evidence suggesting that there was a worldwide ring of distributed child pornography involving multiple government and civil institutions, I don&#39;t think they would keep quiet about it.  Quite conversely, I believe they would have staged or at least put into motion one of the largest Anonymous attacks to date.</p>

<p>Simply put; I&#39;m not convinced.  </p>

<p>When I try to share these stories with people, I&#39;m always met with - &quot;I don&#39;t want to know about this.&quot; I can understand that, but... I reject willful ignorance. I couldn&#39;t live with myself. I&#39;ve got to track down the truth.</p>

<p>And sure, it&#39;s rare to actually find bonafide <strong>proof</strong> in this kind of research... but you find so many clues... so many indications... so many children completely independent of each other, all across the globe, all saying the same shit... you really have to start to wonder.</p>

<p>Hopefully some day the proof will finally come. We know Gary Caradori found it, and lost his life and his son&#39;s life for it. And what a surprise... the proof was missing in his plane&#39;s wreckage. Some day, that brave investigator will make it home safely, and share the smoking gun with the world. And these sick fucks will be brought the fuck down. It <strong>will</strong> happen some day. It has to...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think theres honestly much distinction. Them saying there&#39;s no spritual satan and therefore no god, gives them no absolute moral authority to judge them on the deeds they commit. Historically the catholic church, for example, has done some pretty horrific stuff and the higher ups who sanction such behaviour can&#39;t of been worried about gods judgement. I think the 1960s window dressing was just them rebranding to suit the godless modern era. This is all baseless late night speculation on my part.</p>

<p>Maybe someday you&#39;ll understand how insulting and immature this suggestion is. I know we&#39;re on reddit, but I digress. If you research (the book I posted in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/c9hwdov">this comment</a>is a great start), you&#39;ll discover that many influential and powerful people have ties to satanists, or are satanists themselves. Are we talking satanism in the literal term, like the bible and other religious texts would describe? Maybe; maybe not. Regardless, much of this evil is being perpetrated by those who identify with satanism. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll accept that insult and work on it. But, only if I&#39;m wrong about you being religious. But, since you&#39;re pleading the fifth on the subject while comfortably tossing out insults I&#39;ll just assume you&#39;re being an obtuse dick for a reason. But, maybe I&#39;m wrong!</p>

<p>Oh, I dunno. One that wants to make a buck if they believe it will sell. Just a theory.</p>

<p>Why would an establishment complicit in some of the most brutal crimes in history allow a book clearly highlighting its involvement to stay anywhere but in some corner of the Internet?</p>

<p>By that logic no government corruption would ever make it to press. But, it does. Every day in fact.</p>

<p>If you know how to read, anyway. Of course government corruption makes it to the press. This book <em>was</em> published. You can buy a hard copy. In my last comment I even said the author cites the mainstream press extensively. </p>

<p>Sweet, back to the entire point of me commenting to begin with. How does this explain that atheists are tied to satanism?</p>

<p>Ignorance is upsetting. Just like people thinking all christians are sick and twisted pedos is upsetting right? Or, how people think all muslims are terrorists. Ignorance is fucking upsetting. Do you get it? Also, I do pity believers and this IS peaceful. They&#39;re just words buddy. Now, spare me your rant on the power of words. Because sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me. </p>

<p>It sure does look that way being that is was comprised of only two sentences and both atheism and satanism were brought up.</p>

<p>Well, according to your last pope pedophilia isn&#39;t condemned in the bible. So, really. Being separated from your god would have nothing to do with the pedo ring. There goes your theory.</p>

<p>No. I don&#39;t need more books declaring that they&#39;re the one true god. There are literally hundreds. Why is yours so special. It contains nothing original. It&#39;s not the oldest. It&#39;s not the youngest. There is literally no reason for me to do research on the matter. Other than to argue with people. Which is fun. So, touche I suppose.</p>

<p>I came here to learn just a little about this case. Mostly seeing if there was any justice for the victims. But, now I want to know if there is actually &#39;100&#39;s of victims saying there were rituals.&#39; I swear to raptor jesus if I read those shitty books linked and find out you&#39;re lying...

    <div class="md"><p>your article is amazing. Thank you for your work. The most disturbing thing about these Pedophile rings around the world for me is &quot;Facebook&quot; and the voluntary trafficking of children&#39;s images by parents in light of this highly sophisticated protected, abduction and human trafficking scheme of children.  It disturbs me deeply. It is imperative that each one of us on this thread can  pass on this information to  people who have children and care for children. <strong>&quot;Facebook&quot;</strong> is the most sophisticated tool aiding the Pedophile rings as parents expose their children to  A world of sexual predators and murders.
We must educate parents about this threat to innocent children that they exposing them to. WE  Must start here. We must limit the access to children. We can start by Educating parents about this reality. Email that article to a parent that you know. Please advice them to stop Prostituting their Children&#39;s images on Facebook and Cloud storage where you have no control of data.( Sorry about my bluntness, but that is reality of our sick world.)........I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if NSA PRISM is aiding these Elite pedophile RINGS. I would bet my life, it probably is. Please, we must limit the access to innocent children. We must!</p>
