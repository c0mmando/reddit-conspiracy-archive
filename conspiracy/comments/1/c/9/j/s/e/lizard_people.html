    <div class="md"><p>In a conspiratorial sense, lizard people are a David Icke (tm) concept.  The idea being that, secretly, everyone you&#39;ve ever heard of that&#39;s vaguely important is, in fact, a lizard.  Part of a shape-shifting order of life that secretly controls the world.  Possibly of extraterrestrial origin.</p>

<p>I myself am not entirely certain how this idea got legs.  I figure people can engage in shadowy conclaves without being lizards.  But what do I know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you watch Revelations of the Pyramids it is pretty obvious that there was some wild shit going on a long time ago.  Then look at how easily we are tweaking DNA right now.  Sure we are mostly just doing mix and match now but that can create some crazy results, even with immature techniques and understanding.  If there ever had been any aliens for any length of time at all then it would have been childs play for them to mutate any thing that they wanted to.  Then he is digging back and finding tons of legends that point to very similar things.  That said I think that David Icke is much too certain of his findings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not Jesus but the son of god - whatever that means anyways.  He also thought that the world would end.</p>

<p>This event served a purpose in that it allowed Icke to completely free himself of the opinions of others.  I understand this because I went through this in my own way.  When I was getting out of the military in basic training after I realized what trash it was, I was ridiculed and demeaned in a manner that goes far beyond the normal experience.  I was in great standing doing the push-ups, being where I was supposed to be, etc and in good standing (meaning they didn&#39;t know my name yet).  Since I was the first to say fuck it there were 150 people being told that I was the reason that their life was so unpleasant (hint: its the military its going to suck no matter what).  At one point I was placed against a mirror and repeatedly the entire company would walk past me and nearly everyone would lob insults at me and laugh and yell at me.  The entire company save a few dozen.  I became the false reason for their misery to set an example.</p>

<p>This experience set me free and now I have zero fear of anyone not pointing a gun or a knife at me.  This set me free to say whatever the fuck I want and to think whatever I want.  The vast majority of people don&#39;t get to have an experience that is so over the top with ridicule that they become immune to it and it is a very valuable experience to have.</p>

<p>I understand when Icke says that it makes a lot of sense that this happened to him and that it could not have happened any other way.  Perhaps sometimes people set themselves up for epic fails so that they can learn that lesson.  I know that already the stories of my life are extremely colorful.  Joining the military was worst decision ever and when I chose to leave against crushing control it became my best decision as well and a major defining quality of my character.  Now I am near immune to ridicule and I can share my insights with people throughout life as to the fucked nature of that organization and the psychological insights without having lost the years of life muddling through it only to have been certainly stop lossed for another stupid war to come back shell shocked and likely poisoned.</p>

<p>Also as Icke says how awful is it to laugh at someone who you consider to insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, there&#39;s two parts to this.  First, the Lizard as the metaphor.  Every human has essentially three parts to their brain, based on evolution.  There&#39;s the reptilian part, which is all the fight or flight instincts, the dominance instinct, and the basis for hierarchy.  Then we evolved the mammalian sheath.  This is our feeling nature, our capacity for emotions, nurturing and (tribal) bonding.  Then the human sheath, which is the capacity for objectivity, thought and rationaility.  These three aspects link very well with the root chakra (reptile), the sacral chakra (mammalian), and the solar plexus chakra (human).  The root of the argument is that the elite of the world have a conciousness based in the reptilian part of the brain, or that they have easier access to information on how to manipulate the instinctual part of the brain.  David Icke seeing lizards is a misinterpetation of the figurative as literal.</p>

<p>A lot of levels up from that is the cosmic conspiracy theory.  In this theory, humans and Earth, because of our genetic capacity were chosen to help out the Annunaki and the Drakonian lines to become purified so that they had an opportunity to exit the path of fall.  The path of fall is the spiritual equivalent of dissolution.  The Annunaki were originally created through genetic experiment in the Sirian star system to &quot;destroy all humans&quot;.  They were created because humans have the capacity to realize their connection with cosmic source, which limits the ability for human fear to be used as &quot;Quantam&quot; food for extra-dimensional beings. </p>

<p>The &quot;path of fall&quot; is in direct opposition to the &quot;path of ascent&quot;, and the main characteristic of the path of fall is vampiric disempowerment of human power through fear.  Annunaki are a 4th dimensional representation of this cosmic game.  This is all part of the cosmic game of duality, which itself is an illusion.  But we all are on Earth in body to play the game, so there&#39;s that.  </p>

<p>Whether the Annunaki exist or not, to feed them through our fear would be exactly what they want.  Therefore David Icke is a dick for this particular line of philosophy.  Because belief in an elite ruling class of lizard people shapeshifters is inherently disempowering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;d be alright if David Icke was using the term lizard people as a euphemism because they are cold hearted and lack empathy but he&#39;s being serious. I&#39;ve read he based the idea on different cultures references to these &#39;entities&#39; long before people travelled distances to influence one an other. What is strange and I&#39;m not agreeing with Icke&#39;s hypothesise, is that people who take DMT do experience these lizard people when they are under the influence of these drugs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t kept up on most conspiracy theories for a while now, but that&#39;s a great way of looking at it. However, I wonder if that&#39;s <em>really</em> how the shape-shifting reptilian theorists see it, as having some truth to it, or do they actually believe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes its important to understand the legends.  There is far from definitive proof on the matter though.</p>

<p>I think that we can agree that these people/creatures need to get the fuck out of our leadership.  Then the next question is if we find some good aliens is that cool or do we hate aliens?  Then if the bad people are aliens we deport them and if they are just sociopaths then we keep a close eye on them.</p>

<p>We can at least agree to kick these fuckers out of the big seats.  Then there is plenty of time to determine their precise nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dealt with my first sociopath in Shanghai.  He was from America and able to work the language barrier very well.  He was horrifyingly awful.  Through traveling in strange funky countries I have met some of the best and worst - well far worse than back home.  Well then at some point - I can&#39;t remember when I realized that most of the people running politics in the US are sociopaths.  I look at them bells go off - FUCKING SOCIOPATHS.  Are they aliens?  I don&#39;t know and for the moment I&#39;m not that interested because if they were super chilled out aliens setting a positive example then I probably wouldn&#39;t even be that concerned with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The basis of the idea is that true power in our society lies in otherworldly origin. Perhaps aliens, perhaps demiurges. I wouldn&#39;t bother yourself with the conspiracy. There are much more important ones out there. If you are really interested, David Ickes&#39; Biggest Secret can be torrented easily and lays out an interesting hypothesis. I would recommend getting into other conspiracies first, such as the international pedophile ring protected by intelligence agencies (read Pedophocracy by David McGowan and the research on the Dutroux affair over at ISGCP) or else you will be entirely unable to suspend your disbelief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am fairly knowledgeable about the concept of what other people are explaining here. But with all the conspiracy misinformation who is to say what&#39;s what? So, we go to the one source of truth, the Bible to investigate. Lo and behold they are supported by Scripture one time only. </p>

<p>Then I saw three impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. They are demonic spirits that perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty. (Revelation 16:13, 14 NIV)</p>

<p>They are not lizard people, they are demons, or more accurately, people with demons inside them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lizard People are the main vehicle behind slandering the real issues that DO effect you and the world we live in.</p>

<p>See you just take real factual fairly easy to prove topics such as Zionism and it&#39;s grip on U.S. government, global banking, Hollywood, and the media.  Then if you&#39;re a Zionist supporter you simply point your finger and laugh at someone bringing up the facts, then you claim that that person also believes in reptile-people and tell them to get a tin foil hat.</p>

<p>Hopefully that will make the person speaking the truth look outlandish and foolish.  Therefore the rest of the population will keep drinking the kool-aid while mocking anyone speaking the truth on such subjects.</p>

<p>If the reptilian aspect doesn&#39;t work you can always resort to once again pointing your finger and yelling something about the holocaust to shame them.</p>
