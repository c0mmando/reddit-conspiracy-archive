       Okay, Im not some nutjob who likes to go against the government. BUT, this doesnt make sense to me... This does not add up. Im so fucking shocked right now..
      </p>
      <p>
       Three things to look at.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they announced they arrested someone who was not related to the boston bombing and was innocent after a strip search and released him this was the photo they showed. This isnt a photoshop and I saw with my own eyes on CNN.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
       So now Im like okay thats fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT who is this guy walkign with black hair and naked? Looks like the brother and is pretty built. REMEMBER THE GUY WALKING DOES NOT HAVE BLONDE HAIR.

       What I find odd is that okay say this is some random innocent man who was searched.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, why doesn't anybody from the media want to interview the guy to ask him anything about what happened to him? How he was stripped naked in the middle of the street and put into a police car naked because he was potentially the bomber.

       This thought bugs me as well.  You'd think this guy'd be in an outrage, considering the current climate, about being stripped down on national TV.  He should be blogging, or yelling on youtube, or even spamming reddit!  Where is he?

       I wonder this too about the person they supposedly carjacked, rode around with for an hour and boasted to about being the bombers. Who is that person and where are they now?

       I agree with this. I don't know about you, but if my naked body was just plastered on CNN, I'd be mortified. I wouldn't want anyone to know it was me. Also, if you look closely, just before the guy is put in the car you get a good glimpse at the side of his face, and the guy's nose is nowhere near as big as the dead suspect. Also, he didn't have nearly as much chest hair. I do think something is up though, something does seem off about all of this.

       This is the same question I have about the Craft international folks. Who hired them, why were they there, what role did the fail at with respect to securing the marathon etc
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the pics again, the crsft guys appear to not be interacting with any of the other law enforcement folks. They are seen alone and separate then running and grouping together near their vehicle but seem to have no connectii n to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Were they supposed to be private security to the sandyhook families? If so why were they not seen protecting any of their charges?

       What I find confusing, and correct me if I'm wrong, is why did the younger brother (tamerlan) try to kill himself by shooting himself in the neck? I'm not sure if it was a bullet wound or a knife inflicted wound but either way, if he is capable of building a bomb out of scratch a home then he is fully capable of committing suicide. If it was a bullet wound, then that just doesn't make sense. If it was a knife sound, it's extremely easy to commit suicide by slicing the carotid artery and you will bleed out fairly quickly because of the high arterial pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again please don't downvote me just because you disagree with me. I'm just looking for an answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also there's a strong possibility he won't be able to speak? So two guys are responsible for this attack, one's dead, the other's captured and now a mute.

       TMI but I'm gay and have seen my fair share of naked dudes on the internet... Bad quality video often makes body hair appear "not there" when actually closer/clearer video would reveal it actually is.

       I have a thing for body hair, specifically chest... so I'm the closest thing to an expert you'll find on this.

       Not only is the video poor quality, it's also really dark due to the time of the day and there's a lot of blue flashing lights which makes it hard to see much more than the general tone of his skin. I think it's enough for what body hair he may have to be obscured/appear not there.

       Even the autopsy photo makes his chest hair look different to the shirtless boxing photo. So there's all sorts of weirdness when angles/lighting comes into the mix.

       Was gonna say the same thing, low quality doesn't have hair show up. That guy has the exact same hairline so they either beat him to death and killed him or they put make up on (movie style) and he's actually alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm leaning towards him being dead. Agreed to a mission and is now dead after being betrayed.

       Its all carried out by the same clicks of people. If you have insider knowledge as to how they operate to achieve their means, you could easily have seen these brothers were patsies. Those clicks pull the same stunts over and over again.

       I can theorise, but I will not definitively extrapolate from what I think I know. That's not sensible. Organic events occur in the world as well. People do have extremist ideologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, by now, it's clear this event is not as it appears. But I'm working that out the way the rest of us are, not because someone has told me so.

       Owe but here is the problem with that. Once you know how they operate you can easily see the tell tale signs of their involvement. Sandy Hook, Aurora, and Boston all have their signs all over their work. It is clear minute one that it wasn't an organic event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also how do you say "Organic Events occur in this world" in a discussion about a false flag with insider knowledge?

       Because they do. Not usually on this large a scale, for sure, but are you telling me there are no Islamic extremists who would do something like this? Because I went to school in London with kids that definitely expressed these opinions and attitudes. I was told I should be killed because I wasn't observing Ramadan along with them.

       I have been busy with other things so I haven't had the time until now to have a look properly at the Boston stuff. I didn't want to jump the gun on it even if it conforms to a pattern.

       I cannot find any new information about him besides the few people on threads who also heard the chatter about him. Nothing at all, not even mention of this happening.  He was much older, 60's-70's and maybe Russian.  I'm asking all over the place because I can't seem to follow this up anywhere!

       whilst you were listening to the scanner i was watching/listening to tv reporters and they were trying to report bits and pieces and it was obvious they were mishearing each other, getting wires crossed etc i remember hearing a mention of a blonde guy and when the camera switched it was to a shot of your guy laying down standing up, to me he was clearly indian/pakistani with black hair.

       Naked Guy and Tsarnaev have identical hair. Completely identical, in the video you can see it matches up perfectly. Oh and the guy laying on the ground has wavy hair, slightly brown. NG and Tsarnaev have straight standing hair.

       Looks like him. Gunshots and incisions match doctor's testimony. Pictures of bodies in morgues pop up all the time, especially in high profile cases like this. Someone always wants to be "the guy".

      <p>
       I don't see how you thinking something is "strange" merits the claim that the body isn't genuine.

      <p>
       EDIT: However, if you have actual reasoning behind why you think the body is not the bomber/Tsarnaev, I'm all ears.

       They look a lot alike, which is why the police stopped him in the first place and made him strip.  They say he was release 20 minutes later, however. It seems as though no one knows his name (which is a bit odd) considering the magnitude of this investigation.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The police chief, Edward Deveau, describes how cops nearly apprehended the older suspect, and were placing handcuffs on him in the middle of the street Thursday night, when the younger suspect came at officers in a carjacked SUV. The cops were able "to dive out of the way," and the younger suspect then continued to drive directly over his brother and dragging him through the street. That's how the older suspect died, according to the police chief.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Going by that account, the picture of the guy standing there naked, with his hands behind his back - could very well be Tamerlan a short while before his brother tried to run them all down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The picture of brown/blonde haired guy, with the black hoodie, laying face down on the ground, was the bystander who was checked and released.

       The gash in his side was from an emergency thoracic surgery, which is common when there are multiple bullet wounds affecting internal organs. I believe I read it can also be used to try to manually massage the heart to try to keep him alive.

       Apparently yes. You can tell it was a medical incision by the iodine that stains his skin all around the cut. It was so big and messy because there was probably a couple of pairs of hands in there trying to plug holes and stop bleeding

       If the FBI had 2 years prior knowledge of the brothers, why did they allow these 2 to initially be falsely identified as the suspects?  So much bullshit in this whole thing.

       Mike and Sunil were the "suspects" on scanner by a dispatcher which then went viral cause 200k people were listening to scanners, so any word out of thier mouths and 1000+ made threads, articles.

       Does anyone remember the man who's photo was being taken against a wall? CNN reported it was the same man who was naked, after police allowed him to put his clothes back on. Can anyone find a photo of when the officer was standing beside him and they were photographing him against the wall?

       Seriously I'm so with you. As I keep looking into this, I keep thinking "please let me be wrong." I don't want to think what I think, but this insanely gap-filled and contradictory "official story" and irrefutable proof against it keeps making me think I'm crazy. It's like, if people look into this even just a little bit, they'll see how twisted it is. They'll have questions that
       <em>
        won't
       </em>
       be answered. Yet, conspiracy theories are relentlessly bashed in the public eye. Wtf is happening here?

       I am not the guy who questions everything authority says. I believe in the fundamentals of USA and Canada. I came here with this because alot of people in this subreddit dont mind spending time looking into details and analysing stuff.

       Look, there are thousands of people combing through every tiny detail of this who want to... find unexplained things, find discrepancies, holes, anything and honestly they will find some genuinely weird things and some crazy coincidences, there is no doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at Alex Jones, I mean he does it for a living. The key thing to note is he never finds the conspiracy though. He never produces something that is strong enough to take to court, never a solid list of suspects.. always tantalisingly out of reach until the next incident distracts him. Martial law always juuust around the corner (ever since he's been on air).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's identical in every situation, Aurora, the Sikh shooting, Sandy Hook, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will be down-voted to all hell, but it's just a classic and deep-held suspicion of authority that fuels it. Boston Marathon no different. Next similar incident will be the same.

       Shocking resemblance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some observations I make from this and just some exploring of possibilities in making comparisons:
      </p>
      <p>
       The bloody photo is from the morgue of the alleged suspect 1? So that should be one of the brothers yes? In particular the kickboxing brother.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the ear, the inside of the ear doesn't seem the same as the kickboxing guy picture. The living person has much more depth to his ear, the outer ring protrudes more. The inside is far deeper and well defined than the "dead" person. The dead person's earlobe seems to be much longer. The most compelling here is that the living person seems to have a very defined triangle shape to his inner ear. Whereas the morgue guy has a clear "cut" in one of the legs of what the triangle would be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what happens to an ear if blood stops flowing, or how he was hit and if any of that explains what I feel are differences in ear. But that seems very possible that something has modified his ear to look different. Not to mention the angles and lighting aren't exactly the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comparing noses, if you look at the picture with the boxing gloves you can see his nose is huge. Much bigger than in the other pictures. On the contrary the picture that is taken from his face from his left side shows a much smaller nose than the other pictures. Maybe it is because of intensive sporting that the blood flows better and these organs grow bigger or smaller?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the chest hair. This is a feature that is very easy to manipulate. Just because he has chest hair on the picture with the gloves doesn't mean he doesn't shave his chest hair. He could have shaved his chest hair.
      </p>
      <p>
       The picture of him walking is very bad and doesn't give a lot of detail. So they look very much alike, their total physique seems to match but there is like no detail in it so it's a bit worthless unless we get a better picture of the naked man.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have a better picture you could potentially also see if the chest hair was recently shaved. Even though that doesn't say much. What I'm interested in is the shape of his head. The naked guy has a bit more round head than we see in the other pictures. Is it because the picture isn't clear or because he is clenching his jaws in that picture? I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting though. If you are able to find even one piece of "physical" evidence that pretty much rules out the possibility that it's the same person or confirms it, that would be huge. Like if the naked man's nipples were at a totally different place you would have strong evidence that they are not the same person. Similar for the morgue guy.

       Agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah the angle/lighting/pic quality can change the way something looks pretty dramatically, but there appears to be no real resemblance between the two outside of being ears.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Upon further inspection, if you look at the pictures from this
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1WgWMQS.jpg">
        image
       </a>
       they look a lot more like each other since the details are not lost in the extreme close up. Still not convinced they are the same, but there are some resemblances. The 'outer ring' and the bottom part of the ear looks similar, but the inside looks different (could be swelling?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Really need a better angle of him healthy/alive to say one way or the other.

       The piontyness of the left picture is due to the angle. The wide ear is a more frontal shot.

       In all other aspects these two ears are identical imho.

       These are my opinions: I took a look at all those photos, and I'm convinced, the resemblances are too identical to be illogically not the same person. I even looked at the photo of the ear, the only reason why I can see it looks slightly different is because of the angle of the photos, and the angles the head's were positioned in the photos but if you try to look at them as if side to side at the same angle, they're the same ear. There's so much fucked up about this particular attack it's not even funny. Remember "Dawn" the principal that allegedly was murdered trying to protect children? Guess who was running in that 26th mile dedicated to sandy hook, like 9/11 the event took place during a simulation "drill" of the same type of attack same as during 9/11 they reportedly were simulating a hijacking of the same statue. I think it's fairly obvious this was an inside job, it's more obvious than 9/11 was. People who don't think so have no excuse and seem to forget that human beings lie, ironically they have no problem classifying everyone on the Internet as liar. But as soon as something is said on TV without mentioning otherwise it's assumed as a fact. It all truly began on April 15th. Where battleground martial law was simulated, that was the only real drill here.

       Its been reported somewhere that he was later released. In all honesty he does look similar in physical stature to the pictures of Tamerlan Tsarnaev during his boxing interview, however he does not fit the subjects physical build profile of the alleged morgue photo released of suspect #1.

       That's the carjacking victim. At the time the police did not know whether﻿ he was working with the brothers and thus could have suicide bombs strapped to him. That's why they stripped him before taking him to the station. He was interviewed and released when investigators confirmed he was a victim and not a co-conspirator

       Yes, coincidents can happen. Coincidence I, myself also have a athletic body with black hair and a hairline like this? Only judging from that video, there is not much you can see from the person but it is certain that there was a carjack victim that was arrested. The chesthair is another clear indication.

Police was called and the victim was arrested due to the above reasons

       Is it weird to anyone else that a picture of suspect #1 just so happens to get leaked to the public so quickly? I know people are saying it must have been the doctor etc. but I find it hard to believe they would just drop off the body of a known terrorist without personnel actively monitoring it.

       I should stop posting when I'm sleepy. What I meant was they've continually used the same formula even though it's practically on T-shirts now. I don't get the feeling they learn from their mistakes and get better at deception. I get the feeling they know it doesn't matter if a bunch of people see through it, but know that their authority will let them explain away anything that gets loud enough.

       Police were searching anyone on the street in the area, assuming they may have been one of the suspects and carrying explosives. The naked man was likely stripped and put in the cruiser because, like you say, he looked a lot like the suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suspect 1 had been handcuffed by police shortly before he was run over by his brother as he fled the scene, nearly hitting the officers.

       This is pretty crazy. BUT I'm pretty sure I remember reading (I believe in one of the live update posts) about them finding a guy who looked incredibly similar to one of the brothers but he didn't have his id on him and they were escorting him back to his house for his id. This is probably him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: can't link from my phone but live update posts 1&amp;2 mentions naked guy no longer being a suspect. So he was released. Also, can't seem to find what I remember reading about the guy with no id. It may have been a comment in one of those posts. I'm too tired to search at the moment.

       What if they leaked the picture of the "dead man" on purpose?  I mean it's not hard to make a fake corpse, we see it from Hollywood all the time.  And if you REALLY wanted people to believe this guy is dead, you'd provide cold hard proof.  And how many pictures of dead bodies of high profile cases get leaked nowadays?  Especially SO early in the game?

        The FBI arrived at approximately 2:55, went to the vehicle where the suspect was being held, who is now in pants and jacket, led him to a wall where it appeared they photographed him, before questioning him.

       I want to see the photos of him being detained against the wall. I remember seeing clear live video of the alleged person on CNN but now cannot find any photos or video of it online.

       If we could get an alive photo of him showing his profile we could check the ear. It looks to me like different ears, the ear lobes look similar, but the flesh above it (leading to ear canal) looks to be a different shape. Can someone professional tell us if ears have the capacity to look different after death?

       the blonde guy on the ground was someone on the street and not involved at all with arrests. he was not a person of interest, but walking around when the cops were searching the street. he was questioned and let go. nothing to do with the guy in handcuffs. im not sure what your actually asking though. do you think they are meant to be the same guy?

       Thats what I am saying. He was not the suspect, but there was only ONE suspect apprehended who was not the suspect DURING the car chase. That question here is WHO is the guy walking into the car IF he is NOT the innocent guy..

       Wow this is an amazing catch, the guy laying on the ground has a very different hairline than the guy getting into the police car. The guy getting into the police car, if you horizontally line the eyebrow to the point that comes down to a corner shape before the sideburns, it is a definite match. The guy on the ground doesn't even have that squared off shape, it curves instead. Also the closest part to the eyebrow to the hairline of blonde guy is not as close as the guy who is getting into the police car.

       Um. Apparently the brother reportedly had bullet holds everywhere and was severely injured before being run over.  Also, a cop said that he didn't get to handcuff him. He had to get out of the way of Johar. Then Johar hit his brother and dragged him a short distance.

       Left pic and right pic almost certainly the same person.  Top pic is too washed- out for a clear determination.  Bottom pic, the bridge of the nose looks a little too strong and the tip a little tooshort.  Anyway, if this type of thing shocks you, you haven't seen much about conspiracy that is shocking; this is vague and circumstantial.

       In my opinion that is "black" hair meaning dark brown being illuminated by lights from ALL OVER. the guy also has no chest hair which the big brother would have. Older brother was also already dead by this time this happened so the only suspect they wanted was the little skinny one which this isn't.

       I've been coming to this subreddit just seeing to look at things that raise questions, and most posts have no real substance behind them, but this is actually kind of shocking to me and very confusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I mean that really really appears to be black hat naked! I'm confused because I saw picture of him in the hospital all torn up as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: nvm. guy on ground and guy being brought in naked are the same dude.

       Omfg! They stopped him because he looked like suspect #1 that's what cops do. If there was a crime in your neighborhood and you fit the description of the suspect the cops would detain you too. Right? Now answer this, do you think if there was a conspiracy that involved HUNDREDS of police, paramedics, firefighters, police dispatchers, politicians ect. There wouldn't be atleast ONE that didn't agree or felt bad and would come forword and reveal the "plan"? And why. Why would they conspire to pull of this bombing? To pass a new law that could be overturned in a few years when we have a new president.

       If it was a conspiracy that hundreds of police, paramedics, firefightingers, police dispatchers, politicians etc were aware of, I don't believe all of them would keep quiet.

       Confused reports? There was only 1 man apprehended during car chase whom was innocent. That was the blonde guy. I was listening to scanner the whole time. Please prove me wrong..

       When there was a 20-block premeter, thats when many people got apprehended as being suspects.
