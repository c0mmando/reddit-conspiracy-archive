       At this point, I don't care if their opinions differ from mine (surely they do), if they use the issue as a platform, or whatever.  I want to hear the voices of normal people, who were affected by the tragedy, and who weren't reading off someone else's script.

       If they want to speak, I want to hear.  UNPROMPTED and unedited:

        the family of those who died

        the people who stayed in their houses, scared by terrifying news broadcasts

       Maybe a little off topic, but I was just watching some videos about 911, and the most interesting information seemed to come from eyewitnesses immediately after the event and before the eyewitnesses were exposed to the "real" story on the media ... extra explosions, appearance of molten steel, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       These stories were never heard again after the "real" story was accepted by the media.

       More to the point, and the only reason I am REALLY skeptical is that this happened at a major public event, at the end, with no doubt THOUSANDS of cameras. Everything since has been a spectacle and no doubt people whipped out cameras at various points during the week. We've yet to see:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Someone setting a backpack down that looks like the one detonated.
       </li>
       <li>
        A picture of the other brother holding the supposed dark backpack, because clearly the detonated one in all the pictures is dark, but you only see one brother with a light colored backpack.
        <strong>
         edit:
        </strong>
        There was a pick of both brothers holding backpacks on CNN just now. One is dark.
       </li>
       <li>
        A picture or, even better, video of: a 7-11 robbery (security footages seems to be scarce in all regards) the chase, which apparently involved explosives, and a shootout. (even fuzzy video would be nice in this case)
       </li>
       <li>
        The big plot twist on the mountain of character witnesses that seem to think they were both OK guys. I'm aware that the FBI questioned the older brother. Maybe there is evidence of that, or it's been documented for the public someplace and I just haven't seen it.
       </li>
       <li>
        A public explanation for Craft International's presence.

        has a CSS blackout up. What's that all about? Why make that public evidence so hard to get at? What right does anyone have to take it down? Speculation there is just going to go on elsewhere. It seems pointless.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I've been downvoted and given the Scientologist bum's rush all day for just asking about those things or discussing the militarization of police.

       I have seen minimal evidence that eliminates a number of possibilities for all of this. My concern is that before we see ANY evidence that eliminates those possibilities (all of those points that you listed would be a great start) and supports the current scenario, the media and people will have already settled on the "real" story.

       That's true, but I guess I'm trying to say that a lot of the things that were only shown once were very important pieces of information and evidence but were ignored because they didn't fit with the "real" story being told.

       The extra explosions thing is one of the most easily explainable things out of all of the 911 conspiracies.  Fact is, you have 4 very loud noises which could easily be mistaken as explosions.  Plane 1 hits, plane 2 hits, tower one falls, tower 2 falls.  Not to mention an ongoing on the upper floors.  They are interviewing people who were in or near the towers at the time.  Of course they are hearing multiple explosions.  Imagine I'm in the north tower and escape just prior to its collapse.  Shortly after, I'm being interviewed by a journalist.  I tell him I heard an explosion (first plane) and start evacuating.  While I was going down the stairs, I heard a second explosion (second plane).  As I get to the bottom floor, I heard a series of explosions (south tower collapsing).  There you go, media reports multiple explosions.  This kind of stuff is very common in the confusion that follows the immediate aftermath of a big event.
      </p>
      <p>
       These things are never reported on again, because journalists realize all of the people reporting multiple explosions are just describing the same set of events.

       Can you tell me what the purpose of random explosions an hour or more before collapse would have been?  You can't just start blowing up random supports that long before you induce a collapse (assuming controlled demolition).

       Ok ... maybe the explosions thing wasn't the best example, but a lot of people said a lot of things that were
       <em>
        potentially
       </em>
       relevant but forgotten after that first day. Particularly interesting to me is the fact that the eyewitnesses themselves might overlook their original observations because they doubt themselves once the prevailing hypothesis has been chosen.
      </p>
      <p>
       A better example might be that in 911, there were so many observations of the 3 buildings collapsing in near-freefall, like a "controlled demolition." Those observations were essentially never addressed after the first day because they don't support the hypothesis of fuel fires and pancake collapse.

       Well I don't think anyone is saying they didn't look similar to a controlled demolition.  However, there are obvious differences between a demolition and what happened on 911.  Those differences are never really addressed by conspiracy theorists.

      <p>
       Exactly, this point alone makes the currently accepted hypothesis much less likely, maybe even impossible. Pancake collapse from above would not look similar to controlled demolition. Therefore, other hypotheses need to be addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of thermite can explain the difference between a "standard" demolition and the collapse of the 3 buildings on 911.

       Anyone who uses his logic on me, I only ask them to provide a video (you guys are big on videos right) of how a pancake collapse of a similar building 'should' look so I can compare.  No one has ever provided me one.  In the absence of a video, I'm more inclined to side with the architects and building engineers than I am to side with the armchair experts...call me crazy I know.  Also, while we are at it, please provide video of a thermite induced collapse as well for comparisons sake.

       I'd like to see the scripted/edited media stand aside.  I'm sick of seeing 10-second clips of a grieving relative with a microphone shoved in his face.  You can see why people ask whether those people are actors, and maybe it doesn't matter.  The media lead them on and select what gets aired.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also like REAL people to be encouraged to speak out.  At length.  Share observations and experiences.  Bypass the media, because it doesn't care about us anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've been trained to think that sound bytes edited by some producer on the payroll of the national party is more important than the unscripted words of a real human.  That rambling or struggling to find words to express something, is somehow bad.  Actually, its just the opposite.  We need to hear how HUMANS speak, not the party machinery.

       Actually, it so totally is.  voice-over-radio is just the tip of the iceberg.  So much data, from simple Morse code to SSTV, travels over ham radio that hearing would not help in the slightest bit decoding, it's almost redundant.

       Good.  Any local radio  group would be PLEASED as punch to have ANYONE who geniunely was interested in their hobby, deaf souls doubly so.  As a hearing-impared soul, you could nearly punch your own ticket.  But only nearly.  You do have you have to undergo a bit of a hazing where you actually operate a radio

       That's a step forward, but I think it's really important to realize that it is still a collection of quotes or vignettes put together by AP reporters, together with the
       <em>
        reporters'
       </em>
       surrounding narrative.

       Have the Sandy Hook parents been harassed by conspiracy theorists? Yes. Have any of those harassers been Redditors... I have no idea. Hopefully not.

       I understand that, and apologize. It's a little hard for me to accept that the lot of the group is really interested in researching the event when virtually every witness is accused of being a plant, and every victim an actor. I realize that not every poster is accusing every witness and victim of being fake, but it sure FEELS that way. I'm sure that there are people here who can think through these events critically, and come to their own conclusions, and you sound like one of them.

      <p>
       I'll try not to generalize. But you can be damn sure I'll be downvoting (the internet tough guy I am) any idiot who proposes that any of the injured are "actors". Because I have first-hand knowledge that they are real people with real injuries.

       I'd like to see the scripted/edited media stand aside.  I'm sick of seeing 10-second clips of a grieving relative with a microphone shoved in his face.  You can see why people ask whether those people are actors, and maybe it doesn't matter.  The media lead them on and select what gets aired.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also like REAL people to be encouraged to speak out.  At length.  Share observations and experiences.  Bypass the media, because it doesn't care about us anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've been trained to think that sound bytes edited by some producer on the payroll of the national party is more important than the unscripted words of a real human.  That rambling or struggling to find words to express something, is somehow bad.  Actually, its just the opposite.  We need to hear how HUMANS speak, not the party machinery.

        Well I don't think anyone is saying they didn't look similar to a controlled demolition.

      <p>
       Exactly, this point alone makes the currently accepted hypothesis much less likely, maybe even impossible. Pancake collapse from above would not look similar to controlled demolition. Therefore, other hypotheses need to be addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of thermite can explain the difference between a "standard" demolition and the collapse of the 3 buildings on 911.
