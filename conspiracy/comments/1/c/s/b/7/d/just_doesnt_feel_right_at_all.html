<p>This video of a man looking similar to Tamerlan naked put into the back of a police car. I want to know who he is. Why hasn&#39;t this person come out?</p>

<p>There were 183 people injured, so there&#39;s 183 stories out there right? That&#39;s the biggest issue for me. I&#39;m not saying all 183 were Redditors. But I&#39;ve only been seeing pictures of the same 10 or so people. I&#39;m not hearing stories from any of the hospital staff either. I just want more proof! This is clearly not enough for me, and not enough for a lot of people.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense that the suspects were COMPLETELY normal. Normal people don&#39;t kill people.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen any pictures of the explosion from the battle with police. I&#39;m not seeing upset family members of 183 people. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if this is going too far but that grainy footage of them with backpacks doesn&#39;t look shit like the brothers.. Just looks good enough.</p>

<p>There has to be something someone can do about this. A stand has to be taken somehow. I&#39;m honestly so confused and frustrated at the inconsistencies in what we&#39;re being told.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to tell you shit you don&#39;t already know. I guess I just want to have a conversation, maybe share thoughts and anger with someone. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading if you did.</p>

<p>Edit; By the way if something like this were to ever happen in my city, I would make it my duty to get as close to the event and gather as much information as possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget the mom is saying the FBI has been in contact with the kids for 5 yrs. Nothing adds up here. From the event, to the response, to the media coverage. I haven&#39;t seen media coverage like this since 911, and 3 people died here?
And you&#39;re right...where are the 200 injured? Media would be swarming every one of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also don&#39;t forget about the FIFTEEN people who died in Texas and almost thousand homeless/injured, and theres not near the media coverage. Which should have been a much bigger story. But then again there&#39;s no agenda to push with that story besides failure of regulatory oversight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what pushes the media is a search for answers. for example, politicians or public figures who get caught in scandals and deny it make much bigger news stories because the media has to dig up dirt proving theyre lying. However, when these same people come forward quickly and admit they&#39;re scandals, the media moves on fairly quickly. The difference between Texas and Boston right now is that Texas seemed to be an accident. Boston however had a period where suspects were unknown, then they were known but identity wasn&#39;t, and now motives will be looked into and so it will continue. just thought id provide some context but you make a good point. </p>
