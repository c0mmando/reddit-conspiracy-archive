<p>Fucking Dzhokhar Tsarnaev comments on it in 2011, with the SANEST and clearest response. I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s all happening to him now. Now I really hope that it was all a set-up or some shit and got really badly caught up in it. Now America is against him...</p>

<p>Look at his comment: <a href="http://imgur.com/4FYXqmd">http://imgur.com/4FYXqmd</a></p>

<p>People who comment to say that people can change in a year can gtfo. I&#39;ve heard enough of that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may be wrong but I don&#39;t think he was implying pot makes you violent in the slightest but maybe he was easily influenced and was trying to appease/earn the respect of his brother.. they didn&#39;t seem to have a father around much, it&#39;s hard to explain how much this means to an impressionable young man especially a first generation immigrant balancing being accepted by both cultures.  His brother was probably jealous that it was so easy for his younger brother to fit in and have it seemingly so easy in life--the older one obviously was already mentally unstable and vulnerable so like most cowards he felt the need to ruin everyone else&#39;s life instead of just taking his own.  it kills me to say that but seriously either get help or just save everyone the trouble.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one has really given this kind of scenario but what if... </p>

<p>Tamerlan after being approached by the FBI in connection to supposed terrorist cell&#39;s and Radical Islam is brought in by the FBI as an undercover. They ask him to spend time learning from these groups and figuring out the kinds of things they do. Then one day in late 2012 comes and Tamerlan is again approached by the FBI and asked to bring in one family member to perform a drill during the Famous Boston Marathon. What informant/undercover wouldn&#39;t want to do that?</p>

<p>Insert CIA and FBI leaders working together(or maybe even at odds). Insert the saudi national who may very well be linked to Al-ciaduh terrorist networks and could possibly even be one of the higher up&#39;s in the hierarchy. Who know&#39;s maybe he even worked with the older brother at one point or another? Could there be a connection to the two of them?</p>

<p>Tamerlan has already been given weapons, ammo, and money from the FBI at this point. Having a long gun and handgun..no surprise. Tamerlan invites his little brother to join in on what would be the famous boston marathon drill...But hey bro we have to play it cool..this is a real drill with the FBI at the BOSTON MARATHON. How cool is that?</p>

<p>There weren&#39;t bomb&#39;s their backpacks.. Just magazine clippings made to make the bags look full even though the younger brother&#39;s bag looks a little light.</p>

<p>The two brother&#39;s were supposed to be in the blast zone and taken out by the real bomb&#39;s which is why everything that happened after was a shit show and so convoluted. </p>

<p>The real bomber being the saudi national and friends with connection to al-ciaduh brought in to make the real bombing happen. Knowing full well they would get an escort out of there..  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>or maybe the brothers were just out deer hunting by using pressure cooker bombs like back in their homeland of Chechnya (maybe they couldn&#39;t afford deer rifles or had pawned them) and their car ran out of gas. </p>

<p>So the two brothers got of their car to hike to the forest and put the deer bombs in their backpacks, and low and behold, a bunch of runners came by and they found themselves in the middle of the street with a footrace going by.  </p>

<p>They put their bags down for a second to help an old lady cross the street, but the vibration from the runners feet set off the bombs and they accidentally ended up killing people instead of deer....just as plausible don&#39;t you agree?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Usually I wouldn&#39;t touch your kind of comment with a ten foot pole. However I am suddenly feeling generous. You are part of the problem in this sub-reddit. I offered an explanation of a hypothetical scenario.. As much as I love sarcasm it was unnecessary. I am perfectly ok with eating downvotes but seriously. Grow up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ever assumed that this is just his typical response to a class assignment? He was obviously bright, but maybe just was doing what was needed to complete his assignment.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in school now, and I just write answers to fulfill the requirement of the question that was asked. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s doing.. 7 times out of 10 school answers don&#39;t truly reflect true feelings.</p>

<p>And shut the fuck up saying &quot;with the SANEST and clearest response.&quot; There&#39;s 50+ other posts that are actually saner and clearer on that question. He did what what he had to do the grade with as much minimal effort as possible.</p>
