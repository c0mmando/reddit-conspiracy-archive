    <div class="md"><p>Not using a throw away because I&#39;m sure if there already is a list I&#39;m most likely on it anyway by this point. </p>

<p>A few question for you if you can answer or have the time:</p>

<p>1) is Alex Jones a shill? (Don&#39;t like the guy but always wondered.)</p>

<p>2) where does Scientology fit in if anywhere?</p>

<p>3) what does 322 mean?</p>

<p>4) are there Deep Underground Military Bases?</p>

<p>5) what are these organizations biggest fears?</p>

<p>Sorry for so many questions but an opportunity like this doesn&#39;t present very often. I want to believe this is real but I take everything with healthy skepticism. </p>

<p>And if this is real and they are watching this I&#39;d just like to say &quot;good luck to you guys. More of us than you. No one has ever successfully controlled the planet. You may be winning the battles. But we will win the war.&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks OP for this if indeed you are sticking your neck out for us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could always create a new thread as you get new info. This is a fairly small community here so it will most likely receive visibility. However if this info is genuine you are giving there will most likely not be another post. Something as nefarious as you are describing would most likely silence you before you had the chance. And the more often you do post the less likely me and everyone else would take you as a real source. No offense. I am open to receiving private messages if you fear posting again. Consider me personally interested. Best of luck to you OP. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real truth is very hard to believe, so it gets frustrating trying to alert people, but here it goes: Icke, along with many who have had alien/demon/angel/lizard encounters was a victim of psychotronic weapons. These weapons make the victim feel as if they are possessed. Icke first claimed he was Christ. 
For the actual truth read &quot;The Matrix Deciphered,&quot; by ex-DoD scientist Dr. Robert Duncan or Google &quot;Akwei vs NSA.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in a conspiracy subreddit. Of course I will entertain certain non-traditional ideas and posts here. In my original post I didn&#39;t hail OP as some sort of pillar of truth. I&#39;m only engaging him in the small off chance it may be real. Do I believe societies like the one OP is describing exist? Yes I do. Whole heartedly. Do I believe that the entire federal government is involved? No. Of course I don&#39;t. I do believe there are people in places of high power pulling strings and using factions and groups of individuals in our government as cannon fodder and unknowing participants in their agenda. I&#39;ve done research. And no offense I can tell by your grammar you don&#39;t do much research or reading at all. It may benefit you to be more open to ideas instead of automatically dismissing them as false. Also I&#39;m not going to call you a shill because you don&#39;t fit the profile. You just seem uninformed and misguided. You should check out <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> or <a href="/r/Murica">/r/Murica</a>. Those subs may be more to your liking with people more suited to your current belief system. This isn&#39;t the place for you right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a fellow who did an AMA a while back, who claimed to be a TRUE Satanist. He mentioned a few things that caught my attention, such as identifying one of their main ritual languages as Acadian. This is a very little known fact about some of the &#39;old families&#39;. One of their languages supposedly is far older &amp; I personally suspect it may be from Atlantean-based speech.  I know many folks here laughed him off as a kook, and maybe he was but, there were a few &#39;glaring details&#39;.<br/>
Anyway, he also made mention of these supernatural aspects, &amp; I think that&#39;s where the rubber-meets-the-road in terms of the <em>real</em> conspiracy. However, I don&#39;t see it through the eyes of superstition &amp; ancient pagan metaphors, I think these are multidimensional beings who are just higher on the food chain, but don&#39;t have the high morality we might envision such beings as having. 
These families know how to communicate &amp; interact with them, and have been handing down this knowledge (as well as the &#39;relationships&#39; that go along with it) for a very, very long time. Sociologically speaking, it&#39;s completely fascinating!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen images from within a very nice mansion once, of a hidden &amp; very ornate room that I first thought was centered around some kind of elaborate poker table, when I eventually realized it was a sophisticated Ouija board. Looked like it had been in the family for generations. </p>

<p>At any rate, these folks are where the real power is. The scary power. Maybe that &#39;13th&#39; group is directly related to them, our maybe this is just another hoax for conspiritard to get their lulz. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t make a difference to me, I&#39;ve seen enough to convince me that this angle is very much worth considering, as intellectually scary as it may be. But if this really is what we are up against, how the fuck are we supposed to deal with that?!</p>

<p>I guess I don&#39;t really have a question, but you might look up that true Satanist AMA, see if anything matches up. I know that some Families are more into the occultic stuff, others more into global finance, others military &amp; media, etc.. that guy&#39;s family was definitely major Occult.</p>

<p>Stay safe bro ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, thanks for this AMA.  Many people are turned off from the occult aspects of the ruling elite.  That&#39;s normal, because believing such a thing is beyond the pale.  All occult means is &quot;hidden&quot;, so it is not such an unbelievable aspect to many of us.  </p>

<p>The families that he is talking about are the Plutocratic elites.  As far as extradimensional entities, belief in this takes either a leap of faith or personal experience.  </p>

<p>The truth about these families and bloodlines is that they have become pretty terribly inbred, and they are using a fast declining source of magic.  With genetic dissolution and old school formulas, these lines are actually losing potency.  </p>

<p>Ultimately, the extradimensional entities feed off of fear, and those that provide the food get the favors.  However, power from fear is infinitely less potent than power from the higher emotions.  The astral plane is usually the place that people can find these entities.  The astral is the sum of all beliefs, dreams and nightmares. Most see it as the 4th Dimension.  The more food astral entities get, the more real and powerful they get.  </p>

<p>The ultimate thing to remember is that the material (3rd Dimensional) universe is just school.  The school of choice.  It is predicated on the duality.  We are all much more than just 3rd Dimensional beings.  We are all part of the Unity of all.  &quot;One consciousness experiencing itself subjectively&quot; as Bill Hicks famously said.</p>

<p>To break through the fear of the psychic and astral levels is to move to higher and higher states of consciousness.  This requires looking fear in the face and refusing to feed it with your energy.  This requires love expanding from self, to family, to tribe, to nation, to global, to universal.  </p>

<p>Always, conspiracy has the capacity to either feed the fear, or give people the capacity to look their fears in the face.  Like a lot of things, it&#39;s dual and is a mixed blessing.  I love it when someone posts something like the OP&#39;s post on conspiracy.  This is a thread that attempts to get at the multi-dimensional nature of our current existence.  Anyway, love and light to all who seek, and may you be a candle in the darkness for those travelling through the realms of fear.</p>

<p>I for one am questioning the validity of the comments made by the OP but at the same time it&#39;s a subject I&#39;ve been interested in for a long time, secret societies and such. So even if it is all based on pure BS, fact or opinion it&#39;s still a good time.</p>

<p>Questions I will still ask:
1. Why has the OP decided to come forward with this info now?
2. Not a question, just research: The OP made the reddit account 17 days ago and made some comments related to the Boston Bombers.
3. Not a question, a statement: if indeed this does turn out to be a social experiment I am glad to be a part of it. :)</p>

<p>Most of the Bermuda Triangle &quot;disappearances&quot; didn&#39;t happen anywhere near the Bermuda Triangle. You wanna know something else?

<p>I claim rather that you are conditioned to &quot;see your truth&quot;, which you are...not that you are conditioned to not see the truth, but rather that you insist upon your own, from your own upbringing. </p>

<p>But you are right, the idea that your reality is based on a perspective that is based on your development--pure delusion from a pseudo intelligent big word user!</p>

<p>[EDIT]: </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If by that, you mean evidence acquired through repeated subjective observations that appear to be reproduced consistently, but still subjectively observed, recorded, and interpreted--a <strong>purely subjective</strong> process of striving to obtain access to what we hope to know as the phenomenal objective...that is science. Through these hundreds of years, science has repeatedly proven itself wrong by understanding the pivotal function of questioning what is in place. This is why there has been a pattern of scientists being mocked for ideas that are ahead of their time--attachments to paradigms and obsessions with being &quot;superior&quot; in knowing...when knowing is more about opening up, and understanding that all case studies are still case studies. If they have been fabricated, that is disinformation--but if &#39;hollywood sounding&#39; explanations were true, it would be pretty easy for them to seem fabricated (think about it). </p>

<p>What? For every scientist that was &quot;mocked for ideas that are ahead of their time&quot; there are 1,000 &quot;scientists&quot; who are mocked because they&#39;re spewing psuedo-scientific bullshit.</p>

<p>As a kid I was <strong>very</strong> interested in both Atlantis and The Bermuda Triangle, but instead of reading only the information (read: impossible to prove stories) that supported the claims, I read <strong>everything I could find</strong>. By piecing together all the evidence there was, it was pretty clear that both these phenomena were at the very least exaggerated, but more likely completely fabricated. </p>

<p>EDIT: Oh, and if you could provide me with the sources of your claims that people went through &quot;awkward vortexes&quot; (not entirely sure how a vortex could be considered &quot;awkward&quot;, but whatever), that&#39;d be great.</p>

<p>Objectivity is a central philosophical concept, related to reality and truth, which has been variously defined by sources. Generally, objectivity means the state or quality of being true even outside of a subject&#39;s individual feelings, imaginings, or interpretations. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is impossible, there is virtually nothing in existence that does not first pass an observer&#39;s feelings and interpretations.  It does me little good to suppose that things don&#39;t exist when they are not observed, but the point is that wise scholars understand the place of subjectivity in supposing the objective. Just because something is part of your media and outside a paradigm doesn&#39;t deduce it to be downright impossible. Tons of gadgets in oldschool sci-fi books and films have become realities. </p>

<p>A proposition is generally considered to be objectively true (to have objective truth) when its truth conditions are met and are &quot;mind-independent&quot;—that is, existing freely or independently from a mind (from the thoughts, feelings, ideas, etc. of a sentient subject).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is nothing that exists to us before its existence is contemplated. Again, connecting to the objective, as defined <strong>is not actually possible</strong>, for we are caged within an intersubjective process of trying to reach it and suppose what it may be. It is never conclusively understood to even exist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a simpler meaning of the term, objectivity refers to the ability to judge fairly, without bias or external influence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, impossible. There has never been a human being who judged without bias or external influence (development). </p>

<p>We may get pretty fuckin close to what the objective actually is, hell, perhaps we have even captured it from time to time...but it is always a subjective approximation. True complete objectivity is a myth used by egotistical scientists. 
But, you don&#39;t actually know what pursuing wisdom is about, do you? </p>

<p>Everything I bring to you, objective or not, is going to be labeled &quot;subjective&quot; by you because you&#39;ve essentially made your own definition of words that you use as the basis for your arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the simple fact that they do. I am surprised that someone with your supposed connections would be completely obvious to some basic facts.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example. Let&#39;s say I didn&#39;t find you amusing anymore, I could thus travel across the astral plain to your location (finding you wouldn&#39;t take that long) and then I could rip out your chakra points (which would result in your death or a seriously miserable life). If I wanted you to feel remorse or guilt all I would have to do is just tweak your chakra points. It wouldn&#39;t even be that hard to make you suicidal.</p>

<p>Now for reincarnation it is because they control the system. Unless you are a member of a sect or alien checking out Earth you are under their control when it comes to reincarnation to an extent. They even regulate Karma (something you should already know) and can easily punish you.</p>

<p>So it isn&#39;t that I believe, it is that I know they can. To counter their efforts you would have to be doing meditations or belong to a sect and still be doing the meditations. They will take notice of your efforts to go against them and they will attempt to impede your progress.</p>

<p>For me, the most fascinating thing is the potential conclusion that <em>consciousness is nonlocal.</em></p>

<p>Indeed it is.</p>

<p>Think about it from the perspective of an ocean.  Within the context of the great, wide ocean on this planet, there are innumerable - and <em>individual</em> - eddies, whirlpools, undertows, waves, and a myriad of other different, specific manifestations that the ONE OCEAN creates.</p>

<p>Souls are merely occasional eddies, whirlpools, undertows, and waves that undulate and manifest from within the creative ocean of The All.</p>

<p>Those manifestations can be looked upon as individual if taken in the context of individuation and temporary separation, or they can be looked upon as nothing more than a temporary extension of the One Great Ocean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Realize and understand, good sir, that Astrology is merely Astronomy as it more specifically pertains to <em>human</em> celestial bodies and their personalities (among other things) as opposed to stellar/astronomical celestial bodies and <em>their</em> characteristics.</p>

<p>That is to say that Astronomy deals with how the four universal forces of 1) the strong nuclear force, 2) the electromagnetic force, 3) the weak nuclear force, and 4) the gravitational force deal with and influence the proclivities and characteristics of all celestial bodies from stars to quasars, black holes, asteroids, etc, etc.  Astrology, conversely, deals with how these same four universal forces deal with and influence the proclivities and characteristics of all <em>human</em> bodies at the specific time and place of their birth.  You see the human system - from the cardiovascular, to the sympathetic, to the synaptic - is extremely malleable and moldable the moment it first exists the womb.  For the first nine months, the human system is largely in synchronous union with the mother.  After it is born, however, the soup of initial softness and malleability that is the newborn body&#39;s blood, lymphatic, sympathetic, synaptic, and nervous systems all become influenced by those same four universal forces that all bodies in the universe are influenced by also, and the initial softness and malleability of the infant&#39;s system becomes congealed, hardened, and &quot;stamped&quot; with the signature of how exactly those four universal forces were aligned at the specific time and place of that body&#39;s birth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pure physics really when you think about it.</p>

<p>The effect that the four universal forces have upon the newborn being at the time and place of their birth is what essentially influences their overarching sensitivities, their likes and dislikes - also known as their personality type, also known as their &quot;astrological sign&quot;.</p>

<p>Astrology is, in fact, really very practical and scientifically based when looked upon properly.  So yes.  You are correct.  There <em>is</em> a lost science underneath all the crap.</p>

<p>I have been told that the &quot;As Above, So Below&quot; maxim is important to my friend&#39;s religion&#39;s beliefs and that the idea of them being a microcosm of a macrocosm and the two being interlinked is a big part of what they believe too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In certain scientific circles, this is called Quantum Nonlocality, and, roughly speaking, shows that literally everything in existence is One.  Atoms are said to be interconnected counterparts and it has (somehow) been scientifically shown that what one does to one atom at one point in space has a direct, immediate, and instantaneous effect on its counterpart regardless of where in the universe that counterpart may in fact be - even if it&#39;s on the other side of the cosmos, in fact.  The effect is immediate.</p>

<p>As above, so below.</p>

<p>All is One.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>although I do not understand why they would involve themselves in the activities &quot;around the table&quot; and be complicit in some pretty damnable stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I provided a link elsewhere in your OP (original post) providing some information that postulates that the evil, hate, violence, and fear existing on this planet is the result of an attempt being made by some <em>extremely</em> powerful beings (it would seem more powerful than even your bf&#39;s family and associates) to provide the human beings of planet Earth with a greater foundation of conduct and comportment where it regards the concepts of good and evil.  The theory postulates that Earth homo sapien sapien, being a relatively primitive being, does not yet have a proper understanding of good and evil and the advisability of ultimate transcendence beyond both.  The only way that this primitive being will <em>get</em> that understanding is by exposing it to as much of both as possible so that it will eventually realize the futility of attachment to either and, subsequently, rise above and beyond both toward true divinity and (again) transcendence toward ultimate unity with (and as) The All.</p>

<p>It&#39;s said that this is in part accomplished by, again, providing a <em>lot</em> of good and a whole HELL of a lot of evil on this planet.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also said that beings like the family of your best friend are entrusted with being the ambassadors - the representatives if you will - of those greater beings that set this very plan into motion in the first place.  It&#39;s said that many of these families here on Earth are not even fully aware of this responsibility and merely act from a &quot;we are infinitely superior and can do with these Earth human imbeciles what we wish&quot; type of mentality...and that is enough for the creators of this plan to have their ideals still carried out.</p>

<p>As ultimately shocking, barbaric, abhorrent, and paradoxical as the following might very well seem, this entire plan is all said to actually be for humanity&#39;s BENEFIT. lol.</p>

<p>Paradoxical and insane indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>This sounds like the Hidden Hand material.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say that the HH material talks about the concept, but the concept of the transcendence above both good and evil is something that is much, much deeper and older than the HH material itself.  It is even more voluminously expounded upon within the annals of Indian Philosophy than in anything the HH material brushes upon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My friend doesn&#39;t seem to believe that is what his family is about or what is happening globally, but then again your theory would suggest that he wouldn&#39;t, or couldn&#39;t know that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well...I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to say that I&#39;m suggesting that he wouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t know that.  Hell <em>I</em> know it and I&#39;m just a &quot;lowly human peeon&quot; :), so why wouldn&#39;t he and/or his family know it also?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So it&#39;s difficult to ascertain the truthfulness of what you&#39;re saying, but I agree it&#39;s possible. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  It&#39;s certainly difficult.  I tend to pass the theories and ideas I come across through the filter of critical reason - or at least a filter that&#39;s as critical as I can possibly make it.  That is to say that regardless of where a theory comes from, if it seems sound to at least some extent, I would consider it worth pondering.</p>

<p>The idea that good and evil are <em>both</em> hindrances toward the evolution of the True Self is something that has been expounded upon at great length by the oldest writings known to humanity, and that the HH material also talks about it only reinforces the ideas that I had already come across in my ongoing studies of Eastern Philosophy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have studied the problem of evil from a philosophical perspective and I think the idea that evil is present in the world to contribute to spiritual growth is philosophically problematic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In what sense do you see it as philosophically problematic, my good man?  Does it have to do with the manner that The Problem Of Evil seems to undermine the tripartite nature of the Western concept of God?  Does it involve the inherent problems that the simultaneous existence of omniscience, omnibenevolence, and omnipotence present?</p>

<p>Perhaps I am not understanding entirely what you mean, however, so I will chose to wait for an elucidation from you instead of presuming.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>... and ask some questions. I have narrowed them to 20, from different fields and topics to maximise the chances you already had a conversation on one or two of them with your friend. If not, it can give you an idea on what to ask, without too much pinpointing on a single domain, which could raise suspicions on the fact you may have been asked to do so. In closing, I put value in the risks you&#39;re taking and offer you my sincere feelings for the job you&#39;re doing in opening people&#39;s mind.</p>

<p>1) What are the places/cities they most like (to live in, and to gather in for cult) and why? Are these hotbeds safe for us or quite the contrary?
2) Was the holocaust part of their plan?
3) If FEMA camps are the real deal, it means they employ nonmember people sharing their views (to build up, manage, etc?)... How come?
4) Were they created different in the origins or did they ascend to this state?
5) If they are ancient and allmighty, what did they do in precolombian Americas when the rest of the world apparently didn&#39;t know it?
6) What is their political agenda for europe and the EU?
7) What is the true hidden religion of the Vatican people? Who&#39;s really in charge there?
8) Couldn&#39;t they play with the world and humans, without the cruelty and suffering?
9) What&#39;s the real deal with the moon and planets: landing? exploration? settlements?
10) Are their pantheons only theirs because of what they are or could we access them too?
11) What is their theory on the origins (creation of the Earth, humans, etc.)?
12) Is Africa a big board game for them or no more than the rest of the world?
13) They have very different moral and ethics: what would be taboo for them?
14) Are all people in charge (politicians, big businessmen, natural leaders etc.) bound to be either manipulated nonmembers or manipulating members? 
15) They focus on the male, and the Royal Family is part of them: why the Queen then?
16) They believe in rebirth, and thus are not afraid of dying although they could delay it: is that because they would keep memories in the next life and simply continue (as opposed to pressing the reset button)?
17) Have they been betrayed during History and what of their lore at the time leaked?
18) Who are their historical figures and heroes, what are the deeds they did/do that they admire?
19) You mentioned that your friend had much money going in and out: what kind of business earn him so much and what kind of activity does he finance in turn?
20) Why did the Pope resign? What about the fishy prophecy about the Last Pope?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps the unfortunate actions of some of these schizophrenic people are some of the things your best friend and his family refer to when citing human beings as being little more than unworthy, stupid, ignorant sheep.  I myself am not saying this, by the way.  I&#39;m just postulating with regard to how they might look at things.  They may feel that an animal incapable of disciplining themselves sufficient to prevent things like you just described here from happening might not be worthy of treating as anything more than expendable fodder.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate, of course.  Many schizophrenics and others with ailments can do little about their condition.  However, and again, I wonder if their actions are looked upon by your bf and his family as yet another reason why terrestrial homo sapien sapiens are unworthy and utterly useless as anything other than worker slave-drones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I see it now. So this would infer that they care about the long term survivability of this world and the vehicle to do this is a leaner, more finely tuned population. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I did delete everything specifically because I have now brought my friend in the firing line</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  I figured.  I think your intentions are good in the sense that you DO want more (if not all) of humanity to know just what is going on and be more educated - be given the chance to be a truly noble species.  However, I can also kind of see the point of view of your best friend in the sense that many of us might just not be all <em>that</em> worth it.  Part of the ignorance we have as a species is due to manipulation by TPTB (your friend&#39;s family amongst others), and that ignorance, therefore, can&#39;t be all that faulted as a result.  However, the extent to which we as humans <em>perpetuate</em> the negative manipulation we&#39;re bombarded with and give in to the negativity and evil we&#39;re fed is something that we can and SHOULD control.  However, it seems that too many of us give in to and, again, perpetuate the baser aspects of our personalities instead of continuing to strive upward toward more lofty pursuits and ideals.  If we did the latter more often than the former, perhaps we would not be as easy to manipulate in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and his protection only extends so far... not if I start pushing buttons that are going to take away that protection over myself and himself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  This I definitely understand and was thinking long and hard about as I was reading through your responses.  I thought that if <em>I</em> was one of his family members and I found out about this IAMA, I might just cut a couple of his fingers off to show him a lesson.  To <em>you</em>, however?  Shit I&#39;d simply <em>kill</em> you and wouldn&#39;t think twice about it.  That really wouldn&#39;t be that big of a deal for his family, would it?  I wouldn&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I was really hoping you were being careful and I posted a comment (that got summarily downvoted) <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cs9ts/my_best_friend_was_born_into_an_illuminati_family/c9lh8wt">somewhat chastising 520Minus100</a> for what I felt was <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cs9ts/my_best_friend_was_born_into_an_illuminati_family/c9ldjm5">a suggestion pretty inconsiderate of your welfare</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He doesn&#39;t know I did all this, but if anyone higher up finds out, something unpleasant is going to occur. I went too far.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  Take care of yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I need to get him to change his mind about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While (again) I think your intentions are very noble, I also think its important to consider just how much work humanity as a whole has to do ON ITS OWN - independent of any disclosure on your best friend&#39;s part - in order for the species to improve overall.  We&#39;re certainly not HOPELESS.  No.  However, I&#39;m not all that sure sometimes that we&#39;re not all that much unlike the crackhead prostitute that simply keeps coming back to her pimp over and over again and keeps getting beat up, abused, etc because she hasn&#39;t yet faced the responsibility that SHE HERSELF must take to wake herself up and get herself out of the situation she&#39;s in.</p>

<p>If we as a society were more willing to take personal responsibility for ourselves and each other, I&#39;m not sure that your friend&#39;s family would have all that much power over us in the first place.</p>

<p>In other words, I DO think you should do what you can to get your friend to disclose what he knows, but I also think that you should think about just what exactly would happen afterward if he actually <em>were</em> to agree and disclose what he knows.  I wonder if all that much would change, or if we as a people would simply keep being sheep, causing your friend to look at you and basically say &quot;See?  I told you it wouldn&#39;t matter.  Humans are chattel.  That&#39;s how we treat them because that&#39;s how they act and allow themselves to be treated.&quot;</p>

<p>I know this might be a negative view, but I also want to make sure that you don&#39;t risk all too much of your own safety working on behalf of a species that might not even appreciate your effort and, consequently, might not even be worth it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All I can think to say right now is, be good to yourself, be good to those around you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly.  I try, and I&#39;m trying.  Heck, I don&#39;t even &quot;know&quot; you, yet my intention here is to help YOU be as careful as you possibly can in your endeavors here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prove these bastards that we are not animals to be slaughtered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We certainly are not that.  We may not be as smart as they, but we can exercise a will power and a wisdom if we but try and try that far exceeds mere intellectual prowess and grants something much, much deeper and more meaningful still.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prove to them that we have a spirit, a love, a compassion that they cannot understand and cannot embody themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless of whether they can or cannot embody or understand it th1emselves, I would say that it would indeed behoove us to work on showing and proving to them that we DO indeed have it none the less.  We <em>are</em> indeed capable of it.  Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not fear them,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>pity them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That or simply embody such a foundation of love and compassion that we simply continue manifesting that love and compassion independent of the need to pity them or anyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pity them that they have sold their humanity for temporal power; something so transitory, so worthless in the big scheme of things.  Let&#39;s show them our way is better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Temporal power, definitionally speaking, is indeed worthless in the bigger, eternal scheme of things.  I do think it&#39;s important for you to read <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz">this</a> though, sir - not so much because what you&#39;re saying is wrong per se, but because there might - just <em>might</em> - be a bit more to the static &quot;good v evil&quot; dichotomy that many of us might think is exclusively the case in a situation like the one going on with your friend&#39;s family.</p>

<p>I continue to thank you for your efforts at communicating your information here, sir.</p>

<p>Namaste,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the response. So your take is that they&#39;re just flaunting their position, and that there&#39;s really nothing nefarious behind it?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve often wondered about the messages embedded in the songs themselves. Many songs portray hopelessness, or an homage to needless materialism. Case in point, there was a dynamic shift in the world of hip-hop that took place in the early 90s that changed almost all of the lyrics over to either gangster-based or bling-based. Before that, much of the songs were quite poetic, and carried a message of hope.</p>

<p>Just my $0.02.</p>

<p>VC is doing great work by highlighting that which we were not seeing before.</p>

<p>No they don&#39;t.  Not <em>all</em> of them.  We have inside of us that great equalizer that <em>everything and everyone</em> has.  The All lives and manifests within us just as well.  The only difference is that we have become pacified and indoctrinated to forget Its existence within (and as) us.  Some of us have tapped into that existence, however, and, again, it is the great equalizer that turns the self from pismire to a whale.</p>

<p>As well you should as far as I&#39;m concerned.  That is something I personally look upon as commendable.</p>

<p>Well...perhaps all we can really do is make sure and work on ourselves, as ridding oneself of all superstitions might seem an exceedingly difficult thing to happen for some people.  With that in mind, however, what is and is not a superstition often seems to depend upon the source, as the world and universe we live in is pretty unfathomable from our current, very limited perspective, and we Earth humans hardly know enough to be able to really fully assess exactly what does and doesn&#39;t fall under the category of &quot;superstitious&quot;.</p>

<p>A hundred or two years ago, many things were thought of as superstitious that we know today are scientific truth - and vice versa for that matter.</p>

<p>All we can do is keep being as critical as possible and examine everything with as intelligent yet open a mind as we can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not certain that our current perception (not interpretation) is limited, maybe this is the biggest superstition of them all, in the sense that perception <em>is</em> reality. I know about <em>heightened</em> perception, but maybe it&#39;s only <em>modified</em> perception. Maybe we&#39;re creating the sense of height. Seems we&#39;re creators in a more direct sense than manifesting physical things in a physical world. Maybe thinking we know anything about what lies beyond our senses is our creation. Would our reason and words even be able to touch it, if there was anything else ? I seem to remember that anyone that had some experience remotely comparable to some state of enlightenment always said it was beyond words and reason. I know this seems to go against everything we&#39;ve ever been told and what we currently tell ourselves, against reason itself. To tie this perception with the world of interpretation, quantum theories seem to closely fit the bill. Theories about waves(nothing) becoming particles when someone observes them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly not certain if I <em>do</em> see what you mean.</p>

<p>Seems to me that what is limited is our perception of the limitless <em>sensation</em> that is at our disposal.  In other words, it seems to me that it is our <em>sensation</em> that is what is limitless, but our <em>perception</em> OF what we sense may or may not be up to par with what exists and, therefore, much of what exists we do not actually perceive and are, therefore, not actually aware of.</p>

<p>In a certain sense, the complete and total reality of Everything - of what is happening in a complete, universal sense - is already here <em>now</em>.  It&#39;s happening to us right now as we speak.  We (or, it would at least seem, many of us) are just not sufficiently attuned to perceive and be aware of that universal reality/energy.  The phenomenon is there regardless of whether we are aware of its existence or not, however.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Very</em> good of you to even be aware of this possibility, sir.  Very good indeed.  This is an important understanding.  What we want might not be what we <em>really</em> want depending upon the situation.</p>

<p>Well, with regard to this, I would generally say continue at it if you are driven toward it regardless of what any other entities say or feel about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t trust my own &quot;knowledge&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would seem that there is at least <em>some</em> knowledge that you could/should feel more confident about than others, no?  I understand that there is much that I do not know, but I also know that there are some things - some overarching concepts - that I DO very much know and <em>am</em> indeed very much aware of.</p>

Searching for enlightenment hides it from us, because it is everything, it is us without chains (those chains are the rules we received in order to &quot;evolve&quot;). Like we could do the evolving by stirring words and concepts. We are nothing appearing as everything. What proof do we have that some form of consciousness that we can supposedly attain for eternity is &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;better&quot; ?

<p>If so, then I think that Being Itself <em>intended</em> to mislead Itself, so things are going right on track in that sense. :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A whole epic, mystical, physical, legendary diversion.</p>

<p>Yep.  As the word diversion itself implies, what is happening right now is just a frolic, a game that Being is playing with Itself while in different forms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We never experience the future nor the past, yet we believe in them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true and profound.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Searching for enlightenment hides it from us, because it is everything, it is us without chains</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So obvious that we miss it as we miss our own nose.  The last being to know that water exists is the fish.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like we could do the evolving by stirring words and concepts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say that words and concepts should be discarded and disregarded so summarily, however.  Direct experience seems the superior way to go where it regards understanding of The All, but words and concepts might sometimes be a necessary conduit allowing some to get to a real understanding of The All in incremental steps.  As such, words and concepts have their place on occasion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are nothing appearing as everything.</p>

<p>We are The Everything appearing as something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What proof do we have that some form of consciousness that we can supposedly attain for eternity is &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;better&quot; ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess the answer depends on what you mean by &quot;proof&quot;, &quot;higher&quot;, and &quot;better&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Experiencing existence and thinking &quot;I must work to get something better&quot; is the work of profound, trained vanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are there <em>now</em>.  This is true.  Sometimes we don&#39;t know that we are already there now, however.  Paradoxically, sometimes it takes a bit of meandering about before we realize that the answer was right before us all along.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re trying to advance a token on a board game transmitted trough the human story, thinking it is our &quot;self&quot;, that when we get here or there it will be &quot;better&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We must often go &quot;there&quot;, however, in order to understand that &quot;there&quot; had always been here from the beginning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, we&#39;re already there and it&#39;s as good as it gets, if we care to see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we&#39;ve always been on track. I&#39;m not sure that Being intended to mislead itself, rather it just happened that way as the price for the experience of Being. Now we&#39;ve traversed the infinite void to this point where advanced brains appeared and concepts exists and drive experience. That sea of concepts inevitably contain goals, which inevitably contain problems (knowledge of good and evil from the garden). The &quot;problem&quot; concept (or pleasure and suffering) seems to have a gravity to it which eats and blocks our attention in it. A trap that maybe had to exist if anything was ever to exist.

<p>Why would you think it hypocritical?  Paradoxical, perhaps.  But hypocritical?</p>

<p>That&#39;s an interesting question for me indeed. Maybe it&#39;s bs.</p>

<p>I think we drove that thing to the ground, as it must have been done countless times. I&#39;ll try to be that obvious surge of joy underlying it all.

<p>Edit: Or, I admit, they can be a recipe guiding to some realization. Like a kitchen recipe could guide to a nice taste. But it&#39;s important to remember we&#39;ll be the one tasting. And that a certain taste won&#39;t change the nature of tasting itself, which we already know, even from the less desirable meal.</p>

<p>So then <a href="http://www.gq.com/images/gq/features/060106/GQfeature10v.jpg">sit quiet and meditate as the banyan tree grows</a>.  Words indeed can be cumbersome things and often complicate more than they solve.  Sometimes its best to sit quietly and let the silence speak.</p>

<p>It often says more than words ever could.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not finished with this IAMA - only about half way through, so maybe you might have answered this already - but considering I haven&#39;t seen this asked yet, I&#39;ll put it out there:</p>

<p>Are you allowed to talk about or even delve into why it was that your best friend got kicked out of the organization or is no longer with them?</p>

<p>Also, as per your Interview With A Vampire reference, here&#39;s another question you might have already addressed elsewhere:  Your best friend&#39;s family...are they extraordinarily long-lived beings?  I know you mentioned their awareness of technology vastly more advanced than that which the public sector has on this planet, so maybe they have the capacity to live for very long periods of time by virtue of their medical knowledge.  Do you have any awareness of anything like this as it pertains to your bf&#39;s family? or he himself for that matter?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of it this way.</p>

<p>Concidering how the current system as you said is male centered, and being a guy myself  I can tell you 1 thing long term that matters.</p>

<p>Legacy and how your remembered.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t you want to be remembered to ushering a new  era of humanity interms of technology,knowledge, etc etc?</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t understand about the TPTB  is that  for such a great gathering of power.techology etc etc   they choose to waste it on pathetic destuction.</p>

<p>If they were truely higher  then the &quot;sheep&quot; as they say  then they would be   focusing on creating good things.</p>

<p>If we truely had access to  all that advance tech  imagine what  humanity could be.  We could be a force in the stars.</p>

<p>I think that the  pop count on the guide stones is  abit of trickery since it said nothing about human  populations  on other planets.</p>

<p>Also does the TPTB really think that hiding in the shadows,yet 
telling/ showing stuff right infront of people   is abit ironic?
&quot;oh we are so secret.........  LETS PUT THE SYMBOLS EVERYWHERE!&quot;</p>

<p>Actually I got 1 question  if the TPTB  want population reduction, then atleast  don&#39;t kill the smart people, because the more smart people that breed/live   the better it is for everyone long term, and  after a few  smart generations   we might be able to comprehend/master  that  advanced tech the TPTB  have been keeping from us(possibly waiting til we get  &quot;on there level of  intellect&quot;?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I think the TPTB have been doing the culling process for quite the while now and are doing it in a evil yet smart way.</p>

<p>They mess with the food,water, air,information etc etc etc.</p>

<p>The people that are smart try to stop/avoid the dangers and are deemed worthy because they were smart enough to figure things out etc etc, but are usually hated by  the dumbed down people.</p>

<p>While the dumb people fall for it, and dig there own grave unless they  wake up in time.</p>

<p>I think that in a odd way, they do like the people that solve out whats going on, but  they are very picky about it.</p>

<p>What  I realise about the TPTB is that they have become so blinded by power that they forgot why they joined forces in the first place.</p>

<p>Its not like the TPTB can&#39;t  fixed this world  and make it better, they just choose to mess with it, because frankly they are bored.</p>

<p>You mentioned civilization earlier right?  Well  I  bet the TPTB  think that they completed all the requirements for this level  if you will, and they are thinking about  pulling a sim city and  starting over.  However   they could always do some cheat codes  or just wait it out til they get enough money/rescources/research   to get to the next civilization stage.</p>

<p>Inother words   TPTB  are fucking bored because they think that they did  all that they can do and are wondering why we are not  at there &quot;level&quot;.</p>

<p>We could be at there level IF WE HAD ACCESS THERE TECHNOLOGY ETC ETC.</p>

<p>The TPTB are basically screwing  the TPTB up long term.</p>

<p>Nothing is stopping Humans from having a advanced society, other then the TPTB  blind stupidity.</p>

<p>The TPTB  shouldn&#39;t even  &quot;B&quot;   if they can&#39;t get there shit together.</p>

<p>let me ask you something.</p>

<p>if TPTB revealed/released  all of there advanced tech tomorrow or something like that, how would the world react?</p>

<p>Honestly  Maybe the reason why they keep it from us is because they have no fucking clue what the average guy would probally think about it or if they would even care.</p>

<p>They probally hate humanity so much because other humans  probally shunned them or something.</p>

<p>But don&#39;t they realise by fucking up the world and its people, it simply leads to more problems and more secret societies of good and bad?</p>

<p>Maybe the 13th family  knows this, and has seen this happen over and over and that is why they sit out for the most part.</p>

<p>TPTB are creating there own monsters in every sense of the word.</p>

<p>Honestly WTF do the TPTB even meet about for the part?</p>

<p>like think about it.</p>

<p>First there tech is expensive, but then slowly as people get more access to it, figure it out etc etc etc   that tech becomes mainstream and widely used and practical.</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe TPTB wouldn&#39;t have to be in secret anymore and would  improve who they are in alot of ways if they thought that the average person could handle  it.</p>

<p>Think how much cellphones and wireless technology   has improved every ones lives, including TPTB&#39;s  in a way.</p>

<p>TPTB put themselves up on a pedistal, instead of being down to earth.</p>

<p>All that tech they have, could have been used to make  a galactic empire by now.</p>

What you just mentioned here is a <em>much</em> bigger reason as to why TPTB are making sure and keeping the truth about ET existence under wraps.  It&#39;s because they would also have to disclose the truth about free energy as well, and that would cause them to loose <em>all</em> (or at least a great majority) of their power over the people.  The idea that &quot;the masses just wouldn&#39;t be able to handle the truth and mass chaos would ensue!  We must protect the people from themselves!&quot; is only an excuse.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Yes. I think they underestimate the public&#39;s ability to accept the ET reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, my good man.  What they are most certainly <em>not</em> underestimating is the extent to which disclosure of ET existence will also necessarily involve disclosure of the propulsion technologies that were responsible for allowing those ETs to get here in the first place.</p>

<p>Once <em>THAT</em> cat is out of the bag, then it will be a very short time indeed before something very similar to those same types of propulsion technologies are globally acknowledged by and available to the mass of humanity - and since these propulsion technologies involve the use of devices that can derive energy &quot;out of thin air&quot; - i.e. from the atmosphere itself in an absolutely free, clean, and eternally abundant manner - then the paradigm of manipulative money control TPTB on this planet have had the masses thoroughly enslaved with for who knows how long would come summarily crashing down.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really hard to enslave people when you don&#39;t have anything whatsoever they need and they can already get whatever they want for themselves.  The advent of free energy would help literally <em>every</em> human on Earth be able to provide for themselves and their families without having to spend almost any money whatsoever.</p>

<p>That would absolutely destroy the money paradigm and TPTB&#39;s power and control over the population.</p>

<p>ET disclosure would do that...so no.  The LAST thing TPTB want/will disclose is the truth about ET existence.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t underestimate the public&#39;s ability to accept ET reality.  They <em>know</em> the public will be able to accept it.  They <em>know</em> it won&#39;t cause mass chaos.  What they <em>also</em> know, however, is that they (TPTB themselves) would soon loose all their power and control over the people after ET disclosure for the reasons I mentioned above.</p>

<p><em>THAT&#39;S</em> the reason why they don&#39;t disclose ET reality.  Of course they&#39;re not going to actually <em>say</em> that. lol.  They just couch it by saying &quot;No, no.  The people can&#39;t handle the truth!  It&#39;s too scary!  We&#39;re trying to protect the people because everyone would mass riot!  No way!  We&#39;re here to help everyone!&quot; lol  Evil bastards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t you bring up to your friend the shift that would take place from the money paradigm, control, and the use and consumption of fossil fuels (as is currently the case and has been the case on this planet from time immemorial) to the use of free energy, an ability to get everything you need from &quot;the ethers&quot;, and as a result, a <em>true</em> democratizing of power on the planet?  Mention to him that with the disclosure of ET existence (and, by extension, their technology of free energy), the population wouldn&#39;t need money to build a house, warm themselves, provide food for their families, and travel from one place to the other.  It would make the use of fossil fuels obsolete and, by extension, the money and power paradigm that drives the whole wicked system (along with those individuals and groups that are responsible for keeping that paradigm in place) would tumble quickly after.</p>

<p>Both you and your best friend seem like <em>very</em> intelligent individuals, but I wouldn&#39;t doubt that this factor behind the prevention of the disclosure of ET reality readily occurred to him.  There is such a great insistence on the &quot;prevention of mass panic&quot; aspect, that sometimes we miss the obvious.</p>

<p>See what he says in response to this particular reason behind why TPTB are more likely interested in the prevention of disclosure.</p>

If you &quot;believe some things are too important to be kept secret&quot; and you claim immunity, why not tell us all the specifics? You could be a hero.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see that is kind of a problem because they all would be in the position to know exactly that. We are talking about people with technology 100 years more advanced than our own, people who can talk to beings thousands of years old, and they don&#39;t know about what came before Sumeria? Especially when they probably have all the records.</p>

<p>Let me give you a sample of a few Empires they would know about.</p>

<p>Vedic/Rama in India<br/>
Osirian Civilization in the Mediterrean<br/>
Uiger in the Gobi Desert<br/>
China (seriously that nation is old)    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The POTUS being a controlled position just gave me an interesting thought.</p>

<p>Would you presume that the extreme polarization of American politics is to make it easier to place in power the one they choose? If the vote is a near equal split it would be very easy to report it one way or the other while keeping the general population complacent. Even if it were leaning one way more than the other they would just have to make one candidate <em>seem</em> more popular to just play into the predetermined result.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I been lookin man!</p>

<p>Lotsa answers to sift through...Most seem like you know but don&#39;t wanna say where people should start...I am curious though if you could elaborate on a starting position at all.  If just for the purposes of exploring the surrounding information without pursuing.</p>

<p>But what is their stance on the nature of the universe?  Where does it all come from, or do they not know/not care?  Is there any concept of karma?  Seems that lots of occult traditions suggest that doing bad to others will result in some form of bad to yourself.  Is that just &quot;control systems&quot; in play?  Any truth?</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of Graham Hancock&#39;s beliefs on ancient civilization? If you ever look up one of his documentaries, he believes that our race is currently derived from an ultra advanced seafaring civilization that focused on the supernatural/spiritual ways of the world. He thinks that the end of the last ice age wiped out most of this civilization and whoever was left over tried to preserve their ancient knowledge through geometrical monuments like the Giza pyramids or the statues at Easter island. If I had to guess your friend and his family believes that they are the newest generation of these people. I can also safely assume that they have some sort of advanced biological knowledge and other intelligence of the world that is kept from us &quot;normal&quot; people so, my question is, what is their motive besides world domination? Do thy only keep this knowledge to themselves because they think that only their &quot;race&quot; rightfully deserves it? Thanks for doing this insightful AMA by the way :)</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t you have to know what &quot;the truth&quot; is to be able to determine who&#39;s serious about finding it? Maybe you&#39;ll answer &quot;yeah, I&#39;m in the CIA and I know all kinds of stuff, and this thread is way off.&quot; Even though there&#39;s a chance you&#39;d be full of it, I&#39;d still encourage further discussion, because who knows?</p>

<p>Anyhow, what&#39;s so implausible about time-tested scheme to keep the rich in power? And no matter where you stand on the ultimate nature of reality, would it be be that outlandish for this scheme to incorporate religious/esoteric ideas, which appear to have always been with humanity, even to this day?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too far of a stretch to believe there are uber wealthy Illuminati people out there in a cult who probably have strange religious beliefs that may have nothing remotely at all to do with many of the common religions of today. I just think that the OP is lying that he&#39;s actually met one, or has a tremendously delusional friend who thinks he is one. Other than that, he might have met a true relative of the Rothschild family line who is toying with his friend, telling him all kinds of outlandish sh*t just because little people like you and me are probably a complete joke to the Rothschild family line. But what are the odds of that? Relatively low. So, this is Reddit -- liars are here all over the place. The more likely scenario is that the OP is lying, but exploring some fanfiction. If so, the OP is better-served to visit <a href="/r/fanfiction">/r/fanfiction</a> or <a href="/r/illuminati">/r/illuminati</a> or blogging instead of here.</p>

<p>And as for the strange organ arrangement in the friend&#39;s body, the magic red and white fairy dust, and the ritual murders -- hogwash, I reason to bet.</p>

Yes. I&#39;m talking Eyes Wide Shut kind of stuff. But the idea that you met someone like this who confided in you, or has special alchemy that common people don&#39;t have -- ahhh, no.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit. Its not something only they can do, they arent special. They are possessed and the demon treats them better because they fuel it with evil and sacrificing their own children to it. They don&#39;t have any special abilities except they don&#39;t have a conscious due to the possession. The demon then feeds off of many different forms of human suffering that they destroy humanity with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my understanding and dealings with spirits, it&#39;s about the power you give them. If you let them into your mind and you LET them take over you, then they will. If you want to speak with them, but you have your guard up a bit, then it will be more like &#39;equals&#39;. It depends how seriously you take these spirits, it depends if you let them boss you around, etc. </p>

<p>But yeah they aren&#39;t special. We all have the abilities to do these things.</p>

<p>How can a person advance spiritually? I don&#39;t know if these bloodsucking, murderers are the right people to ask, but I guess theres no harm in asking.</p>

<p>My belief is agnosticism, and I do not believe in demons, devils, reincarnation or god as an entity outside of ourselves. Am I just incredibly deluded and a product of this mans fall? What does your friend believe in? Does he practice something like meditation? </p>

<p>The only thing that gives this group validity is the claim that they can do supernatural things and live long lives, but without these two things they might as well be just a cult.</p>

<p>I also meditated, but due to being undiciplined I stopped. I have had great experiences with continues meditation. I rather go for zen buddhism instead of buddhism but those are just different cultural flavors.</p>

And <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz">this</a>?</p>

<p>Additionally, what do you think about the information I posted <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1co6r6/cnbc_execs_children_murdered_1_day_after_cnbc/c9inlvs">here</a>.  The people/forces/energies who did that to Kevin Krim, where do you think they are on the totem pole of power?  It seems like there is decently major power and control being executed in the Krim situation.  Would you say your friend/his family are this powerful? less? or is what they can do something that makes what happened to Krim small potatoes/pale in comparison?</p>

<p>Thank you very much for putting this OP up.  I too am a graduate in Philosophy.  I too am interested in Truth.</p>

<p>Are you or your best friend in any risk for making this?  One would think that if your bf&#39;s family is as powerful as they might be they would have little problem becoming aware of this post, no?</p>

<p>Best to you, and I look forward to your response,</p>

<p>The linked material has really nothing to do with that.  Channeling happens, and I suppose has its worth and validity, but I&#39;m referring to things that have nothing whatsoever in direct association with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, im a newbie here, checked it out after it seemed to me they used actors with the boston bombing, specifically man in wheelchair and cowby hat guy (i have no medical background, just assumptions based on watching too many movies perhaps?).  Im a very skeptical person by nature, but for some reason when i read your post you seem like the most genuine person i have yet to run into on here....My questions, ill try to keep this short and not expand on my own beliefs. 1.  What does your friend think of followers of Christ such as Seventh Day Adventists, people who may relate these bloodlines and their connection to the Lucifer?  Could these be the entities that are possibly the 13th you speak of?  2.  What are their views on the Constitution?  Im sure they were involved in some way, but did this document and America, the &#39;thought&#39; of a free society which i believe could be achieved living humbly, perhaps throw a wrench into their plans?  After being into David Icke I&#39;ve recently had to question a lot of things after being shown his connnections to Blavatsky, Alice Bailey and &#39;new age&#39; information, sun worship essentially.  Im starting to question whether or not Jesus was the real deal, the real Savior, and if he called it in revelations. Any thoughts on any of the information I&#39;ve been presenting would be greatly appreciated, by anyone reading this not just the OP </p>
