    <div class="md"><p>How did this comment end up at the top when it is the newest one among all the others? Seems like people were personally coming here to vote this up. And clearly this is a baited question because anybody who has done research knows why they want a collapse.</p>

<p>Because the USD is worthless. It has been printed and devalued so much that they know it has to come down at some point. But they don&#39;t want it to be a random act of the market(if that&#39;s even possible). TPTB want it to happen their way so they may be in control of the collapse. Seriously this comment attacks the poster&#39;s links and then proposes a fairly trivial question - and it&#39;s voted right to the top? In less time than all the other comments have been sitting here, yep that sounds totally legit.</p>

<p>As of right now this comment above was submitted 6 hours ago. How did so many people come into these comments and vote this up, but not touch anything else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I apologize if my comment came off as attacking. You bring up good points. I would argue GLP is not all disinfo as there are honest users who share very, very good information. But I am not interested in persuading your opinion on that website. I would just say it is not 100% disinfo and many of the paid members are well-studied.</p>

<p>Anyways, if I could share anything to help you educate yourself further it would be delightful. I noticed <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1c8arn/dhs_insider_watch_the_metals_when_they_dip_it/c9efp6o">your comment below</a> which is basically spot-on. But you&#39;re looking for a motive which simply isn&#39;t there, because &quot;they&quot;(white house staff, Federal Reserve staff, FDIC, congress, etc.) do NOT want a collapse. You are right that they want everything nice and cozy to just keep coasting along. </p>

<p>But this can&#39;t happen forever because of the dollar&#39;s weakened strength as a world reserve currency. Basically every other country who purchases oil needs to first obtain USD to buy the oil. So Japan cannot use their Yen to purchase petroleum, they need to buy our dollars first. This is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrodollar">petrodollar</a> and this system is a big reason why the US has so much control over oil in the middle east.</p>

<p>However this is starting to change very quickly. Now China and Russia along with other BRICS nations are working to start trading oil using alternate currencies. Once this happens nobody will want to keep their dollars anymore, because why would they? The Federal Reserve is currently printing new dollars at the tune of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/02/the-2-mystery-why-has-qe3-been-such-a-bust/273381/">$85 billion each month</a>. Basically they print and immediately spend the money on federal government bonds, because the Fed has an unlimited checkbook. This devalues our money so that $100 will buy you a lot less food than it did ten or twenty years ago.</p>

<p>Once other countries don&#39;t need our dollars then it&#39;s the start of our currency&#39;s downfall. All these excess dollars which have been circulating in the petroleum trade will find their way back to our country... and we&#39;ll see hyperinflation just like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic">they had in Weimar Germany</a>. This has all happened before and that&#39;s why so many people are sure it can happen again. </p>

<p>This is a very long comment so if you read to the end then kudos. I will try to answer other questions if you have them but I think these topics should be enough to start researching? Again my apologies for the attitude on your post, it just seemed very out of place and dismissive that a collapse sounds literally tinfoil crazy when it&#39;s anything but crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They want their one world government. They&#39;re trashing national currencies in order to bring in their International Monetary Unit. </p>

<p>When they throw us into utter chaos, people will BEG them for their &quot;solution&quot;. And of course, exactly like they <em>just happened</em> to have the Patriot Act all ready to ram down our throats, we&#39;ll eat the turd sandwich they propose for the very problem they created.</p>

<p>Most of us are basically decent people. We leave others alone and pretty much expect them to do the same for us. It is a sad fact that <em>politicians are not like us</em>. They <em>enjoy</em> the exercise of power over others.  Once you realize that <em>these people are out to hurt you</em>, a lot of things that were confusing suddenly start to click into place.</p>

<p>Orwell had it exactly right. Too bad so few listen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me.” </p>

<p>Yes? Godlike Productions is not a source itself, the posters link to other websites for evidence and resources. I have never seen as much GLP bashing as I have in this sub. The website itself is obviously a honeypot for collecting data but if you just go there for reading and digesting information there is nothing &quot;spooky&quot; about it. </p>

<p><strong>DH:</strong> Wait, you’re DHS—not some Wall Street insider.</p>

<p><strong>RB:</strong> So you think they are separate agendas? That’s funny. The coming collapse of the U.S. dollar is a done deal. It’s been in the works for years—decades, and this is one of the most important cataclysmic events that DHS is preparing for. I almost think that DHS was created for that purpose alone, to fight Americans, not protect them, right here in America. But that’s not the only reason. There’s the gun issue too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can&#39;t disarm America before the financial collapse, you can at least try to convince them they don&#39;t <em>need</em> AR-15s. Would certainly make the DHS&#39;s job easier when they&#39;re tasked with quelling the rioting in the streets. But don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll have plenty of time to get to your house while it&#39;s being broken in to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would think the opposite would be true.  </p>

<p>-Raise the price of gold.<br/>
-Print out worthless money.<br/>
-Get people to give you their gold in exchange for the money.<br/>
-Once all the gold has been bought up by these people, the dollar can go take a flying fuck for all they care, they&#39;ll have the valuable metal at that point.</p>

<p>Edit: also, I think it&#39;s at least a year or so away anyhow.  Once they really shred the second amendment is when they will start doing whatever pleases them. And the people who aren&#39;t cowering in fear will be powerless to stop them at that point.</p>

But they use confusing language and it sounds like a &quot;put&quot; bet, even though it&#39;s a call spread... the whole thing is pretty confusing but <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/art-cashin-on-big-vix-bet-2013-2">here&#39;s the article I&#39;m referencing</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last week somebody put on a call spread on the VIX using the April 20 and 25 puts. They bought 150,000 contracts for a net of $75 per contract. That is an $11,250,000 bet that the VIX will move over 20 over the next 60 days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>put and call bets are not requirements so nothing may happen. They are options trading, so the buyer has the option of selling but they don&#39;t need to. Generally if you buy a put option it&#39;s to sell at a later date when the stock is lower, thus you make more money because it&#39;s forcing the buyer to pay more than market value. Hope this makes sense I&#39;m definitely no expert but I have studied the basics. I don&#39;t know how this would work placing bets against the VIX but hey let&#39;s see what happens</p>
