        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Like probably everyone else on reddit, I was stoked when I saw <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1c5zxh/i_am_morgan_freeman_ask_me_anything/">Morgan Freeman was doing an AMA.</a>  I started reading through the comments and he was very short with people, against almost everyone&#39;s perception of him.  There was also no instance of proof provided that he was actually sitting behind the keyboard while he was still answering questions.  Three hours later, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1c5zxh/i_am_morgan_freeman_ask_me_anything/c9de51y">this</a> is the proof given.</p>

<p>Other redditors expressed the same opinion in the comments.  Mod roastedbagel <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1c5zxh/i_am_morgan_freeman_ask_me_anything/c9de04l">attempted to explain</a> it&#39;s Morgan Freeman because they said it&#39;s Morgan Freeman.  User paperclip9 <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1c5zxh/i_am_morgan_freeman_ask_me_anything/c9dfhdx">pointed out</a> that Morgan misspelled his idol (Nelson Mandela&#39;s) name.  Another user BottingWorks <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1c5zxh/i_am_morgan_freeman_ask_me_anything/c9ddg6d">outlined his doubts</a> citing discrepancies between Morgan&#39;s AMA and Gerard Butler&#39;s.</p>

<p>To add to my doubt, Morgan&#39;s <a href="http://revelationsent.com/">website</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealMorganF">Twitter</a> have nothing about the AMA.  His <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MorganFreeman">Facebook</a> does have a post, but take a look at the differences in how he posts on his Facebook page and how the questions are answered in the AMA.  If it&#39;s a PR rep, fine, whatever, but we deserve to know who is actually sitting behind the keyboard.  The only mod in the thread kept saying that &quot;the admins&quot; set up this AMA.  So apparently even the mods haven&#39;t seen the proof (the picture posted 3 hours late aside).</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>edit:  I added the link to his AMA</p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He contradicts Gerard Butler about them meeting each other. While it is possible they never met on set, I&#39;m sure they met during table reads of the script at the very least.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Butler could be wrong, or he misremembered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He misspelled his idol&#39;s name, a person he portrayed in a movie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Misspellings and typos occur easily enough, especially on a mobile device (which one of the IAmA mods suggested he could be using). Also, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mandella">mandella</a> is a real word, while <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mandela">Mandela</a> isn&#39;t - possibly autocorrect?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He said he would like to have been a chauffeur if he wasn&#39;t an actor. A little too Driving Miss Daisy, and he has previously answered that question in an interview with The Actor&#39;s Studio saying he&#39;d like to have been a writer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He could have had two ambitions aside from acting, or changed his mind. Or maybe he was just making a reference to DMD rather than answering earnestly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He said all roles are easy. No actor would ever say that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This proves nothing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He said the best part of acting is the paycheck. Possibly joke, but odd for him in this format.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This proves nothing. Why is it odd to make a joke?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His username was the title for a movie he is in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A publicist probably suggested an AMA to him as good marketing for the film and wanted to emphasise the new film. (Obviously they never caught wind of Harrelson-gate.) Maybe an assistant set the account up for him. Doesn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t answer his own questions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No outside verification other than Facebook, which is quite obviously not maintained by him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Verification by social media is not essential for AMAs. I&#39;d say most fanpages are maintained by publicists or are completely unofficial, but that doesn&#39;t mean a one-time outreach like an AMA can&#39;t be authentic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He says he&#39;d like to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. First, that&#39;s not an acting award.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He directed one film in the past, and maybe would like to do so again. Second and third points are more valid.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it definitely was or wasn&#39;t him, but most arguments for conspiracy can be refuted.</p>

<p>Others are saying the shortness of his replies is suspicious, to which I can only say that many people write very differently to how they speak. When you have a great orator like Freeman, you&#39;re probably going to be disappointed with his writing style because you have such high expectations for it. His writing style could also be explained by the possibility he was writing on a phone/tablet, and that he&#39;s not too familiar with modern technology - something that younger and more tech-savvy crowds like Reddit might not appreciate.</p>

<p>&quot;The day [Morgan Freeman] turned up on set, there was such an electricity in the atmosphere, everybody was so excited that God had come upon us.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ajkso/i_am_gerard_butler_amaa/c8xzub0">http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ajkso/i_am_gerard_butler_amaa/c8xzub0</a></p>

<p>Still possibly a fake memory to please redditors, but it is in stark contrast to Freeman saying:</p>

<p>&quot;I did not work with Gerard, we only spoke on the phone&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1c5zxh/i_am_morgan_freeman_ask_me_anything/c9dd00j">http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1c5zxh/i_am_morgan_freeman_ask_me_anything/c9dd00j</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Misspellings and typos occur easily enough, especially on a mobile device</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, he could have been using a phone. But that still feels weird. This was set up by admins well in advance, and I don&#39;t think Morgan Freeman is beyond owning a laptop or iPad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He said all roles are easy. No actor would ever say that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This proves nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem here is his lack of humility in the answer, which seems to go against his public personae.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or maybe he was just making a reference to DMD rather than answering earnestly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AND</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it odd to make a joke? (re: I act for a paycheck only)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but this is starting to be quite a few responses of not being serious. I know he&#39;s old, but he&#39;s not dumb. He knows sarcasm doesn&#39;t translate well when written. Granted, they could be innocent enough still.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Verification by social media is not essential for AMAs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not a requirement, but it is commonly used as proof. Seeing as Mr. Freeman does not use Twitter, we were pretty limited in what outside proof there could be. My point here is mostly we don&#39;t know it was him. But you are correct, it doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t him, either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not saying it definitely was or wasn&#39;t him, but most arguments for conspiracy can be refuted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right.</p>

<p>Most conspiracies have a certain number of arguments, many of which can be explained. However, the conspiracy attracts supporters because there are enough oddities which suggest that things aren&#39;t as they appear to be.</p>

<p>Yes, he&#39;s in his 70s. Modern technology may escape him. But the internet as we know it has been around roughly two decades. So it&#39;s likely he&#39;s familiar with how to use a computer.</p>

<p>So maybe he was on his cell phone. Again, quite possible, but why use a cell phone when this was setup well in advance (meaning he had time to find a desktop, laptop, or iPad)? Regardless if it was him or not, PR people did set this AMA up. So why didn&#39;t one of them find him a desktop or laptop?</p>

<p>So Occam&#39;s Razor comes into play. Is it more likely that Morgan Freeman did an AMA and responded in unexpected ways, or that a PR person was pretending to be Mr. Freeman? There&#39;s no smoking gun at the moment, so for the time being neither side is more right than the other. However, I feel there are too many suspicious points for me to believe that it was Morgan Freeman.</p>

<p>And besides, we&#39;re talking about a reddit AMA, not a second gunman on a grassy knoll. The burden of proof for the conspiracy theorists is going to be held to a much lower standard.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Others are saying the shortness of his replies is suspicious</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m actually okay with this. Shorter replies are quicker to write, meaning you can get to more questions. It&#39;s a decision the AMAer has to ask themselves. Would I rather answer more questions, or answer with more details?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many moons ago, I presented how easy it is to manufacture a conspiracy.  </p>

<p>I simply said &quot;Prove I wrote this comment.&quot;</p>

<p>But what would constitute &quot;proof&quot; that I had written in?  There are so many ways for someone else to have hacked into my account or computer or whatever and wrote the comment.  People could say that my sentence structure isn&#39;t mine, or I made a spelling error.  Even if there was video of me making the comment, it&#39;s easy to say that it wasn&#39;t really me, it was CGI or an actor.  Even if I say I wrote it, what proof is there that it&#39;s me saying it, or that I&#39;m not under duress to say that I said it.  </p>

<p>Something as simple as a comment online has now been turned into a conspiracy that is VERY tough to prove, but also shows how someone who doesn&#39;t accept my comment can convince themselves that it&#39;s not mine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theory: He was supposed to do it himself.  He was drunk.  Somebody tried to do it for him, maybe prodding him for barely muttered answers.  </p>

<p>Again, just a theory.  But the evidence:<br/>
1. They posted a heretofore unseen photo of Morgan Freeman passed out as verification.  While the photo may have been shopped, the Morgan Freeman passed out part wasn&#39;t.  It seems like a really strange thing for an aging actor to deliberately portray himself as worn out like that.<br/>
2. If it was a planned fake as some have suggested, I&#39;d expect that the answers would be better.  This has the air of something thrown together at the last minute.<br/>
3. The answers seem a bit cranky.  Like the kind I&#39;d imagine I&#39;d give if I were doing an AMA while transitioning between drunk and hungover.</p>
