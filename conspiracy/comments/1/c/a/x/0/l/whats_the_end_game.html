Also this nation was not founded as a Christian nation. I&#39;d refer you to the textbooks that taught me that but I&#39;m pretty sure that minorities might have helped write it so you probably won&#39;t touch it. </p>

<p>Edit:  I re read your post when I woke up.  Still racist and ignorant.  How exactly do people who have always lived on this planet corrupt a country because of they&#39;re skin color?

    <div class="md"><p>2 of the biggest genocides ever (that I can think of off the top of my head) are: +100,000,000 Native Americans by the hands of the white European IMMIGRANTS and +60,000,000 Russians, Jews, and many others by Hitler&#39;s regime.  A religion based on morals, yet the main thing they do is hide pedophiles.  White people.

You do know that white Europeans coming here was immigration right? That they basically genocided +100, 000,000 Native Americans. Native meaning that it was their native land.

<p>contrary to what you have been trained to think, not wanting to give up your ethnic political power or your ethnic majority status in your own country is a natural thing.   Whites are the only ethnic group that does it willingly and actively embraces it.  People like you look forward to the day they are a minority in their own land  and you will get your wish in about 20 or so years.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I don&#39;t had out downvotes like candy on Halloween. I get that people are trying. It&#39;s something that needs to be done though. It&#39;s expressing an opinion. This site is based 100% on people&#39;s opinion of content. When users post they <em>should</em> expect some sort of judgment, in the form of up/down votes, from the other users here.</p>

<p>You gotta take away the negative connotations towards downvotes. Instead veiw them as an expression of your opinion. It&#39;s not hurting them. You&#39;re simply disagreeing with another persons opinion. </p>

<p>On another note. I believe people need to know if their content or comments suck. It&#39;s the only way for them to improve or stop.</p>

<p>I wonder who.

<p>Um...Here&#39;s an even <em>better</em> tip for you:</p>

<p>Good and bad <em>don&#39;t</em> exist.</p>

<p>Read Arthur Schopenhauer.  Read Immanuel Kant.  There are various others, but these are two of the more prominent figures that successfully show how you (and me and humanity in general) don&#39;t know at this juncture - <em>can&#39;t</em> know - what&#39;s outside of our extremely limited sphere of reference.  In other words, you don&#39;t have to exclusively rely on anything said on an internet website in order to have an understanding that good and bad are concepts the ultimate truth and reality of which humans absolutely do not have the necessary requisites to judge or assess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know anybody that doesn&#39;t understand that there&#39;s many ways to look at anything, and that interpreting something as good or bad depends on your goals and beliefs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funny because this statement also flies directly in the face of the previous statement you made.  Don&#39;t know if you realize that or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then it goes on to attribute some soul evolving activity as good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Layers.  Existence can be looked upon like an onion that has different layers of perspective.  For you to interpret what was said in the above manner seems to show a lack of understanding of the overall picture.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Never mind that this soul it&#39;s talking about is neither the common spark of life which can&#39;t evolve whatsoever, nor the &quot;localized&quot; material condition of a human form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh.  I see.  So the &quot;common spark of life&quot; <em>can&#39;t</em> &quot;evolve whatsoever&quot;?  And you definitively know this right?  Okay.  Thanks for that.  And the soul it&#39;s talking about ISN&#39;T either one of these things?  Okay.  Thanks for that too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s something in-between that has to be learned to be seen, how convenient. See were I&#39;m going with this ? All a huge smoke screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.  I see exactly where you&#39;re going with this.  That&#39;s part of the problem.  Your interpretation is limited.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take out the beliefs, ambitions and fears, and nothing&#39;s left here to evolve.</p>

<p>Did I miss anything ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  You missed a lot.  Your thinking that beliefs, ambitions, and fears are the only requisites for evolution is part of the problem.  That&#39;s not the only problem, but that&#39;s certainly part of it.</p>

<p>Ultimately, you don&#39;t know what you think you know.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t come back with some stupid statement like the &quot;Edit&quot; that you made if you even want your comments read.  At this point, it&#39;s not super likely that I will even waste my time actually reading your next comment if it has the kind of energy that your &quot;Edit&quot; showed.  If you&#39;re going to say something like that and want only to say YOUR piece of mind without being willing to consider how incorrect it might be, then maybe it really isn&#39;t worth considering anything else you might have to say.</p>

<p>Look in the mirror first before anything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, pardon my loose communication skills, I&#39;m trying to talk about something that goes far beyond words, which is ridiculous. I enjoy reading things that challenge me, that wasn&#39;t irony. Yes, I&#39;m being ridiculous, that&#39;s my condition right now.</p>

<p>I suppose it&#39;s normal that you hate what I&#39;m trying to say, as you seem quite engaged with these theories I&#39;m trying to destroy.</p>

<p>In the first part, I was kind of scoffing (pardon me, really) at the idea that it was a new information. Yes, good and bad are relative. I was saying it&#39;s no secret and doesn&#39;t seem profound when not wrapped in complicated cosmology. I think the &quot;hidden hand interview&quot; is long and complicated to obfuscate what it&#39;s really conveying, to enforce some sort of compartmentalization between people that can consider it and those that can&#39;t, even some sort of prestige to the idea of knowing it. That&#39;s why I asked to keep it simple. If they came out and said &quot;we&#39;re transforming heaven on earth to make it miserable, because we want it that way (to survive)&quot; it wouldn&#39;t work so well.</p>

<p>As soon as a goal is stated (some kind of evolution in this case), good and bad inevitably exist.</p>

<p>In all this mess, seeing the world without a goal, without some intent contaminated by &quot;knowledge&quot; almost never happens. That luciferian principle is a character in our dream that doesn&#39;t want the dream to end, so it builds long roads where we&#39;re supposed to engage our energy.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where I&#39;m coming from, but I must admit I have no idea what can really wake us up from the dream, it just happens sometimes. I&#39;m perfectly conscious that when I open my mouth, some fallacies come out of it. That&#39;s my current condition.</p>

<p>Again, sorry but I&#39;m kind of doing my best, there&#39;s no easy way to say these things (all you ever believed was always a dream).</p>

<p>See, that&#39;s a problem you&#39;re having right there.  That you would even presuppose that and work from that egregiously mistaken impression is just plain bad.  Nowhere in anything I said could any one reasonably derive such an interpretation.  Again, that&#39;s a problem with how you&#39;re looking at things - not with how I&#39;m expressing them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>as you seem quite engaged with these theories I&#39;m trying to destroy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m any more engaged in them than I am in anything else.  Second of all, it is simply <em>really</em> bad to begin from an admitted aversion to something that doesn&#39;t necessarily require such a reaction or aversion in and of itself.  It&#39;s simply very uncritical.  You&#39;re trying to &quot;destroy&quot; the theories?  WTF is that?  Again, that&#39;s just beginning your thought process from an unthinking perspective.  If that&#39;s what you want to do, then okay.  It&#39;s not critical or very intelligent because you should really first EXAMINE a thing and assess it one way or the other for merit before you make the decision to &quot;destroy&quot; it or not.  As per your very own unqualified statements, you aren&#39;t doing that.  You&#39;re just &quot;trying to destroy&quot; it.  Why? I don&#39;t know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the first part, I was kind of scoffing (pardon me, really)</p>

<p>Why seek pardon for something you continue to do?  Those seem empty words and are better left unspoken.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, good and bad are relative. I was saying it&#39;s no secret and doesn&#39;t seem profound when not wrapped in complicated cosmology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then unwrap it.  After you do that, then what?  What is shown is that good and bad are still relative terms, so it doesn&#39;t matter whether that truth is or is not wrapped in what you call &quot;complicated cosmology&quot;.  The main point I was making is that your earlier assertion regarding good and bad, independent of whether the cosmology is &quot;complicated&quot; or not, was erred.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the &quot;hidden hand interview&quot; is long and complicated to obfuscate what it&#39;s really conveying, to enforce some sort of compartmentalization between people that can consider it and those that can&#39;t, even some sort of prestige to the idea of knowing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This itself is an overly complicated sentence - the deep irony of which might have gotten lost on you.  If you think the HH interview was &quot;long and complicated&quot;, then okay.  I didn&#39;t.  So then what?  I didn&#39;t find it long and complicated at all.  I understood it pretty readily.  The idea that only those with &quot;prestige&quot; can really understand what&#39;s being said in it seems to be something you&#39;re making up to, for whatever reason, give yourself reason or justification for criticize it.  Isn&#39;t that a Straw Man Fallacy of sorts? bringing up an aspect of a subject that is erred and inconsequential to the main point so that, in refuting the inconsequential portion, you can hopefully get others to disregard the parts that actually <em>are</em> significant along with it?</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not here defending the HH information as &quot;the TRUTH&quot;, mind you.  I&#39;m simply presenting it as a possible piece of a likely unfathomably complicated puzzle.  As such, it certainly does have merit indeed.  Your attempt to discard the information in it wholesale seems actually a <em>lot</em> more questionable than my intent to present it as simply &quot;a&quot; piece of the puzzle (and not necessarily the entire puzzle itself).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s why I asked to keep it simple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do think it&#39;s not a horrible idea to keep things as simple as possible, but I also think it&#39;s important to thoroughly investigate a thing if you&#39;re going to investigate it at all.  As such, it seems to me that there are various different facets to consider when assessing any one thing.  This might as a result come across as making things &quot;complicated&quot; to some.  I personally don&#39;t find that to be the case or look at things in that way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they came out and said &quot;we&#39;re transforming heaven on earth to make it miserable, because we want it that way (to survive)&quot; it wouldn&#39;t work so well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with what you&#39;re saying is that this is in no way what the HH information alleges from the onset.  You again seem to be creating yet <em>another</em> straw man fallacy by knocking down and refuting something that wasn&#39;t even said or intended by the subject at hand and attempted to pass it off as the actual argument being made.</p>

<p>WTF?  Seriously?  Come one, man.</p>

<p>And?  What does &quot;attempting to see the world without a goal, without some intent contaminated by &#39;knowledge&#39;&quot; have to do with the point of the HH information?</p>

<p>According to who?  According to you, perhaps.  From <em>your</em> own perspective, okay.  This interpretation might have some merit in and of itself.  It might not have much merit outside of it, however.</p>

<p>I do.  The <em>ending</em> of the dream is one thing that can wake us up.  The Greater Self&#39;s awakening from its sleep independent of the dream&#39;s ending is another.</p>

<p>Yes.  It does indeed just happen sometimes.  What causes the Greater Self to awake is something I will not pretend to currently fathom, however.</p>

<p>Yes, the dreamer seems to be as real as it gets.</p>

<p>Yes sir.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I can&#39;t see the dream ending when we believe in some external, self-proclaimed authority pretending to hold some unfathomable truth that can be accessed only &quot;between lives&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then stop believing in that.  There is no external authority.  Whether we know it or not, everything in existence is little more than a tiny raindrop in The Great Ocean.  When the tiny little individual raindrop known as your life dries up, it simply gets absorbed back into where it came from - back to what it <em>is</em> - The Great Ocean.  At that point The Great Ocean simply realizes that It had a dream and in that dream It was a tiny little individual raindrop named mnta, It was a tiny little individual raindrop named no1113, named The Hidden Hand, named everything and everyone else around.</p>

<p>Get it?  It&#39;s all <em>one</em>.  Everything is one.  It&#39;s all the same.</p>

<p>Therefore, &quot;believing in some external, sel-proclaimed authority&quot; is really only &quot;believing&quot; in your own Greater Self.  In one sense, I personally think that the idea of &quot;believing&quot; that is foolish really.  If you can think critically and objectively enough about a thing, then it&#39;s often not &quot;belief&quot;.  It&#39;s simply understanding.  Awareness.  I try to &quot;believe&quot; in as very little as possible.  I strive toward believing in <em>nothing</em> as a matter of fact, and work instead toward obtaining <em>knowledge</em> of a thing - something far greater than mere belief.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I even think that believing it completely, and I&#39;m not saying you do, would be contagious for people around us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I&#39;m glad you said you don&#39;t think I do, because - as I said above before even reading this sentence of yours I quoted right here - I <em>don&#39;t</em> &quot;believe&quot;.  Belief is that which people without data, logic, understanding, and information tend to vainly cling to in the face of ignorance.  That&#39;s not the case here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s why I &quot;tried to destroy it&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s why I knew it was ignorance to come at the conversation from that perspective and with that attitude.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I seem to understand how that interview is a spell belonging to the web holding human consciousness down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s a spell holding <em>you</em> down.  I do not in any way feel that for myself.  Perhaps you didn&#39;t read the information and only skimmed it - in which case you won&#39;t understand it - but I feel the opposite with regard to the information contain therein.  Regardless, however, I feel now about existence pretty much what it seems to me I&#39;ve ALWAYS felt about it, and having read and understood the information in the HH writings the way I did hasn&#39;t necessarily made me feel any different about the world, the cosmos, and everything else around me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s one of those things that says &quot;disregard experience, those words are the truth&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, is that what you understood from the (possibly) little you read of it?  Wow.  Okay.  If that&#39;s what you got from it, then I guess that&#39;s what you got from it.  Some understood the information far differently, and got pretty much the <em>opposite</em> from it.  Interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Never-mind that words are empty without the experiences they lean on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol.  Okay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe we&#39;ll come across each-other &quot;between lives&quot; and we&#39;ll laugh at how stupidly mislead I was, it&#39;s not like I have any authority to brush it off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then why the fuck brush it off at all, man?  Why not just regard it as what it likely is? a PIECE OF THE PUZZLE...a very complicated puzzle that the human mind can scarcely grasp or fathom anyway.  That&#39;s what I presented it as in the first place - as I said before.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just trying to understand things, and presenting bits and pieces I find interesting along the way.</p>

<p>Either way, perhaps we&#39;ll cross each other between lives and will laugh <em>period</em> - not a scornful laugh, but a joyful one - at the journey we took together...you going this way on your journey, me going that way, both of us understanding better that we were ultimately on the <em>very same path</em> all along regardless of how disparaging from one another our directions may have seemed at the time.</p>

<p>It a big, <em>big</em> path is all.  There&#39;s room for everyone and everything on it.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t disagree with that.  I also feel, however, that it might not be possible to obtain a proper experiential grasp of reality <em>without</em> the use of the imagination and its abilities, for imagination is little more than another word for the ability to think in a complex - sometimes abstract - manner.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nope.  I wouldn&#39;t say you did.  If nothing else, it showed that it&#39;s possible to begin from diverging perspectives and still arrive at an amicable acknowledging of one another&#39;s worth even if full resolution is never technically achieved.</p>

<p>That in itself is a victory as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>

<p>You seem to see words as an experience and not experience as words?</p>

<p>If that&#39;s what you mean, I&#39;d say that <em>both</em> perspectives are valid.  Words are definitely an experience.  Experience can definitely also be words, however.  Don&#39;t know if I interpreted your meaning correct, however.</p>

<p>Was it something that you saw while in a dream?  Was it something that you figured out while wide awake and conscious?  A &quot;life between two dreams&quot; doesn&#39;t sound all too dissimilar to what <a href="http://www.btci.org/bioethics/2012/videos2012/vid3.html">Dr. Eben Alexander described with regard to his own experiences</a>.

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say that.  Many people have a recollection of experiences they had &quot;between lives&quot;, so it would not at all be foolish to give credence to the concept.  After all, it&#39;s not outside of your experience IF YOU EXPERIENCED IT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow... That vid was kind of overwhelming. I feel there&#39;s strong similarities, everything that follows are just abstract pointers: I think he experienced the Tao without the material world. I think I experienced it completely with it. I was everything. Instead of being in the world, the world was in me, as sure as I exist. Time and space were in me. Just existing was enough to bring complete fulfillment. I remember I almost took a vow to never talk about it again, because it could only lead the mind to follow words and concepts, to desire, which is diametrically opposed to the experience of it. That experience apparently came from a full acceptance of the world.</p>

<p>Before that experience I thought I knew everything, during that experience I realized my past vanity. I really thought I was definitely done with desire. It was the total destruction of the idea of &quot;problems&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what took me away from it, it seemed impossible to lose it. Time wasn&#39;t even here to take it away from me, was only a construct. It wasn&#39;t a theory, it was the obvious truth. There&#39;s an age-old curse, like a current in the course of reality, that does the impossible. Some people may have sacrificed themselves just to leave us a trace that would survive trough history, despite even the people that were writing it.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s nothing short of amazing especially considering the nearly irrefutable level of medical experience and knowledge that Dr. Alexander has.  Easy to discount an average person.  Much more difficult to discount a Harvard-educated neurosurgeon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think he experienced the Tao without the material world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps he just experienced an <em>aspect</em> of the material world that functions on a different, much finer dimension than the third dimensional one we&#39;re more familiar with; an aspect that is more akin and in tune to the spiritual realm but is still just (again) <em>finer</em> in its vibratory essence than this dimension.  It&#39;s still physical, just vibrating much more rapidly, and, hence, seems immaterial from our current vantage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think I experienced it completely with it.</p>

<p>Are you saying you were able to relate to what he was talking about? or are you saying you had a similar experience?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was everything. Instead of being in the world, the world was in me, as sure as I exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha.  Yes.  This sounds pretty much almost exactly like some experiences that I have had as well.</p>

<p><em>Existence</em> is conscious.  Ultimately, there is only one consciousness - one Great Identity - manifesting itself as many different, smaller selves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Time and space were in me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You got in touch with The Greater Self, of which the smaller, physical self is but a part, but an aspect.  Time and space are a part of TGS and the consciousness of TGS is pervasive throughout it - indeed TGS <em>is</em> it.  TGS consciously manifests from Itself time, space, existence, and all things that manifest within and beyond it.  It is and can be all these things individually or collectively.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s nothing like actually experiencing a thing to help you understand a concept much better than trying to abstractly think about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I manifested more of an unpleasant energy in my first messages, but we wouldn&#39;t have met if I didn&#39;t carry it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I kind of see what you&#39;re saying and where you&#39;re going with the statement, I personally feel that we could have arrived at the level of this more lofty discourse without having to go through the earlier conflict.  Be that as it may, it matters not, as I&#39;ve all but completely forgotten about it, and am focused on the divine topic at hand we are speaking of here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome, I can only hope we&#39;re approaching some sort of tipping point. It&#39;s normally quite hard to find people that can relate.</p>

<p>However, I still can&#39;t interpret the world with these concepts of higher planes, they seem to rub us of an unadulterated experience of existing. I think they may be useful in sucking some people out of materialism as a stepping stone. But apparently they need to be dropped. I feel going back to them would be like opening the door to the distortions of hear-say, of memory, when everything I ever knew and will ever know is staring me in the face right now. It&#39;s like giving more importance to my own constructs which try to describe the content of others dreams, rather than staying with the formless and infinite. Like giving importance to content, to form, to illusion, when the only truth is the emptiness in which they manifest.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very possible that a direct experience of a higher plane would do me some good, but it doesn&#39;t seem right to hold any cosmological description as more important than my current experience of being. I feel it&#39;s a trap that make us disregard the only truth, in order to obtain something else. From what I see, anything that would reside in memory with more importance than the current experience of being <em>is</em> a trap. Not that I&#39;m not in that trap...</p>

<p>The funny thing is that we lay out all these strategies, plans and analysis, often without realizing that it&#39;s only because we refuse the present as it is, that we have some sort of problem with it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I certainly hope so as well, but I can&#39;t say I have much confidence of it happening right now.  It&#39;s said we&#39;re <em>just</em> leaving the Kali Yuga - the last and worst of the four <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuga">Yugas</a> in Hindu philosophy.  As such, I would say that there are still many residual negative effects being felt and that will continue for some years to come.  It&#39;d be great if 1) the tipping point were a <em>good</em> tipping point and not a bad one, and 2) if it come <em>soon</em>, but 3) I&#39;m not sure that tipping point will be a <em>good</em> one with all the turmoil going on in this planet - one involving, among other things, the people of the western hemisphere getting fed up with the corruption here and starting to REALLY revolt.  Additionally, 4) if this time of &quot;massive national upheaval&quot; were to indeed happen, I&#39;m not sure <em>when</em> exactly it will.  In some senses, we <em>do</em> seem to be on a bit of an edge in the U.S. - on the verge, so to speak.  In another sense, we still seem very much asleep.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, I still can&#39;t interpret the world with these concepts of higher planes, they seem to r<del>u</del>ob us of an unadulterated experience of existing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not all that super sure that existence in higher planes is any less than existence in the lower, third dimensional planes.  Heck, as Dr. Eben Alexander and many others have mentioned, existence in higher planes involves an experience that is vastly superior and even <em>more</em> real than anything this dimension can offer.</p>

<p>If you mean that the mere <em>consideration</em> or contemplation of existence of the higher planes in itself robs us of better, more fully experiencing this third dimensional plane, then I would say perhaps.  I personally try to spend my time in the contemplation of higher planes as much and as often as possible, and I find that it <em>enhances</em> my experience of this dimension because I become more and more aware of just how greatly infused this particular physical dimension is with the influence and energy of the higher planes of existence as well as all others along with it.  Contemplation in this manner helps me understand the interconnectedness of everything - and <em>that</em> helps me experience <em>this</em> dimension in a much more profound - more real - manner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think they may be useful in sucking some people out of materialism as a stepping stone. But apparently they need to be dropped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  It&#39;s not a bad idea to be practical certainly and deal with the &quot;here and now&quot;.  You have to eat, you have to pay rent/mortgage, you have to make sure you don&#39;t just end up starving, stranded, and destitute dying in a corner somewhere.  However, past these considerations, I try to keep my mind and contemplation on loftier subjects than the strictly terrestrial.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel going back to them would be like opening the door to the distortions of hear-say, of memory, when everything I ever knew and will ever know is staring me in the face right now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps.  Again, that&#39;s one way to look at things, and it certainly has its worth.  I personally don&#39;t feel that going back to contemplation and experiencing of the beyond opens the door to distortions of hearsay - not any more so than NOT doing it anyway.  Observing and contemplating the experiences without necessarily believing or disbelieving any one thing I feel has great, great worth and helps one have a better understanding of Existence in general.  This is a very good thing, I feel.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not sure that &quot;everything you ever knew and will ever know&quot; is staring you in the face right now - or, rather, I should say that I&#39;m pretty confident that most of us are nowhere near AWARE of it.  There is <em>MUCH</em> more to existence and life than what is staring us in the face <em>right now</em> - at least as far as our five senses are concerned.  Dr. Alexander alone gave but one very good example of many great examples in his talk.</p>

<p>While I think it&#39;s important to be mindful and aware of what&#39;s happening in your life in the here and now, I personally think it&#39;s a great thing to (critically and soberly) stretch your mind as much as you can toward the beyond.</p>

Read Robert Monroe&#39;s first book that details the experiences he had.  Here is a western businessman that had a very successful, multi-million dollar business, who, when he began having literally out-of-this-world experiences, didn&#39;t shun or push them away, but, instead, explored them even further and waited to see where they would take him.  What resulted was <a href="http://www.monroeinstitute.org/">a nationally renowned, one-of-a-kind business</a> known far and wide for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monroe_Institute">its unique and very <em>real</em> accomplishments</a>.</p>

<p>Respect the physical and the tangible, but do not be afraid to follow the abstract.  Often that is where the truest interpretations of The All can be found.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s like giving more importance to my own constructs which try to describe the content of others dreams, rather than staying with the formless and infinite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps split the difference and do a little bit of both.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like giving importance to content, to form, to illusion, when the only truth is the emptiness in which they manifest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good point, but sometimes it is through the contemplation of the forms which Emptiness produces that we ultimately arrive at Its front doorstep.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s very possible that a direct experience of a higher plane would do me some good</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it would do <em>everybody</em> some good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but it doesn&#39;t seem right to hold any cosmological description as more important than my current experience of being.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wonderfully said, sir.  Despite everything I said above, I really fully agree with this.  Also, I <em>certainly</em> don&#39;t think that anyone should hold a mere description - cosmological or not - above the fullness of ones experience.  However, I also do not think that your current experience of being need ever conflict with any actual EXPERIENCE (not just description, but actual experience) that you might have of the cosmological kind.  I don&#39;t feel the two are in any way mutually exclusive.  Indeed they can be quite complimentary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel it&#39;s a trap that make us disregard the only truth, in order to obtain something else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what is &quot;the only truth&quot;?  I cannot say that it is any more in the rock I stub my toe on while walking in the park than it is the abstract realities that exist in stars far off and beyond almost anything I can even being contemplating while on this small mud puddle called Planet Earth.</p>

<p>Also, what is the &quot;something else&quot; that threatens to trap us?  I&#39;m not certain that we are not in as much (if not more) danger of being trapped limiting our contemplations to the mere terrestrial than we would be reaching toward even worlds and stars we have not yet seen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From what I see, anything that would reside in memory with more importance than the current experience of being <em>is</em> a trap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  Certainly you don&#39;t mean that, for we are always in the eternal and present &quot;now&quot; are we not?  Literally EVERY single moment is nothing more than a fleeting memory of what <em>just</em> occurred.  In that sense, then EVERYTHING - Existence as a <em>whole</em> - is nothing but a trap.</p>

<p>While this may actually be true, I&#39;m not sure if this is the conclusion that you intended.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not that I&#39;m not in that trap...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha.  Well said.  We&#39;re <em>all</em> in that trap.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The funny thing is that we lay out all these strategies, plans and analysis, often without realizing that it&#39;s only because we refuse the present as it is, that we have some sort of problem with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is certainly valid.  Perhaps a balance need be struck between living &quot;in the moment&quot; and learning from past experience.</p>

<p>Na.  I don&#39;t think or feel that at all.  I&#39;m sure that many feel this about <em>me</em>, so I&#39;m not necessarily one to pass that same kind of judgment on another.  I&#39;m not thinking this at all actually.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Same goes for me.  It&#39;s very possible that <strong><em>I</em></strong> was completely wrong about it as well.  I certainly wasn&#39;t proposing it as &quot;the ONLY truth&quot;.  It&#39;s just something that seems very interesting and offers a different perspective and reasoning with regard to certain things that actually <em>are</em> going on in this planet.  Independent of whether the reasons in particular are valid or not, many of the things that are talked about in the material with regard to government and global PTB manipulation <em>are</em> indeed a reality and <em>are</em> indeed going on in this planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>t just <em>seems</em> to be yet another game of the mind to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It may very well be.  I try to keep a mind that is as critical yet as open as possible with regard to many things, for this planet and this universe is filled with wonders the likes of which we probably can barely fathom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, pardon my loose communication skills, I&#39;m trying to talk about something that goes far beyond words, which is ridiculous. I enjoy reading things that challenge me, that wasn&#39;t irony. Yes, I&#39;m being ridiculous, that&#39;s my condition right now.</p>

<p>I suppose it&#39;s normal that you hate what I&#39;m trying to say, as you seem quite engaged with these theories I&#39;m trying to destroy.</p>

<p>In the first part, I was kind of scoffing (pardon me, really) at the idea that it was a new information. Yes, good and bad are relative. I was saying it&#39;s no secret and doesn&#39;t seem profound when not wrapped in complicated cosmology. I think the &quot;hidden hand interview&quot; is long and complicated to obfuscate what it&#39;s really conveying, to enforce some sort of compartmentalization between people that can consider it and those that can&#39;t, even some sort of prestige to the idea of knowing it. That&#39;s why I asked to keep it simple. If they came out and said &quot;we&#39;re transforming heaven on earth to make it miserable, because we want it that way (to survive)&quot; it wouldn&#39;t work so well.</p>

<p>As soon as a goal is stated (some kind of evolution in this case), good and bad inevitably exist.</p>

<p>In all this mess, seeing the world without a goal, without some intent contaminated by &quot;knowledge&quot; almost never happens. That luciferian principle is a character in our dream that doesn&#39;t want the dream to end, so it builds long roads where we&#39;re supposed to engage our energy.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where I&#39;m coming from, but I must admit I have no idea what can really wake us up from the dream, it just happens sometimes. I&#39;m perfectly conscious that when I open my mouth, some fallacies come out of it. That&#39;s my current condition.</p>

<p>Again, sorry but I&#39;m kind of doing my best, there&#39;s no easy way to say these things (all you ever believed was always a dream).</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Wow... That vid was kind of overwhelming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it&#39;s nothing short of amazing especially considering the nearly irrefutable level of medical experience and knowledge that Dr. Alexander has.  Easy to discount an average person.  Much more difficult to discount a Harvard-educated neurosurgeon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think he experienced the Tao without the material world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps he just experienced an <em>aspect</em> of the material world that functions on a different, much finer dimension than the third dimensional one we&#39;re more familiar with; an aspect that is more akin and in tune to the spiritual realm but is still just (again) <em>finer</em> in its vibratory essence than this dimension.  It&#39;s still physical, just vibrating much more rapidly, and, hence, seems immaterial from our current vantage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think I experienced it completely with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you saying you were able to relate to what he was talking about? or are you saying you had a similar experience?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was everything. Instead of being in the world, the world was in me, as sure as I exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha.  Yes.  This sounds pretty much almost exactly like some experiences that I have had as well.</p>

<p><em>Existence</em> is conscious.  Ultimately, there is only one consciousness - one Great Identity - manifesting itself as many different, smaller selves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Time and space were in me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You got in touch with The Greater Self, of which the smaller, physical self is but a part, but an aspect.  Time and space are a part of TGS and the consciousness of TGS is pervasive throughout it - indeed TGS <em>is</em> it.  TGS consciously manifests from Itself time, space, existence, and all things that manifest within and beyond it.  It is and can be all these things individually or collectively.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just existing was enough to bring complete fulfillment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wonderful.  Beautiful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I remember I almost took a vow to never talk about it again, because it could only lead the mind to follow words and concepts, to desire, which is diametrically opposed to the experience of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  Difficult to describe the ineffable.  One can try, but...sometimes <a href="http://i.imgur.com/UmpOi.gif">this</a> is all you can do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It wasn&#39;t a theory, it was the obvious truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s nothing like actually experiencing a thing to help you understand a concept much better than trying to abstractly think about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I manifested more of an unpleasant energy in my first messages, but we wouldn&#39;t have met if I didn&#39;t carry it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I kind of see what you&#39;re saying and where you&#39;re going with the statement, I personally feel that we could have arrived at the level of this more lofty discourse without having to go through the earlier conflict.  Be that as it may, it matters not, as I&#39;ve all but completely forgotten about it, and am focused on the divine topic at hand we are speaking of here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems that now I fucked up the necessary humility hehehe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How so?  I don&#39;t feel so at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s supposed to be extremely simple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The paradox of the difficult is that it&#39;s extremely simple.</p>

<p>The paradox of the simple is that it&#39;s often so hard.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know you&#39;re feeling it btw...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  I try to hold on to it as much and as often as possible.</p>
