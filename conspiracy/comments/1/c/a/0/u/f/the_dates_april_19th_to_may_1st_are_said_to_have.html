       I realize that getting into the game of conspiracy "prediction" is treacherous territory, but this type of speculation is merely that: speculation. Sometimes certain patterns become increasingly evident, and a little healthy speculation about the future becomes necessary, as long as there is no blatant fear-mongering involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for April 19th-May 1st, there's a ton of info on the internet about these dates. Some websites claim that
       <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2496156/posts">
        they involve a Blood Sacrifice to the Beast
       </a>
       , while others
       <a href="http://adventofdeception.com/gulf-fire-times-square-occult-importance/">
        stress the connection to the occult and the Illuminati
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       For the more skeptically inclined, April 30th-May 1st specifically has long been important in many Pagan traditions, particularly the ancient Gaelic
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltane">
        Beltane festival
       </a>
       and the European
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walpurgis_Night">
        Walpurgis
       </a>
       .
These festivals always involve fire, hence the connection to the theory of the "fire sacrifice" occurring during this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_19th">
        April 19th
       </a>
       is a bit of an infamous date in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most notably, the first shots of the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord">
        American Revolutionary War
       </a>
       were fired on April 19th.
      </p>
      <p>
       On April 19th, 1943, the Nazis murdered numerous Jews in the Warsaw ghetto by essentially burning them alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm sure I don't need to go into the gruesome details of the events in Waco and Oklahoma City on April 19th in '93 and '95, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon occurred on April 20th, resulting in the deaths of 11 people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much ado has similarly been made over Columbine occurring on April 20th as well, which happens to be Hitler's Birthday.
      </p>
      <p>
       And speaking of our buddy Hitler, his "death" was announced on May 1st, 1945...perhaps a grim foreshadowing of the announcement of the death of the 21st century's great bogeyman, OBL, whose death was
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       announced on May 1st.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1st">
        May 1st
       </a>
       , of course, is a favorite date for conspiracy theorists as it marks the supposed founding of the Bavarian Illuminati, and according to
       <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/cienciareal/cienciareal20.htm">
        some conspiratorial websites
       </a>
       is the "Illuminati's second most sacred holiday".
      </p>
      <p>
       What does this all mean? I'm sure many of you think that I'm finding connections where there are none...the typical sign of a raving paranoiac and conspiracy theorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I actually remain unconvinced about any of this...I'm curious about all of your thoughts on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if in a week or so we see some sort of sacrifice by fire...well maybe then I'll be convinced that
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       is up...

       yeah I dont think there is much here, mainly because your prediction actually would suggest we would expect a fire ritual (what ever that means specifically) between April 19th and May 1st. It happened April 15th.

       Deaths from a bomb explosion=sacrifice by fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Deepwater Horizon explosion fits as well, as it too was an explosion that killed 11 people.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole "fire ritual" goes back to certain pagan rites, but in this occult context today,
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       type of sacrifice that evolves a fiery death is acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the April 15th thing,  the point is that it's supposed to happen in the second half of April, but
       <em>
        specifically
       </em>
       after the 19th.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in this sense you are correct (and
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       else pointing out this obvious fact), the event came early.
      </p>
      <p>
       However my
       <em>
        entire
       </em>
       point with this was
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       that I accurately predicted this event, obviously I didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that I predicted there would soon be a ritual sacrifice involving fire (a la Waco) or a bomb (a la Oklahoma City and Deepwater Horizon) and then two days later this occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's uncanny and disturbing so I though I'd repost to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , that is all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got a bunch of flak for submitting it, as was to be expected, and my second post was buried and disappeared pretty quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       If
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       had made the same prediction and this event happened two days later, I'd bet you might have a similar WTF reaction as me.

       The dates ARE important to the occult elite. Even if nothing happens in the public eye, there will be some perverse rituals behind the scenes.

       I forgot to mention ex-Nazi youth Cardinal Ratzinger was named pope on the auspicious date of April 19th as well, and the phony New York car bombing was May 1st.

       I feel like most people just brush off these conspiracy theories as nonsense and see theorists as nut jobs who no one should listen to, but after doing my own research and being a part of this subreddit some of the facts are just undeniable at times. I believe people just don't want to accept the truth that our government is capable of these travesties.

       Well, one of the brothers was sacrificed on the 19th at least, I actually think it's incredible that the younger one survived, all odds were against him. Though who knows what will happen to him next, maybe death would be preferable =/

       Just sharing this, I'm not claiming it means anything outside of my own life: I had an unusual dream on the morning of Saturday, March 23; the context was that I'd asked for a date by which I should leave California before going to sleep.

       Seeing that previous false flags have failed to initiate the fear and outcry need to successfully pass legislation to strip US citizens of their constitutional rights, there will be high profile killings of middleaged white Americans reportably by mexican and negro gangs.  The legislation the government wants to unarm citizens will be disguised as protection and retaliation but will essentially remove all rights to property and privacy of all US citizens.

       Since year after year there are major events on significant dates I would have said yes anyway - but the latest "event" just adds further validity to what you, me, and many others have been saying for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Related, somewhat: many years ago I worked with someone who claimed to be an ex-member of a generational family of satanists. As far as I could tell she was dead serious about dates, even after cutting off contact with her family and ex-husband. I knew little to nothing of "conspiracies" at the time, but now that I read about things like this, she comes to mind.

       Do you have a source for this? If so that's just crazy.

       I remember being stunned at how often the talking heads on the news were saying a fire was imminent or repeatedly mentioning how flammable the boat was...I thought for sure they were following a script.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really felt that the night was going to end with a fiery inferno and his death, I'm actually
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       grateful he survived.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I predicted something would happen April 19th, but
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       prepared me for the events of the last week. Although this post was largely ignored, I
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       do think there's something to the fact that the events began with a sacrifice by fire (explosion a la Oklahoma City) and then culminated with the virtual shutdown of Boston, a sacrifice of one of the suspects (likely killed by an explosion too), and the completion of the manhunt...all on April 19th.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people would've taken this post more seriously if I had just said "the second half of April" instead of starting on the 19th. I should've remembered that the Virginia Tech Massacre was on April 16th, the sinking of the Titanic and Lincoln's death on the 15th, and also that stupid swine flu hoax began mid-April as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next date to keep your eye on is definitely April 30-May 1st, but we'll see I guess.

       Thanks for reminding me.  This is an area of interest to me and I lost track of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       May 1st seems to be the day where they set a new agenda or a new wish.  So there will be some sort of release on this date which will set major things in motion and reveals a part of a larger agenda.
      </p>

       Oh fuck!  I just looked up the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Osama_bin_Laden">
        "Osama Bin Ladin death"
       </a>
       and those dang people changed the announcement date to May 2.  Those revisionist mother fuckers.  They said at the time that he was killed days before hand and then they waited.  Maybe they are going by Chinese time twenty four hours in the future or something crazy and plain wrong.

       </em>
       remember at the time of the Deepwater Horizon disaster that the actual deaths of the 11 individuals took place on April 20th, but I
       <em>
        swear
       </em>
       I read in numerous places that the
       <em>
        fire
       </em>
       began the day earlier...on April 19th. Now Wikipedia and everywhere else says it started on the 20th.
      </p>
      <p>
       April 19th seems to be the key date though.

       Well hopefully nothing bad happens then either :(

      <p>
       I'm not trying to claim that
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       was the event I was talking about...but come on, I said there could be a sacrifice by fire soon and this happened, I think that qualifies as more than just mildly interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's the time of month that matters...specifically the second half of April (which the 15th begins).
      </p>
      <p>
       If, hypothetically speaking, this event
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       ritualistic to some degree, it still fits with the program of those who orchestrate these occult rituals...the Boston Marathon is conceivably a high-profile event enough to stage something like this, even though it's four days away from the 19th.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this is all extremely wide-eyed, high octane speculation.

       many Nazis were quietly brought to the US after the war that it boggles the mind. Thousands upon thousands were assimilated into numerous fields: medicine, scientific research, and espionage to name a few.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it's ridiculous to say that the Nazi's run the show in the US, it's similarly ridiculous to dismiss their post-war influence completely. Operation Paperclip is a testament to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The burning alive of the freedom fighters in the Warsaw ghetto was one of the worst combat atrocities of the war. The fact that Waco occurred 50 years later to the day, and the fact that the deaths were so similar, just screams more than coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything Waco may have been some sort of macabre homage to that event 50 years earlier. That's why I think bringing it up is extremely relevant in this instance.

       They came to the US because the US offered to shelter them and protect many of them from their war crimes. That's a pretty good deal after just being on the losing side.

      <p>
       And no one
       <em>
        waited

       50 years. Again I didn't say that the Nazis are IN CHARGE of things, just that they had a great influence on the politics and the sciences in the US after the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Waco thing was a sick event and
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       too much of a coincidence to have occurred 50 years to the day after that brutal event in WWII.
      </p>
      <p>
       What came of it was that the US showed they were capable of murdering innocent adults and children by burning them alive and then they could get away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were demonstrating that the US was becoming like Nazi Germany and they were shoving it in our faces.

       Or, the more corrupt TPTB become, the more blatant they get with their false flags and sick rituals, so they follow their calendars because they know the majority of people will dismiss it all as coincidence because there are only 365 days in a year, after all.
