       I can't seem to get a simple message across without being downvoted into oblivion. I thought NorthKoreaNews was reputable but I was instantly down voted, and my link disappeared off their 'new' feed. The only point I'm trying to make is that the maximum internet speed in North Korea is 519x faster than the AVERAGE American connection. Nobody can seem to get past their own knee-jerk reaction to downvote... so I figured maybe this is the place to actually get the world out.

       This is true of course. I'm not making the case that North Korea is some promised land of wonderful internet access. Personally I'm under the assumption that only the mega-elite and government  (one in the same?) have access to the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       My real point is to demonstrate how fast people downvote without critically thinking that: yes it may be true that none of the civilian population of North Korea has access to the internet, but that certainly doesn't mean that the internet doesn't serve a purpose there like it does here. In fact, the insane internet speeds accessible only to the government and not the people can lend credence to the North Korean government brainwashing it's people into the ground.

       Sure, but I'm not sure of how relevant or even useful this piece of information is. It's well known that North Korea is run in an Orwellian way, so I'm not really sure what the point of your post is.

       Orwellian  states can come in many forms. The most dangerous of these is not the traditional ones like North Korea where control is maintained with Sanctions,  the threat of fear , death, concentration or labour camps . The American Orwellian state is accomplished by consumerism.Totalitarianism is packaged and sold to them over the counter and they wont event know it or care, and when you point out their dangerous purchase, they will scold you for revealing the truth to them. So you just turn away, and let them buy their way to detention centres and curfews and when once more history repeats itself.

       here, this guy is an idiot. He was downvoted below the post threshold, not silenced, and probably downvoted because, even if this "fact" is true, it's an extremely irrelevant tidbit of information. It's also hardly news about North Korea and the current tensions on the peninsula, which is what the sub is about....

       The transfer of data is important. Being able to transfer massive amounts of data long distances is important especially when it comes to military involvement. There is a state of the art infrastructure (speed-wise) in place and you're discounting it like it's nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also would like to see a source for that number of public IP addresses.

       2 gigs for a nation's infrastructure is chump change.  You can achieve that with a really small amount of equipment. Look up the speeds an OC-768 can achieve, and understand that's just a single line.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, 2 gigs is an OC-48 transmission speed.  2002-2004 time frame.  If that's state of the art for you, awesome.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the ip's:
       <a href="http://www.programva.com/en/ip-addresses-world-countries?u0=%20North%20Korea&amp;amp;uA=IP%20address&amp;amp;id_r=121&amp;amp;opEvent=country">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Only 6 of 1024 are in use.  Only 1024 IP's for an entire country is insane.  Definitely NOT state of the art.

       No, but what is the
       <em>
        maximum
       </em>
       internet speed in America? Since that 2.5 Gbits/s (assuming it's even true) is likely only used by their government, what kind of speeds does the U.S. government have access to? If the N. Korea government had faster internet than the U.S. government, that may be something interesting. What you posted was just garbage.

       Also, did you even read the wiki page on N. Korea? It makes it sound like that 2.5Gbits/s is only for their local intranet or whatever, not for access to the global web. That makes it even more irrelevant.

       It's not irrelevant simply because the public perception of North Korea is skewed in a way that many people believe they live in third-world conditions and never take the time to take into account the transfer of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reference to the intra/internet argument, although it is true that those who actually do have access to the net in North Korea won't see speeds anywhere near the 2.5 Gbits/s listed when accessing the global web, it is still crucial to note that it has such a fast intranet
       <em>
        within

       The fact that some crappy, tiny dictatorship's propaganda service saved up and bought a nice router is of "great importance?" The intranet where I work is like 10 Gbits/s or something - does this mean our company is over four times more technologically advanced than North Korea?

       The people of NK have nothing to eat, two state run TV stations, one state run radio station. I think they could give two shits how fast the dictators Internet is...maybe Kim Jong fatass plays a lot of COD or what ever the cool kids are playing these days.

       When 6 people share a countries internet, of course it's going to be fast. This is also completely irrelevant to absolutely anything. Glad a mod from the sub showed up. Keep your nutjob garbage here. There's plenty of legitimate aspects of the NK conflict to discuss, this isn't one of them.

       I think the "2.5 Gbits" you're referring to is the Backbone link between major cities in NK. 
It's not like everyone connected in is getting 2.5gb speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if they were it's not like they can get to anything cool, probably locked down tight.

       The transfer of data is important. Being able to transfer massive amounts of data long distances is important especially when it comes to military involvement. There is a state of the art infrastructure (speed-wise) in place and you're discounting it like it's nothing.
