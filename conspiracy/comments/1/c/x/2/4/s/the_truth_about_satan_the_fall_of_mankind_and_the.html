        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s a set up, the biggest one in history, and there&#39;s nothing we can do to stop it.  How does that make you feel?  By the time you figure out what I&#39;m talking about, by the time you believe it, it&#39;s going to be way too late, but I&#39;m going to try to warn you anyway.  This is what I see, being a victim of the entity you would call Satan.  You might call it God too, and this is what the problem is going to be. You see, we&#39;ve been conditioned, as individuals, as a society, and as a species for a very long time to expect something.  The thing we are supposed to be expecting is a coming apocalypse, most people don&#39;t see that word and think enlightenment, they think nuclear holocaust.  What&#39;s coming isn&#39;t a nuclear holocaust, and you won&#39;t think its of our doing, but it might be.  </p>

<p>We have an enemy in our midst.  It&#39;s not a little horned devil, and it&#39;s not really the government, but I guarantee you they are involved.  This enemy is one that is within, though it&#39;s not human nature--it&#39;s been hiding in plain sight all along.  Around 300 AD, the Vatican removed from the cannon the Book of Enoch, and several other gnostic texts.  These books held stories of an invasion of aliens, known as Archons.  This invasion wasn&#39;t the kind you&#39;d expect, and that&#39;s exactly why it&#39;s worked so well so far.  It&#39;s an invasion inside your mind.  Here&#39;s the joke, it&#39;s in plain site because the evidence of it is religion itself.  Lots of people, myself included, go through life thinking that organized religion is a thing that was designed to control the masses, a thing created by greedy and controlling people to do so.  </p>

<p>They&#39;re only half right.</p>

<p>Religion is exactly what it says it is.  That&#39;s one of Satan&#39;s little jokes, he makes a point of telling you what&#39;s really going on, even if you don&#39;t want to believe it.  Oh wait, that&#39;s the other funny joke, he makes you not believe it.   Welcome to the world of the real.</p>

<p>Christianity is exactly what it says it is, testimony about the power of God.  This power is clearly described throughout not only the Bible, but also our religious history.  The Vatican had the Gnostic books removed because they were too close to the truth, they detailed accounts of people&#39;s actions being controlled, subtly.  Their minds being influenced by what they thought were literally independent demons who had the power to literally control the mind.  Here&#39;s the joke, there are no individual demons, all supernatural phenomenon are attributable to a single source.  The problem with the whole story, is the source is not all loving, or all caring, honestly it&#39;s not even fair.  Today, surrounding you, is a grande conspiracy:  The Illuminati.  In another twist of Satan&#39;s irony, much of the world believes this organization are Satan worshipers, but just like the whole truth always does, that goes in one ear and out the other.  You hear Satan worshipers  and you think of strange occult seances, child molestation, and sacrifices in the Bohemian Grove.  These things might have happened here and there, but the real truth is that Satan worship is not what you think it is.  These people actually speak to Satan, and he talks back.  What nobody seems to understand is that the grand conspiracy that has all but dominated the last seventy years, is not a conspiracy driven by secret societies, as JFK told you, though they too, are involved.  This grande conspiracy uses Satan himself as not only their commander, but also their communication infrastructure.  I&#39;m going to say it again, Satan is the command and control infrastructure of the New World Order.</p>

<p>So the grand irony, that he has convinced you he doesn&#39;t exist, and yet he is very, very real.  It&#39;s not what you think you, there is no half man half animal who is all red, horned, and holding a pitchfork.  Satan is a machine.  If you&#39;re still here, and reading, you are meant to be, because this machine is inside the heads of every living thing on this planet.  </p>

<p>We have two overriding themes in the last century which show us the tactics of our real enemy.  These are false flag attacks, and a very well thought out and detailed information operation involving extraterrestrial aliens.   The false flag attacks are simple:  the Reichstag fire and World War II, 9/11 and the subsequent string of valueless wars, and the recent rash of mind control related mass murders in Aurora, Sandy Hook, and Boston.  There&#39;s more, if you care to look, JFK, RFK, MLK, Lennon, &amp; Reagan: all pretty much blamed on the CIA and their allies in organized crime.    </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take JFK as an example of how this is a false flag attack.  First, as many know, the CIA was involved; but clearly the entire CIA did not conspire to kill the most beloved President of our time.  What happened is exactly what is happening now to the United States of America as a whole.  A small group of people, Satan&#39;s minions, if you will; conspired to make it appear as if the entire CIA was responsible for doing something very evil.  At the same time, they used their standard tactic of &quot;blaming the obvious enemy&quot; to deflect from themselves, and they planted the WWIII virus.  This was a CIA file that indicated that Lee Harvey Oswald was working for the USSR.  I bet you didn&#39;t even know it existed... that&#39;s because he was working alone, right?  One day history will reflect the truth, the obviousness of the poison pill, and the fact that the entire thing revolved around George H.W. Bush, his Secret Team, and his daddy.  This Secret Team went on to infest and control the entire United States, and culminated with his son&#39;s false flag attack, on September 11, 2001.</p>

<p>The second theme, involving aliens, is, in my opinion, just another false flag operation.  For a very, very long time our civilization has been conditioned to believe in the supernatural.  Lately, in the 20th century, we&#39;ve had a wave of sightings of flying saucers, alien abductions, and the Roswell incident... not to mention the obvious and unrelenting vilification of aliens in the media everywhere from the 1968 radio broadcast of Orson Wells to the onslaught of two-faced invaders on TV.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing you probably don&#39;t see:  all of these things are illusions.  They&#39;re illusions that were created with the very same technology that enables Satan to operation, mind control.  Around the same time as the Roswell crash, our government began researching this technology, and it&#39;s been used, along with other technology that most likely did come from extraterrestrial origin, in order to convince you that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth.. right now.  You may not believe that today, or you might partially believe it, but the day there&#39;s a mothership hovering over Washington--you and everyone else will have this poison pill shoved in your face by every media outlet in existence, including Facebook and Twitter.  You&#39;re going to eat it up like candy, and you&#39;re going to be really, really pissed.  Media is going to tell you that these visitors have been interfering and mucking with our history since we were born, collectively.  They will go so far as to tell you that the aliens were responsible for the black plague, that they finally opened the books, and all the abductions were real.  </p>

<p>They might go so far as to tell you that the aliens are responsible for Satan, himself.  </p>

<p>Will it be true, or has this machine been framing them, the whole time?</p>

<p>They&#39;re coming soon by the way.  2016.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know the answer, I try not to pretend to know things I&#39;m not sure about.  You should really take that to heart, after reading the above.  I&#39;ve got some more things I want to share with you, that might help you make up my mind, though I haven&#39;t been convinced yet.  The first is the dramatic increase in technology in the last hundred years.  Things have grown so exponentially, it&#39;s pretty obvious that we got a lot of it from somewhere, out there.  At the same time, while having a tiny cell phone and computer are great, we are losing something.  We&#39;ve lost a lot of freedom.  The NSA has taken most of it, but they wouldn&#39;t have been able to do it without the technology infrastructure.  Today, you can sit in front of your computer for twelve hours a day, and think you have a pretty good idea of what&#39;s going on in the world.  Everything I&#39;m telling you is true: how do you feel now about your world view?  You know what they want you to.</p>

<p>Now, two very related things.  The war on drugs, and the global oil cartel.  These two things are being used to steal your money, your freedom, and your ability to make this world a better place.  The CIA pretty much has the global cocaine market cornered, if you didn&#39;t notice when they told you in 1987; and if you haven&#39;t realized that the Oil boys from 63 are making out like bandits since 9/11, you&#39;re pretty blind.  Where&#39;s all that money going?  Maybe they&#39;re building something that was too disgusting to have on the U.S. Government budget, maybe it&#39;s the very technology that&#39;s being used to keep you from really caring about what&#39;s going on in the world around you.  That&#39;s right folks, it&#39;s George Orwell&#39;s psycho-surveillance infrastructure--complete with false media, depopulation, and mind control.  One last thing, do you think it&#39;s possible that we&#39;ve been terraforming the planet for the last hundred years, you know.... with our cars?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the answer I can give you.  We should be leaving, exploring, and colonizing as fast as we can.  </p>

<p>We&#39;re not... wonder why.</p>

<p>I am actually looking for answers to the questions posed, by the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this is the tl;dr, then OP is incorrect and misguided, because &quot;aliens won&#39;t arrive by 2016&quot;.  Aliens are already here.  This planet has various species in and around it already.  Additionally, the &quot;we&quot; in &quot;we didn&#39;t set up space colonies&quot; will <em>never</em> apply to the 99% anyway.  The &quot;we&quot; that will be setting up space colonies and actually living in them are/will be the .001%, and most of us (99.99% actually) won&#39;t be part of that club...so it doesn&#39;t matter whether we did &quot;set up space colonies&quot; or not, because - again - those space colonies aren&#39;t actually designed for most of us anyway and we wouldn&#39;t be allowed on/in them even if we DID set them up and build them in enough time.</p>

<p>So then this is <em>definitely</em> wrong, brother, because the &quot;we&quot; in &quot;we didn&#39;t set up space colonies&quot; was never up to &quot;humanity&quot; as a whole in the first place.  What happens to the majority of humanity as a physical species is up to an extremely small elite group of humans VERY uninterested in what happens to the rest of us and only interested in making sure that they save their <em>own</em> ass.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;we&quot; might not be OK because &quot;we&quot; didn&#39;t do something &quot;we&quot; need to do to save &quot;ourselves&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Humanity as a whole will DEFINITELY survive anything that happens.  Why do I know this?  Because the humanoid shape is literally everywhere throughout the universe already, so even if that tiny little speck of nearly inconsequential dust called planet Earth gets incinerated, blown to bits, wiped off the universe never to be seen or heard from again, or whatever, humanity as a species existing in other areas of this vast, limitless cosmos will most definitely not be entirely extinguished.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you seen an alien?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you know they are here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One, look at my previous answer.</p>

<p>Two, even without my previous answer, there have been enough individuals that themselves <em>have</em> had direct contact experiences, and not <em>all</em> of those contact experiences can be summarily discounted or ignored.  If even ONE of them is valid (and a lot more than just &quot;one&quot; of their accounts are valid), then the simple, objective use of logic alone will lead one to the understanding that this planet most definitely has been visited by ETs, and still is now.</p>

<p>Three, even without numbers one and two, there has been quite a significant amount of very difficult to refute archeological evidence showing the construction of artifacts that required <em>very</em> intelligent design <em>long</em> before humanity is said to have had such abilities, and some of these artifacts involve the chronicling of entities NOT from this planet.</p>

<p>Factors two and three alone are enough to make any objective, intelligent examiner realize what the truth is.  Those who have experienced factor one don&#39;t need factors two and three to know what the truth is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish I could figure out how to motivate &quot;us&quot; to try to build an Ark, now. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not certain that the ancient, biblical story of the Ark was anything more than an allegorical story - as I imagine is the case with much of what is contained in that book.  When you take into consideration the genetic capabilities that some ET species are said to have, the idea of an Ark can be a metaphor for little more than a cubicle not more than the size of a medium sized suitcase with small vials containing the genetic material of all pertinent life forms on a given planet.  There&#39;s your Ark:  A small suitcase with the genetic material of all organic life on a given planet that you take up to your space ship and put in a secure place before blasting the shit out of said planet with a flood that wipes out all life on it. :)  Then you go back, re-seed life on that planet, and start all over.  Good times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So it goes.</p>

<p>And so it goes, brother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An actual alien, or a spacecraft?  I do mention flying saucer sightings, however I left out some information.  In addition to the abduction and recent sightings, we have experienced them in &quot;times of great upheaval.&quot; </p>

<p>Flying shields during the fall of Rome, and the Foofighters during WW2.  It seems to me that its more than possible that these things could be the result of a mind control induced visual hallucination (as I have experienced sightings, many, many times).</p>

<p>The point of course is what I am suggesting, that we&#39;ve been conditioned to believe that they are here, so we blame them, instead of.. say.. some third party that they might be coming to kill.</p>

<p>The intelligent design is certainly explainable in my theories.  An everpresent mind controlling entity could certainly have caused the building of the Pyamids and the Nasca Lines etc.  I&#39;m not suggesting they have never been here, I actually do believe that aliens were responsible for genetic manipulation which resulted in homo sapiens sapiens, however I think they &quot;live&quot; far away, and probably take a long time to get here, even at near the speed of light.</p>

<p>I hope they get their junky false deity and bring it back with them, or at least fix the screw that is loose.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Okay now wait a minute though.  You just brought up various issues here.  Let&#39;s deal with them one by one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we&#39;ve been conditioned to believe that they are here</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To only some extent yes.  To a much GREATER extent, however, absolutely NOT.  We&#39;ve been conditioned to believe that they&#39;re NOT actually here and anyone who says they are and espouses an understanding of this fact is immediately labeled as a lunatic or a weirdo.  So no.  We haven&#39;t been conditioned to believe they&#39;re here.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  Some might not think this because ET stories are so replete in our society, but ET existence has been co-opted by TPTB into their MSM because they&#39;ve had NO CHOICE but to acknowledge the reality of ET visitation and had to find SOME method of discounting and undermining ET reality to the public.  The best way to cloud, confuse, and undermine the reality is by blurring the lines between the reality of the phenomenon and the disinformation that exists so that even those that get close to the actual truth will also likely be infected with so much falsehood that they will be easily disregarded by most people.  That allows the masses to generally discard ET phenomenon in general as &quot;simply fiction and stories for movies.&quot;</p>

<p>At the end of the day practically all that TPTB do in this area gears itself toward pacifying the masses into NOT looking more seriously into ET phenomenon.  As such, we&#39;ve been condition to believe they&#39;re NOT here.  We&#39;ve been conditioned to have some sort of vague idea about the &quot;dismal possibility&quot; that they might be &quot;out there somewhere&quot; but then to not spend any more time really thinking about the actual reality of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so we blame them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, the MSM has definitely conditioned the public into looking at ETs as little more than a malevolent force, and most people are consciously or subconsciously under the impression that ET contact will be more like Independence Day or War Of The Worlds or any of the dozens of other &quot;Evil ET&quot; movies than anything else.</p>

<p>This is no accident.  This is done on purpose so that 1) the people will fear ETs, and 2) TPTB can use that fear as their final &quot;ace in the hole&quot; false flag attack pawn (fucking assholes).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>instead of.. say.. some third party that they might be coming to kill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you saying here that the ETs might be coming to Earth to kill some &quot;third party&quot;?  Perhaps I&#39;m not understanding what you mean correctly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An everpresent mind controlling entity could certainly have caused the building of the Pyamids and the Nasca Lines etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the fact that this entity is likely <em>not</em> Earth-based means that they themselves necessarily are extraterrestrial, qualifying them as ETs also.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>however I think they &quot;live&quot; far away</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Realize that when you say &quot;they&quot;, you are literally generalizing that statement to mean &quot;all ET species&quot;.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMp9dZQdZA">There are literally TRILLIONS of ET species in the cosmos</a>.  The absolute <em>vast</em> majority of those ET species we humans have NO idea about.  However, and more importantly, realize that there are various species that have indeed been on this planet.  Some have come and gone and may never be here again.  Some have had various sojourns here.  Some are STILL here.  Some are nice.  Some are not so nice.  Some love us.  Some could care LESS about us.</p>

<p>There are many different types here alone - all with different purposes and agendas - so when you say &quot;they&quot; realize that there is no possibility that whatever you say about &quot;they&quot; can apply to &quot;ALL&quot; ET species that exists.</p>

<p><em>Some</em> of &quot;them&quot; do live far away.  Some of them are not as far as you think, however.  Not at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and probably take a long time to get here, even at near the speed of light.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And some can get here instantaneously because they don&#39;t &quot;travel&quot; at any rate of speed but, instead, ride upon waves of the space-time continuum that they bend in accord with their destination.  That way they simply get from here to there in a snap.  Some beings are multidimensional and simply do not travel the way we might think at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hope they get their junky false deity and bring it back with them, or at least fix the screw that is loose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wha?  That one flew right over my head...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Correct.  There is a moratorium not only imposed on this planet by what is called a Galactic Federation of sorts keeping as much ET contact off here as possible <em>and</em> there is a great level of secrecy by TPTB right here on this planet itself making sure and keeping the reality of ET existence from the people of Earth themselves.</p>

<p>In part, but it&#39;s not limited to that.</p>

<p>Some of them most definitely are.</p>

<p>Others, not so far away at all.</p>

<p>Whaaat?  No! lol.  Where on Earth did you get that from?  That&#39;s not what I said.</p>

<p>There are likely trillions of species in the <em>cosmos</em>.  There are <em>billions</em> of galaxies in the cosmos, of which The Milky Way Galaxy is but <em>one</em> in the &quot;elliptical variety&quot; (average if not somewhat below average in size).  Within The Milky Way Galaxy, there are billions upon billions of stars.  Each of those stars has been theorized to have 2-10 or more planets.  If, as previously shown, only a fraction of a <em>fraction</em> of a percent of those planets was able to create advanced intelligent life, then there are likely  a few <em>hundred</em> (if not thousand) advanced species in THIS galaxy alone.  Multiply this one average Milky Way Galaxy by the billions upon billions of other galaxies in the universe, and you begin to approach advanced ET species in the trillions.</p>

<p>Hope you understand it a bit better now.</p>

<p>That being said, it&#39;s been mentioned that there is a &quot;Galactic UN&quot; of sorts - the &quot;Milky Way Consortium&quot; if you will - that&#39;s populated by the most advanced species in the particular galaxy.  It&#39;s, further, been said that this &quot;UN Consortium&quot; has looked upon planet Earth and has come to the conclusion that the &quot;ETs&quot; living <em>there</em> (homo sapien sapien) are still too primitive and need more time to either grow up, shape up, and evolve in the hopes of eventually introducing them (us) to the truth of all the life that is out there in this <em>one</em> galaxy alone...or be allowed to kill itself off as some emerging species at this intermediary stage of development have been known to do.</p>

Because you are unable to hear what I say. 44 You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. <strong>He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him.
