    <div class="md"><p>There have been <em>many</em> moves in the direction of attempting to curtail the 2nd Amendment in the past few months.  That much is more than blatantly apparent for anyone even mildly paying attention.</p>

<p>CISPA, NDAA and any of the alphabet acronyms are all designed to cut down on civil liberties.  &quot;Terrorist act&quot; after &quot;terrorist act&quot; taking place gives many a politician a pulpit to expound upon how we &quot;must protect the people against this that or the other!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We must be allowed to carry out our investigations without our inquiries being tampered by internet vandalism!&quot;  This easily leads the way toward justifying further internet encroachment by the state.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t theory.  This has been happening.  Again, many a politician (Dianne Feinstein to name but one of several) are on the forefront of shouting out about &quot;dangers that must be curtailed!&quot;</p>

<p>So yeah.  Any moves in that direction, you ask?  I would say <em>many</em> moves in that direction.</p>

<p>he never went to the front of the boat and even if he did why was there no blood in the location he was laying in?</p>

<p>The blood on his head is from the head injuries he sustained in the earlier interaction he has with the police. </p>

<p>this graph shows you where all the major artery&#39;s are. In order for the suspect to be unable to speak is if he show himself in the vocal chords. </p>

<p>You claimed earlier that he wasn&#39;t bleeding. Or did I misunderstand that?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not at all. If he shot himself in the mouth his tongue would be damaged. The transcript of his charge states that he is able to say &quot;no&quot; which means his vocal cords aren&#39;t damaged. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why would he? Humans aren&#39;t balloons full of blood. You can bleed to death without much blood exiting your body. </p>

<p>I did also claim that he was bleeding before he sat in the the boat. Other wise there would be no blood on the side of it. Didn&#39;t really understand why you would point that out. </p>

<p>If he did shoot himself in the mouth more then just his tongue would be missing which would also counter attack your argument about him being able to speak. </p>

<p>this is a victim a gun shot please tell me how only the tong would be blown off but not the rest of his head or major muscle tissue / vain. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have to be an expert in gunshot wounds but I own/shot several guns in my life and if it hits something it doesn&#39;t just take out a muscle tissue that is closest to the bullet. </p>

<p>People get shot in the leg and if it happens to hit the bone 1/2 the time it&#39;s broken and doesn&#39;t just stop and the muscle. </p>

<p>Point is there is no way for someone to shoot themselves in the mouth/ throat without bleeding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not an american ( dont live in usa ) so if you guys let me give you my opinion . This looks like an american action movie .  Since the begining , first , a terrible attack , that everybody can see and feel sorry for them . Second , the FBI ( like in the movies) said &quot; these are the guys&quot; and dont show any evidence at all . Only two guy waking with backpacks. 3. The media start to broadcast  to the whole world the persicution, a gunfigth, a naked guy , police in the streets, a manhunt  with army tanks, bomb squads, robots , a whole city paralice for only a teenager with bombs in his chest . And then ... The happy ending . &quot;We got him&quot; people cheering in the steeets, everybody is happy, the police are the heroes . THE end . Im not try to be rude or be nosy , ( in my coutry , they never catch the bad guy) but i think is to show to the world what USA always wins no matter what ! Nobody can mess with us!  Even if dont know who did it , or why !  We always wins ........ Its just my view , I dont wanna be disrespetfull .  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The purpose could have been to test the public&#39;s reaction to martial law?  People accepted SWAT and military police into their homes without question and without warrants, more importantly.  It could also have been to introduce further gun regulation? There has already been a bill introduced to ban gun powder.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad some answers are surfacing, but I still have questions:</p>

<p>What about the Saudi suspect?  Glenn Beck actually released some interesting information on that.  And what about the aunt who claims &quot;the naked man&quot; was absolutely her nephew, Tamerlan Tsarnaev -who was apparently under surveillance or in contact with the FBI for years.</p>

<p>this is the picture of him climbing out with no help from the authority. Do you see any blood on his shirt ? (I know your reply will be something along the lines of &quot;the pic is too blurry to tell)  </p>

<p>for that reason I give you the photo of the <strong>suspect</strong> on the ground with medics surrounding him. Please show me a photo of anyone that has been shot in the throat and doesn&#39;t bleed.</p>
