<p>The additional quip that &quot;theories must be falsifiable&quot; is also incorrect.  Theories are simply ideas that attempt to explain something.  In our case, our theories differ from the official story.  Both are explained by various evidence and neither is disprovable.</p>

<p>Actually, what you are talking about is a hypothesis.  A theory is a collected amount of data, observations, and evidence to a hypothesis that makes it probable.  Theories can be proved wrong if there&#39;s evidence brought against the evidence you already have, but ultimately it just changes the theory.  A law( in terms of science )is a collection of theories supported by evidence where there is no contradictory evidence.</p>

<p>You see, people <em>believe</em> the FBI before anyone else because of their perceived position in society.  People perceive the FBI&#39;s claims as superior to any other individual or group making claims because they are in a position of authority.  Why should people believe them just because they are in a position of authority?  Why should we believe they have superior capability to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the bombing?</p>

<p>It&#39;s playing on people&#39;s animal instincts of following the leader where the &quot;fittest&quot; leads the pack.  You can call it bandwagon effect, natural order of society, or any other number of descriptions but in reality it all boils down to being submissive to the people in authority and following them wherever they lead the people.</p>

<p>Nope. I bet you believe the earth is round because someone told you, or that you&#39;d die if you get crushed by a train because someone told you. But you have no &quot;proof&quot; of that, you&#39;ve never seen the earth from space and you never died in a train accident.</p>

<p>So you believe some things you&#39;ve been told. But apparently on this subreddit some people believe EVERYTHING that they can&#39;t see on TV. They believe mainstream media lie all the time, but everyone outside of these media is telling the truth.</p>

<p>If a video is titled<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWUB4MCLsHg"> &quot;A retired Lieutenant Colonel in the Army weighs in on Boston.&quot;</a>, then people will believe he&#39;s really a retired lieutenant, even if there&#39;s no proof and the only source is a video title, and will believe everything he says. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cuoc5/is_there_any_proof_that_lieutenant_colonel_roy/c9k5anz">If someone asks for proof, he gets downvoted.</a></p>

<p>If someone claims to be an EMT and says he knows the bombing was staged, he&#39;ll get thousands of comments and be shared everywhere, it&#39;ll be on the frontpage of this sub, even though he&#39;s [full of shit](<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1csio3/an_indepth_analysis_of_one_of_the_boston_bombing/c9jp29b">www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1csio3/an_indepth_analysis_of_one_of_the_boston_bombing/c9jp29b</a>).</p>
