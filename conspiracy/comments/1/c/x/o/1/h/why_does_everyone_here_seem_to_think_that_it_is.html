       Especially during a psy-op like this? This is not evidence, regardless of how many people say it is! For all we know they could have had set this photo up in a studio. On 9/11 there was the fake Osama Bin Laden video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every part of their story makes these guys sound extremely stupid and irrational, why the fuck would they fire on the police knowing full well they would effectively be signing their death sentence by doing so! And how the fuck would they let one of them get away in his car?? Are you telling me that they didn't bother to seal of the streets?
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this makes any sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to prepare for the shill parade, just focus on one question and try not to divert from it and spin it into other debates:
      </p>
      <p>
       If the goal of the conspirators was to frame these guys and make it seem like they were justified in killing one of them, even after apprehending him a life, would it be impossible for them to fake pictures like these?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you believe they could do it, do you really claim that we should just trust that they wouldn't?
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, it doesn't matter that they originated from some blog. That is a predictable way of publishing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will of course say "Apparently no evidence is enough for the conspiracy theorists" and "any piece of evidence is obviously faked"... but this is a part of the psy-op and simply does not lay this discussion to rest, as they clearly want. The main goal of it is to turn the public against us, the "conspiracy nuts", and make it seem like we are defending murderers who attack police.

       Don't just say "the pictures are doctored".  Post some evidence. Otherwise it sounds like you are ignoring evidence to support your alternative theory. THAT is when people start throwing around insults about tinfoil hats and such.

       There isn't, and most likely will never be, any proof that the pictures were doctored. So it's a dead-end for that. But that is not the only piece of evidence that can be analyzed in a situation like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think that if you expect those in the intelligence community, who have technology to detect if photos or videos were doctored, to not use it on their own photographic releases and remove any trace of it, then you're one step behind.

       In the past 4 days we've proven that CIA photos were doctored. You are missing the point here. There is insurmountable evidence that you're choosing to ignore because it's scary and borderline character assassination. If our accusations are ridiculous, why are government officials avoiding all the questions asked in regards to these discoveries? If they were non-sense, they could easily disprove
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       , but they haven't and they won't. Evading questions, nervousness, hesistation and sloppy evidence are the tell-tale signs of liars, go ask a detective yourself.

       If you bothered to read what I said more carefully or click my username, you'd be able to see that you're preaching to the choir. I've been actively reading and commenting in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       since this entire Boston
       <em>
        event
       </em>
       happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I said is that instead of focusing on the "there's a pixel wrong in this picture," we should focus on the bigger and more undeniable facts that we know. The photographic and video evidence that proves our point beyond the shadow of a doubt. Because you might not be able to appeal to the average person by telling him there are a few pixels wrong in this photo, but you might be able to make that person believe when you show them the frame-by-frame pictures of the actors ducked down, waiting for the smoke to wear out, so they could emerge from the smoke like some injuried victims and terrify the people across the street from them sitting in the stands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you could convince someone that this was staged by showing the Huffington Post zombie photo with the guy whose jeans are completely ripped in front, yet walking; with his shirt shredded into pieces, with only one button holding the shirt together, yet the rest of the buttons nicely undone and visible on the shirt, because, hey, why ruin a perfectly good shirt that can be used in the next zombie movie sensation?
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you want to take away some of this tinfoil hatness from these posts, we should probably focus more on the undeniable proof, rather than focus on some pixels that seem out of place. Have an actual doctor or EMT give his personal opinion on what happens when someone's legs are severed off -- what's the rate at which the blood gushes out, how many minutes he's got to live, what conditions he would be in if he lost, say, half his blood?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, thank you and the other three (and possibly more by now) that downvoted my comment, without realizing that I'm on the same side of the argument here. You were so focused on pulling the trigger that you didn't even realize you turned your gun against your own people. Have a good day.

       I will say this.  Once seemingly hard evidence is provided, the onus is on anyone who believes it to be faked to then prove that it's been tampered with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying it's doctored.  I'm not saying it couldn't be doctored.  I'm just saying that as of yet, it hasn't been proven to be doctored.  And until such time, my assumption is that it's real.

       The hard evidence is not the pics by themselves. It is the pics coupled with the eyewitness who took them who is a real person. He has posted his address, license plate number, friend's license plate number, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       To fake a shootout with 2 men that looked like the brothers on a public street with probably 100 cops, explosives going off, etc would be a HUGE undertaking.

       I'm not saying the powers that be couldn't pull it off but we should be able to poke holes in it somewhere if it was staged no?

       I suppose I could give you that.  There is still wiggle room after these pics.  But I don't think anyone would argue that there is much less now.

       But you are correct.  The dash cams are what we should be demanding.  In fact, they should have been released prior to the Martial Law beta (not that it would have justified it).

       All in all... sure, anything can happen... but it seems to me much more likely that, more often than not, people who do such things are isolated nuts, rather than that most of the time it is some intricate conspiracy of our worlds leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I think so is because intricate conspiraces are highly complex, and therefore rare phenomena; while crazy people with a cause are very common (just looking at crime history).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fair enough if someone wants to point at a conspiracy with good evidence... but if someone thinks that every single spree-killing event is a part of the conspiracy, because he did some laptop investigation of photos and blogs (who are no less likely to be fake than offical photos) ... then I just tap out.

       They declared Martial Law during Hurricane Katrina and DID take peoples guns AT THE THREAT OF GUN POINT, what do you think they would do if a person says "No I'm not giving you my guns", NOT have a standoff with a potential shootout?

       This is one area he's right on, in that when they declare martial law they WILL take your guns, as they've done it before and they'll do it again.

      <p>
       Why do you think they cared about dying at that point? Maybe they prefered to try to kill the cops rather than be captured. In fact the guy who posted the pictures says "As he got closer to the officers, within 10 -15 yards of them he was taken down.", so the older brother really just wanted to kill cops and didn't care about his safety.

      <p>
       If it was after a car chase, during the night, and the firefight lasted less than 5 minutes, why is it impossible to think the other police cars were far away? And maybe they were badly coordinated and they failed somewhere? The younger brother drove between
       <a href="http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0116/4362/files/moh-boston-3_grande.jpg?749">
        these 2 police cars
       </a>
       , it doesn't look hard to do, and if they wanted to capture him alive, they couldn't just shot his car, and they were already busy arresting the other brother.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think it makes more sense that:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) the firefight never happened, all the cops and witnesses involved are part of the conspiracy
      </p>
      <p>
       2) people who faked the firefight and the pictures (actors, light engineers, fake houses builders, fake trees planters, the cars owners etc.) are part of the conspiracy
      </p>
      <p>
       3) the CIA guys interrogating the suspect (and everyone in contact with him) are part of the conspiracy

       I have one question: do you think the pictures of the funerals of these three who died are all fake? For those saying the bombings were just a false flag and no one died. Please explain the photos at funerals. I am not saying there isn't some kind of conspiracy, but to suggest the victims never died and that it was all fake, how could they show their faces around anyone again? Why would they do that? Doesn't make sense, does it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw so many pictures of the bombing scene - more than I should have - and I cannot, for the life of me, see ANY reason why actors would do this. I just can't. If I'm wrong, please enlighten me, because it just has no reasoning behind it.

Those that say this is a terrorist activity and nothing more and its a horrible tragedy and we must do everything in our power to prevent it from ever occurring again and they are terrified.

      <p>
       Those that say this is a set up, completely staged for nefarious purposes to control and rule by fear, and they are terrified.

       What's even more absurd is that the suspects left the car head lights on.  This not only gave the cops a clear view of them, it would have made it harder for them to return fire, but it does conveniently make it so that a picture of them can be taken (wearing clothes that look nearly identical to what they wore at the marathon three days earlier I might add).

       Do you expect two dudes who had never done this before to have the presence of mind and knowledge to consider tactical issues like that, and know how to turn off the lights of a carjacked Mercedes? A lot of modern luxury vehicles have always on lights that require weird button depressions and the like to turn off that aren't immediately clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Silverados for example, to turn off the headlights while the car is running, you have to hit a button labelled dome override twice in less than a second and a half

       That assumes that they were both thinking calmly and rationally in the middle of a shootout with the police, that they knew how to turn the lights off, and that they thought of doing so before getting pinned down behind the car. You have to go through a whole fucking options menu with the steering wheel to do it on a relatively new Mercedes.

       Here is the process for turning off the lights on a Mercedes without turning the engine off:

       Dude, the whole thing is preposterous.  What you are saying is that someone so fucking stupid as to stop a car while being pursued by police then decides to stand in a light which not only reveals their position but also makes it so that they can't see to return fire...so one of these absolute morons somehow manages to evade the police after this incident in a city that has been completely shut down.  You are an absolute imbecile if you think that happened.

       Here is a plausible timeline:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Old brother and young brother are being pursued
       </li>
       <li>
        All the guns and/or bombs are in the trunk of the honda driven by young brother
       </li>
       <li>
        With adrenalin rushing and panicking, they pull over quickly
       </li>
       <li>
        older brother exits the mercedes as fast as he can and goes to the trunk, leaving the key in the ignition of the mercedes
       </li>
       <li>
        cops pull up and pin them down behind mercedes, unable to turn off the lights and pinned down behind the car with little place to go
       </li>
       <li>
        So, does older brother have the presence of mind to shoot out the headlights in the middle of a firefight that he has never experienced before? Questionable
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This is just one plausible sequence of events that could have lead to the lights remaining on. They also could just be dumb as rocks and never even considered the lighting.

       Plausible?  You've been watching too many hollywood movies.  So let me get this straight - they are both being pursued by cops driving two separate vehicles on streets that are otherwise empty.  They call each other on the cell phone and say something to the effect of "I don't think we are going to outrun them in our car, we better stop and have a gun fight."  So after they have a gun fight the younger brother flees on foot and evades authorities?  Is that right?

       Since we do not yet know the precise timeline of the events of the shooting, we do not know with any remote degree of certainty whether or not the police pulled up while they were transferring supplies or any number of plausible factors.

       No, just tell me how after this gunfight the younger brother got away in a city that was shutdown?  You weren't afraid of speculating in your previous post so lets hear your explanation for how this occurred.

       The city was not shut down at the time of the pictures. The shutdown happened after the shootout when police could all congregate and form a perimeter. He escaped on foot and was lucky enough to hide in the boat which was outside of said perimeter. If you listen to the police scanner, you can hear helicopter pilots complaining about it being too foggy to be effective at the time

       I suppose I could give you that.  There is still wiggle room after these pics.  But I don't think anyone would argue that there is much less now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you are correct.  The dash cams are what we should be demanding.  In fact, they should have been released prior to the Martial Law beta (not that it would have justified it).

       The hard evidence is not the pics by themselves. It is the pics coupled with the eyewitness who took them who is a real person. He has posted his address, license plate number, friend's license plate number, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       To fake a shootout with 2 men that looked like the brothers on a public street with probably 100 cops, explosives going off, etc would be a HUGE undertaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying the powers that be couldn't pull it off but we should be able to poke holes in it somewhere if it was staged no?
