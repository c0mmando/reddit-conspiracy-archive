        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Historically speaking, we are all well aware that conspiracy theories of their day, 9 times out of 10 become facts/lessons to be taught to the next generation. That&#39;s the malevolent duality of the democracies that have been established in the modern era. There is an illusion of freedom, which is much more powerful to those on top than an actual whim of freedom. </p>

<p>When fiscal assets (ALWAYS the reason) need to be protected, stolen,   destroyed, etc. there is a surefire way of obtaining the public&#39;s support     in order to act on these wants. If there is no covert way to obtain what the government is looking for (seen in the establishment of CIA, MI6, etc) they will need public support to successfully accomplish their goals. </p>

<p>The Alamo: US built an illegal base, in foreign territory, was inevitably attacked, used the story to perpetuate the belief that the Spanish are evil, and used the story to eliminate them from Texas and gained the wealth of that land.</p>

<p>The USS Maine: sinking in 1898 was told to the public that it was a Spanish sea mine, to this day the true cause is still not understood but we do know it was an internal explosion (so no Sea mine) in the munitions bay.</p>

<p>Gulf of Tonkin: captain told Washington he was shot at, never happened, LBJ committed hundreds of thousands of troops and military tech to Vietnam</p>

<p>Now we get to the present..</p>

<p>9/11: still a touchy subject in the hearts of many, this is a perfect example of what it would have been like back in 1898 (or any of the past examples for that matter) if you were to have claimed the sinking of the USS Maine was a conspiracy. People would have disdain towards you in the same exact manner that people do now if you claim 9/11 was a conspiracy. There will be a day when this is accepted as a False Flag to place a massive military presence in the middle east to protect oil reserves and build a pipeline through Afghanistan.</p>

<p>--- That is the whole construct of false flags; the media puts the story out, controlled by the companies that own them and are gaining from both the coverage and the event, then people accept it because we all believe and are told to believe since kindergarten that we live in a free country, of honest and true patriots, and that our enemies are attacking us. Who would think the greatest government on Earth would attack its own people? Then those conspirators are deemed as lunatics, the pain and suffering being the buffer that the media uses to quiet the conspirators beliefs. (Explained: If you are a conspirator, regardless of how much evidence you actually have obtained, the media and public silences you and condemns you for speaking out because it will &quot;harm the families and people&quot; already affected by the tragedy, a flawless plan to keep doubts in the &quot;crazy and heartless&quot; category.</p>

<p>This will happen again. This will always happen as long as mercantile democracies exist.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just FYI the Alamo was built by Catholic Spanish missionaries in the 1700s. Your statement that &quot;US built an illegal base, in foreign territory, was inevitably attacked, used the story to perpetuate the belief that the Spanish are evil&quot; shows how little you understand Texas history. For example, the Texas revolution wasn&#39;t against the Spanish. Mexico had already fought and won their independence from Spain. You have no understanding of the history you are pretending to be an expert on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US government or military did not &quot;take&quot; the Alamo. You make it sound like the US conducted a military invasion of Mexico, took the Alamo and then stole Texas.</p>

<p>Your post is the worst bastardization of Texas history I&#39;ve ever seen. It bears practically no resemblance to the truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Alamo: US built an illegal base, in foreign territory, was inevitably attacked, used the story to perpetuate the belief that the Spanish are evil, and used the story to eliminate them from Texas and gained the wealth of that land.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The US didn&#39;t build the Alamo. They did not capture or occupy the Alamo. The Alamo was built by Spanish missionaries. The battle there was part of the Texas revolution against the Mexican government by the people who lived in Texas. Most of the revolutionaries were American settlers in Texas. Some were European. Some were Mexican.</p>

<p>The battle of the Alamo was fought by 100 defenders. From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Alamo">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Alamo</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In terms of ethnicity among the Texian defenders, 13 were native-born Texians, with 11 of these 13 being of Mexican descent. The rest of the Alamo defenders consisted of 41 men born in Europe, 2 Jews, 2 blacks, and the remainder were Americans from states other than Texas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason the Alamo became such a rallying cry is because the Mexican commander did not just attack and take over the Alamo but he also killed every person in it. No prisoners were taken. This was seen as unnecessarily cruel.</p>

<p>As for the reason for the revolution that same page says :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Under President Antonio López de Santa Anna, the Mexican government began to shift away from a federalist model. The increasingly dictatorial policies, including the revocation of the Constitution of 1824 in early 1835, incited many federalists to revolt.[5] The Mexican border region of Texas was largely populated by immigrants from the United States. These were accustomed to a federalist government and to extensive individual rights, and they were quite vocal in their displeasure at Mexico&#39;s shift towards centralism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the Texans won the revolution Texas became an independent country. It was not until years later that it became part of the US.</p>

<p>So to sum up the US government did not build a base on foreign lands that was &quot;inevitably attacked&quot;, and the story of the Alamo was not a US government propaganda method to create hatred for the Spanish. Basically nothing in your post about the Alamo is true. For a subreddit that is supposedly about exposing &quot;the truth&quot; there&#39;s a lot of crap that gets upvoted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being that this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> I have to theorize, there may still be one regarding the Alamo and all that entails.</p>

<p>Perhaps President Antonio López de Santa Anna was &quot;influenced&quot; into making this anti-federalist policy change in order to set this whole thing into motion.</p>

<p>A devious way into securing the land for America.</p>

<p>Let it start of as an independent country, and then unionize the fuck out of it like every other territory they&#39;ve ever got their greedy hands on.</p>

<p>This is all just theorizing based off of zero evidence though so nobody take any of this seriously, it&#39;s just a could be possibility with zero proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re attacking the symptom and ignoring the disease.  It&#39;s far more difficult to attack the root cause.  Blaming the government for these woes and pointing fingers at false flag operations, real or hypothetical, is not a winner script.  It&#39;s blaming higher powers from a low vantage and begging to overthrow them.  This is folly because it leads to the same thing, it&#39;s step one of the same cycle.  The root cause that allows people to think they are above the law isn&#39;t government, it&#39;s power.  And right now, power goes to those with money.  It seems to me that one either has to fundamentally debase the notion that any one man can have power over another (unlikely, as government is a necessary evil in some sense) or one must find an alternative to money.  Because right now, money runs government, and money decides what the laws will be.  If you want sea change, you&#39;re going to have to redefine the economy, and make it so that the people with power aren&#39;t the ones who are rewarded for malignant, cutthroat, greedy behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understood.  And yes, that&#39;s a good call out.  Law <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be power, law should be judicial extension of ethics.  In practice.  Unfortunately this becomes something else.  Personally I don&#39;t distrust the government as a rule or as some choice.
