       The thing that catches my eye most of all is the relevance and timing around American interests and agendas at the time of these incidents.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         We're in the middle of the CISPA bill when the Boston Marathon gets bombed.  Authorities could claim that they need this bill to monitor online activity of suspected terrorists...in the wake of terrorism.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Newtown shootings happened at the height of the gun control issue.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         9/11 happened when America had an interest in the Middle East, and opened the door for an American presence there.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The curious timing of these events raises the biggest flags for me, and warrants the most answers.  I'm not saying that these were done for those reasons, only that I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case.  No trolling here, but I haven't really heard this mentioned anywhere.  Maybe I haven't dug deep enough into this subreddit.  What are your thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's healthy to remain skeptical, but remember to stay within reality.

       During the J.F.K.Presidency, one of Kennedy's advisers suggested that U.S. operatives fake a terrorist attack to use as an excuse attack Cuba. Kennedy rejected the idea, but it's entirely possible that other presidents have not.

       "One aspect of Operation Northwoods involved the proposed hijacking of an American passenger plane. The JCS proposed that a real plane containing American passengers would be hijacked by friendly forces disguised as Cuban agents. The plane would drop down off the radar screen and be replaced by a pilotless aircraft, which would crash, purportedly killing all the passengers. Under the plan, the real passenger plane would be secretly flown back to the United States.[12]"

       That is sort of the point he is trying to make, that Newtown lead to an increased awareness of the issues surrounding gun control, which used correctly could be framed in an either pro or anti way depending on who wields the mass power i.e the media/ corporation/ powers at be. Thats the underlying theme for all of the discussion here is that with the right information framed in the right way you can produce any result with the masses if they are ignorant to the original truth.

       He phrased it as though it was odd, or "coincidental." But it's not unexpected to have gun control debates after a shooting. The post seems to imply the shooting happened because gun control was on the table.

       So when bad things happen, other things are also happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 300 million people in the country, 7 billion in the planet.  Any time any event is happening, there is going to be something else going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every day when there isn't some major catastrophic event, there is also some major political discussion/topic going on.  That's why there is a brand new newspaper every day. Because there are lots of things that happen every day.

       Agreed. I don't know that they were caused by the government, but I also don't know that they weren't. Lack of evidence for one does not prove the other. Like I say, though, the timing of the incidents is what always threw me. It's just so coincidental and convenient.

       The U.S. has had an interest in the Middle East for many decades. For example, President Carter
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Doctrine">
        declared in 1980
       </a>
       that "an attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force."

       I think you're on the right track, Marcusg1984, but I want to take this a few steps further.  What we're dealing with here, I believe, is nothing but a trail of breadcrumbs left by shadow government hirelings that is intended to lead you to such relatively "safe" conclusions.  Gun control? War in the Middle East? Terrorism? These are all red herrings.  The real issue is the extraordinary "heterophobia" at the highest levels of the one-world government that currently directs most of the events that happen on a daily basis.  Ever since the outing (no pun intended) of McCarthy and the failure of the "lavender scare" to remove individuals with same-sex (male) preferences from the American foreign policy bureaucracy, the homosexual (male) rights movement became increasingly visible.  However, this too is a distraction:  like the gay cabal that controls the curia in Vatican City, the actual "closeted" world leadership secretly detests real "out" (open) homosexuals as weak or effeminate.  This is the point that Jerome Corsi has missed in his earnest and honest attempt to "out" the current president (Obama, see
       <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2012/09/claim-obama-hid-gay-life-to-become-president/">
        http://www.wnd.com/2012/09/claim-obama-hid-gay-life-to-become-president/
       </a>
       ).  In short, nearly all of human events--all of human history--since the crucifixion of Christ have been dictated by a small but influential group of "closeted" men with same-sex intimate preferences.  This is a more or less self-evident truth, yet events such as this attack in Boston (possibly conducted on a soundstage, as with the Newton "shooting"; I wasn't there, so I can't speak to its authenticity or "provenance") prevent us from uniting with the true self-actualized "out" homosexuals who are dedicated to sexual liberation and thus opposed to the one-world fascist state desired by the current president (Obama) and priapic retreads like the Viagra-ingesting septegenarian ex-premier of Italy.
