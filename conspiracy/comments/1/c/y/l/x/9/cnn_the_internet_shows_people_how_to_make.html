Its almost like the news wants more attacks to happen so they can boost there ratings, but lets make sure to blur out blood stains and hurt people on there videos..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they should be telling people how easy it is to make one. For instance, when Doctor Oz says you can lose weight with anything they sell out.  These news stations reach a lot of people and I am worried that people will be more likely to make a bomb now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, the other day I was at my house, minding my own business. There was a knock at the door and to my surprise it was Obama! He said he had come to take my pressure cooker.
&quot;I was like WTF dude! I have rights!&quot; And he was all, &quot;LOL, chill out dude. I just want to borrow it to fry some chicken!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, I admit, The joke was stupid. Some jokes are. Who gives a shit.</p>

<p>How is this racist though? Is it because Obama is black? Is making jokes about black people in-of-itself racist? Are we just not allowed to mention our president in a joke now because he is black? Maybe we should just ignore him?</p>

<p>Oh, I get it... It&#39;s the fried chicken thing... But wait... Fried chicken isn&#39;t a race. Oh, and I happen to like fried chicken too. So, If I made a joke about a white dude who likes fried chicken you&#39;d get your panties in a bunch about that as well, right?</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s not it... What is it then... Hmmm... Oh, OK you&#39;re one of those guys who thinks shoving a big stick of political correctness up his ass makes him intellectually superior to everyone.</p>

<p>Good luck with that, I&#39;m going to go eat some fried chicken now. Hope that doesn&#39;t offend you too much.</p>
