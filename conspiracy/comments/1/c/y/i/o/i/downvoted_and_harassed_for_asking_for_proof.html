I&#39;ve been a long time lurker, but only just posted in this sub recently due to what&#39;s been going on.</p>

<p>I asked for some proof in a few topics and either got flamed, down voted, harassed or more commonly ignored by the people I asked.</p>

<p>Surely it&#39;s in this subs best interests to provide some kind of evidence with claims that are made by individuals?
Wouldn&#39;t that lead to more people believing, more people giving their input and also spreading the word?</p>

<p>Surely posting personal opinions that are claimed to be &quot;facts&quot; will only have a damaging affect on this sub?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it only a matter of time before some one discovers something but fails to provide proof and it gets ignored?</p>

<p>It&#39;s in the best interests of this sub to spread the word and open peoples eyes (Which wont happen if no evidence is used to back up claims), surely the Sheeple are those that swallow things without any evidence?</p>

<p>Genuine interest (Before I get called a Shill/Troll/Informant/Working for the FBI, CIA and Government)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s take a look at the top threads this week on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;4chan spots a suspect&quot;, who&#39;s totally unrelated to the 2 main suspects: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1chjy8/4chan_spots_a_suspect/">www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1chjy8/4chan_spots_a_suspect/</a></p>

<p>&quot;They&#39;re trying to ban blackpowder&quot; (ie.

<p>&quot;4chan solved the bombing&quot;, ie they think the security agents are the bombers (and btw you can buy a <a href="http://co-store.com/craftgear">Craft cap on their website</a>) <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1clmie/4chan_solved_the_boston_bombing/">www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1clmie/4chan_solved_the_boston_bombing/</a></p>

<p>3 of the cops are actors. But if they need actors, it means the explosion never happened, right?

<p>12th post this week: suspect didn&#39;t bleed in the boat.

    <div class="md"><p>I liked the picture of people waking up and the 60 minutes thing even though they don&#39;t technically belong in this sub. I probably wouldn&#39;t have seen them otherwise. Everything else that has been crazily upvoted this week is such crap. It pisses me off because people will believe anything if it fits their narrative, and what&#39;s worse is they will spread these lies/misinfo to anyone who will listen. At first, the internet was a great tool for conspiracy theorists. Now, it&#39;s being used against people searching for the truth by spamming false/dis info with up votes and convincing well meaning people its true. Before long, conspiracy theorists are lumped in the same category as holocaust deniers, and anyone going against the official story is just &#39;crying wolf&#39; and will be immediately dismissed as crazy. Ugh.</p>

<p>I want a new &#39;conspiracy&#39; themed sub, where people with opened minds can rationally discuss current events and post related art and anything else they feel is relevant. Sure, there would be trolls, but <em>anything</em> is better than what this place has turned into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it happens all the time. You&#39;re usually told to &quot;google it&quot;/&quot;do your own research&quot; (lol), or you&#39;re accused of being a shill (because, you know, only a paid government agent would try to disrupt a peaceful circlejerk like that).</p>

<p>It all comes down to the fact that, at the end of the day, many (that means: probably most) people here would like this subreddit to be an easy way to affirm already existent opinions. I guess it gives them a feeling of assurance. Interfering with the circlejerk is seen as a threat to that.</p>

<p>Please refrain from asking for sources (and from applying any other shill tactics) the next time. Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>edit: watch as the shills swoop in on this thread... they want this to be a front pager... I caught it on the new queue and almost thought the op was genuine</strong></p>

<p>You ask for proof in a meaningless way. Someone says that we&#39;re all being monitored on this website, if he had proof he&#39;d provide it. Why not just take it with a pinch of salt and move on, or disregard it.</p>

<p>You ask for proof that the &quot;brothers&quot; were being groomed by the FBI, obviously there&#39;s no more &quot;proof&quot; than the media story of them being in contact with the FBI years prior, or else we&#39;d all be talking about <strong>that</strong></p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like it leave it alone, instead of obnoxiously asking &quot;got any proof&quot; &quot;got any proof&quot; surely if you had any brain at all you&#39;d realise there&#39;s nothing to achieve. <strong>If there&#39;s proof, people will provide it</strong>, now and then when people like to <strong>make conjecture based on history or personal inclinations, let them</strong>. A real truth-seeker can infer which is which, you make a fool of yourself by pretending that you don&#39;t know any better.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t even find many examples of you asking for proof, but clearly you&#39;re just here to stir up argument by pretending that your preferred manner of discourse should be the one and only. Do you think anyone will care that now you&#39;re getting up on the cross and acting as if you&#39;ve been wronged in some terrible way? Sadly some people might indeed care, but if they do they&#39;re as bad as yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not at all.
Like I&#39;ve said in other topics, I want to hear the evidence and form my own opinions. I some one says &quot;The fact that the brothers were groomed by the FBI&quot;, leads me to believe that they have some solid damning evidence, I ask for that (Because I haven&#39;t seen it anywhere) and it either gets ignored or down voted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me see... no-one is allowed to make any extraordinary claim on this forum, instead they have to provide only objective proof and allow you to make up your own mind otherwise you will get mad and make a crybaby post about it.</p>

<p>If these claims don&#39;t come with proof, if they don&#39;t seem to make any sense to you, it might well be conjecture based on the (folk/alternative) history of intelligence agencies, or any number of other things. One must do one&#39;s own research, when solving the crypto-field of modern sociology and geopolitics or whatever one calls it, you really can&#39;t expect to have it handed to you on a plate.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it only a matter of time before some one discovers something but fails to provide proof and it gets ignored?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is really confusing because, it is possible someone could post a very compelling discovery and it would get ignored by someone demanding proof....that would be you.  </p>

<p>If someone is claiming a fact, you should definitely ask for proof because the burden of proof lies on those who declare not those who deny. But this is a place where people came come and express their personal opinions and discuss alternative explanations. You don&#39;t have to have proof to do that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that completely, the problem is that they don&#39;t make it clear that it&#39;s their opinion when they use the word &quot;Fact&quot; very very loosely. </p>

<p>Surely people will ignore some one that doesn&#39;t provide proof (E.g. some one outside of this sub looking in) and it all just gets brushed to the side as crazy talk, rather than being addressed as it should?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you are correct. Asking for proof should not get you downvoted. However if you are seeking the truth. Then downvoting shouldn&#39;t really matter right?</p>

<p>Facts by evidence should be posted, but facts can be manipulated by the perspective of how one wants to read into it. You just have to use your best discernment in deciphering the evidence.</p>

<p>You see I have a problem about crises actors on the Boston Bombing. However I don&#39;t need a lot of evidence that the rights of the 4th amendment were clearly violated by the Police state mentality. The pic ( if it&#39;s still there at time of reading)on the right says it all.</p>

<p>Juries can be deceived through deceptive evidence as facts in a court of law by DA&#39;s. Many criminals convicted of murders  have served lengthy guilty sentences in the past. Some have now been exonerated because new evidences such as DNA have shown they were not guilty. However due to corrupt evidence they lost many years of their life in the shit hole of a jail cell.</p>

<p>Some truths can at times be really a lie in wolves clothing, and it works both ways be it OP&#39;s on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, or <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, or <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> or the government itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I love that the recent influx of people due to the Boston events has brought a lot of (justified) scepticism into this place.
