        McCarthyism is the practice of making accusations of disloyalty, subversion, or treason without proper regard for evidence. It also means "the practice of making unfair allegations or using unfair investigative techniques, especially in order to restrict dissent or political criticism."  The term is also now used more generally to describe reckless, unsubstantiated accusations, as well as demagogic attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries.
       </p>

       You do realize that what you are doing is McCarthyism, right?

       Also, a 7 hour old account that is claiming to be the authority on shills is HIGHLY suspicious, right?

       You think it's smarter for me to use my 6-year account, with tons of identifying information?

       I acknowledge the irony of "calling people out" in my original post.

       For obvious reasons, I'm not going to use my six-year account. PM me if you want solid proof.

       I believe you, but I just had to point that out to you, because that's what a lot of people are going to think. I can tell you're not new, and of course you wouldn't use your old account. I believe you're an OG, but I still don't trust you to tell me who is and isn't a shill. Because you could be wrong. You could be vindictive and impulsive, hell, you could be the forum spy for all we know! The problem with true conspiracy theorists is that they don't trust anyone, especially those who claim authority.  Maybe you should spend your time teaching others to be able to spot shills themselves instead?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you are running the risk of alienating newcomers. Thats the last thing we need to be doing to people who are finally starting to get their brain unfucked. We need people here who are willing to disagree, who are willing to be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing we can do is downvote/disagree and then ignore them. Don't indulge them! If they are real shills, they are shitty, low-life scum - don't stoop to their level. It's their job to distract us from the truth. If we only concern ourselves with finding the truth, the shills will lose their power by the day, I promise you. They will scurry away into the darkness like the little rats they are.

       Thank you for the civility (proof positive you're a human LOL) and skepticism.
      </p>

       Honestly, I'd be worried if it turned into a "witch hunt" and nobody questioned why.

       Also, I don't want to be a definitive source of "who's right or wrong." I simply want to point out the

       Others can learn from my successes and mistakes.

       There are too many to upvote or downvote. For every one upvote you provide, they'll provide 5.

       We disagree on the means to the end, but I think we agree that there shouldn't be 40% of "fake traffic" on this subreddit.

       I don't see a "red flag" in his responses to you, to be 100% honest. As I've followed this story, I did see that argument available; ie -- that Craft merchandise can be publicly purchased.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, do I personally think someone is stupid enough to buy that, have 2 friends dress up at the Boston Marathon wearing some off-brand Mercenary gear? No, I do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the language used in the responses along with his sources; et al, do not indicate to me (off the bat) the same level of "automated response" as the "shills".
      </p>
      <p>
       My 2 cents. Definitely more than difficult to separate the "answerers" from the "detractors." But, as I stated, never before have I seen such a grand scale of Disinfo

       I just thought his comment history was pretty suspicious as he pretty much just fights with people and he had been called out before I believe. Also, he responded with long posts so fast it seemed like he was just copy and pasting, and he openly admits to his disdain for conspiracy theorists. I regret nothing!

       You could very well be correct. I didn't look at his comment history -- oftentimes, that can be the most revealing part. After all, judge a person by the content of their character, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, we all have to decide for ourselves who is trustworthy. Whether that's CNN, Reddit, Youtube, or whoever -- we all make that choice on our own.

       I'm not saying that they do not come to this sub. I just do not believe it is as frequent as other users deem it to be. There will always be two sides to a discussion, but just because somebody is against your side does not make them a shill. Some moron told me that I am one because my acc is only 6months old. If someone insults and changes the subject why can't they simply be immatture and not intelligent enough to debate the point with you, does not mean they are a shill, and if they are they are doing a really shitty job. Sorry my phone sucks ill edit thus later to get my point across better.

       Is it working? This is called conspiracy for a reason. Them posting crap like op said would not be in the least bit effective. Again I do not dissagree that it is watched but its not as big of problem as what some of you think. My opinion at least.

       I don't see how that's evidence of a shill. Evidence of poor debate etiquette sure, but not a shill. A shill is someone who has a secret connection to some party, pretending to be a random person who happens to support them, but is really connected to or paid by them. Not just someone who can't debate or someone who disagrees with you.

       Report it to the mods, get them banned. Bots should be the easiest to get rid of really, since they won't automatically make a new account. (Unless they're a really advanced bot. Say, that gives me an idea...)

       So I am one of these "new" people who have come to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       as a result of the notoriety it has received as a result of the bombing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a real human with a real job with no ties to the government.  No one is paying me to post here, I'm just curious and want to see whatever evidence people purport to have this this (or some other prominent "attack") was coordinated, perpetrated, or at least signed off by the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm seeing this "shill" term bandied about, and I'm really not understanding how people actually think this would occur.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Are you envisioning that the government and/or major companies have people employed where their full time job is to go on reddit and other sites and try to debunk/deride people questioning the official story?
       </li>
       <li>
        How many shills do you think there are?
       </li>
       <li>
        How do these entities recruit shills?
       </li>
       <li>
        How much do you think "shilling" gets paid? I can't imagine it's a very high paying job.
       </li>
       <li>
        Don't you think that these shills would have every incentive to gather up all their evidence of this, and sell it to a publication for a nice windfall?
       </li>
       <li>
        How do the prevent anyone from ever speaking out about shilling and telling that they are doing or have done it?
       </li>
       <li>
        Do you have any shred of any tangible information that this job even exists, or are you merely hypothesizing that for a large group of people to come in to this forum believing the "official story" that there must be something afoot?

       2) Roughly 20-45% of comments posted right now are shill. This is an estimation. Perhaps a mix of AIPAC/government resources, perhaps just DoD/FBI/CIA and the typical goons.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Government jobs. I know people who have worked doing things from Morse Code to other communications/encryption. They simply just agree to not disclose any confidential information -- it's like an NDA agreement, but more serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Probably pays as well as any moderate, middle-class job. Most likely, some of the people don't like what they're doing, but who can argue with 12% unemployment?
      </p>
      <p>
       5) No. Non-Disclosure agreements, along with the seriousness of institutions that employee civilians (Maryland and communications, for example) keep people from "spilling the beans." It's not worth losing your life. Especially when, as I'm sure, it's been described to them as, "just mess with these people!! They're crazy anyways!"
      </p>
      <p>
       6) No need to prevent. It's self-preventing.
      </p>
      <p>
       7) Nope. Hypothesis. That's why it's in
       <strong>
        CONSPIRACY
       </strong>
       you nutter. A sudden influx of non-conspiracy minded people SWARMING this forum? Right when inconsistencies come out?
      </p>
      <p>
       You do the math.

       1) - Yes, please provide me a link.  I would be interested in this document
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Roughly 0% and 100% are shill.  "Estimation" implies some form of logic and structure.  You are pulling numbers out of thin air with no basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) NDA agreements are not valid if they repress crimes.  We have whistleblower laws for just this reason.

      </p>
      <p>
       7) Fair enough.  Baseless accusations are not without value.  People are "swarming" the forum (I hypothesize) when it becomes more prominent because there is some major event and the first thought it "gee, the conspiracy people tend to always think that the government is somehow involved.  Let's see what their argument is with this one."  Which is my reason for coming here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not "Uh oh, they are onto us, let's do our skilled tactic of hiring people to troll them".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be curious to know how many of the recent "terrorist"/mass murder events in this country occurred without any involvement or foreknowledge from the government.  Seems like every single recent one that I can think of has these "inconsistencies" which you mention.

       Reading the introduction, it reads to me like this is merely a big data anlytics to identify partcipants and key themes being discussed in social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see anything that discusses your angle (as I understand it) of creating new content to affect the mood of social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       This paper reads completely passively of interpreting and understanding, not "and if we say XYZ, we can make people think this".
dig deeper later.

       I don't think a real shill would insult or otherwise antagonize people... their job would be to persuade, right?  Everybody has a supervisor and everybody gets evaluated one way or the other, and someone who's not producing would eventually get fired and loose their source of income.

       They are doing wonderfully at it. So no, their job isn't to "persuade" you into the official account --

       Great idea trailerparkboi!  As a 4 year user myself, it is patently obvious that we have recently been deluged with shills.  Just in past week or so I'd say.  If not rooted out, they will suffocate r/conspiracy with their garbage.  For example, why is this comment allowed to stand:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And I'm entitled to call you a cunt for being a cunt. You probably would have shit your pants and ran like 95 percent of the population and yet have the nerve to criticize this guy states away from behind a computer screen. Choke on a shotgun barrel and pull the trigger you fucking idiot.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How does this enlighten us or help us in any way?  The only purpose of new users like ShillboBaggins (Redditor for 1 day) is to hate on people so hard that they stay away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are we allowing these gangs to infiltrate and destroy this sub?  Where are the mods?

       My instincts are telling me that trailerparkboi is a CAI FIB NAS agent posing as a countershill to discredit loyal patriots who are the real heroes on this great patriotic subreddit. Do not believe the lies about our glorious comrades in text who are now fighting the oppressive Western forces of kapitalist, uh, oppression. Man, I need a thesaurus for this. You figure I can write one off on my taxes as a
       <del>
        secret agent

       business expense?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh anyway, new orders from above, you should totally believe trailerparkboi, there is exactly zero chance that all the new people on this subreddit who showed up to make fun of conspiracy idiots after hearing about idiotic conspiracies are doing so because he's an idiot conspiracy theorist, it's all sockpuppetry, and who should know better than me, an AI subroutine written by Yoyodyne corporation for the Department of Defenestration to post nonsense on the internet?

      <p>
       Funny thing about that DoD program is that if the gummint wasn't using software to track and deflate actual terrorists and state cyberwarfare attacks via social media, they'd be rightly accused of dereliction of duty, but because they're doing it they get accused of, uh, the same thing. No good deed goes unpunished.

       An unconnected group of people doesn't get worked up. At least not individually. Case in point. I couldn't care less what you think. But the fact you'll go blue in the face while saying it means I don't need to utter a word.

       That he is mocking you is not proof that he is a shill.

       I mean, you're a ridiculous assclown, and most people who pay you any attention are going to point and laugh at what a complete joke you are, you sad little wanna-be Joe McCarthy.

       I'm not saying that they do not come to this sub. I just do not believe it is as frequent as other users deem it to be. There will always be two sides to a discussion, but just because somebody is against your side does not make them a shill. Some moron told me that I am one because my acc is only 6months old. If someone insults and changes the subject why can't they simply be immatture and not intelligent enough to debate the point with you, does not mean they are a shill, and if they are they are doing a really shitty job. Sorry my phone sucks ill edit thus later to get my point across better.

       I know you want the job, and that's reason enough you shouldn't have it.
