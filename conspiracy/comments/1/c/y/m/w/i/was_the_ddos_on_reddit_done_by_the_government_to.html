       Though I feel like the FBI would be able to bring much harsher attacks on reddit, it seems odd that at the same time as the police scanners were noticing the public listening in and reporting online and cutting chatter, and mods were blocking posts from the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously some of that could have been just from the natural influx of people to reddit, which as noted by the reddit blog, was more than even when the President was doing his AMA. It just all seems pretty convenient (in how inconvenient it was for us, trying to get and pass information), and I was hoping people had looked into this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally have no skills technologically speaking, and was wondering if there was any way to corroborate other than wild speculation.

       Alex Horan, senior product manager at Core Security, said the important point about DDoS is the initial 'D' for Distributed. In other words, Reddit could not easily distinguish between legitimate traffic  and attack traffic.

       The peak of the DDoS attack measured
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1cyfrk/ddos_dossier/">
        400,000
       </a>
       requests per second, and that was only what they were able to measure. Quite possibly the largest DDoS Reddit has ever seen. I don't know much about this subject but is it that simple for a prankster to pull off an attack that large? Or would this require superior knowledge, understanding, and resources to accomplish?

       Thank you for phrasing my question better! I remember the "largest" attack between spamhaus and cyber bunker... but I have no idea how to compare the two. It's just the first time I'd seen reddit claim a "malicious" attack, and it was strange it was coming at the same time as all the focus on the manhunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...though, I suppose if I were someone trying to take down reddit for non-censorship reasons (ie: some rival site, or individuals wanting to make a big splarsh), starting the DDOS during all the spike in attention would be smart too.

       Yes, massive resources. Actually very sloppy in that respect. They must have pulled out all stops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then after the snow cleared, the target data was gone. I theorize that the DDOS was the obfuscation and/or blocking access of sensitive data.

       FBI came on record stating that the internet shouldn't do detective work for them and we should all JUST rely on their "official information".
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth of the matter is, the internet pinned the real bombers (covert op agents) and was developing hard evidence against them... there was a flurry of traffic towards reddit (+4chan) as it was gaining media attention for its work. If people were flocking to reddit and they saw the real bombers the entire 'official story' would've been compromised... so they resorted to the largest DDoS in reddit history to turn off people from having an interest in the developments.

       the only thing everyone remembers is "the boston bombing tragedy" and of course there's also notion that "islamic teenagers" are deadly and the FBI is force to be reckoned with when they go out to 'serve justice'.

       I think this is a real thing. It was definitely a glitch in the matrix.

       They were definitely obfuscation something, DDOS does not happen that frequently, and the fact that they do not publish evidence of them placing the bomb is telltale to me that there was likely something entirely separate going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I came here looking for this and I found it, therefore I'm not crazy. I don't think we can really discuss this in a public forum like reddit either. Obviously they are watching and data mining.

       I never expected such a glitch in the matrix though. 
Just like the movie.

       It's clear that the government doesn't trust the public with the internet, and the reddit efforts to share information about an event that the feds did not want public involvement in (they shut down an entire city for pete's sake), clearly constituted a violation of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The snooping didn't surprise me: the technological capabilities to store that much information did. To me, it seems like it would be easy for the government to mobilize enough infrastructure toward crippling reddit as users tried to make people aware of something the government wanted control of how it was disseminated/interpreted.
