    <div class="md"><p>Look. I agree that the entire Boston <em>event</em> is fishy, to say the least. And I&#39;m with a lot of conspiracy theories that arose during the past week and a half. And I have also verified the identities of a lot of the accounts that were shilling for the government. Feel free to browse through the comments I made in the past if you question where I&#39;m coming from.</p>

<p>But the difference between you and I is that I have the courage to put my main and <em>only</em> Reddit account on the line -- my actual Reddit identity, if you will -- to state my claims. I don&#39;t go around posting through throw-away accounts, being afraid of what people -- or the government, for that matter -- will think of me if I say what&#39;s on my mind.</p>

<p>The reason America is in the state it is in right now is because despite the fact that a lot of people are noticing that something really fishy is going on lately, they are too afraid to stand up and demand the truth from their government. They prefer to sit in silence for the rest of their lives, knowing that they&#39;re being lied to continuously, but being too afraid to stand up and shout because of the fear of what will his or her peers think of them. The media has conditioned people to believe that conspiracy theorists are all a bunch of nutcases, and that the government and mainstream media is being as transparent as possible.</p>

<p>So stand up for what you believe in, no matter how crazy it may sound, even if you are the only one screaming it... because you never know, you might actually be the only right person in the crowd. </p>

<p>It happens all the time, people like to promote free thinking and discussion here, but as soon as someone doubts a conspiracy, they are a shill, sheeple, you name it. </p>

<p>It seems like every time something happens in the world, people flock here to post about it being a conspiracy, and that is okay. But, just because you think it is a conspiracy doesn&#39;t make it true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think doubting a conspiracy makes anyone a shill, or that this is the point of the OP.  Most of us don&#39;t mind open and honest debate.  I think the people he&#39;s talking about are actually shills and trolls that have no desire to express their doubts, but spend the majority of their time insulting, name calling, and implying people are crazy for entertaining the thought that our government could possibly be involved in anything so evil.</p>

<p>Yet our government has proven time and again that it does indeed participate in false flags (you can debate which events, but not the use) to further an agenda.  </p>

<p>I always promote discussion (cause everyone has a right to their opinion), and I never downvote people who express doubts. I only downvote the obvious shills and trolls (which their are a lot of recently).</p>

<p>A false flag is used to take away our rights even in your example how did that take away your rights?</p>

<p>This was used as a test. The american people would clearly give up their constitutional rights, have guns pointed at them and THEIR FAMILIES.</p>

<p>All in the name of the greater good.</p>

<p>The &#39;Evidence&#39; you are blind to was all over the main stream media broadcasted by everyone!</p>

<p>A false flag is an inside job used to take our rights away or frame another country etc. Just read the wiki page pull your head out of your ass and learn something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) This is a conspiracy forum on the fucking internet in the year 2013. You should never be taking anything anyone says at face value. If you have not, by now, calibrated your bullshit filter and learned how to read between the lines, you deserve to be swirling around in a vortex of paranoid delusion.</p>

<p>2) Constantly freaking out about possible shills and pointing out why you think they are shills does exactly two things. First, it creates hostility and paranoia. Second, it teaches the shills how to better blend in. Neither of these things are productive. </p>

<p>If you see what you think may be a shill, shut your cakehole, tag them, compile a list and share it with other people you trust on here and move on to the next post.</p>

I don&#39;t care how long you have had an account on reddit.  I want to be able to sort through the evidence  myself and draw my own conclusions.  I can read comments and decide who a shill is or not.  And who cares?  We all know that disinformation campaigns are all part of the game.  I have seen more posts at the top of the page regarding topics on shills than I have about the recent subjects that have brought us all together to this subreddit.

<p>Edit: Let me just ask you directly, since your account fits the so many others I&#39;ve noticed. You made the account a few days ago, and most of your posts have been in r/conspiracy. There&#39;s a few posts in the regular ol&#39; reddit forums like r/funny and r/gaming...posts not very thought out, just kinda chiming in. But 90% of your posts are devoted to the Boston thing, including several posts to another thread claiming the same thing I am here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets see, in the last week there was a MAJOR terrorist event. During that time lots of sites were screaming False flag, conspiracy theory. Google searches for false flag were through the roof last week.</p>

<p>If you think its a false flag, that is a conspiracy, ergo people come to the conspiracy board.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how I got here, I did not use a different account, but I probably should have.</p>

<p>So what is the more logical scenario that because of more intense media pressure more people came to this subreddit and since there is quite a bit of acrimony here created an anonymous account to post here without hurting the integrity of their main reddit account.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>There is a team of bitcoin funded government shills going from message board to message board spreading disinformation and finding those who are on the right path and discredit them, harrass them until they move of their line of questioning. </p>

<p>SERIOUSLY: you asked Why do you think there are so many acccounts around here that are new.  I don&#39;t know maybe more people found this subreddit, see all the crap in the comments and don&#39;t wan&#39;t that on their main reddit account?</p>

<p>but no that&#39;s too easy its a government conspiracy to discredit this subreddit cause its obviously on the right trail</p>
