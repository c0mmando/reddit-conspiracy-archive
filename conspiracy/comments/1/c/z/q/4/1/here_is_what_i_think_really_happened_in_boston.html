        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Tamerlan loved to box and loved America so much so that he was &quot;willing to box for passport&quot;. In 2011 FBI contacted Tamerlan and questioned him about his 6 months long trip to Russia due to an official request that came from FSB</p>

<p>Since Tamerlan was a person interest to FSB and because of his ethnic background (Chechen Muslim) FBI decided to recruit him. Tamerlan agreed and was officially recruited by FBI in 2011.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2013. FBI contacts Tamerlan and asks him if he and his brother could help FBI with an anti-terrorist drill that would take place on 15/April/2013.</p>

<p>Tsarnaev brothers are to carry fake explosives provided by FBI in their backpacks while attending Boston Marathon. FBI told Tamerlan that they wanted to see whether police with their sniffing dogs and national guard would be able to catch terrorists with explosives during the marathon. After some time if police failed to catch brothers they are to make a drop and leave their backpacks at certain locations.</p>

<p>FBI reassured Tamerlan that in the event that he or his brother get caught, FBI would immediately step in and they won&#39;t have to worry about getting arrested. Tamerlan agrees to help FBI.</p>

<p>Monday – 15/April/2013. Tamerlan arrives with his brother to Boston Marathon. Both are carrying backpacks with what they believe are dummy explosives. </p>

<p>Tsarnaevs are in good mood, Tamerlan feels like he is a special agent 007 helping America, Dzhokhar  is just happy to be there with his older brother on this secret government mission.</p>

<p>As soon as brothers arrive, FBI starts to collect evidence by filming them and taking pictures. Brothers walk around for a while. Everything is as expected: police is there with sniffing dogs, so is national guard. Moreover, police is constantly announcing on the loud speaker that they are conducting a bomb drill and that there is nothing to worry about. Everything is going according to the plan.</p>

<p>After sometime, seeing that the police were unable to catch them, Tsarnaev brothers move to the final stage - the drop off. Tamerlan and Dzhokhar leave their backpacks at predetermined locations. Every step they make is filmed and photographed by FBI.</p>

<p>That said, at least <em>his</em> narrative is coherent. The meta question to the BMB situation we have now is: </p>

<p>&quot;Why are so many questions being asked when everything was caught live on TV?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And how is that any different from the 3-day long circlejerk on Reddit about the Boston bombings and shoot-out? I was reading literally hundreds of responses where people were taking small bit of data fed to them by the media and then weaving them into elaborate fictional scenarios.</p>

<p>Here is a good question: <strong>What was the evidence shown to the US public to initially support the idea that these two were the bombers?</strong></p>

<p>And don&#39;t waste your time writing to me about what happened afterwards. If the government were orchestrating a massive cover-up and pinning terrorism on two innocents, you cannot predict whether they would run or turn themselves in. And don&#39;t bring up the &quot;bombs&quot; or shootout with the cops because that could also be fictional. </p>

<p>The US government is the most powerful agency in the world, they aren&#39;t amateurs. And I am not saying this is an conspiracy, but if it were, don&#39;t insult the public&#39;s intelligence by suggesting the government couldn&#39;t doctor photos and fabricate evidence of a shoot-out. Seems easy enough for Hollywood.</p>

<p>And just to reiterate: <strong>What was the evidence shown to the US public to initially support the idea that these two were the bombers?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is quite a pickle. Not only am I to account to you, I&#39;m required to do so without discussing what happened. You pose a tough question, but we disagree on why it&#39;s difficult. You consider it good. I consider it very poor. Off the top of my head I can only think of one query even worse that illustrates why: What evidence have we been shown that alive41stime is not the bomber?</p>

<p>Both questions have identical answers: Absolutely none. Moreover, those answers result from the same reason. Law enforcement does not operate by consulting an applause meter. (This is by design.)</p>

<p>Might I suggest you find a way to assist Tsarneav&#39;s lawyer? The state will be required to establish guilt. Defense will get to examine everything and say &quot;untrue&quot; as often as they like. (This too is by design.)</p>

<p>I like this part.  Mainly because the Tsarnaev brothers seem so careless in every other facet of their operation, except for the bomb making, which would require a fair amount of planning and caution.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m hearing is that the bombs were detonated via remote control.  So it required more than just relying on a timer to complete a circuit.  Beyond that, they also attacked the race at the best time and area.  </p>

<p>&quot;These are literally the most amateur and unsophisticated devices that could still conceivably bear the name of &quot;bombs&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p>And yet they still performed to perfection and did a massive amount of damage.  As for bombs, you can make a pipe bomb with Baking Soda and Vinegar (unpredictable), or by wrapping battery leads around clock hands (unreliable).  Granted, making a remote detonated bomb doesn&#39;t take a genius.  But I&#39;m speaking of the whole Marathon phase of their plan.  It&#39;s like they prepared for nothing beyond that, and yet they had a cache of more bombs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If OP is correct I don&#39;t think the Feds would supply the brothers with actual bombs. Bombs would be planted by professionals. </p>

<p>The 7/7 London bombings also took place during a drill (shills will say &#39;yeah there are always drills at big events). If you look into the London bombings you will see that &#39;crisis management specialist&#39; and former soldier Peter Power&#39;s company were running a drill that day. </p>

<p>In his drill the bombs exploded not just in London but in the exact same locations. There are hundreds of rail and bus stations in London - his company&#39;s drill happened at the exact same three locations as his drill.</p>

<p>He gave an interview on radio just after it and admitted this (to be fair he was seemed as shocked as anyone.) </p>

<p>Radio interview: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGE9FiuM06o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGE9FiuM06o</a></p>

<p>Him being confronted: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29tzNXKUL-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29tzNXKUL-Q</a></p>

<p>Anyway, there is plenty of info on this online already. What I remember from the 7/7 bombings was that eyewitnesses described one of the bombers panicking and searching his bag before it exploded. </p>

<p>When the first bomb went off he probably knew he had been set up. My point is they probably wouldn&#39;t risk giving them bombs - particularly if they wanted them captured later. Other minor thing I remembered was that the alleged suicide bombers in London also bought return tickets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course not. But in reality these people <em>do</em> have the motivation, and in some cases even the means to carry out such an attack.</p>

<p>I remember back in 2010 the FBI had an informant infiltrate a mosque in SoCal using violent rhetoric. They called the FBI on him. That&#39;s what anyone would do in such a situation who genuinely didn&#39;t want to attack the US in some shape or form.</p>

<p>So anyways, the boston bombers are the first that the FBI actually let carry through on the attack?</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re saying his parents lied about their son&#39;s interests? If they lied about his hobbies how do we know they&#39;re not lying about the FBI visiting their son? Was the younger brother lying on his VK page where he lists Islam as a hobby? Did the older one not have <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/muazseyfullah/videos?flow=grid&amp;amp;view=1">playlists on youtube titled &quot;terrorists&quot; with videos of jihadist Islamic leaders preaching violence?</a></p>

<p>Where is the line drawn between MSM disinformation BS and conspiracy misinformation BS?</p>

<p>Do you ever think for yourself or is your world separated into black and white MSM news vs standard conspiratorial trash?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>..</p>

<p>Then the explosions happen... Tsarnaevs panic and quickly return to their apartment. Tamerlan calls FBI, he is worried, he is scared, he wants to know what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>FBI reassures Tamerlan that they have nothing to worry about. FBI is not sure what went wrong yet, however, Tsarnaev brothers are not suspects, they are safe and nobody will come looking for them.</p>

<p>After the call, Tamerlan calms down, he feels like everything is under control. He talks to his younger brother, explains him the situation. Dzhokhar is now relaxed too, “stress free”, so much so that he goes to a partly on Wednesday. The brothers are convinced that FBI got their backs covered.</p>

<p>Thursday night, FBI releases photos and videos of two suspects investigators believe are behind Monday&#39;s Boston Marathon bombing. Tsarnaev brothers see their photos on TV and are now in total panic mode. They realize that they were framed by FBI. They want to leave Boston ASAP. They quickly pack their bags, taking only bare essentials with them. Tamerlan also takes his legally registered pistol with him, just in case... </p>

<p>Brothers carjack an SUV using their gun and desperately try to escape from the city. Police quickly locates and surrounds them, Tsarnaevs initially try to surrender &quot;Chill out, Chill out, We did not do it&quot;, but police just won&#39;t stop shooting at them.</p>

<p>Tamerlan comes to a conclusion that cops want them both dead. In a desperate move Tamerlan opens fire from his pistol. He is then shot and killed in a gun fight. While this is happening younger brother manages to escape on foot into the dark.</p>

<p>At the same time 7/11 store is robbed. The robber is armed and dangerous. On his way out of 7/11 store he sees a police cruiser with officer Sean Collier. The robber opens fire and kills the police officer on the spot.</p>

<p>TLDR: Tsarnaev brothers were framed by FBI. After the bombings they were reassured by FBI that they had nothing to worry about. This would explain why Dzhokhar was so relaxed after the bombings. This is also the reason why Tsarnaev brothers did not try to leave the country right after the bombings. Finally, Tsarnaev brothers were not involved in the 7/11 robbery. It is the robber of 7/11 who shot and killed MIT police officer Sean Collier.</p>

<p>Show me a single piece of evidence that somehow depicts what the two brothers were thinking, and why. Explain to me how this is <em>not</em> just fiction.</p>

<p>For people so concerned with questioning things and being skeptical, you sure are extremely quick to accept anything and everything that just so happens to confirm what you want to believe.</p>

<p>Just a few days ago I was in a store and overheard a clerk tell another clerk &quot;Those boys did it &#39;cause they&#39;re Muslim.

    <div class="md"><p>This country is supposed to be a Christian one, but most Christians are unfortunately hypocrites and only Christian in name, rather than practice. The media pretty much dictates what Christians should believe this has led to Christians to deviate <em>very far</em> from the teachings proclaimed in the Bible.</p>

<p>That said Muslims tend to be the most devout towards Allah (God) - most devout Muslim prays frequently and strive to lead a life that aligns with teachings in the Koran.  Muslims, as a result, have been hard to &#39;brainwash&#39; into American culture which, if you haven&#39;t noticed already, is trying to run away from God. </p>

<p>These devout believers of God are being labeled as extremists and radicals primarily because they are so had to influence and manipulate, unlike most Christians. This has prompted <em>those in power</em> to take an easy way out and Muslims as terrorists in the public eye -- this has prompted the masses to believe that the practices and beliefs of Muslims <em>(practices which are nearly identical to Christians minus some minor details)</em> are unjust and should be shunned...</p>

<p>As you have seen, these &#39;Islamic terrorists&#39; have went from &#39;extremists&#39; who &quot;fly jets into buildings&quot; to teenagers who &quot;bomb&quot; innocents... the people are conditioned to believe that there might be terrorists everywhere and anywhere and they give up constitutional rights and privacy to &#39;prevent future attacks from the practitioners of a faith&#39;... </p>

<p>This repeated condition also provides grounds for the US government to go out and invade other [middle eastern] countries, declaring a War on TERROR (Muslims)...  politicians profit, soldiers die, gas prices remain high, corporations profit and the people remain unsafe.</p>

<p>Since Americans are incapable of thinking for themselves,  this bull shit will carry on till they become absolute slaves to those in power</p>

<p>Despite there being too many unanswered questions in their case, I don&#39;t feel there is enough compelling evidence justifying a false-flag. </p>

<p>On regard to their <em>life-style</em>, one misconception of terrorists is that they are all poor and iliterate, which is wrong, most, specially those in <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2049646/The-middle-class-terrorists-More-60pc-suspects-educated-comfortable-backgrounds-says-secret-M15-file.html">western coutnries (60%) are actually from the middle class, with good/stable familial background and quite sociable</a>, group which the Tsarnaev&#39;s fit quite well.</p>

<p>Again, the only conspiracy I see is the expansion of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19914763">Saudi Salafi / Wahhabi influence, ideology and above all financial support throughout the Muslim world from the US, to Chechenya all the way to Bhurma.</a> All the while the US, and even most recently <a href="http://www.dw.de/germany-mulls-new-tank-deal-with-saudis/a-16425587">Israel, treat these Saudi kingdoms as close allies.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those <em>extremist</em> sites and forums / communities (inside vk.com) were specifically for terror groups inside the speratatist Chechen republic. </p>

<p>The surveillance system enacted by the DHS is so overflooded by information that they just can&#39;t track or obtain any reasonable conclusions from it. There have been some implemantations of <em>organizational algorithms</em>, as posted here before, but its a long way from <em>Person of Interest</em> style <em>Minority Report</em> dystopic future, specially when in a language not monitored by the system; Chechen.</p>

<p>And this is ignoring the possibility that the departments aren&#39;t caught in some sort of in-fighting for resources / attention / oversight. With the implementation and re-arrangment of departments post 9/11, Homeland Security, I doubt egos haven&#39;t clashed with older departments like that of Justice, mainly the FBI, or Military, or even the CIA, which is independent. The Petraeus scandal comes to mind, how much of it was intentionally provoked, FBI vs. CIA ? How much information is actually and effectively shared between all these departments, all conducting their individual <em>secret</em> investigations, many times unbeknowingly on the same subjects.</p>

<p>The younger brother was always very sociable and likable, hence the brainwash theory MSM is taking hold of. Many consider the older Tsarnaev responsible as he was the one being monitored by the FSB, and possibly the FBI, and his story is more consistent of the <em>downward spiral</em>, distanced himself from family and friends, aggressive Muslim ideologies took hold of his life-style, trips to Chechnya, sites visited, etc...</p>

<p>Thanks. My statement still stands. I was wrong that his interview was written but he has only spoken anonymously (understandably so as he&#39;s probably super shaken up).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Furthermore, I see a lot of people theorizing that someone how it involves gov&#39;t entities in their entirety. That&#39;s way too big, its way too complicated. What we saw in Boston is merely the state&#39;s reaction to a real life situation, I believe the injuries were real, to think they weren&#39;t is ridiculous. Everything was very real, not entirely scripted, if at all. The only thing I know to be scripted is the media, what they tell you, and what they don&#39;t. a popular blackout of CISPA, the money behind it, you couldn&#39;t tell me that there isn&#39;t money behind CNN and FOX not reporting it. Now to say that a very small circle of individuals could have &quot;coerced&quot; these two unfortunate SOBs into creating  that situation for a much larger, purpose, ie. Control, profit, probabale cause for this new CISPA bill, even - now that, I could believe.</p>

<p>Does commenting here mean you must be a conspiracy theorist? Or could I perhaps channel that skepticism and questioning towards <em>conspiracies</em> as well?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Insights</em>? Really? It&#39;s a work of fiction. It &quot;explains&quot; what happened about as much as the Lord of the Rings &quot;explains&quot; why the elves disappeared from Middle Earth. It is complete speculation and conjecture crammed in between certain real events, for the purpose of shoehorning a conspiracy into a place where a conspiracy doesn&#39;t actually fit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You missed out the fact that Tamerlan&#39;s closest friend, and 2 other people, had their throats slit and cannibis trashed all around the scene of the crime back in 2011/11. No money was taken ($3000 found at scene). That kind of crime is committed by someone who has all the drugs and money they need. It&#39;s committed to instill fear and force compliance.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/boston-bomber-slit-throat-best-1848615">http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/boston-bomber-slit-throat-best-1848615</a></p>

<p>They say he didn&#39;t attend the funeral despite being very close. Perhaps this was him being pressured to become an asset. If that is the case then the younger brother wanting to defend him to the death would be understandable.
This also ties up with him become more unstable (if we are to believe the news reports on that aspect of his character).</p>

<p>If the FBI/CIA were working with FSB then the boys would do anything to avoid being deported to be &#39;cleansed&#39; by the russians who view the chechyns as a disease.</p>

<p>If the brothers seemed relatively relaxed perhaps it was they had been promised that this was a one time deal. No mention of explosives. More likely a drug drop off for cash. </p>

<p>You ammateurs need to realize that cultivating and turning assets is not as simple as just asking some kids to help out on a bomb drill. No offense. But you guys need to think like you don&#39;t give a shit about your own brother or nephew or mother and then you will begin to think like the people who control us from the shadows.</p>

<p>Just you don&#39;t see the potential scope in this picture.</p>

<p>Without a doubt there were at least two factions deep within the government vying for first place in some twisted plot to control us. There are the soft team (no shrapnel - crisis actors - placed well behind people - intent to limit damage) and the don&#39;t give a fuck team (shrapnel - narrow street placement - fuck the victims).</p>

<p>So no the boy weren&#39;t asked to run around with bombs to see if the dogs could sniff them out. Please.</p>

<p>You should be asking the following questions.</p>

What it does not explain is the younger brother attending a party and some of the younger brother&#39;s messages on twitter concerning explosives in August plus his remorseless messages after the event. It is still possible, with the level of electronic and physical surveillance conducted by multiple agencies, that they simply sat on the perfect egg until it hatched, in order to have plausible deniability while still being able to exploit the event for unfavorable political and social purposes. </p>

<p>Though, I still imagine that most surveillance agents are so over-flooded by information that they&#39;re unable to keep track of everything, and considering how possibly the Tsarnaev&#39;s communicated or even obtained their information through non-English channels (Chechen language), it isn&#39;t hard to believe that the info was simply ignored by these agents.</p>

And after that is when Dzhokhar took his <em>fake</em> guns and shot a campus police officer, then threw <em>fake</em> bombs at the police chasing him, then had a <em>fake</em> shoot-out with police in the boat, then was caught, and <em>never said a word about being framed</em>.</p>

<p>Yep, makes complete sense.</p>

<p>Either that, or he was an easily influenced idiot who was convinced by his more radicalized brother to go through with this attack, and never expected to get caught (just like a lot of idiot criminals don&#39;t).</p>

<p>The evidence points to him being stupid. It <em>doesn&#39;t</em> point to a secret FBI plot to set them up. Why are you inventing narratives not supported by the actual evidence? Are you <em>trying</em> to find ways to shoehorn a conspiracy into the facts, as opposed to doing it the other way around?</p>

<p>Absolutely, but then again, in a court of law I think the evidence that exists is <em>way more</em> than enough to convict him. However, the absence of the evidence you claim is <em>not</em> enough to warrant belief in any far-fetched conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Exactly, and I think during or after the trial, more than enough evidence will be released to convince anyone he&#39;s guilty. However, I doubt there will ever be <em>any</em> actual evidence to support this theory that they brothers were innocent FBI recruits.</p>

<p>If he believed he was working <em>for</em> the FBI, and wound up being hunted by the police, of course he would try to clear his name. He would believe it was a mistake, that he had the backing of the government for what he did. Remember that there were a couple of days <em>before</em> they were even the prime suspects. A couple of days for two people to realize something had gone horribly wrong with the &quot;anti-terrorism drill&quot; they thought they were part of, and they did... nothing? They neither ran <em>nor</em> turned themselves in to explain? An FBI agent does that?</p>

<p>And when the FBI <em>did</em> implicate the two brothers, they did not what any innocent person would do, which is either turn themselves in or <em>just run</em>, but instead chose to become violent, shooting police officers, and throwing bombs and IEDs out of their stolen car.</p>

<p>What? Again, if they didn&#39;t actually <em>have</em> real bombs, how the hell did  two <em>innocent</em> FBI recruits end up with guns, bombs and stolen cars? This theory doesn&#39;t explain that. In fact, it blatantly ignores it, just like it ignores everything else that doesn&#39;t fit the narrative. Find the few pieces that support this story, and ignore everything else = conspiracy theory.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because it wasn&#39;t &quot;taken from him&quot;, his throat was damages. According to reports, he <em>can</em> speak, just not very well and quite likely not without a whole lot of pain. He can also write, <em>has</em> written, and has in fact carried out interviews with the FBI.</p>

<p>How are <em>you</em> so conveniently ignoring all that? How are you ignoring everything that goes against this story, and only accepting the few, thin parts that could possibly support it?</p>

<p>None of this makes any actual sense. None of it explain the behavior of the brothers, in fact only makes it even <em>more</em> mysterious. None of it explains the bombs, in fact only makes <em>larger</em> gaps in the story rather than fill the gaps in.</p>

<p>It&#39;s reaching for the facts that support the theory, as opposed to finding the theory supported by the facts.</p>

<p>Exactly. So why would they run, knowing it would do nothing but make them look guilty? Had they <em>not</em> run, but rather turned themselves in, they could have pointed to all the obvious circumstances defending their innocence, rather than shattering every last doubt by attacking police in the most violent way possible.</p>

<p>Had they gone to the police right afterwards, claimed they were innocent and explained how they had no ties to any extremists, no bomb-making material (again, the bombs they had were given to them, right?) and no reason to do it, would the FBI declaring them guilty not be seen as <em>more</em> suspicious than it is now?</p>

<p>You tell me: if they were merely <em>given</em> bombs they thought were fake, how did they get their hands on identical bombs that were <em>real</em>? Where did they get guns and IEDs? This is a <em>massive</em> hole in the theory that you&#39;re just conveniently ignoring. There is <em>absolutely no reason</em> for them to be having real bombs and explosive if they were innocent FBI operatives planting &quot;fake&quot; bombs in a training exercise.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Selective acceptance of facts, only the facts that support <em>your</em> theory is reliable. Confirmation bias, any new evidence will be considered BS <em>unless</em> it confirms your theory.</p>

<p>Since the government has mind control technology, did the bombing and subsequent events even happen at all!? Maybe it&#39;s all a mind-trick!?</p>

<p>Dismissed for no other reason than that it just doesn&#39;t confirm to the theory <em>you want</em> to believe is true. Awesome. It <em>has</em> to be a conspiracy, so anything pointing in any other direction is <em>obviously</em> fake, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I&#39;ll see if I can answer some of your points from my understanding of this theory.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t flee Boston straight after the bombing because they talked to the FBI (as stated by the Mum) and were told that things went horribly wrong but don&#39;t worry as the police know it wasn&#39;t their fault.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t shoot the cop, that was done by the 711 robbers (There were initial police reports of the shooter being a black male).</p>

<p>They never said a word about being framed as they didn&#39;t realise it until after the photos came out and freaked out. </p>

<p>They threw bombs and got into the shootout as they realised the cops weren&#39;t on their side and were freaked out. Where would they go if the police told everyone that they were the bombers? They knew there was photo evidence of them planting the bags. They knew the police weren&#39;t on their side and had just set them up as terrorists. They saw them as the reason for all this. Why would they think they&#39;d be treated fairly if they turned themselves in? </p>

<p>They stole the car cause their car was in the shop. (Why put the car in the shop if you were about to bomb something.) There has been no interviews with the carjacker, only relayed storied through the FBI.</p>

<p>They stole cash either cause their accounts were frozen by the cops or they were poor and didn&#39;t realise they needed cash prior (same as why the car was in the shop)</p>

<p>Were they throwing bombs? The only evidence retrieved from their house was a &#39;large pyrotechnic&#39; and the fireworks company they bought it off said they had bought a $200 set recently. Were they bombs they were throwing or just big fireworks? </p>

<p>The gun could have been for any reason. He&#39;s an agro guy. Lots of people have a gun. The weapons they were reported to have used to include a machine gun and now only includes a handgun. What happened to the machine gun? Why did they take a BB gun with them? The shootout only shows one gun being shot. Why wouldn&#39;t they use all their weapons?   </p>

<p>Dismissal of confession only cause it doesn&#39;t conform to conspiracy theory. Fair enough but that works both ways. </p>

<p>Mind control? Fuck that. That&#39;s crazy talk! </p>

<p>It&#39;s out there. Absolutely but somehow it seems to fit the provable facts. Somehow. </p>

<p>[No, it wasn&#39;t]</p>

<p>Someone else referenced the FBI-terrorist-entrapment thing, but the major difference is that in the official versions of this, the FBI gave people <em>fake</em> bombs for them to use in <em>real</em> terrorist attacks. Now, suddenly, the FBI gives a <em>real</em> bomb to people who supposedly believed the were working <em>for</em> the FBI as part of an exercise. What was the purpose of killing a bunch of people in order to implicate two brothers who&#39;d done nothing wrong, who supposedly didn&#39;t even have <em>plans</em> to do anything wrong?</p>

<p>Another <em>major</em> hole in this work of fiction that no one even bothers trying to explain. In this story, there&#39;s even <em>less</em> motive than in the official version. The FBI gained <em>nothing</em> by doing all of this. There are no calls to invade Chechnya, no calls to limit Muslims or Islam in particular, and if it was all just to enforce gun powder limitations or bans, wouldn&#39;t it be a <em>lot</em> easier and cheaper to just lobby politicians like everyone else?</p>

<p>This story does. not. make. sense. None of it. All it does is use conjecture and speculation to invite <em>more</em> conjecture and speculation, until the brothers were actually lizard people from Mars trying to entrap the FBI through a reverse conspiracy, all of it on direct orders from L. Ron Hubbard. This &quot;theory&quot; ends nowhere, explains nothing, and serves <em>solely</em> to engorge the egos of the people who want everything around them to be a conspiracy.</p>

<p>There&#39;s multiple stories about him getting in arguments with his uncle, at the mosque, domestic violence record, etc. Being an angry guy doesn&#39;t stop people getting guns. It never will (although a domestic violence record probably should). There&#39;s no word on whether the gun was legal or not so how he got it is up in the air.</p>

<p>It fits the facts if you ignore most the police narrative. There are gaps in all accounts of what happened. What happened when Tamerlan went to Russia? That gap is filled in with talk of him being radicalized but with only circumstantial evidence. Why did Jahar go along with it even though he seemed so chilled out by all accounts? Supposedly his brother talked him into it being a terrorist even though he showed no signs of anything to anyone else in his life. </p>

<p>Another major hole in this work of fiction that no one even bothers trying to explain. In this story, there&#39;s even less motive than in the official version. The FBI gained nothing by doing all of this. There are no calls to invade Chechnya, no calls to limit Muslims or Islam in particular, and if it was all just to enforce gun powder limitations or bans, wouldn&#39;t it be a lot easier and cheaper to just lobby politicians like everyone else?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the same major hole you pointed out in the last paragraph :) Some people will probably say the whole NWO world government thing. It could be simpler and just be to make money or a fucked up few agents who want their section to get more power and funding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This story does. not. make. sense. None of it. All it does is use conjecture and speculation to invite more conjecture and speculation,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s speculation. The title of the thread is &quot;Here&#39;s what I think really happened&quot; not &quot;Here&#39;s what I can prove happened&quot;. It&#39;s an attempt to connect the dots that are the undeniable facts (e.g. they were at the bombing, they had backpacks on before but not after, they didn&#39;t try and leave town for 4 days, they then carjacked a car, they were chased by cops, they got in a shootout, one got killed, the other is captured) and to piece it together in a different way that doesn&#39;t take the word of the government as fact. It&#39;s more plausible than other theories as it admits that they were the bombers and the entire official narrative of after the carjacking fits. It&#39;s mostly just trying to piece together the motive which is officially pretty nebulous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>until the brothers were actually lizard people from Mars trying to entrap the FBI through a reverse conspiracy, all of it on direct orders from L. Ron Hubbard. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about Hubbard but the whole lizard theory thing is fucking funny. David Icke believes it so hard it&#39;s amazing to watch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This &quot;theory&quot; ends nowhere, explains nothing, and serves solely to engorge the egos of the people who want everything around them to be a conspiracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you strip the whole incident back to the first principle provable facts you realise that there aren&#39;t actually that many of them. It&#39;s just interesting to try and piece them together in a different way. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that one! You realise that claim backs up this theory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Precisely. One <em>claim</em> from a clearly non-objective person, devoid of any facts to support it. It only backs up this theory if you <em>decide</em> it does, because you <em>need</em> the theory to be true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Supposedly identical bombs and IEDS. No evidence that they were identical. Assumption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No evidence they were <em>not</em> identical, plenty of reports that they were. There were even photos that <em>people here</em> agreed showed something very similar to the &quot;pressure cooker bomb&quot;.</p>

<p>You&#39;re picking and choosing evidence based on what you want to believe. That&#39;s the wrong way to go about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They knew that there was evidence that they planted the bags. They knew the FBI had double-crossed them and told everyone they were terrorists. Who do you think the police was going to believe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again with the completely fantasy. &quot;They knew&quot;? They knew what? And how do <em>you</em> know what they knew? This is just inventing stuff as you go along, in order to prove a theory you&#39;ve already decided is right.</p>

<p>There is <em>nothing</em> to indicate the police had been told anything by anyone. Any claim to the contrary is entirely without merit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agreed. I wasn&#39;t just fingered for terrorism and triple murder though and being hunted by the entire country. Panic is a crazy thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nor were they, because there&#39;s no reason whatsoever to make that assumption. The evidence points to them being guilty, and reacting the way they did <em>because they were guilty</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agreed but they went through with the plan anyway without organizing secondary transport until nearly a week later. Rookie mistake? Probably. The plans changed on them after the marathon happened? Maybe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most likely. There&#39;s no reason to come to any other conclusion at this point. Unless you invent a story that shoehorns a conspiracy into all of this. But we wouldn&#39;t do that, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s always a reason to buy fireworks. Also, maybe the FBI were coaching him. Who knows? I wouldn&#39;t want to make up any conjecture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you wouldn&#39;t, so no on both accounts. The evidence points to them planting bombs, filled with the explosives they would have gotten from the fireworks they purchased. The most logical explanation. This fantasy narrative requires a <em>lot</em> of random chance, or far-fetched reasons for the FBI to tell them to buy fireworks. The simplest explanation is the currently official one, that <em>doesn&#39;t</em> require a whole lot of shoehorning to make some conspiracy fit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s multiple stories about him getting in arguments with his uncle, at the mosque, domestic violence record, etc. Being an angry guy doesn&#39;t stop people getting guns. It never will (although a domestic violence record probably should). There&#39;s no word on whether the gun was legal or not so how he got it is up in the air.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, it should. And there&#39;s at least one gun that was purchased legally, from what I&#39;ve read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It fits the facts if you ignore most the police narrative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly, and <em>why would you</em>? Unless you&#39;ve already determined that the only acceptable theory involves a conspiracy, and proceed to pick and choose the facts based on that assumption. There&#39;s no actual cause to ignore the police narrative, is there?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are gaps in all accounts of what happened. What happened when Tamerlan went to Russia? That gap is filled in with talk of him being radicalized but with only circumstantial evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the word of a mother living halfway across the word is taken for truth, but the word of the uncle who was <em>actually there</em> with Tamerlan and his new friend (&quot;Mischa&quot; or something like that, I think), shouldn&#39;t be believed? It was his uncle&#39;s house he lived in!</p>

<p>Again, you&#39;re picking and choosing evidence based on what you <em>want</em> to believe, not on what&#39;s actually credible and likely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did Jahar go along with it even though he seemed so chilled out by all accounts? Supposedly his brother talked him into it being a terrorist even though he showed no signs of anything to anyone else in his life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jahar was, by <em>all</em> accounts, very easily influenced by his brother, and his sister (blood bond!) describes them all changing their opinions based on what Tamerlan thought. There are also reports that he <em>did</em> have somewhat radical Islamist ideas, even if he didn&#39;t speak about them in the open with his friends.</p>

<p>Time will tell, and at some point we&#39;ll have all the evidence presented. At this point, however, <em>once again</em>, there&#39;s no reason to discount these arguments unless you&#39;re intent on proving a conspiracy theory at all costs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Money? Extra powers? Rogue agents? Motives are fragile things and all speculation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. So why invent one only for the purpose of supporting a theory you&#39;ve already decided must be true? Why not simply accept that there <em>is no</em> motive, that we have seen <em>no result</em> of this supposed FBI operation, and that for all intents and purposes, it <em>didn&#39;t happen</em> that way?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What was Jahar&#39;s motive? Even his written confession is about Tamerlan&#39;s motive rather than his.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above. Not all crimes have motive. That he was simply influenced by his brother, as well as his religion, is not at all unlikely or impossible, and is just as reasonable an assumption as any other. It also fits with the facts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s the same major hole you pointed out in the last paragraph :) Some people will probably say the whole NWO world government thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Inventing stories to prove a conspiracy you&#39;ve already decided is real.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It could be simpler and just be to make money or a fucked up few agents who want their section to get more power and funding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or it could be <em>even simpler</em>, and didn&#39;t happen that way at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s more plausible than other theories as it admits that they were the bombers and the entire official narrative of after the carjacking fits. It&#39;s mostly just trying to piece together the motive which is officially pretty nebulous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Piecing together&quot; something requires having pieces. This story doesn&#39;t. This story <em>invents</em> the pieces as it goes along, then puts them together, and no one is surprised they suddenly point to a vast, motive-less conspiracy on behalf of a major government organization.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a conspiracy for the sake of a conspiracy. It&#39;s not trying to find out what <em>actually</em> happened, it&#39;s <em>only</em> meant to prove a conspiracy, whether one happened or not.</p>

<p>Agreed. A lot of the evidence is from a uncorroborated single source. e.g. the confession to the anonymous carjacking victim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No evidence they were not identical, plenty of reports that they were. There were even photos that people here agreed showed something very similar to the &quot;pressure cooker bomb&quot;.</p>

<p>Have you seen <a href="http://www.getonhand.com/blogs/news/7743337-boston-bombing-suspect-shootout-pictures">the photos</a>? I think it&#39;s pretty hard to say that whatever he threw was identical to the marathon bombs. You&#39;re complaining about speculative narrative yet there&#39;s no way you can be sure that they are <strong>identical</strong> with this photographic evidence. Considering there was talk of them having multiple guns including a rifle and now that&#39;s changed to a single handgun I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s enough evidence for the specificity of this claim.</p>

<p>That&#39;s an interesting point as some are saying it would be enough but the <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100668244">fireworks VP says it wouldn&#39;t</a>. The articles saying it would seem to be newer than the fireworks VP&#39;s statement.</p>

<p>Uncle Ruslan wasn&#39;t in Russia so his word is very good but still circumstantial. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__MQsec6jJQ">the original Ruslan interview</a> he states that he hasn&#39;t seen the brothers since December 2005 and they never lived with him.</p>

<p>This story has pieces. They placed the bombs. They carjacked the car. They shot at the police. There are some very fragile pieces (the FBI phone call, for example) to be sure and it could crumble very easily but it does have pieces. Like I said, there are periods of time and motivations in the official story that have been filled in with &quot;invented narrative&quot; too. Simply because it&#39;s believable doesn&#39;t make them any less &quot;invented&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The important difference being that the carjacking victim <em>was there</em> and has no emotional bond to the suspects. The mother <em>was not</em> there, knows nothing about what actually happened, and speaks solely from her <em>emotional bond</em> with the suspects.</p>

<p>Do you see how one is perhaps quite a bit more relevant than the other? And how it&#39;s extremely suspicious that people are instantly accepting the word of someone who, again, <em>was not there</em> over the words of people who, again, <em>were there</em>? It reeks of attempting to prove a conspiracy by selectively ignoring evidence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But it&#39;s certainly more reasonable to conclude that the item they are <em>expected</em> to have is the one showing in those photos. It&#39;s <em>unreasonable</em> to pretend it&#39;s something else, against all other evidence, for the sake of proving a conspiracy.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t tell you it&#39;s absolutely identical, but <em>in no way, shape or form</em> does it suggest it&#39;s fireworks either. There&#39;s <em>less</em> reason to think it&#39;s something other than the bomb, than there is to think it <em>is</em> the bomb.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agreed. Just the same as any narrative is doing when trying to explain what they were doing between the bombs and the carjacking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except that the FBI don&#39;t pretend to know what the suspects were &quot;thinking&quot;, nor do they claim things happened that there is literally not a scrap of evidence for. They stick to the facts, and simply explain that &quot;they went from here to here, they did this then that. Only the things which can be supported by evidence. They don&#39;t <em>invent</em> a story based on what they&#39;d <em>like</em> to be true and proceed to write fiction to fill out the holes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a stretch to think that the police believed that these were the terrorists based on the FBI&#39;s statements. Everyone else in the world thought that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what I meant. Even if they believed that, the brothers had no reason to expect them to be especially partial and unfair. What would be the easiest way to present the facts as to why you&#39;re innocent, even to police that have been told you&#39;re the prime suspect? Is it A) surrendering yourself and calmly stating your innocence, or B) shooting wildly, throwing bombs, and escaping in a stolen car?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll go with A, thank you very much.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All cases are a matter of &quot;inventing a story&quot; that fits the facts. It&#39;s similar to a scientific theory. You have all the observable facts and you &quot;invent a theory&quot; that fits those facts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow. No. Very much no. What&#39;s being done here is the exact <em>opposite</em> of a scientific theory.</p>

<p>A scientific <em>hypothesis</em> is an &quot;invented story&quot; that you proceed to test. The tests result in facts that either support or don&#39;t support the hypothesis. The facts, in turn, shape the theory. You then proceed to <em>falsify</em> the theory, meaning you attempt to <em>dis</em>prove it, not prove it.</p>

<p>Here, however, we have a bunch of people who start with the theory (it was a conspiracy!), cherry pick the facts to <em>prove</em> that theory (making absolutely no attempt whatsoever to <em>dis</em>prove it, in fact arguing with anyone who even tries), and lastly invent the hypothesis that would have gone about creating the evidence they claim supports the theory.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the exact opposite way of how you do science.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, you wouldn&#39;t buy fireworks for any other reason than making bombs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t go into a store selling fireworks a short time before being caught bombing a marathon, asking for the biggest ones they&#39;ve got, leaving with reloadable and refillable fireworks and then <em>not using them</em>. Is there any report of them <em>shooting</em> fireworks at any point between the sale and the bombing? Is there any evidence they still <em>have</em> said fireworks?</p>

<p>Of course there are endless <em>possible</em> reasons for buying fireworks, but that&#39;s entirely the wrong question to even ask. The <em>right</em> question is: is it <em>likely</em> that they bought it for some other reason, and if so, is there <em>evidence</em> to support it? The answer is quite clearly <strong>no</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can believe he was easily influenced by him but to become a terrorist because of him is a pretty extreme form of influence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, of course. To <em>be</em> a terrorist is pretty extreme to begin with. Are we saying terrorism as a whole is unlikely because it&#39;s extreme?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&#39;t heard their sister talk (didn&#39;t even know they had one) only older relatives. Link please?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t have the link, it was some story out of dozens I read yesterday. Sorry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe the FBI didn&#39;t need a motive then ;)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, more likely, they didn&#39;t do it to begin with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And neither is sitting back and reading the (constantly changing) official story off AOL each day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, because I&#39;m not qualified to find out what happened. I <em>know</em> that. I don&#39;t have access to all the facts (just like everyone here), nor am I a trained investigator. I trust those who <em>are</em>. I have no reason whatsoever to trust a bunch of anonymous people who are wrong 90% of the time, and happen to be right by mistake the rest.</p>

<p>Also, speaking of proper science, <em>changing</em> your theories as new facts arise is a hallmark of good science. The FBI investigators, unlike r/conspiracy subscribers, did not already decide what the official theory is and only attempt to find evidence to support it. They will change the theory based on the facts.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying that whether they <em>did have</em> automatic weapons or not, that was the intel the police had at the time, and what prompted their decisions. There were so many police, and police armed in that way, because of what they <em>believed</em> the brothers had, since no one actually knew.</p>

<p>and true. actually photos might become nearly useless considering the ability to manipulate them will be amazing and easily available. i can&#39;t believe the actor theory is a thing. it&#39;s the worst one and shows no sympathy for the victims at all. pretty sick really.</p>

<p>Yeah, I can&#39;t believe the emotional disability required to put such a thought into your head, not to mention maintain it against all known evidence.</p>

<p>Absolutely. They thought these guys had automatic weapons and grenades. No wonder they went a little nuts. </p>

<p>Exactly. It&#39;s intellectually healthy to not just blindly believe everything you&#39;re told. &quot;Don&#39;t believe everything you read in the newspaper&quot; is a well known phrase which people agree with and can extend to police statements too (it&#39;s not exactly unheard of for police to either get things wrong or actually frame people) but sometimes it&#39;s taken to a place that only mental illness can explain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Endimoniada, you make excellent points but it&#39;s not really worth engaging with dedicated circle-squarers like alive41stime. To a paranoid conspiracy theorist, facts don&#39;t matter. All real evidence points towards the theory, and all fake evidence points towards the theory, and when they conflict that is in and of itself is evidence for the theory, and when the fake evidence gets discredited, that too is evidence for the theory. Conspiracy theorists are immune to logic. If they weren&#39;t... They wouldn&#39;t be conspiracy theorists. So don&#39;t lower yourself to their level. Skewer and move on.</p>

<p>In that vein, I think it&#39;s important to note that the FBI has in the past given fake bombs to would-be terrorists. Which then didn&#39;t go off, because they were fake. And then the would-be terrorists were arrested and charged with attempted and conspiracy to commit w/e. Why, in the paranoid fantasy the OP envisions, wouldn&#39;t they have supplied the real would-be terrorists with real bombs? Why give fake bombs to real terrorists and then real bombs to fake terrorists? What kind of idiot would think hiring random bozos to plant fake bombs instead of trained professionals would be remotely plausible? What kind of idiot would think hiring anyone to plant fake bombs at a public event was remotely plausible? What kind of idiot would be framed and then make no attempt whatsoever to reveal the frame?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even a very interesting conspiracy theory. Why not just allege that both brothers are CIA/FBI/Mossad/KGB plants and they weren&#39;t even shot, they aren&#39;t really brothers, and also that the whole thing was masterminded by the frozen head of Walt Disney? As I like to say, if you&#39;re going to go retard, always go full retard.</p>

<p>In before I&#39;m accused of being a FBCINSA plant disinfo sockpuppet troll. Man, I wish, then at least I&#39;d be getting paid to argue on the Internet. I&#39;m actually posting from bed at home instead of sleeping for no good reason.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think we&#39;d all be better off if Reddit just deleted all conspiracy 9/11 truth chemtrail bullshit subreddits. But I guess then they&#39;d be all alone with themselves and nobody to even attempt to inject rational thought, so I dunno.</p>

<p>In conclusion, conspiracy theories are like nicotine patches. Just because you can apply them everywhere doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a good idea.</p>
