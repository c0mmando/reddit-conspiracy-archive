       welp, it's time to get out of here.  i can't exactly say why, but there is some weird shit going down and i don't want to be a part of it.  i have been a conspiracy theorist for the past 8 or so years.  ever since i got hoodwinked in court on a simple drunk in public charge, i began researching things on my own.  i began connecting the dots with my own research and, unfortunately, that brings the label of conspiracy theorist.  up until the boston bombings, i loved coming to this subreddit.  it let me know that there were people out there with similar trains of thought as my own.  i sometimes feel alienated from my best friends that i have known since elementary school because they have become sheep and cannot think for themselves.  that is why i loved this subreddit.  but now.  i don't know what the fuck is going on.  i feel like this subreddit is being attacked by shills and god dammit i'm a logical fucking person and i don't like being persecuted for simply looking at things differently than the story that is presented to us by the soul-sucking mainstream media.  i just read the olive garden thread and my mind is still boggled.  is that thread fucking serious? what the fuck is going on here?!  god dammit.

       I mean I guess leaving is part of catharsis. I just wanted him to take a lesson away from the experience after he left.  But then I thought about it and I don't really give a shit. I just wanted to use the word catharsis appropriately.

       i'm not saying i'm going to stop following my gut and doing my own research, but i think something is seriously wrong with this subreddit and it saddens me because for once i thought i was part of a group that had similar views.  catharsis is right.

       don't worry man. you have to keep fighting. There is nothing wrong with thinking and forming individual opinions and beliefs. The key is to support your claims with evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       2nd, with so many people in the world, many people simply rely on mainstream modes of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 or 6 companies own 90% of all media in the USA. That leaves only 10% independent sources, of which many never even take a look at. So when you present information that contradicts their beliefs, they are going to get defensive. Challenge them and give them the evidence. Show them the light and if they want to go back into the cave they can.

       There are those that dont want anyone to question anything. Does this mean that the ideas and theories posted here are all valid? No, but anyone who attempts to get you to not think at all, not question anything is your enemy. Regardless of their reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it is just an exercise in thought, a debate for both/any sides of what happens - you should always look at everything from every angle to understand the possibilities of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone is telling you to simply regurgitate what you are told, they are an enemy of your growth and your ability to think for yourself.

       I hear you when it comes to that olive garden thread. That really tripped me out. I'm Australian so I don't even know what olive garden is, although I have gathered that it's some smutty restaurant. There's still good content here, it's just scattered throughout all the dog shit. Having the subreddit full of ridiculous nonsense from time to time helps with your abilities to decipher what is good content and what is poorly executed shiilery. But still that olive garden thread was too much for me, I'm just going to pretend it didn't happen.

       don't be afraid. they get to you through fear . they feed off of fear. you keep doing what you do. and i also feel alienated from people..well i always have lol knowing that all as it seems but i understand. you realize the truth when you're alone the most. when it comes to your friends, don't mention it to them if it starts making them uncomfortable. all you do is you mention it to them, it plants the seed for thinking. If they're ready to know the truth they'll look into it more themselves when they're alone, if not then they'll just ignore and still be friends with you (good friends at least). again don't be a afraid. all will be well.

       Yea whats with the temporal value assigned to the "conspiracy theorist" state.  What the fuck is a "conspiracy theorist" anyways?  It sounds like a person that professionally creates intricate battles between good and evil in his mind and then believes them?

       I mean I guess leaving is part of catharsis. I just wanted him to take a lesson away from the experience after he left.  But then I thought about it and I don't really give a shit. I just wanted to use the word catharsis appropriately.
