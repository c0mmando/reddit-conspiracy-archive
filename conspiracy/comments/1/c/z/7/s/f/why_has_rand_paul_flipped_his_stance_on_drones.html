       Rand Paul was recently featured on
       <a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/04/23/ron_paul_fans_furious_over_rand_pauls_drone_flip_flop">
        "Fox Business" and was discussing drones.
       </a>
       While  discussing, he said "I've never argued against any technology being used when you have an imminent threat, an active crime going on," Paul said. "If someone comes out of a liquor store with a weapon and fifty dollars in cash. I don't care if a drone kills him or a policeman kills him."
      </p>
      <p>
       Really Rand? Keep in mind, for those of you who don't know, he was the man who had a
       <strong>
        13-Hour Filibuster
       </strong>
       over drone strikes on U.S. Soil. This doesn't sound like the Rand we used to know, which leads me to my next question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was Rand Paul just bullshitting the whole Filibuster event to gain the public support? Or, was he actually sincere about it. Did someone change his stance on it? Did someone scare him into supporting Drones over the U.S?

       Is it possible that someone has some dirt on Rand that could otherwise irrevocably destroy his political career? As far as I am concerned stating that it would be a good idea to have drones on patrol "kill a liquor store robber with a stolen $50" is about as far as a 180 flip as I have ever seen. Why would he change his mind so quickly and alienate his base?

       He still doesn't favor surveillance. I'm not particularly fond of drones either, but if it performs the same function as a helicopter would chasing a murderer down a highway, I can see where you might justifiably support it. The worrisome part is that fine line between being "out for a suspect" or patrolling for anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       People freak out on Rand for these things, but I'm okay with it because I tend to believe he's still the same person at the core, and is just avoiding the terrible slanderous headlines his father would draw by saying things like "We shouldn't have captured Bin Laden the way we did."
      </p>
      <p>
       Rand would quickly become irrelevant if he said this drone shouldn't have caught this guy. If you're gonna be mad at him, he had no good answer.

       What I'm trying to say is, I think he'd prefer to give the right answer more often, but if he answers like his dad, he'll go as far as his dad did. You know it's true, and he does too.

       Yes, it's disappointing to hear it, but I think if he were elected to the white house, he would be better on the issues than he campaigns.

       This is weird - I'm not quite sure what to make of it.  Yes, I expected him to eventually ditch that rhetoric when he got further ahead - but he hasn't really made much progress.  Now all the people who became interested in him because of the filibuster will lose interest and never come back.

       And for what?  So he can say the same things that everyone else did?

       I don't think his stance has changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've only listened to a few hours of his filibuster, but he states quite clearly throughout that he doesn't care if someone is killed who is in the process of committing a violent crime, and he is saying here, he doesn't care if its a drone or a police officer on the ground. He doesn't distinguish between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
       His point was more that it seemed as if drones were being used in a way that would be seen as wrong if it was a police officer, but somehow is being justified because it was a drone.
      </p>
      <p>
       So his point all along has been that a drone should be treated the same as a police officer. He wanted the government to state clearly that a drone wouldn't be able to kill a non-active combatant in the same way a police officer isn't able to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is never abouts drones vs not drones, it's always what they're doing, why and to who.

       I said this when he filibustered the last debate and got downvoted to oblivion. He's a politician and says anything which will gain him an advantage. He wants to be on the presidential ticket next time around and is doing what it takes.

       Rands filibuster was not about using or not using drones. It was about rather or not the president believed he possessed the right to kill non-combatant Americans on U.S. soil. I don't like the idea of drones being used in the U.S. for any reason,  so therefore I disagree with Rand on this.  He was, however,  the only politician that stood up and asked questions about the drones before it was too late for questions.

       80% of the people on reddit want to attack one another.  I love discussion, but I don't see a lot of it on reddit. It seems like the majority want to attack one another, some just want to agree with whatever is said, and others just want to make unrelated jokes.
