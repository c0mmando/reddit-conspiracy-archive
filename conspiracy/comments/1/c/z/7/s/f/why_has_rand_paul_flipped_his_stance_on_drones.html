        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">41</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-04-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/OrangeBananaFish.html">OrangeBananaFish</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Rand Paul was recently featured on <a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/04/23/ron_paul_fans_furious_over_rand_pauls_drone_flip_flop">&quot;Fox Business&quot; and was discussing drones.</a>While  discussing, he said &quot;I&#39;ve never argued against any technology being used when you have an imminent threat, an active crime going on,&quot; Paul said. &quot;If someone comes out of a liquor store with a weapon and fifty dollars in cash. I don&#39;t care if a drone kills him or a policeman kills him.&quot;</p>

<p>Really Rand? Keep in mind, for those of you who don&#39;t know, he was the man who had a <strong>13-Hour Filibuster</strong> over drone strikes on U.S. Soil. This doesn&#39;t sound like the Rand we used to know, which leads me to my next question. </p>

<p>Was Rand Paul just bullshitting the whole Filibuster event to gain the public support? Or, was he actually sincere about it. Did someone change his stance on it? Did someone scare him into supporting Drones over the U.S?</p>

As far as I am concerned stating that it would be a good idea to have drones on patrol &quot;kill a liquor store robber with a stolen $50&quot; is about as far as a 180 flip as I have ever seen.

    <div class="md"><p>He still doesn&#39;t favor surveillance. I&#39;m not particularly fond of drones either, but if it performs the same function as a helicopter would chasing a murderer down a highway, I can see where you might justifiably support it. The worrisome part is that fine line between being &quot;out for a suspect&quot; or patrolling for anything. </p>

<p>People freak out on Rand for these things, but I&#39;m okay with it because I tend to believe he&#39;s still the same person at the core, and is just avoiding the terrible slanderous headlines his father would draw by saying things like &quot;We shouldn&#39;t have captured Bin Laden the way we did.&quot; </p>

<p>Rand would quickly become irrelevant if he said this drone shouldn&#39;t have caught this guy. If you&#39;re gonna be mad at him, he had no good answer.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is, I think he&#39;d prefer to give the right answer more often, but if he answers like his dad, he&#39;ll go as far as his dad did. You know it&#39;s true, and he does too. </p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s disappointing to hear it, but I think if he were elected to the white house, he would be better on the issues than he campaigns. </p>

Yes, I expected him to eventually ditch that rhetoric when he got further ahead - but he hasn&#39;t really made much progress.

<p>And for what?  So he can say the same things that everyone else did?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think his stance has changed.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve only listened to a few hours of his filibuster, but he states quite clearly throughout that he doesn&#39;t care if someone is killed who is in the process of committing a violent crime, and he is saying here, he doesn&#39;t care if its a drone or a police officer on the ground. He doesn&#39;t distinguish between the two.</p>

<p>His point was more that it seemed as if drones were being used in a way that would be seen as wrong if it was a police officer, but somehow is being justified because it was a drone. </p>

<p>So his point all along has been that a drone should be treated the same as a police officer. He wanted the government to state clearly that a drone wouldn&#39;t be able to kill a non-active combatant in the same way a police officer isn&#39;t able to.</p>

<p>The point is never abouts drones vs not drones, it&#39;s always what they&#39;re doing, why and to who.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t attacking you.  Maybe you should calm down.</p>

<p>Is there some fany reddit way to tell someone you&#39;re asking them a question so they don&#39;t automatically jump your shit?</p>

<p>edit to clarify in case it wasn&#39;t already clear enough.</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t support the killing of non-combatant.  He does support the killing of liquor store robbers.  Is there some fancy government document painting low level robbers as enemy combatants?</p>

<p>Because criminal or not, pretty sure that hypothetical guy would still be a non-combatant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>80% of the people on reddit want to attack one another.  I love discussion, but I don&#39;t see a lot of it on reddit. It seems like the majority want to attack one another, some just want to agree with whatever is said, and others just want to make unrelated jokes.</p>

<p>You are right I did jump to conclusions and I apologize for that. You make a good point,  but I believe Rand is the best chance we have to return America to the people since it has been take from us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is somebody robbing a liquor store now considered an enemy combatant?</p>

<p>They&#39;ve passed a lot of legislation to slap hasty labels on citizens, but this seems pretty ... severe.</p>
