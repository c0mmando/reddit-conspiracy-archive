        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was thinking about the Marathon bombing yesterday and couldn&#39;t get one thing out of my mind. I couldn&#39;t believe how these two brothers were so careless in their efforts last week.</p>

<p>If you were to place a bomb near the finish line of a damn marathon, with thousands of people around carrying cameras, why in the world wouldn&#39;t you wear some sort of disguise? It just baffles me how these two seemingly intelligent guys (since they can build such a complicated device on their own) can not think to disguise themselves any better than wearing a hat.  Did they really think they wouldn&#39;t be spotted, placing a backpack in front of such a large crowd?  I would be surprised if I forgot my shopping bag at an empty park and it wasn&#39;t traced back to me somehow if someone wanted to. With all the surveillance cameras and technology all around every big city now days, how could they be so stupid to think no one would recognize them!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, according to reports it was detonated via remote control.  A fuse / timer build bomb can be made by almost anyone.  One detonated with the remote would require a bit more knowledge.</p>

<p>Which even the timer / fuse bombs require exercising extreme caution.   Any gunpowder caught in the rivets (pipe bomb) or even between the lid / pressure cooker itself could potentially set it off.  So if nothing else, building the bomb required quite a bit of caution / planning.</p>

<p>Past the bombs they really did nothing else.  No disguise, sloppy attempt at a 2nd attack, etc.  Yet somehow they pull off the Marathon bombing to perfection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think it&#39;d take much more than a cursory Googling to figure out how to make a remotely triggered bomb. All you&#39;d need is a cell phone. Just attach your detonator to whatever line/wire provides current to, say, the speaker (or the, uh, vibrator -- there&#39;s got to be a better word for that) and call the phone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great Observation. Most of the video and pictures you see they look clueless or out of place. To me they don&#39;t look nervous they look like they are following directions maybe, But you are right. Im sure the younger brother was more mainstream and maybe watched some crime movies or learnt something to hide himself, anyone in there right mind would try to disguise themselves change hair color shave, etc, the just look way to out of place..
Edit:Like they were setup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, they should have known for days how the police were asking for pictures from the public so they could be used as evidence. Obviously someone would have captured them at some point so why stay in their house? I&#39;m not even sure where the first suspect was killed, but we all knew they were wanted before the police arrived...why just stay and wait?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the things that really struck me was that when thy searched the home they found plates of unfinished food on the table and the general scene suggested they got up and left really abruptly and without prior warning.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a really small detail but it feels important. Almost as if they had absolutely NO inkling that they were going to have to leave and that something prompted them to make the decision to leave with a great deal of urgency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, that is correct, because they believed they could hide in plain sight. They figured a huge crowd, thousands of people with bags, no one is going to suspect a couple of white guys. They weighed that vs doing things to change appearance which might tip off people in their regular lives, like if they dyed their hair blond or shaved it off.</p>

<p>They thought that the gov&#39;t and media would look for a brown skinned person and they could just disappear. Once the news report hit with their pictures, they took off right away figuring the police would come to their home first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>or, they could have believed that such a large scale event, that they would blend in, 2 white guys walking around shouldn&#39;t bring suspicion. They believed that after the bombing they could simply go back to their lives and no one would notice that one second they had a backpack and a second later during the chaos they didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>That would explain why they had no escape plan, and how they acted so erratic once their pictures were put on the news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you&#39;re saying but if they &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; wouldn&#39;t they have killed the guys whose car they hijacked? I know MSM accounts are saying that he escaped but I can&#39;t help but think, if they just didn&#39;t give a shit about human life wouldn&#39;t they have killed him after they got his ATM card and PIN? Why bother keeping him alive? Continuing on that, why actually not rob the 7/11 to get some real cash for a getaway?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they were not prepared to have to run. They thought they could hide in plain sight, after that they figured they are on the news everyone will know about them anyway to its time to run and panic.</p>

<p>It was a mistake to kill the cop that didn&#39;t yet ID them and not to kill the carjacker and not to tell him a full confession, but not all criminals are masterminds that make no mistakes, even LEx Luthor fucks up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the one time where I really have no clue what the truth is. There&#39;s just enough evidence to support almost any theory.I&#39;m pretty sure these kids did this but with who&#39;s help? Their sloppiness suggest they most definitely had someone adding them.I don&#39;t think they had help from our government but it certainly seems that our government at least expected some sort of attack. I&#39;m fairly certain the &quot;bomb drill&quot; was just an excuse to have all the extra security/medical teams to easily contain the expected attack. (I feel if the FBI knew of an attack but did nothing, they&#39;re just as guilty as the bombers) any thoughts on why the FBI/CIA would be involved? Possibly just a distraction? </p>

<p>i would hardly call that &quot;huge packs&quot;</p>

<p>i don&#39;t think the runners were the target. the crowd had definitely thinned by the time the bombs went off. compared to bombings in the rest of the world that day the sheer lack of dead and injured should demonstrate the poor timing and placement of the bombs.</p>

<p>but then if i was going to target a sporting event for &quot;jihad&quot; it would not be something with a thin line of spectators. if i wanted to justify more homeland security on the other hand...</p>

1) They are the dumbest, most short-sighted people in existence and forgot to plan ahead or just assumed no one would know they did it.
2) It was like a suicide mission. They knew they wanted to kill people and figured they would get caught or die afterwards. So, no need for an exit strategy.
3) They were set up somehow and never thought they would need any planning because someone else was supposed to be doing the planning for them.</p>
