        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It makes me sick to see the misdirection in conspiracy lately, it really does. I understand the pressing matter of trying to pick apart the Boston bombings....But aren&#39;t we smart enough to realize that the more pressing issue at hand here is <strong>SOPA</strong>?</p>

<p>After being a member of this community for well over a year, I think it is safe to say that despite all of the evidence put forth in this subreddit, very little progress is made other than informing individuals. That is all good and well believe me, but there comes a time where we have to decide whether we&#39;re just going to sit around getting to the bottom of what may very well be a rabbit hole, or actually take action against the questionable government activities that brought us here in the first place. </p>

<p>As far as what can be done in the current situation, we have two distinct avenues. </p>

<p>1.) We can nit-pick every last shred of media that comes out of what happened in Boston</p>

<p>2.) We can unite under a cause that we can ACTUALLY make a difference in, that being the current threat of SOPA. </p>

<p>I can only hope that you see this message and make the right decision. Now is the worst possible time to be distracted by ongoing events with the FBI and the media and the trails and all the fluff that comes along with it. We are at a pivotal point in the history of the internet, and I know that the vast majority of you know that it&#39;s a potential risk, and our freedoms are at stake. </p>

<p>I urge you to shift your attention towards SOPA. Further, I urge you to contact your senator, or multiple senators and voice your opinion. We have come to the point where the only difference we may possibly make is by using the avenues legally available.  </p>

<p>Below is a brief description of the current status of SOPA, along with a message that I hope will reach you. </p>

<p>Thank you to those of you who have read and digested this. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h117">Here</a></strong> is the breakdown of how it fared in the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>Of course, letting your senator know you oppose CISPA is first and foremost the most important duty we have to protect the internet. However, we should take it upon ourselves to show our disdain towards the representatives who voted for it to pass through the house. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm">Here</a></strong> you can quickly find information to contact your senator.</p>

<p>As for contacting members of the house in your state, use the first link I&#39;ve provided. From there, you can view the results and click on each representatives name and be taken directly to their individual website. Every representative will have their Washington D.C office number listed at the bottom of their home page. </p>

<p>Call the number and tell the person who answers the phone that you would like to leave a comment for the congressman/woman. Let them know the bill you are referring to (H.R. 624 - Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act) and give them your opinion. </p>

<p>We need to ramp up our participation to ensure this atrocity doesn&#39;t pass the senate. </p>

<p>Exercise your right. We&#39;re the first generation to have to defend our rights on the internet, and we haven&#39;t set enough of a precedent yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s cool. I really do think we have to choose wisely what kind of state representatives we vote and empower to office so that Tom, Dick, and Harry don&#39;t just impose on our privacy and strip our freedoms because a few lunatics come into the lime light.</p>

<p>The current events of this year have seemed to be devestating to say the least, but those who give up freedoms for protections will get neither. It will be a sad day when our children and grandchildren grow up without these freedoms and it becomes the norm.</p>

<p>The news idolizes these terror attacks and pound images into our minds of bloodshed and bills and new laws get put into place that have little to no effect on criminals. Our country is great but the leaders not so. </p>

<p>Innocent untill proven guilty is no longer the case and it seems everyone is committing a crime whether you realize it or not.</p>
