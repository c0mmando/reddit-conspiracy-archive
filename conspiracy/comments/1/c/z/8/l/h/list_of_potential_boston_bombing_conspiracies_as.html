    <div class="md"><p>0 - I don&#39;t believe so. Dzhokhar claims they acted alone.</p>

<p>1 - No. Too many independent people have seen the injuries up close.</p>

<p>2 - I can&#39;t disprove it.</p>

<p>3 - He certainly was a suspect. I don&#39;t know what his actual status is.</p>

<p>4 - I can&#39;t disprove it.</p>

<p>5 - The backpacks do not appear to match.</p>

<p>6 - No. Dzhokhar claims to have done the bombing.</p>

<p>7 - No. Dzhokhar claims to have done the bombing.</p>

<p>8 - No. The CST member has his bag after the explosion.</p>

<p>9 - No. Naked man was videotaped being put into a squad car at the intersection of Dexter and Nichols at 1:35am. Dr. David Schoenfeld pronounced Tamerlan dead at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at 1:35am.</p>

<p>10 - I don&#39;t believe so. Andrew Kitzenberg&#39;s photos seem to indicate Tamerlan was run over by his brother. I think the vehicle escaping is a Grey &#39;95 Honda Odyssey, license plate 93N-N73. I believe the other vehicle in the brothers possession was a Green &#39;99 Honda Sedan, license plate 116-GC7.</p>

<p>11 - I don&#39;t believe so. Dzhokhar claims they acted alone.</p>

<p>12 - No. The double amputee at the first bomb site is definitely Jeff Bauman. His sister recognized him on the news.</p>

<p>13 - Possibly. The two interviews done by CNN show women who look extremely similar. I can&#39;t disprove it.</p>

<p>14 - I don&#39;t believe so. The boat owner said he saw blood on his boat. The car hijack victim says Dzhokhar had a gun.</p>

<p>15 - Possibly. I can&#39;t disprove it.</p>

<p>16 - Possibly. I can&#39;t disprove it.</p>

<p>edit - spelling</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also the saudi that was a person of interest was cleared. Then a day later Steve Emerson(self made &quot;terrorism expert) went on Fox News saying this guy was being deported. Made a huge issue, then the next day he came back on saying his Informant/source was actually wrong and read the name wrong on ICE papers and that it is a different saudi man being deported. Steve Emerson is a fuck for doing that and has a very shoddy track record before with saying things like that on Fox News. The Saudi man is a non issue and was cleared days after the bombing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the FBI wanted to falsify admission of guilt then Dzhokhar&#39;s ability to speak would not stop them because they are the only ones questioning him right now. So far the FBI has claimed Dzhokhar said that he learned to build bombs from Inspire magazine, that he said he and his brother acted alone and that he said they were responsible for the bombing.</p>

<p>At some point Dzhokhar will be given an attorney and if the admission of guilt was falsified then attorney would know.</p>

<p>Doctors at the hospital where Tamerlan Tsarnaev was taken said that they did not see any wounds on his body that were consistent with being run over by a vehicle.

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. That&#39;s why I focused only on the doctors words. They&#39;re usually pretty accurate and calm under pressure. Mistakes happen and, like they said, they don&#39;t see a lot of blast wounds or similar incidents so that might have got it wrong. It&#39;d be interesting to see the autopsy report.</p>

<p>That eyewitness testimony, well helpful, isn&#39;t even necessary.</p>

<p>Unless he made a 3-point turn in 2.4s, w/out damaging the vehicle near him and then subsequently proceeds to head in the direction of the Officers, run through, presumably Officer vehicles, w/out a single shot to the face/chest/etc. or no mechanical hindrance, then it&#39;s nearly implausible and the media/investigators need to quit with that bull.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what&#39;s your scenario for the following moments? The rest of the photos and commentary in that stream seem to show Tamerlan running down the street under smoke cover from a bomb and then Jahar driving down it and smashing through the cars. I think there&#39;s multiple eyewitnesses to that but not sure.</p>

<p>Did he not drive that way and drove off in the other direction instead? What was in the other direction? Obviously no cops as they weren&#39;t hiding from anyone that one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I do wedding photos as well.</p>

<p>A fact? According to? Because, eyewitness testimony states that he was ran over by a Police SUV, which would be more plausible as they were heading in the same direction that Djokar was...away from his brother.</p>

<p>Unless you purport that Djokar decided that the best route to &quot;escape&quot; would to turn an SUV, with a larger turn radius than the vehicle in front of him, 180 degrees, into the direction of the police and police officers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what I find suspicious is that the early reports included detail from Jahar&#39;s friends at school saying he was a terrible driver and everyone was afraid to ask him for rides, because he was such a bad driver. That seemed to be such a forced narrative, there is no way that emerged too early on, all on its own. It almost sounds like a justification for Jahar&#39;s running over his own brother. Not just running over, but dragging his body for like 40-45 feet, and keeping going (the body got dislodged on its own). That&#39;s a fucked up and disturbing thing all by itself. Why would he do that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know the lay out of the street but he could&#39;ve had a legit reason to turn around. Also if year guys planted bombs to kill people, they wouldn&#39;t mind killing more; he could have been trying to run over police. And who took that picture? </p>

<p>Edit: so I just watched the interview that is linked to in the #10 YouTube description. The guy who took the picture with the MS paint additions said he saw Jahar get in his car, turn around, and drive at the police. So I guess he decided to go that way and that&#39;s why he turned around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>0 - Plausible, in that the FBI had opportunity, but unlikely given the lack of collaborating evidence. </p>

<p>1 - Completely implausible.  This would require the FBI to give the Tsarnaev brothers fake bombs, which the brothers would have to recognize as fake and replace with real bombs, and then go through the plan anyways.  </p>

<p>2 - Very plausible.  Might point towards motive for Tamerlan Tsarnaev; attacking Americans may have been a symbolic attack against his Westernized uncle who had allied himself with the CIA; an organization strongly connected to a number of crimes against Muslims in the middle east.</p>

<p>3 - I wouldn&#39;t believe Glen Beck if he told me water is wet.  The man is a crypto-fascist propagandist.</p>

<p>4 - No, that is clearly not Hamza bin Laden.</p>

<p>5 - Unconvincing. The backpacks look correct to me.</p>

<p>6 - &quot;This was shopped. I can see the pixels.&quot;</p>

<p>7 - I can&#39;t make out anything specific in such low-res pictures.</p>

<p>8 - This one has been thoroughly busted.</p>

<p>9 - Busted.</p>

<p>10 - Doesn&#39;t really matter who ran him over or if he got ran over.</p>

<p>11 - The Illuminati would never stage a bombing.  I will not tolerate this anti-Illuminati hate speech.  The Illuminati are a force for good and the primary driver of social, religious and scientific progress.  Fuck these crypto-fascists and their anti-Illuminati proaganda.</p>

<p>12 - Not a chance in hell.  With the sheer number of volunteer medical staff on hand for the marathon, there is no way the injuries sustained in the attack could be faked.  If you follow this line of thought down the rabbit-hole, you end up at a place where the entire marathon must have been faked.  That&#39;s just not possible.  Any organization that could pull off a hoax of that magnitude wouldn&#39;t need to pull off a hoax of that magnitude, because they <strong>clearly</strong> already have control of the entire world.  Damn near everyone on the planet except me would have to be in on the conspiracy.</p>

<p>13 - I totally wouldn&#39;t put it past CNN to hire actors to play witnesses.  While not propagandists like Fox, they are truly the most incompetent bunch of assclowns in the news game.  And the two women do look a lot alike...but their voices are <em>very</em> different.</p>

<p>14 - The &quot;pool of blood&quot; description is from a neighbor&#39;s account of the story as told to him, so it&#39;s hearsay at best and may me an exaggeration.  These pics are too small, too low-res and at a poor angle -- the blood may be there, just not visible in these photos.  The dark stains that are identified as blood after his arrest seem to be on his sweatshirt as he exits the boat. This is a case of seeing what one wants to see.</p>

<p>15 - Completely implausible.  If the police shot him in the throat and he didn&#39;t die immediately, they would have simply delayed emergency treatment and &quot;slow walked&quot; him to the hospital.  If they had him at their mercy and wanted him dead, he&#39;d be dead.</p>

<p>16 - I also successfully predicted capture on Friday.  This guy failed to predict that there would be two bombers, there has been no mention of an NRA connection, neither brother appears to have been &quot;unstable.&quot;  Standard psychic schtick.  He got one hit, and many misses.  This is just a b/tard fucking with people&#39;s heads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find your stance on the illuminati very interesting. Although they aren&#39;t frequently mentioned here, one of the first conspiracies I ever heard was centered around the Illuminati&#39;s diabolical plan to control the world, enact the NWO and make 1984 a reality. All of which definitely <em>do not seem good</em>. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t ever really considered them in the light you portray them, and am open to the concept. Do you think that what most people see as the Illuminati&#39;s efforts to control the world are really the mechanism driving society in nearly every aspect OR is it that you believe their agenda in accordance to what it has been portrayed as is false? I am just curious, i&#39;ve been told to resent them for a while and now I see you saying I should embrace them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I subscribe to the theory (first advanced, afaik, by Robert Anton Wilson) that the Illuminati is a secret society so clandestine that even the vast majority of its members are unaware that they are members -- in fact, the members who recognize themselves as members are the least likely to be leaders.  For example, I am an insignificant member of the Illuminati, but recognize myself as one of their agents.  Martin Luther King Kr was a prominent Illuminati leader, but never would have recognized himself as such.</p>

<p>The Illuminati is not a conspiracy per se, since the goals of the Illuminati are not criminal, but rather the advancement and liberation of humanity through the destruction of all authoritarian structures.  In this sense, organizations as varied as Anonymous, the ACLU, Human Rights Watch, and Electronic Frontier Foundation are all Illuminati -- they all work towards the goal of human liberation, human dignity and social progress.</p>

<p>The name &quot;Illuminati&quot; comes from the Bavarian Illuminati founded by Adam Weishaupt (better known to history as George Washington, the man&#39;s whose identity Weishaupt stole when he fled persecution in Germany), but the Illuminati are far, far older than that -- they have literally been with us since the dawn of civilization.  They are the Enlightened Ones, those who see beyond themselves and recognize the vast potential of humanity and work towards its</p>

<p>Naturally they have an enemy, called Grayface, that is equally ancient.  Grayface is represented in the world by organizations like The Republican Party, Family Research Council, the Communist Party of China, and the Third Reich.    Grayface has long waged a war of disinformation and demonization against all agents of Illumination, as the goal of grayface is to stiffle, impede and thwart the advancement of humanity by any means necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, and I should also mention that the term <em>New World Order</em>, or <em>A New Order For The Ages</em>, is an ancient Illuminati motto.  It refers to the ultimate utopian goals of the Illuminati: a single world order founded on mutualism, equality and respect for human dignity.</p>

<p>If you want to understand the New World Order, think of the world presented in <strong>Star Trek</strong>.  A post-scarcity society where all can freely participate and humans have limitless opportunities for self-discovery and personal enlightenment.  That is the actual goal of the Illuminati.  Timothy Leary, another Illuminated Master, used the phrase <a href="http://www.futureconscience.com/smi2le-the-futurism-of-timothy-leary/">S.M.I2.L.E.</a> – Space Migration, Increased Intelligence, Life Extension -- to describe the goal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember seeing the update thread in the being a few posts regarding MIT that I am pretty sure said unrelated individuals who were either dark skinned or wearing black clothes, as well as being armed, were the reason for the shots fired alert. I specifically remember this because it made me think about how much shit was hitting the fan in Boston between chasing around two bombers and also having a separate unknown group raising hell at MIT. </p>

<p>Blaming Tamerlan and Johar for shooting the MIT officer would certainly help in creating an &#39;armed and dangerous&#39; label for the two, which could both make it much more acceptable to go to any means to get them (such as armored vehicles, full house searches, etc.) and also give some leeway to those orchestrating the entire thing to act discretely.  </p>

<p>No. My comment was pretty clear. Any of the private contractors could have placed the backpack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the mainstream media and official accounts have framed the debate as being between whether the bombings were a Columbine-type attack or an Al-Qaeda-type attack. This fits with the political narratives of the two political parties: should we be afraid of guns or immigrants?  But there are completely unrelated explanations which would still fit much of what we know, other than the FBI&#39;s claim that the kid has confessed to working alone.  Because let&#39;s face it, the kid might very well be scared and prone to telling the FBI what they want to hear and none-too-eager to rock the boat.  Let&#39;s not even get started on the whole getting shot in the neck thing. My evidence is admittedly circumstantial, but no one has focused on refuting these angles so I haven&#39;t really had a chance to clarify my thoughts about how they might tie in:</p>

<p>1 - Possible FSB involvement: in her first interview (around 6:00-7:00) the brothers&#39; aunt is explaining how they were able to get asylum so easily and she mentions that their father worked in <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2013/04/19/maret_tsarnaeva_dzhokhar_tsarnaev_and_tamerlan_tsarnaev_s_aunt_still_not.html">&quot;enforcement agencies&quot;</a>. With all that people are saying about Uncle Ruslan now, these kids being spooks would imply that they went into the family business--or thought they were going into the family business... Mostly, it just seems like Russia benefits a lot from increased suspicion of central asians (central asians most certainly do not benefit) and the attack has probably killed a lot of enthusiasm for seriously arming the Syrian opposition due to a newly urgent fear of jihadis.  Could the US government really go public if this was Russian asymmetrical warfare--even if they wanted to or, of course, assuming there wasn&#39;t collusion?  I don&#39;t know.  Then again, sometimes people have a child-like understanding of geopolitics while still having the ability to build a relatively primitive bomb.  As I said, I&#39;m certainly not equipped to rule out the lone-nut hypothesis...</p>

<p>2 - Organized crime tie-ins: Boston has a long history of organized crime.  Extortion rackets also employ bombs and criminal syndicates ask men to carry bags without asking a lot of questions.  There are plenty of eastern european and central asian criminal syndicates which might be flexing their muscles or able to provide patsies to anyone who needs them.  It&#39;s still not clear to me what exactly the older brother did for a living and how he financed his tastes for mercedes cars and eurotrash fashion.  Then there&#39;s the fact that Tamerlan&#39;s friend was <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/murder-of-brendan-mess-the-best-friend-of-boston-bombing-suspect-tamerlan-tsarnaev-2013-4">killed in a blatant gangland attack where they sprinkled drugs on the bodies just in case the message wasn&#39;t clear</a>.</p>

<p>Exploring both angles might lead to a theory which would involve the two as more or less knowing patsies who were told to do something and then left holding the proverbial bag.  But neither of these explanations serve a recognizable political agenda in the Democrat/Republican binary.  However, both would explain what keeps puzzling me the most: why a couple of apolitical bros who seem way too popular to go postal ended up getting fingered for mass murder?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Buying into? None at the moment, and i should hope nobody else is, either. If you&#39;re coming to conclusions at this early stage, you&#39;re doing something wrong.</p>

<p>Interesting ones that i&#39;ll be keeping an eye on?</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> - Although i&#39;ve only just seen this today. People involved at a high level with USAID and Halliburton are unlikely to be unaware of the CIA presence in both of those organisations, but there&#39;s nothing solid that connects the guy that i&#39;ve seen yet.</p>

<p><strong>3/4</strong> - Not seen anything compelling, but CIA connections to the Bin Laden family would lead me to believe that if it <em>was</em> indeed him, they&#39;d want him (and whoever he was with) out of the country pretty fast. The reason i&#39;ve lumped these two together, is that it&#39;s unlikely that Bin Laden&#39;s son just happened to be at a marathon where bombs went off and had nothing to do with it. Again, just keeping an eye on it, not putting much weight into it at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> - Looks very much like the suspect. It would be a hell of a coincidence if it wasn&#39;t him.</p>

<p><strong>10</strong> - Eyewitness reports this is the case. Maybe mixed up brother&#39;s stolen SUV with police, but i find that hard to believe; not to mention they then apparently went on to shoot him <em>after</em> he had been run over by said SUV, whoever it was driven by. Although this boils down to the police fucking something up or being over-zealous, rather than a wider conspiracy. </p>

<p><strong>16</strong> - Too much of a general sweeping statement to make at this early stage, but depending on whatever legislation may or may not come of this, it&#39;s certainly a possibility. Whether they take advantage of a legitimate attack, or the attack was staged, i think we&#39;ll see repercussions. </p>

<p>Like i said, not putting all of my eggs in one basket yet, and i think the most logical thing for anyone to say at this stage is &quot;i don&#39;t know&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I don&#39;t have a timing myself but another doubter of that theory said they both happened at exactly 1:35am. Don&#39;t have a source though. (Probably shouldn&#39;t state the info without checking it first but there you go)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but like i said, i&#39;m not sure when he was actually arrested, just the time it was reported. Although they were reporting it as if it was breaking news, so it does seem unlikely that is was happening a significant amount of time before 1:35am.</p>

<p>that image is full of weird pixelation, video just focused on one instance instead of the hundreds in the photo. </p>

<p>screenshots of image where you can see &#39;rectangles of image&#39;.

<p>i would say, not shopped.</p>

<p>if someone knows of the ultimate original image, i would look at it, but based on a high-res i found, the whole thing is full of digital noise.</p>
