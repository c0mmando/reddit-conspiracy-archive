        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When I joined reddit nearly 6 years ago, it was a site where questioning authority and not accepting official statements wasn&#39;t just the status quo but encouraged.  Shortly after I joined, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> was overrun with paid supporters of the 2008 presidential candidates and then became the cesspool it is today.</p>

<p>What am I seeing on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?</p>

<p>The same transition.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, as I understand it, has been a bastion of an exchange of free thinking, of questioning authority, and yes... alien/ufo stuff.  However, today there is a contingent of paid shills, jerks, or both who en masse discourage any theories that question the authorities.</p>

<p>No more than since this Boston Bombing incident have I seen this contingent so hard at work to discredit free thought.  On nearly every submission some of the top comments are from the same group of people stating &quot;You&#39;re just a guy sitting at home in front of a computer.  What you know?&quot; or &quot;Oh, you know more than the FBI?  You must be some super sleuth&quot; or just plain insults.</p>

<p>Why is this so important, and why is it disturbing?  </p>

<p>Because the behavior exhibited by &quot;the powers that be&quot; and the mainstream news source lays the groundwork for deception, and the resulting official narrative that will be parroted over and over after the dust settles will be used to transform our society much like the PATRIOT Act, TSA, naked body scanners, etc.</p>

<p>What to do about it?</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know.  Until a reliable alternative to reddit is found, I think the best solution is to continue shining the light on the cockroaches.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not a paid shill and you&#39;re going around <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> calling people lunatics for questioning official statements.  Stop wasting everyone&#39;s time and go to another subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sort of illustrates my issue with this subreddit. It is <em>not</em> free, rational thought, as is claimed. It is a stubborn group of people who see phantoms in every shadow, and search for evidence to support their conclusion rather than the other way around.</p>

<p>Certainly, questioning the official story isn&#39;t a bad thing, but rejecting answers that you find simply because you don&#39;t like them is destructive. By its very nature, almost every theory posted on this subreddit is likely false. If this was acknowledged, there would be no issue. The problem comes when anyone who provides evidence against an &quot;alternate&quot; explanation is accused of being a shill or is told they belong in a different subreddit. You <em>must</em> make room for <em>reason</em>, or else this entire community is a pointless circlejerk.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear about the study that showed that contradicting evidence can actually reinforce false beliefs? This is it. It&#39;s not about the importance of the community, it&#39;s about reconciling the existence of different opinions in the face of the &#39;obvious&#39; &#39;truth&#39; and all the &#39;proof&#39; and &#39;evidence&#39;.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s extremely pointless to employ people to shill for the mainstream opinion on the internet. There&#39;s enough people around who support it for free. That&#39;s why it&#39;s called the <em>mainstream</em> opinion. If anyone has any interest in having paid shills spread an opinion, it&#39;s supporters of fringe views.</p>

<p>It&#39;s even more pointless to try to influence &#39;the crowd&#39; by posting on a miniscule niche community that consists almost exclusively of people who either disbelieve the &#39;official story&#39; out of principle or already agree with it and are only here to mock the former group.  There&#39;s nothing to gain here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit has millions of followers , this is the ideal spot to push an idea or way of life .. You obv dont want to give anything else a honest ear.. Do you really believe everything that has transpired is exactly how they say it did on tv ? Do you really believe the govt and media tells us the absolute truth ? Do you think an established journalist like Glenn beck is trolling for attention ? He has a prominent career why ruin it over lies ? Hes puttin his lively hood on the line exposing this huge lie thats being fed to us .. At the end of the day my opinon is worth as much as your is . But the fact still remains that the known master mind with known al qaeda ties was deported , do to national security . Instead of being detainned and interrogated .. Maybe i am feeding into the conspiracy but if i am please shoot down glenn becks theory and shoot down infowars theory . So this way i can be on the same page as you </p>

<p>He&#39;s putting nothing on the line. He has a prominent career as a conspiracy theory spewing attention whore that is <em>built</em> on lies. The man has zero credibility outside of your community of believers. I&#39;m sorry to say, but your filter bubble is showing.</p>

He knows that even if he appeals to only 3% of the population, 3% of 300 million is still a sizable customer base.  </p>

<p>Look, I am an Iraqi and a worker for a prominent civil liberties organization.  I know that the government lies to you and have lost relatives because of this fact.  I also know there are people in the government and the national security apparatus who want to curb civil liberties.  But this is not an Illuminati conspiracy.  They are behaving in natural, human ways- they either want more power or genuinely believe that less civil liberties will help them protect their fellow citizens.  It makes the jobs of us fighting for civil liberties much harder when we get grouped with &quot;conspiracy nuts&quot; all the time.  </p>

Have you researched the saudi national that got deported ? Do you think those brothers master minded all this on there own ? Terrorist and conspiracy are words of the same feather .. There both used by the media to manipulate people ... Most people believe every drop they hear on tv , when this nightnare showed how false the media can be .. They were just blurting shit on air that had no facts to support it . I on the other hand choose to believe half of what i see and none of what i hear .. And its worked out for me so far ..

<p>Maybe you think these questions don&#39;t need to be answered. Fine. Then this subreddit is not for you, just as <a href="/r/fanfic">/r/fanfic</a> is not for people who don&#39;t want to read fan fiction, and <a href="/r/dornercase">/r/dornercase</a> is not for people who don&#39;t want to hear about Dorner anymore.</p>

<p>The most likely answer is that they were there running security. That&#39;s probably true. Few dismissed that. In fact, most of the posts in that thread stated as much. But as of yet there&#39;s no real hard evidence. If you&#39;re not interested in that evidence, then you don&#39;t belong here.</p>

That&#39;s not a discussion, that&#39;s just pointless and insulting.

<p>This whole topic is about how anyone that is critical of a conspiracy theory is a shill. You also promote that anyone that thinks a conspiracy ridiculous should not be here and should not voice their opinion. That&#39;s just as insulting as people pointing the circlejerk out.</p>

<p>Just in this comment thread you have expressed that people that are critical should either 1) leave and not voice their opinion or 2) be downvoted so their opinion isn&#39;t scene. How do you deal with this cognitive dissonance?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between being critical of a conspiracy theory, and mocking people who buy into a conspiracy theory. You, and most of the newcomers here, are doing the latter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No. If you think a conspiracy theory is ridiculous, and all you say is &quot;that&#39;s ridiculous&quot;, or &quot;you&#39;re stupid&quot;, then you should not be here, because you are not contributing to the discussion. If you can logically deconstruct the theory, and that&#39;s what you do in your post, then that&#39;s fine.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Neither of those are censorship. You don&#39;t seem to understand censorship. Asking you to leave is not censorship. Downvoting posts that don&#39;t contribute to the discussion is censorship - the goal is to prevent it from disrupting the conversation. Downvoted posts can still be seen. I often sort posts by controversial, especially in <a href="/r/askreddit">/r/askreddit</a>, so that I can see downvoted posts. Having mods delete your post would be censorship. I am against that.</p>

<p>And all of this applies not to people who are critical of conspiracy theories, but people who are critical of conspiracy theor<strong>ists</strong>.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve also provided an excellent example of devolving the discussion by attempting to insult me. Please keep to the subject matter and leave any baseless personal accusations out of it, because as I stated, there&#39;s no way you know enough about me to discredit what I say on that basis.</p>

<p>If you are someone who is legitimately just dubious of someones theory, just explain it without being a dick. Employ a little diplomacy, that&#39;s good for everyone to develop.

    <div class="md"><p>Petty insults and shit like that shows one thing: lack of a decent argument. I&#39;ve got no issue with people having different view on things, i personally don&#39;t agree with a lot of what is written/posted here. You know what i do? I ignore the crazy stuff, and i discuss other ideas about the dubious or fairly speculative stuff.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem with a lot of things posted here - the track record of the government makes a lot of it believable, but there&#39;s not much solid evidence to back up the theories. Theories are great, a lot of them make sense, but they&#39;re just theories for now, especially when we&#39;re, what, 6 days into a situation?</p>

<p>It&#39;s like me going over the r/Christianity and telling them they&#39;re all delusional retards for believing in such fairytales. Why would i bother? Why would i feel the need to do that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every time theres a big national story, you get an influx of douches because they are searching Reddit for Boston bombers or something. Once subscribed, they come back and mess with you on the next big story.</p>

<p>This place got noticeably worse after Aurora. Sandy Hook was a huge brawl. Dorner, and now this one. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you this: the crisis actor nonsense, which is trivial to disprove, turns many of us into critics of the sub, rather than supporters, because it is an insult to the victims. &quot;conspiracy&quot; researchers studying JFKs murder or Cheney&#39;s war crimes are often motivated by compassion for victims who don&#39;t get justice. </p>

<p>Also, since this sub started to approach everything as a matter of 2nd amendment rights....I&#39;m cool with that, but then you start to cross-pollinate with conservative law and order types, birthers basically. 80% of those guys are total asshats, and I guarantee you they think the BDP walks on water.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;it is an insult to the victims&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Expand upon this theory please?
Unfortunately, this talking point is used all too often whenever any official story is questioned.
I think it&#39;s an insult to the investigation process, but let&#39;s be honest.  The victims are already victims.  Everything that happens after that is purely emotionally reactionary.  Our (ideal) justice system is supposed to utilize these investigations in presenting evidence to make criminals pay for their crimes.  That&#39;s the only connection between the investigation and the victims (after the crime).  Any other emotional response is purely biased for revenge, and cannot be trusted.  </p>

<p>If someone that I know were a victim of a crime, I would be slightly disapproving, but understanding, not insulted, at the thought that investigation may have went overboard and campy, in an attempt to explore every angle to find the truth behind the victimization of my loved one.  I would rather have too many suspects than too little.  Not everyone is going to use common sense, but part of the faith in justice is believing in the ability of Detectives, Prosecutors, and a Jury to eliminate the overly absurd information.</p>

<p>Exactly, why make things worse for them by saying that they are paid actors.</p>

<p>Imagine if your son was shot dead in front of you, and as you lay there holding him some asshole on the internet said &#39;it&#39;s obviously fake, gunshot wounds would have left a different bloodspatter&#39; with absolutely zero evidence and the only reason for it being brought up is someone who &#39;never trusts the official story&#39; how would you feel?

    <div class="md"><p>My question is, will there ever be another mass event that won&#39;t catch the eye of the average conspiracy theorist? I wasn&#39;t really surprised to see a lot coverage in here on the Boston situation, but it did get me to thinking &quot;is anything able to just be?&quot; Some people on here seem to look at every event with the preconceived belief that it is somehow orchestrated by some unknown group or agency. I honestly think that we&#39;ve passed the point of no return and these types of approaches just delegitimize the serious questions that need to be asked and answered. Once you flood the market with conspiracy theories who in the general public are going to take them seriously? How can we expect change and accountability when we seem to be crying wolf?</p>

No. I&#39;m not talking about the people asking questions and fact checking, I&#39;m talking about the people that drew conclusions long before there was any sort of definitive official story, before anyone was identified as a suspect. Now think about it, if this happens every time a major event happens do you think the general public are going to in future pay any attention to what we have to say? Of course not, because we will just appear self indulgent and irrational. Even if it is only a few people doing it, they tend to be the loudest and then they make us all look bad.</p>

The best part is watching another puppet cut the strings and come up to you &quot; Dude... did you know that....&quot; Me: &quot; YUP, have a seat bro&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s really absurd that because I don&#39;t believe that these guys were patsy&#39;s (or hadn&#39;t jumped to that conclusion days ago) and because I believe Sandy Hook was not a false flag, suddenly I&#39;m a McNews chomping temper tantrumming bully with no valid points. </p>

<p>Conversely, <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> subscribers tend to shit on religious posts, even when they are in the appropriate board. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be interested in conspiracies doesn&#39;t mean you have to put every major world event down as a conspiracy.  You can&#39;t have rational discussion or investigation if you aren&#39;t allowed to point out that someone is full of shit and speculating based on nothing.  Show some facts about why you think it&#39;s a conspiracy and your arguement is valid and up for further scrutiny.  Scrutiny is good.  Without it this sub is pointless.</p>

<p>I find it ironic that you and OP find it disturbing that people are questioning other&#39;s radical (let&#39;s face it...all of our ideas are considered radical, whether right or wrong) ideas and opinions, whilst supporting scrutiny of the powers at be.   </p>

<p>We know absolutely nothing about what happened in Boston, relatively speaking.  So why should I listen to some asshat on the internet who says it&#39;s all a conspiracy?  We have very little information to make an assertment on, only assumptions, and I&#39;m not going to be told that I&#39;m not allowed to tell someone they&#39;re an idiot for stating their opinion (which is based on practically no actual information) as fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly I disagree with pretty much all conspiracy shit. But if you really want to know why I swing past here occasionally is because I find conspiracies and the people that follow them extremely amusing. I comment and argue because a lot of the times amount of mental gymnastics needed to believe this stuff is baffling to me and I can&#39;t help but point out flaws sometimes. Sometimes I just want to ruffle feathers.</p>

<p>Believe it or not the vast majority of people that disagree aren&#39;t &quot;shills&quot; they are people that looked at the &quot;evidence&quot; for these conspiracies called BULLSHIT! to themselves and were compelled to voice that belief. The very fact that people around here automatically call people shills for voicing disbelief just tells me that the are unable to actually articulate why they think that the &quot;shill&#39;s&quot; view is off base and instead feel the need to discredit them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all: what request? The only time you ever asked me a question before was when you said &quot;BAHAHAHAHA really?&quot;</p>

<p>As to: Sandy Hook, Aurora, and Boston, I don&#39;t have to use what happened with WTC7 and apply it to Sandy Hook, Aurora, and Boston, because WTC7 went down in Manhattan, not Sandy Hook, Aurora, nor Boston. Therefore, the incidents are independent of each other. I am pointing out clear discrepancies in the official story they (media &amp; govt. officials, CEOs, etc.) provide about what happened to WTC7 because I recognize that point as the &quot;Achilles&#39; Heel&quot; of the Official 9/11 Story. There are discrepancies anywhere you look at it, but when you have to chose the most <em>plausible</em> one, you don&#39;t have to look any further than WTC7.</p>

<p>You never clearly addressed <em>my</em> request to <strong>you</strong> as exactly how Building Seven, was, as you say, &quot;destroyed.&quot;</p>

<p>If you happen to do a little research, you&#39;ll see that the NYFD &quot;pulled&quot; the building with explosives.</p>

<p>It&#39;s physically impossible to put enough explosives to take down a building the size of WTC7 in the span of a day while simultaneously dealing with the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States; and yet they seemed to accomplish the feat with impossible speed.</p>

<p>The only logical explanation that remains is that the explosives were placed on the foundations in the months or weeks leading up to 9/11. This would indicate prior knowledge of a catastrophic event on 9/11. Why would one want have such knowledge, I wonder?</p>

<p>The owner of WTC7 was soon compensated in large denominations of dollars due to the insurance policy he had on the building.</p>

<p>I would say that there is more than enough probable cause to be deeply suspicious of the official story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is, many people who claim to be skeptical - also claim to know all the answers with limited information. It&#39;s understandable to look at WTC7 and be skeptical. However, it&#39;s not understandable to take some few unknown or misunderstood pieces of evidence and claim to &#39;know&#39; exactly what happened. This I feel is the biggest non sequitur I see in most discussions. People just claim to &#39;know&#39; simply because they have a distrust in the government, MSM, TPTB, etc.</p>

<p>I consider myself a skeptical person, but my threshold to believe in most conspiracies is pretty high. I often try to offer different explanations so that we can attempt to find the truth, even if it&#39;s not a sinister plan devised by the Illuminati. To me, that&#39;s the point of being a skeptic - as the side bar says: to create a more &#39;transparent world&#39;. But sometimes the world just isn&#39;t as black and white as some skeptics try to make it.</p>

<p>Again, so what?  Do you understand that, merely because an event is rare or unprecedented does not mean it didn&#39;t happen?  I asked for evidence.  Saying something is rare is not evidence it did not happen.</p>

<p>Sidestepped what?  I asked if you had any evidence of an alternate theory of why/how it was destroyed.  You keep repeating the all-too-common 9/11 Denier fallacy that &quot;rare&quot; = &quot;impossible.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I never said WTC never happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You implied that, because &quot;no&quot; steel-framed building had ever collapsed from fire before, it was impossible for WTC7 (and 1 &amp; 2) to have collapsed from fire.  That was your implication.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just the heat from the fires alone was nowhere near enough to weaken nor melt the steel, even with the fireproofing blown away in Towers One and Two. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Citation needed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Strangely enough, Building Seven had no loss of fireproofing but the media still claimed it collapsed by the same mechanism as One and Two</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who gives a shit what the media claimed?  They&#39;re wrong as often as they&#39;re right.  You can read the NIST report, or any of a half-dozen other actual engineering studies on the collapse, to understand that&#39;s what happened.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>even when firefighters later admitted that they gave the order to &#39;pull&#39; the building.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL... Really?  You&#39;re still repeating this lie that&#39;s been debunked for a fucking decade?  The infamous &quot;pull it&quot; quote?  We&#39;ve known for a decade that what was being discussed was the decision to &quot;pull&quot; <strong>the firefighting efforts out of the building and let it burn.</strong>  Anyway, to &quot;pull&quot; a building in demolition means something entirely different than to demolish it.  But don&#39;t let reality mess with your delusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is simply impossible to successfully place bombs on critical building supports in a single day, and still successfully blow up a building in the middle of downtown Manhattan during America&#39;s worst crisis in history because of &quot;safety reasons&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely correct, which is one of the many reasons why <strong>this didn&#39;t happen.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does it not bother you that the owner of Building Seven was present during the order to pull the building and later claimed an insurance policy to the tune of millions of dollars?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was no &quot;order to pull the building.&quot;  There was an order to remove firefighting from the building, and no, it doesn&#39;t bother me that he was there when that decision was made.  If it were my building, I sure wouldn&#39;t want any more firefighters to lose their lives in a futile effort.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does it not bother you that to successfully demolish a building like Building 7 requires months of planning, and could not be physically done in a day?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would this &quot;bother&quot; me considering I know that fires destroyed WTC7, not demolition?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rare does not equal impossible but many extraordinarily rare events happening all at a single time usually indicate some semi-invisible hand guiding these events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL.  No, no it doesn&#39;t.  Not at all, and this is an incredibly unsupported and illogical statement.  What is your support or rationale for even saying this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t even wanna get into the Pentagon, NORAD, or Shanksville. It&#39;s clear to me you&#39;re only interested in denigrating people&#39;s opinions rather than seeking the truth.</p>

<p>Translation:  &quot;I&#39;m in over my head and this guy is asking for proof I can&#39;t provide, so I&#39;m going to run away.&quot;</p>

<p>Says the conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>But joking aside, I am one of those people who think most conspiracy theories are crazy (I probably wouldn&#39;t normally use that word, though.) I come here (not regularly) to see how people think differently than I do. I sometime come across comments that upset me, mostly when I see comments that completely disregard logic, but I generally refrain from responding unless I have anything that adds to the conversation.</p>

<p>What always gets me is that you would assume that people that believe in conspiracy theories would be more open-minded towards analyzing and interpreting information that is relayed to them, but more often than not I see people looking at things much less open-mindedly and just crying foul.</p>

I&#39;m talking about when someone posts a picture claiming a guy who just had his lower legs blown off, is an actor who lost his legs at the hips in Afghanistan. When people claim a TOW missile blew up the fertilizer plant in Texas. When people say Navy Seals had the IEDs in their backpacks in Boston. When people say haarp is the cause for earthquakes and hurricanes. When people say there&#39;s a conspiracy with meteors, because there&#39;s video of 3 or 4 in a week, when you can talk to any sailor and he&#39;ll tell you of meteor showers all night long on the open ocean. There&#39;s just so much fantastical theories here, it makes the whole sub look bad. </p>

<p><strong>SOME??</strong>
Most everything that gets posted follows the same narrative. Its an opinion based on circumstantial evidence that miraculously gets trumpeted as incontrovertible fact and if you disagree with this, you are labeled a shill.  There is no reasoning. There is no consideration for an opposing view. You either agree, or you are working for the government or part of the liberal whore media. </p>

<p>Its really sad that intelligent debate cannot be conducted here. I keep hoping, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, your viewpoint definitely reflects mine.  Thanks for saying this.  I&#39;ve known lots of ex-military who weren&#39;t brainwashed conformists, and knew exactly why they were doing what they were doing and looked forward to the day when they were done.  </p>

<p>To add:
Empiricism and skepticism go hand-in-hand, and the most important thing is not to jump to early conclusions.  Speculation is fine if you&#39;re laying grounds for a new route of inquiry, but you have to phrase your questions in a neutral fashion which allow for  confirmation or denial. You have to accept you could be wrong in your suspicions.  </p>

<p>If people would adopt this viewpoint we&#39;d be a hell of a lot closer to figuring out how to pass this plutocratic bolus and get to a better place for all of us instead of calling each other names. </p>

<p>Its the nature of man basicly, its becomming very hard to maintain this subreddit but we have already created such a nice community it&#39;d be a shame if we left it to rot. </p>

<p>So we have to start cleaning it up ourselves and report stuff to the mods. The mods are one of us, so I&#39;m certain they will do their best to clean up without infringing upon free speech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t feel the need to protect anyone. My background in the military and security tells me not everything is a conspiracy. I was never ordered to do something and keep it a secret. Never ordered to turn a blind eye. Never ordered to torture. You may calk me a minion or whatever. But if I saw something fishy, I&#39;d be talking about it, because I don&#39;t believe anyone would come and silence me. I only care abut myself and the guys I deployed with, and the guys I work with. I work in a hotel, so I protect people&#39;s privacy and belongings. I worked at a bar so I protected patrons and property. I was a scout in the army, so my job was reconnaissance, observing and reporting. In Iraq we patrolled, waiting to get hit by an IED or take small arms fire, and we also escorted engineers to set up for voting in 2006. Did a few raids to take blacklisted people into custody. Got shot at and blown up, never dropped a jdam on an apartment. Never shot up a marketplace. Dealt with only 2 technologies considered secret at the time, not sure if they still are, I&#39;m not going to look them up, but one dealt with detonating IEDs, and the other dealt with communications. I never witnessed a violation of the law of land warfare. I have nothing to hide and no one to protect. I don&#39;t have an angle. I just want the truth. Not speculation. Not fantasy. I understand there is a &quot;fog of war&quot;. In the army we had a blue 1 contact report. Goes &quot;callsign, contact, north (direction of travel), out.&quot; Then you develop the situation and report. Deal with the initial contact, gather as much info as possible as soon as possible and pass on the info. That info is subject to change as details become clearer. It seems people take the first piece of information as fact and that stays concrete in their minds. That&#39;s what needs to change. First reports are often inaccurate. But they stay that way despite newer clearer details emerging. That&#39;s what I want to fight. The ignorant and sometimes intentional transmission of misinformation. </p>

<p>Do you ever think that maybe you were compartmentalized?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if I offend you, but it sounds like from your military and security experience you&#39;ve been heavily indoctrinated with a pro-statist and pro-authoritarian view of society.  And it&#39;s sounds like, if there&#39;s one thing you&#39;re trying to protect, it&#39;s your world view which will be challenged in this subreddit.

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe in law and order. I wonder why the fuck we&#39;re in Afghanistan. I wondered why we went to Iraq, tho to be honest I did wish to volunteer for the invasion, and later felt foolish for that. I deployed not in the mindset of making the world safe, protecting America, making life better for Iraqis, I deployed in the mindset of protecting my soldiers and doing all I could to make sure they came home safe, with doing the least amount of damage possible to the people and property in Iraq. And in case you&#39;re interested, despite being combat arms and going on over 350 to 400 patrols, I never killed anyone. Only really shot warning shots are cars that got too close. I saw the effects of sectarian violence, and made up my mind they were better off under Saddam Hussein. </p>

<p>Like I said, I do believe in law an order. I don&#39;t believe in giving up my rights to achieve that. I believe I have the right to drive past a DUI checkpoint without stopping, because I don&#39;t drink. I believe in stop light cameras, buy they need to be vastly improved and fail proofed. I believe in gun background checks because sometimes felons do try to buy guns legitimately. I do believe that a law abiding citizen should be able to own a semi auto rifle with 30 round mags. I believe in concealed carry. I do believe there are aggressive and psychopathic and abusive police officers, and I believe there are great good officers who really are police for the idealistic dream of making their community better for everyone. I believe weed should be legal. I believe our troops should be in mexico if anywhere, destroying drug cartels. That&#39;s what directly affects America. I&#39;d say a bunch of the gun related gang violence in america can be directly attributed to drug trafficking. </p>

<p>So take that as compartmentalized or brainwashed or a shill, but I&#39;m not entirely on one side of the fence or the other. </p>

<p>And thanks for having a civil conversation without calling me a Jew shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re certainly entitled to that opinion, but I think redirecting the discussion through tangential arguments is a large and effective issue.</p>

<p>One of the most effective ways to get someone off topic is to put them on the defensive about something that is outside the subject.</p>

<p>A great example is creating a debate about Zionism vs Judaism in a discussion about whether or not it&#39;s prudent to allow holders of dual Israeli/American citizenship into some of the higher levels of government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep been here for a year + and have noticed an invasion of people trying to steer people onto a more mainstream line.  It used to be a place where a person could float an idea and people, if they disagreed, would state why they disagreed in a constructive, friendly and considerate manner. Now it&#39;s all sarcastic comments and &quot;lol, you&#39;re all dumb&quot; type statements. They&#39;ve really brought the tone of the place down from cooperative to combative. Not to mention the use of downvotes to bury opinions that are both anti mainstream and hard to refute. ( preemptive edit : I, and I think most of the subreddit don&#39;t care about reddit points we just want the best stuff to rise to the top and not be buried by close minded zealots. ) Unfortunately all we can really do is ignore them. remember a troll wants most of all to engage you in their game. If you don&#39;t engage they are lost ( unless you have a zinger or a well reasoned post that trumps them ) . </p>

<p>People are trying to do a similar thing with 4chan however the focus is much more trying to turn it into a &quot;nice&quot; place ( every joke or topic that&#39;s not politically correct gets put down to edgy teenagers. It&#39;s annoying because everyone knows /b/ is a cesspool - but at least it was funny in it&#39;s political incorrectness ) </p>

<p>OP thanks for making this post. You&#39;re not the only one that has noticed this trend.</p>

<p>You say you&#39;re open to other&#39;s opinions, but you really aren&#39;t.  Because you&#39;ll never accept that most other people&#39;s opinions is that people like you are stupid, and embarrassing, and completely pathetic.</p>

<p>Oh, I know, more insults.  But there really is no way to address your arguments without insults.

<p>Free speech is one of the foundations of this country and just because you don&#39;t like what someone may have to say doesn&#39;t mean they are destroying the country by saying it. </p>

<p>I was wondering how long it was going to take before someone started spewing the anti-semitic hate speech.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just curious: how many confederate flags are on your pickup truck?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Zionism is not Judaism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is correct. </p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Zionism is a form of nationalism of Jews and Jewish culture that supports a Jewish nation state in the territory defined as the Land of Israel. Zionism supports Jews upholding their Jewish identity, opposes the assimilation of Jews into other societies and has advocated the return of Jews to Israel as a means for Jews to be a majority in their own nation, and to be liberated from antisemitic discrimination, exclusion, and persecution that had historically occurred in the diaspora.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Poruss stated that Reddit is &quot;infested&quot; with people that support someone having a Jewish identity and that these people are&quot;parasitic trash.&quot; </p>

<p>The definition of anti-semitism is &quot;The intense dislike for and prejudice against Jewish people.&quot;</p>

<p>So how is what he said NOT anti-semitism? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would love to be invited just to see how reasonable and logical the arguments for and against specific theories are.  </p>

<p>I tend to lock on to really obvious inconsistencies when it comes to conspiracies.  Take Sandy Hook.  While I don&#39;t believe for a second the parents are paid actors (impossible to keep that kind of information quiet),  I do find it strange that the authorities have not released a tape showing Adam Lanza approaching the school.</p>

<p>From what I gather, the school had multiple cameras that should have caught these images.  Columbine video was released showing those two jerkoffs. Why not Sandy Hook?  I&#39;m not saying I want to see kids getting shot,  just release a video showing Adam Lanza with rifle in hand approaching the school.  It&#39;s not traumatic footage and it would go a long way toward killing off the conspiracy theories surrounding that story.</p>

<p>That is the depth of my speculation and questioning with respect to conspiracies.  </p>

<p>Pretty telling that a bunch of &#39;free thinkers&#39; want to cut down honest discourse.</p>

<p>EDIT: Ya know what? These downvotes are fascinating. You all think I am some anti-conspiracy shill. That is the furthest thing from the truth that is possible. I ACTUALLY tend to think this issue could stand some sincere scrutiny.  But y&#39;all need to do your homework better. Read some Karl Popper: evidence of a theory is not a bunch of shit that suggests something is true. If you come up with a hypothesis, you need to do your absolute utmost to FALSIFY that theory. Because A SINGLE bit of contradictory evidence destroys the theory. This subreddit asks amazing questions but then stumbles when they re-interpret their questions as the actual answers. I was tryin to make you better. But ya know what, fuck you all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I think that we can all agree, this being the internet, that we all end up reading the words of some not-so-stable individuals, and I don&#39;t just mean on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  Or just assholes.  Or trolls.  Or people who are <em>way</em> too high to post coherently, sometimes.</p>

<p>The conspiracy theorist in me, though, wonders whether or not anyone interested in disrupting the free flow information might not just post a bunch of <em>clearly</em> insane gibberish in order to drive away reasonable people who might actually learn a thing or two.  </p>

<p>Now, of course, I consider myself a reasonable person so I get to be the <em>victim</em> of that, and feeling that way can color my perceptions.  All I know is that, from time to time, I stop going to conspiracy sites (not just <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>) because I get tired of reading some of the <em>really</em> out there stuff and especially the faulty logic that people try to present as fact.</p>

<p>I dunno.  In the end, what <em>I</em> know or don&#39;t know probably/surely doesn&#39;t make the slightest bit of difference.  A lot of people attach way too much importance to themselves, personally, which isn&#39;t helpful.</p>

To my mind, if you look at the extreme ends of the spectrum, one group tends to create elaborate, far reaching and honestly completely unbelievable conspiracies that shatters the credulity of reasonable people.  </p>

<p>The other group asks reasonable questions, analyses available data and discounts that which is impossible or highly unlikely.  They then draw conclusions that are at least plausible including the idea that a conspiracy might be at play.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are opposed to people questioning the people questioning the status quo?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t have one without the other.  If you really want discourse you are going to have people say your ideas are shit.  It goes with the territory.</p>

<p>I am very interested in conspiracies.  What I am not interested in is blindly accepting theories with absolutely no evidence.  If you want a make believe subreddit go ahead and make up fanciful stories, but if you post in a place that calls for critical thinking and evidence based reason then expect someone to challenge your theories.</p>

<p>I am very interested in black programs, weapons development, cyber warfare, secret government agencies or military units. Instead I get a daily bombing of ridiculous made up headlines with not a shred of evidence.  Then people get angry when you point out there is no evidence.</p>

<p>If you have an interesting theory, promote it as a theory but be honest you have no evidence.  Certainly don&#39;t make statements you cannot back up in your OP. And don&#39;t downvote when someone correctly calls you out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This wave of people comming in from the mainstream part of reddit is not doing us good as you would like to believe. Sure they make very good points, points that would make them a valuable asset here, but while making a good point they will turn around and in the same phrase trash this subreddit and everyone in it as nuts. Thats unacceptable. They feel themselvs to be better then us, thats why they use sarcasm and generalizations. </p>

<p>They are not helping the community they are destroying it by hatefull comments. Comments that rile up people into flame wars. </p>

<p>I have said it once and I will say it again. Those who are not &quot;awake&quot; (I know I hate this word) are living in a COMPLETELY different paradigm. I have a friend and I started to talk to him about all the shit thats going on. He never believed me, now that he is seeing Boston unfold and my previous comments to him he is beginning to wake up. Thats what we have to do. Plant seeds of the future and when that future is unfolded before them they will suddenly realize that we were correct.</p>

<p>Alex Jones how nutty he may be sometimes, has foretold many many things. Things that were not apparent in the time when he said them. Like homegrown terrorism, and how citizens will be targeted as terrorists. To be honest I didn&#39;t see how they were going to pull that off, but guess what?! They did pull it off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL</p>

<p>So people disagree with you, and then you make a new conspiracy about users being paid to purposely distort your already distorted imagination!</p>

<p>That&#39;s rich!</p>

<p>To me, the people who see a tragedy are profoundly curious and naturally want all the answers. It&#39;s okay to be scared but when you let your fear and paranoia consume you, then you see with a sort of tunnel vision. There&#39;s also the natural teen rebellion and angst which is glaringly apparent here. There&#39;s also the attention seekers. You feel like something can&#39;t possibly be going on that&#39;s bigger than you so you &#39;get invlolved&#39; and jump into the circle jerk. When I saw people suggest that the man with the cowboy hat was an FX specialist for hollywood I couldn&#39;t help feel disgust. Like people are dying and all you can think of doing is pushing your half baked anti establishment message. Like I said though, in tragedy with no one to blame we tend to think of the easiest person to blame, the government. It gives people comfort to feel like they got it all figured out, when in reality we&#39;re all a bunch of chickens running around with our heads cut off.</p>

<p>And just to clarify, there is NO SUCH THING as mainstream media. It&#39;s what YOU CHOOSE to pay attention to. I don&#39;t watch the news because a) They don&#39;t report news, they push an agenda sought by the corporate entities which manage them. It&#39;s not conspiracy, it&#39;s capitalism and it&#39;s the way things have been since before the Revolutionary war. b)If you want actual up-to-the-date info, rather then a bunch of bumbling idiots who say the same paranoid, delusional bullshit I see on here your gunna want to go with social media.</p>

<p>The best thing people can do. What CNN should have done, is realize and understand this is a chaotic and tragic event and that misinformation will be flying left and right which you need to take with a grain of salt. Realize your not a part of the situation, your computer screen DOES NOT hand you all the facts nor does it even come close.</p>

<p>If anything you should be concerned about NRA trolls who are trying to sell sell sell by establishing an irrational and baseless fear that this or that will be banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please, quit making me laugh. Some of you really don&#39;t belong here, and it&#39;s not those who disagree with you that don&#39;t belong. It&#39;s those who think up the most erroneous stories in there head and then cry about people calling them out for what they are, that is, fools.</p>

<p>Also, there is nothing more insulting than to accuse suffering people to be behind some crap conspiracy. It&#39;s also ironic how you call people out for negativity when in reality, the people who look at anything and see conspiracy are the most negative people I&#39;ve seen on this board. They are filled to the brim with hate and yearn for the chance to reap vengeance on the monsters they&#39;ve thought up.</p>

<p>So either keep crying or actually come up with a legitimate argument. If you can&#39;t handle people disagreeing with you then gtfo yourself.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with having a theory with some ground to stand on. But at the same time, how can you encourage people to participate if they arent allowed to not believe your theory or discuss (read: not argue or flame) the other side?</p>

<p>&quot;If you are not providing new evidence or reasonable speculation that furthers the current discussion please withhold your comments.&quot;</p>

<p>This will cause them to devolve the argument into personal attacks. At this point you can ignore them and move on as they have proved your point that they are incapable of adding to the discussion.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen countless attacks upon the contributors of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> recently but very little counter-argument.

    <div class="md"><p>A conspiracy is defined as simply 2 or more people that collude in a crime.</p>

<p>&quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; was literally a term coined during the time of the JFK Assassination investigations and the Warren Commission for the sole purpose of discrediting what were called &quot;Assassination Theories&quot; at that time.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t really mater if people think a &#39;conspiracy&#39; is not possible - they are and history has proven that.  To what extent can&#39;t really be known in every case.  I think of it this way, yes, I am going to use the &quot;Nazi&quot; example - as the Germans did not actually know the full truth that the Nationalist Socialists actually lied to them, including the Reichstag False Flag incident until the Nuremburg Trials.  At that moment it became Historical Record - even though many Germans were wary of the Nazi&#39;s and believed they were being lied to, but many were duped.  Victors write history and those Empires that fall we learn about what heinous things they did to their citizens.  The U.S. and other Western Nations are no different in Modern times - being deceitful, using the media as propaganda (admitted facts by intelligence agencies and whistle-blowers), false pretense for war (examples of admitted historical facts where these wars started by false flags or deceit - Vietnam, Gulf War 1, and Gulf War 2) and answering to the mighty Petro-Dollar.  This is all information out in the open.  So by definition, if an act to cover up crimes against humanity, like the say the Apache gunning down civilians and journalists from the leaked Manning video, not evidence of a &#39;conspiracy of the willing&#39;?  People colluded to keep it from the public eyes to hide behind a veil of &#39;national security.&#39;  I could go on and on about multiple subjects, I&#39;ve practically researched them all and read other people&#39;s research.</p>

<p>Why should any of that be a surprise to anyone?  Label it what you want you want, it is what it is.  Certainly known by paid trolls the OP post was alluding to.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ll know our our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.&quot; - William Casey, CIA Director 1981</p>

<p>&quot;The CIA worked very closely with them and United States supported Saddam Hussein at every level - gave him arms, gave him money, gave him political backing, the military helped him; none of this is really fully understood by the American people.&quot; - Peter Camejo</p>

<p>Take General Clark, for example, when in 2007 he admitted facts, on Democracy Now, about the wars the U.S. in which plans were conspired from think tanks in the Pentagon and White House far in advance to take out Iraq, Libya, Syria, and finishing off with Iran.  When you have people in high places like Generals laying out information for people, it is no longer a theory.</p>

<p>This can only go so far before the general public realizes they are being duped.  And people might ask, why, why would they be deceitful and commit crimes against the public?  A means to an end why else, to protect interests, to further Imperial agendas - again, as shown through History.  Humans are not perfect, but we&#39;re getting better from our dark past history  - those that seek power for instance tend to follow what I think are the detrimental cultural &#39;memes&#39; that lead people down paths of corruption, like narcissism or machiavellianism - and we don&#39;t live in some sort of Utopic World Peace group of nation cultures like Star Trek or whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hear, hear.  And well said.  </p>

<p>Although it&#39;s linked in the sidebar, I have found it handy to keep <a href="http://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htm">The Gentleperson&#39;s Guide To Forum Spies</a> open in a large print text file behind my browser window so I can read it often and constantly remind myself of the varyious techniques being used.  Newcomers (who are not shills) unfamiliar with this information should read it very slowly and very carefully.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s harder for certain people to deal when they are faced with sudden, massive cognitive dissonance.   In the early 90&#39;s I told an s/o before dumping him that what I despised most about him was his obsession with conspiracy theories.  I remember reading in the local free paper every year the <a href="http://www.projectcensored.org/">Top 25 underreported stories of the year</a> and feeling my tenuously happy life suddenly fill with gloom and horror.  I forcibly turned my head away and tried like hell to forget.  But this stuff kept coming up and eventually - 10 years later - I started actively reading and learning.  It was in the mid-2000&#39;s when I realized there even was a building 7 and then what happened to it.  I was news obsessed after it happened and I just couldn&#39;t believe that it didn&#39;t register wiht me at the  time.  I really feel there is some mass hypnosis happening via media.  </p>

<p>But it&#39;s also isolating if you start talking about it to others and no one likes to lose friends.  It&#39;s worse if these people are still around you every day - the stares and whispers.  I guess I&#39;m trying to find a place where I can feel empathy for some of the newbies and their caustic comments.  I used to be a bleeding heart and I still can be at times.  </p>

<p>But in the end, I believe it&#39;s best to know the truth, or at least be on your way to knowing it, and wanting to know it.   You get used to the heavy heart that  comes from understanding how awful the ones running this joint really are.  </p>

<p>I feel very soon that this stuff will go full-on mainstream and there will be some serious defections, public ones by well known talking heads in the msm.  Maybe something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTN3s2iVKKI">Network</a> but not so crazy.  (Olbermann was good.)  </p>

<p>Freethought is a philosophical viewpoint that holds that opinions should be formed on the basis of science, logic, and reason, and should not be influenced by authority, tradition, or any <strong>dogma</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine.  What <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> routinely fails to comprehend is that it <em>isn&#39;t</em> a &quot;bastion for free-thinking&quot;, if anything it&#39;s a dogmatic echo-chamber.</p>

<p>The dogmatic principle of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is similar to the religious fundamentalists in that &#39;everything is a result of x&#39;.  For the religious &#39;x = god&#39; for the conspiracists &#39;x = grand, overarching conspiracy&#39;.</p>

<p>Within hours of any tragic, wide-reaching event <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> routinely deems said event to be the result of a grand, overarching conspiracy - without fail.  That&#39;s this sub&#39;s &#39;status quo&#39;.</p>

<p>You allude to the fact that a dogmatic echo-chamber that actively silences dissent is what you want as the result of being a &#39;freethinker&#39; without even the <em>slightest</em> hint of irony - for those of us who actually understand critical thinking and free thought this can be simultaneously hilarious and infuriating, giving us urges to post to try to correct you, and what we do we get?</p>

<p>Accusations of being &#39;paid shills&#39;, &#39;trolls&#39;, &#39;government agents&#39;, &#39;sheeple&#39;, etc.  What we also get is users that create whiny threads simply as an attempt to gain support from like-minded individuals because that&#39;s the conspiracist&#39;s inherent problem: they can&#39;t convince anyone that isn&#39;t already convinced. Furthermore they conclude that every time someone tells them they&#39;re wrong, they must be right creating a false-reality where they can <em>never</em> be wrong.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR: <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is dogma, not free thought.</strong></p>

<p>There is no fallacy here. Never did Puddle say that conspiracies do not exist, and whether they do or not makes no difference to the arguement that the conversations are dogmatic, and not free thought. As was pointed out, it isn&#39;t &quot;free thought&quot; to point out a non-mainstream way of thinking, and then not accept any opinions that differ from your own. </p>

<p>I think we all agree that conspiracies exist. But you don&#39;t get credit for correctly labeling conspiracies when you cry &quot;conspiracy!&quot; about everything and one ends up being right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact is that reporting news in real time is difficult to do. We witnessed the big news agencies fuck it up earlier in the week. We watched reddit and other internet sleuths fuck it up just as badly (albeit to less fanfare, because inaccurate fourth hand observation is a trivial result).</p>

<p>We should come to an agreement that the accuracy of news is inversely proportional to latency. We should come to an agreement that, given such a complex system, the only way to improve is with investment in scientific research and development. </p>

<p>We are just beginning to cope with the speed of modern human communication. The social uproar is evidence of such a gap. Economic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash">flash-crashes</a> are evidence of the same at smaller time scales.</p>

<p>I love the occasional conspiracy theory...but we mustn&#39;t dull Occam&#39;s Razor over every incident. <strong>Requisite acceptance of weakly sourced conspiracy theories are precisely the reason why real conspiracies are allowed to hide in plain sight</strong>. </p>

<p>Did anyone try challenging this?  I wonder what would have happened if you took your dog out for a walk past the swat teams when they were searching house to house.  I think it would have gone from &quot;your being advised&quot; to &quot;your being ordered&quot; to stay inside.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I know that not everyone in Watertown was inside their homes for all of yesterday. I have friends that were outside for various reasons. I also think there is a difference between - and again, your logic comes into play here, which is lost on some it seems - between being either within very close proximity to say, the boat or suspect for instance, or a swat team doing searches, and being 2 blocks away and needing to take the dog out to take a piss. </p>

<p>If you live next door to the boat, or the house next to you is being swept and you decide to waltz out your front door, you are probably going to be told to not move/get down/etc because they are looking for someone and you are in close proximity. The same with living next door to boat guy and deciding to go outside when there are weapons trained on people in the area. </p>

<p>If you were 2 blocks away and went outside and a cop saw you, I&#39;m sure he&#39;d recommend you go inside, but you aren&#39;t going to be arrested on sight. People in town were getting updates from police and asking them questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get not interfering with a police investigation which is illegal and will get you arrested.  It just seems odd that the governor told Boston residents to stay in place and everyone, or at least most, complied.  Seems rather excessive to my mind.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from the city so I take this closer to the heart than most. Boston is a small city. I would have been watching the marathon had I not been at Logan - but the thoughts of myself and pretty much everyone I talked to during this week were &quot;holy shit, that&#39;s right down the road&quot; or &quot;I walk that street everyday&quot; or &quot;They&#39;re shooting in front of a bar I love&quot;. I know for a fact that all of my friends complied because they had no interest in being outside. It is very easy to get around and in the early hours of what was going on it was very possible for these guys to be in a completely different section of town in a matter of minutes, as you saw going from Copley to MIT to Watertown. I would have absolutely been sticking my head out the door at a reasonable distance but I have no interest in stray bullets or being mistaken for a suspect if I was in close proximity. Most businesses shut down so people didn&#39;t really have a reason to go out with the T being closed as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I get self preservation but from a probability standpoint you likely never would have been in that much danger from the suspect.   </p>

<p>I think back to the DC shootings when Malvo and company were indiscriminately sniping people all over the area.  How long did that go on?  Weeks if I recall correctly. The authorities certainly didn&#39;t close down DC or suggest that people not go to work.  People just went about their business and hoped they wouldn&#39;t be the next victim.  I have a sister who lived about a quarter mile from one the shootings.  Yes they were a little freaked but her and her family still went about their business.</p>

<p>IDK, this was a strange way to go about apprehending this guy.  I can&#39;t think of another case where an entire city was closed down for want of capturing one dangerous suspect.  </p>

<p>If you think about the power of this one individual who had already been widely identified and was on the run, against an entire city, it seems that he wasn&#39;t that much of an overall threat.  IMO the military style door to door search was reminiscent of Iraq or Afghanistan and is a disturbing portend of things to come.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The line of thought some people have been taking here recently is that of &quot;everything bad that happens is part of The Big Conspiracy&quot; </p>

<p>People are spreading ideas, yes, I get that, and I think that´s a good thing. But a noticeable amount of people have been making <em>assertions</em>, <em>judgements</em>, that have no base or solid reasoning behind them. Ideas that if true, would require a level of complexity in their execution that is, to many people, unfathomable. </p>

<p>I think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is hurting itself by jumping to incredible conclusions. I saw somebody yesterday contending that none of the Boston manhunt was actually happening; no real people being chased, no real shootouts happening, no real bombs going off. </p>

<p>That to me looks like narrow minded thinking. And your request for people who don´t accept the general reasoning of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to go somewhere else looks like incredibly narrow minded thinking. </p>

<p>I believe that it is a good thing in the search for truth and knowledge to criticise yourself, and not accept the first thing you think, or the first thing somebody tells you to think, whether that is from a news source or a discussion forum. </p>

<p>So I think what you´re advocating is a curtailment of free discussion and free thought. Nevermind how some of the more extravagant claims are hurting this subreddit and alienating potential readers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like that&#39;s the type of thing that comes along with talking about conspiracies. It&#39;s a very touchy subject, for obvious reasons. I came here a few days ago initially to see what people had figured out or were talking about because I myself was becoming skeptical of the things I was seeing on the news and on social media. But, I can honestly say it wasn&#39;t long before I wanted looked elsewhere. All I can see is a lot of misinformation and plenty of ego to go around which is a bad mix for any kind of discussion about these types of events, and I mean that on both sides of the arguments. It&#39;s incredibly easy to make a conspiracy out of something and I think that may be the problem. Questioning things is fine, but calling someone a sheeple because their &quot;eyes aren&#39;t open to the truth&quot; or that &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot; is just immaturity and internet childishness in its prime.</p>

<p>&quot;What I meant is that you focused entirely on the threat, spun it into wild and crazy paranoid fantasy, and in doing so pretty much demonstrated that you have no grip on reality.</p>

<p>Basically what I&#39;m trying to tell you is that in complaining about this guy&#39;s insulting comment, you have pretty effectively demonstrated the personality traits that inspired the comment.</p>

<p>TL;DR: After reading a few of your comments, I kinda want to tie you to a chair, throw a bucket of cold water in your face, and slap you silly until you come back to reality.</p>

<p>And no, I was never in the military&quot;</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not a paid shill and you&#39;re going around <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> calling people lunatics for questioning official statements. Stop wasting everyone&#39;s time and go to another subreddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a terrible attitude and absolutely NOT what <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was back when it was started.</p>

<p>If people come up with a conspiracy theory, they should be expected to defend it with evidence.  They should expect this evidence to be questioned by others.</p>

<p>This is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, not <a href="/r/fantasy">/r/fantasy</a>.  </p>

<p>The reason why conspiracy theories are looked down on by mainstream society is because there&#39;s a lunatic fringe within it who make the rest of us look insane.  This is the rod which they use to beat us with.  The only way to have any sort of credibility is to present your point balls out with your evidence and allow it to tell its own story.</p>

<p>The reason that 9/11 conspiracy theories are in the mainstream is because people took the time to present compelling evidence that the official story was not the way it went down.  People responded to this and made their own judgements.</p>

<p>Questioning official statements is perfectly rational and fine but there&#39;s too many things like &quot;the Jews did (insert event)&quot;, the Monsanto Protection Act bunch of crap, and &quot;aliens invaded my cellar&quot; that are heavily upvoted and it makes us look ridiculous and allows the powerbrokers to group us all in together and readily dismiss anything out of hand.</p>

<p>The only way to fight the system is to not become part of it. Allowing badly researched theories with no evidence supporting it to become part of the fabric that &quot;everybody knows&quot; in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is the EXACT role in the system that they designed for you.  Don&#39;t fall into it, let evidence do the talking.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>However, today there is a contingent of paid shills, jerks, or both who en masse discourage any theories that question the authorities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the people who DO question events in the news are paid shills, jerks or both who en masse are planting seeds of doubt to destroy normal sane life.</p>

<p>Not upheave the existing authority (set us sheeples &#39;free&#39;) - but, to create confusion and chaos for the purposes of harming us. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t feel right in being a &#39;sheeple&#39;, because you choose to, which is fine. But, you hate people like me so much, that you want me to feel fear and terror about my very normal and sane life. So, you attempt to poison my thinking. </p>

<p>I think there is an organized attempt to just cause havoc and chaos. It&#39;s human nature to destroy and harm others,.. just because. </p>

<p>I totally agree that the war on Iraq was unwarranted. However, I do not think events like 9/11, Boston bombing, etc. were done by our own government to restrict, control and harm us. Nonetheless, forums like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are like a soapbox, where malcontents do not like anything associated with normal human living - and take events of aggression/hate and claim that the entity which essentially establishes and allows me to live a normal human life, is the cause of it.  </p>

<p>The government isn&#39;t responsible to make sure I eat 3 healthy meals a day, get fresh air and enjoy life - I am. And, I do. </p>

<p>And, the government isn&#39;t responsible for when some maniac blows him/herself up in front of me - they are (the maniac). For such a thing to happen, the government makes mistakes in preventing it (at times), but they are not intended nor desired. </p>

<p>So, my normal sane life, becomes chaotic when one and/or two things occurs; </p>

<p>1) some random maniac decides to harm me in an act of terror (again, 9/11, etc.)</p>

<p>2) some paid shill, jerk or both en masse plants seeds of doubt into this freshly upturned event (again, 9/11, etc.)</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and others alike KNOW that even if every terrorist organized a world wide event to harm innocent people, that it would STILL not bring suffering, confusion and chaos to everyone,... so, the organized havoc and chaos makers take to such forums (again, soapboxes) and start making claims it was all from our own government. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is the tip of a large iceberg - where OPs pretend they are &#39;looking out&#39; for us normal sane people. You want us to feel fear, horror and terror, by attempting to poison our thinking.</p>

<p>You are not looking to free us, enlighten us or educate us. You are looking to flat out harm us. </p>

<p>You are angry because of whatever personal reasons and are taking it out on us, by attempting to create a fervor. You refuse to accept any facts and proof, because they would deter you from planting that seed of doubt and seizing the opportunity to spread your own personal suffering and self loathing. </p>

<p>It makes perfect sense really. You can not be a happy person, so, you spread your own misery by tainting those who do indeed feel safe and OK with their own lives. They won&#39;t suffer like you do (again, because of whatever personal reasons make you feel awful), so, you attack &#39;the establishment&#39; to create suffering and fear, on the same level you suffer; the mind. </p>

<p>And, there are many like you. And, you are organized, via these soapboxes. </p>

<p><strong>So, I am here to call out the call outs.</strong> You are not calling out events of terror, to point out they were done by our own government. You are using events of terror to spread doubt, fear and personal mental suffering - much like how you yourself are feeling. </p>

<p>THAT is the biggest conspiracy of all; a hive mind of miserable people who are trying very very hard to spread their suffering. Possibly in hope of alleviating their own?? I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>But, know this, you alone control your feelings. You do not control the events that trigger your feelings (9/11 &amp; <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s organized attempts to spread fear, self doubt and terror), but you control what you feel from these event. And, there are quite a few of use that won&#39;t let terror events and malcontents make us feel what we do not want to feel. </p>

<p>8: You&#39;re only hurting your movement</p>

<p>6: That&#39;s not a reputable enough source  / not mainstream enough</p>

<p>5: That source is too main stream</p>

<p>4: If it&#39;s the truth then why doesn&#39;t everyone believe it</p>

<p>2:  herp derp tin foil hate hat herp derp</p>

In my opinion, asking questions and postulating anything but the official story, which has proven to be completely wrong before is not even outlandish, but the media has gotten us to the point where even doubting their makes you sound like a back-woods, tin-foil hat wearing lunatic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a double sided coin. You can say your thoughts, but people also have the right to disagree. That is part of freedom is it not? Do you want this to be a circlejerk or do you want this to be a healthy forum where ideas are discussed and everybody, not just the people with the same opinion, gets to weigh in? It sounds like you want this to be a simple circlejerk where people who may disagree with what you are saying shouldn&#39;t be allowed to voice their opinion. People should be able to discuss their theories in a mature manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking similar things for a while now.  I love reading the stuff on here and I find it interesting, but it&#39;s frustrating when all I read are insults to people who offer up unpopular theories.  They&#39;re not accepted...That&#39;s why they are theories.  If you want to argue, at least throw up some reasons why you disagree and facts and encourage everyone to post sources with their information.</p>

<p>This &quot;You&#39;re an idiot&quot; and &quot;I can&#39;t believe you believe this bull&quot; and the flying of insults and name-calling isn&#39;t productive at all.  Whenever I see this I always assume it&#39;s some 12 year old who is too lazy to look up anything intelligent to say, so they simply throw out insults.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve honestly considered quite a few times unsubscribing because of this, but I enjoy reading all of the other theories about historical events.  I am conflicted.</p>

<p>Problem we have here is that if it don&#39;t happen in there backyard or front or in somewhay disrpts there daily routine it is not real in there minds come on we live in a technolgy age of information in everything we use for daily life</p>

<p>From refridgerators that have tvs and cars that have satalite uplinks to monitor in case you have a crash it may not seam like it but it distances you from the reaity that control is the goals of government it has always been and always will be </p>

<p>I have given up trying to convince people anymore belive what you are told ignore those of us that question everything I understand and would hate to fracture your controled life</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This disturbs me too. A bunch of naysayers, downvoting anyone that questions. </p>

<p>r/conspiracy has become the defacto go to spot on the net for this type of content, making it easy to access and interact. every other site is commercialized to death  like abovetop, infowars, Icke forums etc.</p>

<p>THAT seems why. The front for the infowar in a sense. People on r/conspiracy are more suspicious of government entities than posters on r/anarchism... or maybe I should have wrote that in <em>past</em> tense. This reddit is hurting due to shills and bots. </p>

I have been feeling the exact same thing, I feel like ever since April fools day when there were jovial exchanges between sub-reddits; there seems to be a huge influx of people that are specifically on here just to down vote and criticize others who are doing some damn fine critical thinking. It seems like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has been compromised to an extent. Especially with the creation of conspiritard whose entire purpose is to discredit and make fun of people that spend time doing alternative research. The same type of research that acts like CISPA are made to essentially destroy the true mass communication that takes place around the internet at large. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually just joined Reddit. I came here because my brother is an avid Redditor and ran upstairs to tell my mother and I about the Tsarnaev brothers shooting the MIT security guy before any mass media sources in our area had reported it. I became curious about alternative explanations to the Boston Marathon so I signed up and have been lurking here a bit. However, isn&#39;t it possible that the free thinking and discussion is disintegrating because of increasingly idiotic posts? I mean some of the top posts boast &quot;evidence&quot; which are in reality just blurry pictures, with captions that contradict themselves. I was hoping for intellectual conversations &amp; theories .. I guess I will just have to dig deeper on this subreddit. I can see there ARE many intelligent people here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Downvoting is what has destroyed the conspiracy section. Just like in real life, you can get enough shills to cover the truth. It&#39;s fucked up but it&#39;s true. There should be a ban against that here. There should be no downvoting just because it hurts your feelings or it goes against your views. </p>

<p>If something here goes against your views, fucking FIGHT it with your sources and your intelligence. Not with internet reputation. Too many men and women have staked their actual lives on fighting government tyranny for anyone on this site to worry about their digital one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the disinformation is this: they come in and do their immediate damage and then melt away. It doesn&#39;t matter if &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; end up being right in the history books, politics are being manipulated by untruths today. Many conspiracy theories have been proven true by declassified documents, but this does not convince your average voter. The government and corporations knows they can get away with manipulating public opinion with impunity. The same dopes will keep getting fooled over and over again.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah these calls of internet vigilanteism bothered the crap out of me. We&#39;re a huge site with a metric assload of users - people are going to have opinions and speculations.  That&#39;s natural. Few people actually went overboard claiming, for example, that they knew for certain who the bombers were in those people who were id&#39;d as potential suspects.  Most of us knew that it was just speculation.  Yet I&#39;ve seen so much talk today on how reddit/4chan destroyed the lives of these people who were not the bombers.  I fail to see the connection.  The only destroying of their lives that was done was by official media sources who were stupid enough to assume we actually knew what we were talking about when ever we knew that we didn&#39;t know the answers and then plaster innocent peoples pictures all over everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God dammit this is sad how insular a supposed &quot;free thought&quot; community can be. People dont argue with you because you are questioning the official story and this enrages their sheeple instincts. They argue with you because they disagree with you.</p>

<p>Free speech doesnt mean a hugbox. You have the right to post stupid ideas and people have the right to disagree with them. This is the one thing I hate about the modern Alex Jones conspiritainment crowd, they care more about being part of some special enlightened group than finding the truth. </p>

<p>&quot;Why would someone who thinks conspiracy theories are crazy go to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in the first place. I don&#39;t go to <a href="/r/hinduism">/r/hinduism</a> to tell them that reincarnation is stupid.&quot; You see? Its like a religion now, questioning someones pet theory or calling it out for being stupid is like doing the same to the core tenant of a religion. </p>

<p>If you want to find the truth you need a free exchange of ideas, but when have the mindset that anyone who disagrees with you is a secret government agent contracted to give the clever illusion that people disagree with you on the internet, you arent going to get very far because you have completely closed yourself off to any negative feedback. This is known as confirmation bias.</p>

<p>And I was there for the Boston threads. People werent saying &quot;How dare you question our lord and savior Obama when ye are but a lowely prole.&quot; They were pointing out that we didnt know anything, all we had were newsreports that kept changing and a few shaking cell phone camera videos. Yet despite this complete blackout of information people were already forming elaborate theories about what happened and presenting them as unquestionable dogma that you must be a shill to even dream of doubting. </p>

<p>And yes, some people were insulting, this is the internet enjoy your stay. </p>

I don&#39;t think we should find a new sub, I still love this place. I think we just need to be more open with our new friends about how we don&#39;t want to hear their shit and how they should gtfo.</p>

<p>Challengers of the <em>mainstream</em> opinion has left a trail of steadily observable pattern of an influence that left evidence of itself throughout the ages.

    <div class="md"><p>Reading through these comments is surreal... shills up in arms circlejerking each others as usual. Signs that you are a shill:</p>

<ol>
<li>Being rude - calling names, crazy the usual &quot;conspiratard&quot; bashing</li>
<li>Denying the existence of paid shills</li>
<li>Pretending you agree with conspiracy theories in general but then contributing to the discussion in the aforementioned manner</li>
<li>Not agreeing with a post stating something so basic as this</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember, the main strategy of the shills is to focus on the comment section, it gives the curious people the impression that this community upvotes without investigating and sensationalizes, but when you investigate thoroughly you find someone who debunks it. The bashing serves to discourage people from opening their mouths. These tactics are transparent and getting old. Most of us see through this by now.</p>

<p>I left more than a year ago, after joining reddit in late 07. I was the mod on two popular (but nsfw) subs (find the two with created by: deleted). </p>

<p>Anyway, as a tinfoil hat appreciator, I noticed exactly what you mention.</p>

<p>But like, almost a year ago now. I can&#39;t remember what it was that pushed me over the edge.</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<p>It became obvious to me, and it is obvious to you, that reddit is totally sold out and that the admins MUST be complicit. The whole site is rigged, and being used as a social control mechanism to distribute the common narrative. </p>

<p>The only option is to leave the site. I only came by today to see if r/conspiracy was talking about cispa. </p>

<p>Nope. </p>

<p>Just continuing to eat itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the disinformation is this: they come in and do their immediate damage and then melt away. It doesn&#39;t matter if &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; end up being right in the history books, politics are being manipulated by untruths today. Many conspiracy theories have been proven true by declassified documents, but this does not convince your average voter. The government and corporations knows they can get away with manipulating public opinion with impunity. The same dopes will keep getting fooled over and over again. I am sick and tired of your average person automatically accepting the official story by default when it&#39;s provably false time and time again.</p>

<p>Guys like you are the ultimate Useful Idiots.  You spout off these asinine, ludicrous and completely unhinged theories, and then when people point out that you&#39;re a clueless fuckwit, you demand that they leave.</p>

<p><strong>No.</strong></p>

<p>You leave.  Get the fuck out of here, and take all your asshole friends with you.  Nobody cares about your wild speculation, your fact-free paranoia, or your pathetic persecution complex.  We want to talk about real conspiracy theories, based on real evidence.  You want people to applaud when you masturbate in public.</p>

<p>Fuck off, you tin foil hat wearing loser.  You aren&#39;t a conspiracy theorist, you&#39;re an unhinged, paranoia whack job, and you make people who actually care about what is really going on look stupid.</p>

<p>The internet is a debate. It&#39;s two opposing ideas that will almost never come to a consensus. The only thing that matters is presenting an argument that clearly describes you&#39;re side for the interpretation of the masses.</p>
