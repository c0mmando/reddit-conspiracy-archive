I just think its a little weird. Wouldn&#39;t there be a substantial amount of damage caused from these explosions? And don&#39;t all police vehicles have cameras in the dash? Maybe I just missed it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy who had his car stolen said that they told him that they were the marathon bombers. Why would they say more than &quot;get out of the car&quot;? </p>

<p>Just like when Dorner supposedly tried to hijack a boat and told the boat&#39;s owner that he was taking it to Mexico. If he was running from authorities why would he tell someone where he was going?</p>

<p>The government thinks we are absolute idiots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) I&#39;m not reading that because a whole Hospital isn&#39;t going to decide to leak a photo, just one of it&#39;s employees.</p>

<p>2) The &quot;change&quot; is a weak censoring of the gore within the picture.</p>

<p>3) The hole in his chest is not from an explosion. It&#39;s a emergency procedure to get to his heart, hoping to resuscitate him. Forgot the name of the procedure, but it was said all over Reddit. (It&#39;s a big word and I&#39;m stupid)</p>

<p>4) Based on the blasts on Monday that wiped off meat off shin bones, or just leg clean off the victim&#39;s body, I doubt that one of their bombs would have done a small wound like that, as apposed to creating a creator in his chest.</p>

<p>The explosives may have been on him, but they obviously didn&#39;t go off.</p>

The shootout appeared to have happened in Watertown, Laurel Street 61.
There is this eyewitness Andrew Kitzenberg who described some of the things he saw and the pics he made and posted on his twitter are the only things we have as footage of this happening. </p>
