       When I saw the police barging their ways into homes, I was shocked. Of course I can understand that they were looking for the suspected bomber, but that just really kind of scared me. It does show a police state. People laugh about

       What I'm seeing here is sensationalist hype in order to slander something that didn't exactly happen and fearmonger for personal political views.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         People were allowed to leave their homes at any time of the day, yet chose not to.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It was not the entire city, it was only a section of the city that they've pinned the suspect hiding in.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The police did not come barging into homes without permission. They've asked and were allowed in by the homeowners to do a quick search for the suspect. Why did they search people's homes? In case the bomber decided to take a family hostage or was hiding, which he was doing when they caught him hiding under a tarp in someone's backyard. No, the homeowner was not arrested for that.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Once they've captured the suspect, all of the forces quickly packed up and headed off, leaving the homeowners further free to do what they so wish.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As for being over-the-top armed SWAT teams and police in bulletproof vests scouring the area? ...Why not? Do you want a repeat of the 1995 North Hollywood bank robbery where the LAPD couldn't even handle taking down two heavily armed men because of being under-equipped? ..Especially so given the fact that during the first shootout with the brothers in Boston by
         <strong>
          NORMAL
         </strong>
         police officers, they were using grenades along with firearms against the officers that resulted in multiple wounded men. I'll clarify that for you: They were using
         <strong>
          MILITARY-GRADE WEAPONS
         </strong>
         against officers and you're claiming the Police were over-reacting with their gear and equipment? Redditor, please!
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>

       <strong>
        Final statement:
       </strong>
       Everything I've said here is backed up by other comments in this thread. So no, I do not agree with OP here but stated why and I'm allowed to share my opposing viewpoint as given by the moderators of this subreddit.

       Also, everyone outside of Boston do not seem to realize that there wouldn't be anything to do even if they wanted to leave their house. Tons of stores were closed, events were cancelled, people may as well relaxed at home until it was all over.

       This is r/conspiracy. Chill out and let everyone have their fun. Why are you so intent on debunking theories? Using words like "fearmonger" and "slander"? Theorizing on conspiracies is what we do here. You need to calm down.

       Because the original post was worded in such a way as to continue the rhetoric that the entire city was under some sort of Orwellian oppression. This is exactly the kind of thing fearmongers like Alex Jones profit from.

       I agree. I don't believe this incident was planned. But it should be interesting to see what happens within the next month. Everyone is saying stuff is going to go down late April/May. Maybe a "copycat" bomber on a larger scale?

       Sorry I don't have any links but I have seen people form theories that something bigger is being planned soon. You are correct, him saying "everyone" is poor word choice, obviously not everyone is saying it. But for the people that follow the theory that all these tragic events are a way to strip us of our rights, they claim there is a coming event that will set all this "police state/stripping of rights" stuff in to full gear. Again, sorry I don't have the links of people saying this but I'm sure you can agree that there would at least be SOME people thinking this will happen.

       That is the date of the US assault weapons ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US has slowly been passing gun regulation legislation at the federal and statewide levels for years. Even now they want to ban how many bullets you can have in your magazine. How many bullets can be fired per/trigger pull, and what accessories you can have.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are taxing bullets, and making it harder for people to purchase firearms.

       The federal government prohibited the manufacture certain semi-automatic firearms for civilian use. The ban only applied to weapons manufactured after the date of the ban's enactment.

       first of all, those were not tanks, 2nd of all you should read the constitution, there is something called
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exigent_circumstance_in_United_States_law">
        Exigent circumstance
       </a>
       . I know its inconvenient to read the constitution and all of its amendments, but it is essential that we do not lose sight of what its meaning and purpose is, no matter how inconvenient it is for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       and as for guns being taken away, I refer to the earlier guys comments. They will never go door to door to take away guns from people because guns became illegal, and if/when that bill passes I will be on your side, but until that law is even being discussed (which it is not) then stop giving into fear mongers such as Alex Jones. He and others like him, are profiting from fear, and it is unhealthy to the American conscience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, having opposing views and having conversations discussed does not make it a useless conversation, maybe a frustrating one for you, but it is not useless, when you start shutting out other peoples ideals and only listening to your own then you are no better than the "men you fear"

       Are you referring to the policy that was ruled unconstitutional?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, they banned a type of weapon for a time.  That ban has been lifted.  Also, during the ban, if you owned an assault weapon you kept that weapon.

      <p>
       By the terms used: no citizen was disarmed.  THey were merely relegated to purchasing a different type of firearm.

       What you've just stated has near-zero relevance to the topic at hand. Unless you mean people setting off bombs in bank lobbies and end up killing innocent people to get at the "banksters".

       In that case, yea I'm pretty sure the police has no choice but to respond to that, especially if this person or persons are armed like the Boston bombers.

       There are an awful lot of federally mandated equipment purchases as well. Those mandates come with certain strings attached.

       perhaps you can show me any instance in all this where civilians were forced to do anything. they had every right to decline a search of their house, but my guess is a perfectly reasonable use of
       <a href="http://lawbrain.com/wiki/Hot_Pursuit">
        hot pursuit
       </a>
       would have been used. but luckily it appears most bostonians weren't wearing their tin foil hats, so it wasn't necessary. they weren't forced to stay in their homes, it was just suggested, and my guess is most of them wanted to stay in their homes seeing as these guys were tossing bombs out their car window and killing cops. but watching all the footage, there were plenty of people who ignored the warning and were out and about, and even driving. but maybe you can show where military took over the role of government. oh wait...you can't, because it didn't happen.

       what about anything i said leads you to believe that i don't think the government lies and doesn't ever do anything shady behind the scenes? i just don't happen to think that EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS EVER is some kind of government conspiracy. there is absolutely nothing that has taken place over the last 2 days that indicates that the federal government was doing something shady.

       also you have no clue where i get my information. regardless, i guess a better way to receive information is from the paranoia inside me. i'm sure that information is based in reality.

       They shot a terrorist who was shooting at them and possibly had an IED on him! You act like this guy was a peaceful protester. Maybe instead of your crazy idea of why they killed him, they actually killed him BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING TO KILL THEM AND OTHER CITIZENS. Get your head out of your ass.

       Police are authorized to respond in force if a suspect they are trying to apprehend fires at them. These guys threw grenades and shot at police in the pursuit of a car jacking and officer involved shooting resulting in the death of the MIT cop. I think they can shoot back...

       From what I read, xenopants merely provided an opposing view with an argument. When he used the term "tin foil hats" he was talking about bostonians, not any posters in this thread. This subreddit should be a place for healthy debate. Not conspiracy circle-jerking.

       Find me one person who denied police access to their house and you may have an argument. But to me, I think bostonians had the common sense to remain cooperative in a dangerous situation.

       I find it hypocritical that posters here have such negative reactions to counter-arguments in a subreddit that claims to be so open-minded and respectful.

       Perhaps the term irks you in particular, but the rest of his comment provides his argument and I don't think he was being dismissive.
      </p>
      <p>
       People by and large were not resisting any of this because they identified the situation as a legitimate danger. If there were accounts of people refusing police entrance to their homes, that would have suggested varying opinions on the situation. But since there haven't been any reports of this, I don't think it's an awful thing to say that bostonians thought it crazy to be uncooperative with police when their established priority was declared to be public safety.

       sorry you're focusing on "tinfoil hat" out of all the other things i said. you're being obtuse. plus nothing else you said really makes any sense. if it helps with your future arguments, i don't actually feel persecuted. like, at all. so i don't know where you're getting that.

       well, if "tinfoil hat" is some kind of banned term in this subreddit, i'll take it back. but obviously my point is that bostonians didn't assume that this was some complex government conspiracy to enact martial law. they assumed law enforcement was trying to find an armed and dangerous person, who already bombed the shit out of a large group of people in their city, and killed a police officer, and opened fire on other boston police officers, so they let them look. but that's a mouthful, so i went with "they weren't wearing tinfoil hats."

       In my opinion I dont think it was martiall law by definition. However it was riding the lines of it. You gotta admit that the whole situation was rather militarized  and extreme. And this is first time I personally have ever seen something like that its just crazy.

       it was militarized and extreme, BECAUSE THEY SET OFF BOMBS IN A PUBLIC PLACE KILLING AND INJURING PEOPLE, AND THEN KILLED A COP, AND THEN THREW BOMBS AT COPS WHILE THEY WERE BEING CHASED, AND THEN SHOT AT MORE COPS, AND THEN ONE GOT AWAY AND NO ONE KNEW WHERE HE WAS IN NEIGHBORHOODS HEAVILY POPULATED WITH CIVILIANS. that's kind of how that shit works.

       of course, allegedly. so no action should be taken by the police to find the guy who allegedly bombed the boston marathon and allegedly killed a police officer, and allegedly stole a car, and allegedly engaged in a firefight with cops(which was witnessed and documented with photos and video by various bostonians), and allegedly threw pipe bombs at cops, and who one of which allegedly didn't get caught and was allegedly running loose in a suburb of boston. they probably shouldn't have done anything to try to find him. i mean, they pay for those streets with our tax dollars! did they ask their permission to even search their streets?

       so law enforcement must go around and get the permission of every person living on a street before they search it for a criminal? that seems super efficient.

       That quote during the news conference could only make me laugh. Whether people were forced or chose to stay inside/on lock down, Boston fucking stopped for terrorism. $200 million in lost revenue, people afraid to go outside. It is the complete opposite of what the American people are supposedly about, "not stopping for terrorism"

       If there was a bomber on the loose in your town who was just previously seen attempting to setup MORE BOMBS, you wouldn't want police handling the situation like that?

       It's always easier to chime in thoughts when you're in another state far far away. If you were not in the town the day of, then no one should be saying Martial Law was active. Thank you for being reasonable.

       I think the police actually did a pretty nice job. Sure they evacuated people out of their homes but they were looking for the suspect and they didn't shoot any civilians in the process. They found the man relatively quickly. They didn't disarm anyone and the people seemed to be cooperative. The thing we have to worry about are the laws being passed after this tragedy.

       I always wonder if the people in this subreddit had their loved ones killed because of this guys actions, would you want him alive? Would you give him shelter and hide him from the police? Would you give him more time to plant more bombs and maybe kill more people that you love? Would you give him a meal, and pat his back and say good job? Would you tell the police to stand down and not gear and let him roam the streets because you know he's a good guy?  It's always easier to say what we would do if it was us in this situation, but the truth is we wouldn't know what to do, and it wasn't us in the situation. Everyone says they would have done this, and that but if shit was to happen, and they were presented with it right in front of their face, they'd run. I'd highly doubt anyone in here would take a bullet for me, nor would they have confronted this guy, in realty they would run and then complain that things weren't done right.

       Are you people for real? We have a very dangerous terrorist on the loose in a section of a highly populated American city and you think we shouldn't use all of our resources to capture him? I'm sure the people who's homes were searched were just so inconvenienced by the officers. I mean, way more than the terrorism happening in their neighborhood right? Fucking idiots

       Oh Im sorry did cops just raid normal citizens houses? How did I miss that? You all are ignorant, they were creating a permitter to block him from leaving and they were successful in that. They asked permission for people to leave the house especially the one where the guy was hiding, HE HAD EXPLOSIVES.

       The city of Boston lost $333mil for the city shutdown, oh yes the government would LOVE to lose that money... for what? No one can work, nothing gets done, crap piles up. Idiots. People who are worried about Martial Law can just calm the hell down.  How many times do we see this?

       This wasn't some burglar or crack dealer they were closing in on. It was a terrorist who had already killed one cop and was assumed to be heavily armed with explosives. How exactly would you suggest they go about apprehending him?

       Innocent until proven guilty in the courts, yes. But first you need to arrest the guy. What you said made no sense. The cops do not presume innocence. If they feel there is sufficient cause, they pursue and arrest people.

       Obviously. But he's going to be convicted as a terrorist. The FBI has told us that they have a video of the men putting down the bombs, yet haven't released them to the public. Why?

       Consider what would happen if, in any given criminal case, all or some of the evidence was shown on the news or online before the trial even started.
      </p>
      <p>
       How, then, could you even pretend to find an impartial jury, since any person you picked to be on that jury would likely have already seen the evidence--or at least some of it, and without context or explanation, never mind a chance for the defense to make their case--and already made up their mind?

       I'm not sure if it's possible for you to get more stupid. Yep, the cops should've went looking for him with no guns, no protection, no backup. Just strolled the street yelling "oh terrorist, please come out but definitely dont shoot us!". Or maybe they should've just let him go. I mean everything is a plot by THE GOVERNMENT to take over, man!

       It was a dangerous person. Even if its not 100% proven they bombed the marathon, they still threw explosives and killed a cop. Also planted pressure cooker bombs Who knows what they would be capable of. I think a terrorist roaming about is a lot worse than all the cops. It was for a valid reason.

       Some Bostonians on the update thread said that they knocked and asked if they could come in (if you said no they'd just wait for legal OK's) and if noone answered they'd break the door and clear the building.

       It's a little on the over-reaching side and
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be looked at with a little mistrust but putting this photo up as "proof" they were barging into peoples homes without consent is really misleading and weakens your argument.

       oh, i'm sorry. i didn't realize this a was a private forum. you don't want to hear dissenting opinions? perhaps you guys should make it private so you can circle-jerk about how the government is ALWAYS coming after you ALWAYS without interruption.

       What you've just stated has near-zero relevance to the topic at hand. Unless you mean people setting off bombs in bank lobbies and end up killing innocent people to get at the "banksters".
      </p>
      <p>
       In that case, yea I'm pretty sure the police has no choice but to respond to that, especially if this person or persons are armed like the Boston bombers.

       They've been preparing to turn the US into a military state for years now... just search for recent police urban warfare exercises (like the one in miami) and you'll see.
