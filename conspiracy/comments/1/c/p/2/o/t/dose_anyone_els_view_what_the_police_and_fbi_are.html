       It's not technically martial law. Martial law is when the military is placed in charge of security during an emergency situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the United States, the police have simply been militarized. They look like soldiers don't they? But they're not army. They're not even national guard (which are allowed to be deployed under the authority of a governor, unarmed, for disaster relief). Nope, those are police officers. ... and that's the fucked up part.

       The old slippery slope, huh? Permenant curfews in major cities? Really? A part of me thinks that those who actually believe this stuff will happen, actually want it to happen. Be honest, you want the government to impose egregious stuff like that so that you can rail against the system even more. Well we have a thing in the country called the Constitution. It doesn't allow things like we saw in Boston to happen unless there is a very good reason for them. A permanent curfew in urban centers could not and would not ever happen in this country. It's unconstitutional. If it by chance ever did there would be an uprising from the citizenry.

       Well there haven't been any loss of rights yet. As far as surveillance goes, we already have camera pretty much everywhere in this country. Any loss of rights you saw in Boston were justified given exigent circumstances and could never become permanent.

       I'm from Boston and I've been saying it all along, I had no problem whatsoever with what the police did. I haven't talked to a single person in the city who has. It's very easy for people to watch the news 1000 miles away and declare that our rights are gone and this is the new norm. It's not the new norm, this was an extraordinary and unprecedented situation with an unprecedented, yet in my opinion justified, response.

       Interesting,  that's exactly what I think,  I have no room to judge because I live nowhere near boston.  Did the police forcefully enter people's homes though?  I never quite figured out if that was true or not.

       Good to know other people view it in the same light all I can see is this situation playing out to an American citizen in Boston.
      </p>
      <p>
       Officer: "we need to search your home to see if our suspect is in there."
Homeowner: " I've been home all day and I can assure you he isn't."
Officer: "that won't work we need to physically see."(pushes man aside walks in guns drawn)
Minutes later....
Officer: " well we didn't find anything involving the ongoing investigation but we did find a little weed and a weapon."
Que homeowner being arrested and charged with Felony possession of a firearm with an illegal substance. But hey the search will continue.

       why would they waste their time writing you a ticket? they're looking for a terrorist. they dont give a fuck about anything else other than finding the guy. anything else they find would be inadmissible in court due to being found while not having a warrant. any lawyer, really ANY lawyer would get that shit thrown out faster than you can blink so it's not remotely worth the trouble and a waste of time that is more valuable being devoted to the search for the suspect.

       If the police enter a house under exigent circumstances any evidence they gather must be related to the reason they entered the house. Since they weren't going into the houses looking for drugs, they wouldn't be able to lawfully confiscate the drugs or arrest you. If the police did try this it would probably be a violation of the 4th Amendment. Either way, the police were not concerned with small amounts of drugs. There's a very good chance they encountered things like weed and bowls or whatever and just didn't give a shit.

       so you want them to get warrants and allow people on the streets while they hunt a guy who has blown up the marathon, robbed a store, killed a cop, had massive shootout with the cops, stole a car, threw explosives at cops....

       they're taking measures to save lives. this situation is likely going to end with gunfire and explosions so it makes perfect sense to anyone who isn't an idiot why they put everything on lockdown. no potential innocent bystanders, no potential hostages, no cars to be carjacked. they're going after one of, if not the, most wanted people in america. this has to be done this way. its the protect part of "to protect and serve"
      </p>

       but whatever. you want to exercise your freedom? fine. take off your tinfoil hat and go to boston and explain to them how you have the freedom to do whatever you want and try to enter the area they're surrounding.

       I'm from Boston and I've been saying it all along, I had no problem whatsoever with what the police did. I haven't talked to a single person in the city who has. It's very easy for people to watch the news 1000 miles away and declare that our rights are gone and this is the new norm. It's not the new norm, this was an extraordinary and unprecedented situation with an unprecedented, yet in my opinion justified, response.
