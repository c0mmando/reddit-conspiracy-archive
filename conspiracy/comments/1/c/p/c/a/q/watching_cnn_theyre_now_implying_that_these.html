<p>I am not saying I have evidence for this because I dont, but it doesn&#39;t need to be done by a bunch of guys in suits for it to be suspicious.</p>

<p>The FBI/CIA is already doing that to prevent &quot;terrorists&quot; by finding fools, urging them on and then capturing them.</p>

For that case, do you believe everyone in the government has the same views and same proposed methods to achieve those views?

</blockquote>

<p>The excuse is they &quot;protect&quot; you from terrorists, their is numerous examples of this types of sting operations, my point that to go from one of this &quot;sting operations&quot; to the real deal just takes the right people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think everyone in the FBI/CIA (two different organizations by the way) share the same world view and have the same politics where they could decide on the best course of action to advance that cause?</p>

<p>The lie is different at every level. But yes its just as planed, the pawns move as they are meant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>his is a government, I remind you, which can&#39;t even pass as simple funding budget,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh come on that&#39;s the carnival of idiots meant to hide the bigger picture, its a charade, a simple play of good cop bad cop, it is all about perception, smoke and mirrors so that you give your rights willingly and are a partaker in your own enslavement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Something they all can&#39;t agree on anyway?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A single legislation is meaningless, all that matters is perception, how much rage was caused when background checks didn&#39;t pass? it was a flawed bill full of loopholes anyway, but the rage is real.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaboodle">Kitten Kaboodle was a character in an anti-cat story written by Charles Schulz&#39;s Snoopy in June of 1974. &quot;Secretly, Kitten Kaboodle wished she were a dog. She was aware of the natural superiority of a dog, and it bothered her.&quot; Linus to Snoopy: &quot;I think your anti-cat stories show too much prejudice.. I think you&#39;re going to make a lot of enemies.. Not everybody hates cats, you know!&quot; Snoopy, in thought balloon: &quot;I find that hard to believe.&quot;</a></p>

This looks like they are going to attempt to turn the public against conspiracy theorists and may even go so far to say that they are terrorists.  Don&#39;t forger the ricin attacks this week were from a homegrown guy that thought he had uncovered a plot to sell body parts - this narrative paints conspiracy theory as not only whacky, but also once again the conflation with terrorism.</p>

It would only cause more people to go searching for the truth, and that would put many more eyes on Israel&#39;s role behind 9/11, which they certainly do not want.

    <div class="md"><p>This was staged, the authorities held back all images of these two.  There wasn&#39;t a photo or film showing them anywhere.  Then they said they have images of a suspect putting his bag on the ground - and the media started very strong hints that it was the man in blue and the man in black, and they feared for their lives.  Two days later the FBI released the video and images we now know.  It was stage managed, give people photos of dodgy looking people (which they did), let hysteria take over (which it did), then release the real images and introduce a bill that restricts the information that any news agency can report!

    <div class="md"><p>New York is a Judaized city owned by Jews. Hence it is a Jewish city, like I said. Everything about New York screams Jewish, from Wall Street to Mayor Bloomberg.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One cannot
underestimate the importance of Jewish power in intellectual circles in New York
at the time of Niebuhr’s pronouncements (see CofC, passim). For example, Leslie
Fiedler (1948, 873) noted that “the writer drawn to New York from the provinces
feels . . . the Rube, attempts to conform; and the almost parody of Jewishness
achieved by the gentile writer in New York is a strange and crucial testimony of
our time.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, you have clearly never been here, but you&#39;re entitled to your slanted and uninformed opinion of a place you have never seen with your own eyes. </p>

<p>I do not like Bloomberg. His crimes against the black, latino, muslim and immigrant communities in this city through programs like muslim surveillance and stop-and-frisk should not only have had him impeached, but brought up on charges of depriving a population of millions their civil rights.</p>

<p>Wall Street too is the epitome of greed, zina, excess and evil. A gleaming white cancer in the heart not only of the city or the nation but the entire world. The treason that occurs daily in New York skyscrapers has never before seen its equal within the borders of this country, and the fact that law enforcement does nothing to stop it screams a great human injustice for which one day this country may be forced to pay for with its very existence. </p>

<p>That said; the Jewish people have far less control over all this than the anglo-american white bankers who have been plotting to run this country and bend it to a slavery of debt since its inception. Bloomberg may be a Jew but that does not by any means entail that the city is owned or populated exclusively by his people. New York stands for many things, it is far less black-and-white as you seem to believe. It is a city of shades of grey just as the world we live in is a world of shades of grey because there really is a little bit of everyone here. No matter who you are you will find people like yourself here in NYC. </p>

<p>Your contention that it is simply a Jew-owned fortress of &quot;Jewishness&quot; is laughable. I urge you to visit this place before you leave this world. There really is nowhere else like it anywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I shared a similar thought once I heard about CISPA a few days ago. I noticed the complete lack of attention it received from people who had bandwagoned it before, who were more concerned with the bombings (which I&#39;m not downplaying, but just pointing out). It seemed that the only people who were concerned or even knew about it this time were people who actually cared. It might not mean a damn thing as far as how the events line up, but in my mind, it doesn&#39;t simply seem like a coincidence. </p>

<p>My thoughts exactly. And then I became even more suspicious when I heard the conversation that was on CNN. I wasn&#39;t paying attention at first, then I ended up choking on my drink when he started forcing the &#39;role&#39; the internet supposedly played down the interviewer&#39;s throat.</p>

<p>And as I continued listening, I started thinking about CISPA. And the more I listened to him, the more it sounded like trying to convince the country that CISPA is justified because of these attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly - film of the two bombers and their backpacks - white hat has a light colored backpack which has black piping and finishes on it (go and look while you still can).  Now go and look at the damning photo of white hat with his backpack on the ground - it is black with white piping - it is not his backpack, it is the polar opposite of his backpack!</p>

<p>Secondly - This looks set to be used for restricting the media.  Because so many false people were being accused there will be a limitation and vetting procedure put in place by the FBI and other agencies to ensure that only &#39;correct&#39; news is published.  Just you see!  It&#39;s already starting - the NY Times has issued an apology, and so have many other media outlets.  Now just wait for the bill.  When the revolution starts nobody will know, because no-one will tell you!  Police will start to use scrambled digital frequencies (same as UK forces) and you&#39;ll not even be able to listen into them anymore.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I noticed immediately that the backpacks just didn&#39;t match up. It&#39;s bullshit.</p>

<p>And I went through literally hundreds of photos of the crime scene before and after detonation, and I didn&#39;t see a single <em>sign</em> of either of these two until <em>after</em> the FBI announced they were looking for them. Then slowly I start finding photos with them in them.</p>

<p>I was half asleep when looking at one, but it looked just like one of the other pictures I had studied for a couple hours but suddenly White Hat is in it. And rather visible. I swear the other version of the photo didn&#39;t have him in it!</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to find the link to it right now. I just hope it hasn&#39;t been removed.</p>

In reality, gun violence has been dropping in the United States over the last decade or more and <em>continues</em> to drop.</p>

<p>The only reason we&#39;re seeing more coverage about gun violence over the last year [since around the time of the Theater Shooting in July] is because the government is pushing it&#39;s agenda to unarm Americans. </p>

<p>Only if those accused of the crimes aren&#39;t the real people who carried them out.</p>

<p>Though I supposed it&#39;s possible that they were on websites and plotting what they wanted to do. Mostly just bullshitting and whatnot, but someone carried out their plot, which put pressure on the others to carry out their plots as well. I can see that as a possibility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It does.</p>

<p>However, the law can&#39;t promise unbiased opinions and the public loves convicting people before they&#39;ve even seen the evidence. Even our own police departments, prosecutors, and judges often consider someone guilty and treat them as such.</p>

<p>And when preformed opinions are so heavy, evidence is often ignored, and innocent people go to prison. It still happens.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if the surviving brother is guilty or innocent. It&#39;s hard to determine based on how inconsistent the information about all of this has been.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ll end up slipping it into a completely unrelated bill at the last minute in the near future, I&#39;m sure. Which will likely be how the gun control laws will be changed. Also, what I gathered from that bill [I couldn&#39;t understand all of what I read] they were trying to make background checks stricter to make sure guns don&#39;t fall into the wrong hands.</p>

<p>And while anyone who really wants a gun even if they can&#39;t legally own one can get a gun illegally with ease, I do agree that background checks need to be stricter.</p>

<p>I normally try to stay out of the great gun control debate. It&#39;s such a fire starter. But for once I&#39;m voicing my opinion on gun control.</p>

<p>I am pro-gun ownership. I used to target shoot when I was a little kid [ages 3-5]. I was given a rifle on my 6th birthday. I totally believe in gun ownership and an armed America.</p>

<p>Today we had to take our cat back to the vet. We didn&#39;t have enough money for the x-ray he needs, or for the two meds he really needs right now. Our cat has a very painful bladder infection.
