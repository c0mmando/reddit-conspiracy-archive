       It was 3 murders and over a hundred terrible injuries. People losing arms legs faces who will never live a normal life again. At the City of Boston's most well-known and important annual event. All these people were targeted for no discernible reason. It's scary to me that people think this was overkill. They needed to catch these guys.

Last i checked there weren't other IED's found, but rather the suspicious packages they found were destroyed as a precaution.

       Four if you include the police officer who apparently was sitting in his squad car when he was killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cops had no way of knowing if the suspects would attempt another bombing. In fact, it seems like that's what they were trying to do at MIT.

       Right, it's more about the mode of destruction than anything. Of course, I am still highly skeptical about the whole event, but just because the bombs only killed 2 people doesn't mean there's not valid reason to capture "whoever" the suspects are ASAP because it would be a matter of time before they injured many more. There still should be a trial and I'm still bewildered that there's only 2 suspects and that we've honed in on them like we have with ruthlessness. People cheering in the streets before they've had their day in court. Maybe we ha the wrong guys? Maybe there's way more to all of this then we know? All the more reason for a trial, for the sake of our rights as citizens. We are presumed innocent until proven guilty.

       Quick answer Yes. Also deny it all you want the lock down did allow the police to find him quicker. Based on the smokers tip.

       I just find it strange that the military in Boston would find it necessary to shut down the city and have hundreds of military and armored vehicles in the streets, going door to door saying that citizens cannot leave their houses, so that they can find the
       <em>
        suspect
       </em>
       of a crime. It is not like the guy got arrested, found guilty of the bombing, then escaped and was on the run. Then I can see them taking some more measures to find the guy. But to have this martial law declared to locate a suspect? Give me a break. Also, as far as getting into a shootout with police. I don't see any evidence of who fired first. If the military are firing guns at you, and you have a gun handy, would you sit in the fetal position until they kill you, or will you fire back and try to take some of them out? I guess it depends on each person.

       I live in Boston, and this was not martial law. We went out and got beer. Dunkin' Donuts was open. There weren't many people on the streets, but there were some.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a strong suggestion to stay indoors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why on earth would they request that people stay indoors?
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Because there was evidence that the guy was extremely dangerous, possessed high powered weapons and explosives, and there were fears that there may be other IEDs planted. Given the danger (and the really small size of Boston), it was probably a damn good idea to stay off the streets.
       </li>
       <li>
        Because they had lost the trail of the suspect. It's a lot harder to find the suspect if the streets are full of people.
       </li>
      </ol>

       On another note, you seemed to emphasize that he was a SUSPECT. Why would he go on a huge manhunt with high powered weapons and explosives if he was actually only a suspect? Why not try to automatically clear his name? This guy was still posting on Twitter. He certainly could have tried to make the case that he was innocent, starting there.

       I did not see high powered explosives or weapons, aside from what the military was parading through the streets. And what was the evidence that he was extremely dangerous? Allegations that he had involvement with the bombing at the marathon?

       Oh, and the numerous reports across all the news stations (both local and national) of the explosives during the manhunt. But I suppose all of the news stations were wrong or part of some grand conspiracy.

       What is that? Maybe I do not know what you consider to be "martial law," but by my understanding, the term "martial law" refers to a situation where the military is deployed to control a situation or to control an area and maintain order. If armed military with M4s and full battle garb alongside armored vehicles is not a deployment of military to control an area, I don't know what is... You don't have to be in Boston to be able to look at a picture and tell if that is military.

       You think innocent people don't die in Chicago and Detroit? You're very misguided. If I shot 143 people with a gun it would be different than blowing 143 people up with a bomb? No. You don't even know that these were the bombers and yet you scream "KILL!" No evidence has been brought up to suggest otherwise. Just the FBI telling you that they did it.

       No shit innocent people die in Chicago and Detroit. Someone getting shot in a robbery is one thing, but if someone shot 100 innocent people with a gun in Chicago, you can bet your ass they would shut the city down to find the guy.

       Honestly, I fully believe the government is up to some pretty horrible crap. I just also fully believe they are WAY better at hiding/covering up/keeping what they're really up to under wraps so that a bunch of people on the internet with way too much free time can "figure them out". I don't understand how people can be so "OMG THE GOVERNMENT IS BEHIND IT ALL AND IS TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE NOT" but don't think they would have any issue with shutting up anyone who tries to call them out on it, nice and quiet like.

       Jesus Christ, are you really this stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       !43 people being shot at once or being blown up would still result in a manhunt of the same scale. Shutting down the city for one person being shot would be stupid of course but for some guys who have explosives and are willing to detonate them in public places it is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you know what they dont need allot of evidence right now as the guys shot back for christs sake. They used explosives. The ploice didnt execture two young guys in a private place they had a fucking shoot out in public.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are trying to make a conspiracy out of something and it just dosent make sense. If the goverment wanted to enforce gun laws why not get a guy to start shooting an assault rifle at the marathon, the death count would have been higher.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they wanted to just cause terror amongst the citizen ship then why bother catching anyone, people who drop bombs and dont get caught are much more scary.

       You could have walke your happy ass out of your house and started chasing the crazy bastard yourself. The duty of the police department is to protect the LIFE and property of those go cannot protect it themselves. That's what they were doing.

       Are you oblivious to what happens around the country? Where is he getting these bombs? I want you to know that a pressure cooker bomb most likely weighs upwards of 25 lbs. Is he just hanging them off his belt? He prepared and stored them around the city? Yea fucking right. If they have a perimeter set up around him fucking assault through and get the fucking job done. Quit fucking lolly gagging around and fucking with ordinary citizens going about their lives. Helicopters, MRAPS, 9000 police officers. Think about that really good and hard for me.

       Most of the FBI's Counter Terrorist Team is ex SOF. Trust me they have dealt with a few fucking gunmen in their time. Get the innnocent bystanders out of the suspected area of the gunman and assault through fallujah style and clear the fucking objective. This is disgusting.

       the issue was they didn't know where he was hiding, the majority of the officers were here to search for him.  Once they did find him, they wanted him alive, hence the stand off.

       1) There was actually 4 lives lost
2) There was nearly 200 injuries, dozens of which were quite critical and only survived because of the quick medical response. So, yah, it sucks that our city was taken over by police in fatigues tonight but these guys continued throwing bombs and shooting in residential neighborhoods.

       All things aside, it's extremely silly to think that they wouldn't make a big deal over the most wanted men since 9/11. Overkill? So you think they should just let local P.D Handle this one? No big deal right, it's not like these guys would hurt anybody right.

       From the looks of the armor and weaponry that Boston PD has, I'm sure they would have no problem catching ONE GUY. Add the FBI in there now and you have a better equipped army than most countries.

       I don't think so at all. Boston is a very urban area, shutting down public transportation was the obvious action that was taken, and actually shutting down the city was a rational way of approaching things if you ask me. You can label it as overkill if you think its so easy to combat someone who could potentially blow you the fuck up, and your colleagues, and already shot at several other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I think about it quickly, I would like to think its so easy to track down one person. But when I think it through and consider all the factors and the size of the area, I personally realize its not so simple. Technology certainly helps but its not an end-all be-all.

       I HAVE combated someone that has shot and killed someone AND blown someone up. I know how these fucking FBI HRT teams work. They are as trained as SF and Rangers. Why? Because most of them are ex-SOF themselves. They fucking sat in a backyard and threw flashbangs at a boat for an hour? Do you even know what a flashbang does to a human being? Or just what you have seen in COD? Oh and throwing bombs huh? Let me tell you a little something about MRAP's. There were multiple on the scene. Do you know what MRAP stands for? Mine Resistant Anti Personnel vehicle. Don't even get me started on the helicopters. How many times have you been watching Worlds Wildest Police Chases and the fucking car gets away? Ill answer for you. NONE. Sorry for the rant and rave man but people need to think!

       I'm not sure if they found one on his body, but it could have been assumed that since the brothers shot and killed an MIT officer that Djohar (or however it's spelled) was carrying a weapon on him at the time. I imagine it would have been more simple if it was a certainty that he was unarmed, wasn't wearing a suicide vest, or any other kind of vest, and also wasn't carrying other weapons with him. Could something like that have been known to begin with? I'm not so sure. Of course, if this was all staged, that makes all those points moot, but that's an intellectual leap I'm not going to take until I understand this more.

       OP, Your point is silly. This isn't just a couple of murders. It's a planned bombing of a big event, it's terrorism. This isn't terribly common in America. Also,  he was heavily armed in a RESIDENTIAL area. He could of killed even more easily, since he knew he would get caught soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's more about how the FBI has been watching him and there's signs that point to prior knowledge that the bombing was going to happen. And also how he got away so easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did police react correctly in regards to the severity of the situation? Yes. But did they let this happen, to practice their martial law drills and push political agendas? Very, very possible.

       As someone from Chicago: you don't really know what you're talking about. Comparing gang violence and a random act of terrorism is different. Gang members are arrested daily.

       These bombs were called weapons of mass destruction and the use of them requires harsh penalties and add since it was used to hurt people the death penalty will be the punishment. That is a lot worse than the murders in Chicago where the penalties aren't nearly and harsh and WMDs aren't used.

       Really?! WMDs? Do you have any idea what you are talking about? These are rudimentary pressure cookers filled with gunpowder or ammonium nitrate. Please explain to me how you think that has anything to do with any type of NBC weapon system?

       After reading articles i found out these homemade bombs were classified as WMDs because the definition I found was a weapon intended to kill or wound multiple people. I did check my facts so unless the 3 news channels were all wrong, I am not the one who is wrong.

       Just two suspects? This isn't two dudes who robbed a gas station and shot the cashier. These are guys who planted a bomb in a crowd, which blew up and left arms, legs, pools of blood and a hundred people screaming in agony. How the hell are you supposed to handle people running around a city planting bombs?
      </p>
      <p>
       A bomb doesnt discriminate on how many people put it there, it fucking blows up. It doesnt matter if it was 2 men, 200 men, or a 10 year old girl who put it there. It does damage. It blew peoples limbs off. It's fucked up, so they shut the city down, and got the guys. Ask anyone from boston if they think the police went overkill.

       Agreed.  Law enforcement all over the US have been investing heavily in military-grade and crowd-control equipment.  They've also been training in tactics for handling these types of situations for at least a decade.  I know and love people in law enforcement...I respect them and I admire them.  I also believe they enjoy the militarization of their duties, which is understandable for many reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I distrust is the "playbook" that I see unfolding over the last several years....a playbook of tactics that can be used on an alleged couple of lone nutjobs - or on an entire section of a US suburb.
      </p>
      <p>
       The equipment being used and the 'military lock-down' of a US city by it's own law enforcement is IN NO WAY justified.  And Bostonians, no matter how outraged, should by no means be excused if they are accepting what is happening there.

       Are you oblivious to what happens around the country? Where is he getting these bombs? I want you to know that a pressure cooker bomb most likely weighs upwards of 25 lbs. Is he just hanging them off his belt? He prepared and stored them around the city? Yea fucking right. If they have a perimeter set up around him fucking assault through and get the fucking job done. Quit fucking lolly gagging around and fucking with ordinary citizens going about their lives. Helicopters, MRAPS, 9000 police officers. Think about that really good and hard for me.

       It is in the live update timeline (i think #2 of 9 that were made). An officer spotted them planting suspicious packages at Cambridge.
