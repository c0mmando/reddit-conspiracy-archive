<p>Has the FBI released PROOF that these two brothers are involved in the bombing other than the fact that they were wearing backpacks near the blast sight? There many other people wearing backpacks near the blast sight, it doesn&#39;t prove anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe they couldn&#39;t bring that 1st dead suspect in for a proper trial without murdering the guy. They also seem to have video of everything but not when the bomb was actually placed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get that, they wont show when the bomb was placed but they will parade the guys mutilated body trophy all over the internet.</p>

<p>Disgusting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was looking into a couple pictures and noticed something concerning. There was an older bald gentleman who looked nervous in one of the pictures. It seemed as if he was praying. He had a backpack with him that looked seemingly familiar to the one that was photographed after the explosion. In the first picture, he is in the same exact spot where the bomb went off with the backpack to his side. On the second photo he does not have the backpack anymore and is walking away from the site before any of the bombs go off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have also been concerned about the lack of clear evidence since the beginning of this whole pursuit and suspect announcement. What concerns me most is that I am struggling to find actual facts within media outlets talking about the links between the suspect and the bombings. Most of the coverage is about their shootouts and the elder brother&#39;s previous history with the FBI. The media did a fantastic job of constructing &quot;terrorists&quot; out of these two brothers, and the fact of the matter is that majority of people are soaking in this media news without giving it a second thought. The younger brother, who is in critical condition, is being revoked of his Miranda rights, and discussions of death penalty vs life sentence have already started. How is he already being presumed guilty when not a single piece of strong evidence has been presented. Things do not add up and the media is doing an awesome job of glorifying what the government and these agencies want us to concentrate on, rather than asking the real questions!</p>
