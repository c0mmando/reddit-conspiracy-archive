       Downvote me if you wish. This dude is innocent until proven guilty. Come on. Enough with the 'Kill him' 'cut off his legs'. Please, he is a human. He is proven innocent until guilty.

      <p>
       Edit: Dude, the Internet is so awesome sometimes. I was falling  asleep and was just venting here. Didn't think I would make it to front page the next morning! I tossed and turned last night. All of this is very bad news. Either way a human life is a human life. Thanks you cool ass Redditors!

        need
       </em>
       to grant anyone the power to do so.

       I agree in principle, but it has nothing to do with "this country". Nations that don't experience/suffer from violence like this regularly all react the same way. It shocks them, scares them, makes them contemplate their own safety and mortality, and it all results in blood lust and a desire for vengeance before the facts have all presented themselves. Many react that way, wherever they live, but many feel like you do. Neither phenomenon knows borders.

       There was a small sect of society who vocalised that they wanted Breivik killed. But the overwhelming humanity we saw even right after the massacre really comes down to the way Norwegians see justice; it's centred around rehabilitation and measured by societal gain. Perhaps only in more individualistic societies - where retribution is the forethought - does sorry_to_say's argument stand true.

       And I do. The comparison of this event with the manhunt of Officer Dormer is profound. I'm just sad that these kids came to a place where they could have everything and they end up, one dead, one in prison at 19. Fuck me, but that's sad, too. I always wanted a friend named Tamerlane.

       No idiotic emotional reactions like yours are why we have due process. Did a horrible thing happen Monday? Yes. Was this guy part of that incident? Maybe even most likely but our prisons are full of truly innocent people who got caught up in emotional reactions and stereotyping ....

       maybe? be real. they arent throwing out random pictures....do you fully understand what happened last night? most of this city wants him alive so he can be tried and brought to justice...but if you seriously think he may be innocent then theres something wrong with you. hopefully something like this never happens again, but if it does you better hope it doesnt happen in you community...then you might understand how we feel

       How does it scare people? Well, after 9/11 there were literally groups of people in the streets being interviewed saying they want 'towel heads' to be bombed irrespective of whether certain people did anything wrong or not. That kind or knee jerk anger and reaction helped to gain support for an illegal war in Iraq with young kids signing up for war because they wanted to 'strike back at the enemy'. Some of those kids are in a box six foot under ground now a long with 100,000's of other people that died either as a direct result of US and coalition forces or indirectly because of the sectarian violence that went out of control when the US turned up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It scares people because it was so easy to whip people up into a murderous frenzy its a worrying possibility it might happen again.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also, people wonder why bombs go off in the US and why its a target for terror. Why is there so much anti US sentiment? Ask yourself that question. Why is Germany or Japan not a target for multiple terror attacks?

       I think it is all sentiment regarding exacting justice in a way that requires no consumption of resources and very little time. I personally believe that sending a person convicted of terror or mass murder to prison for the rest of their lives is not enough to ensure justice was served for survivors or families of the deceased.

       Yeah I get wanting justice. But I don't have blood lust for even the most twisted serial killers. Evil makes me more sad than angry. Whenever I hear someone say let's torture him or anything... It's just so ugly to me.

       you mean when someone shoots at a cop and the cop shoots back and kills him, it needs to be proven that's he's guilty? even a citizen has the right to shoot back if someone was shooting at him. also i'm pretty sure the fbi wanted those suspects alive if possible so they can interrogate them.

       Legit question...if one is charged with a terrorist act, does that not constitute treason and thus you revoke your rights as a citizen? I don't think we will do this to this guy, but just wondering of the legal consequences.

       That is somewhat false.  Hamdi v. Rumsfeld requires that all U.S. citizens labeled enemy combatants must be afforded with basic due process protections and also to be provided with an opportunity to challenge their designation as an enemy combatant.  Not saying I agree with labeling U.S. citizens enemy combatants for acts committed domestically, just pointing out that you conveniently decided to side step some factual information.

       The fact that a US citizen can be labelled an enemy combatant is quite frightening. Its gone from terrorist to enemy combatant making the US a battlefield. Enemy combatants is a term used on the battlefield, not in a country where the person is a citizen. He's a terrorist by definition by wanting to create fear to pursue a political, religious or ideological goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to keep a close eye on that term being used because it opens a can or worms with a lot of implications.

       they were overseas, but it's not like it's all black and white here. they may afford him basic rights, or they may not. that being said, I've heard it said that you can best judge a society by how it treats it's 'untouchables' and we treat ours pretty bad. solitary confinement for 23/24hr a day, giving money hand over fist to the prison industrial complex for profits.. until we fix some of these things and maybe humanize the process a little like the Scandinavian countries (who've also lowered recidivism accordingly, since inmates are treated at least to some extent like human beings) we can only expect a revolving door.

       My thoughts exactly. The way this has been treated should be an example of how any "domestic terrorism" case will be treated in the future. So far, I'd say we're fucked.

       It doesn't afford him anything extra, he is only afforded what everyone is afforded, which here I think is the presumption of innocence until proven guilty in court, and competent legal council.  Nothing more than anyone would get if they were accused of murder.

       This does not appear to be so, (at least in the US) 
"Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court." US Constitution Article 3 section 3.  So a confession can be enough to be tried for treason, but it is not required.

       The problem is who decides what is a terrorist act.  Currently, since Bush, it is whomever holds the office of the presidency.  With no legal standards, they can claim someone is an "enemy combatant" on a whim.

       But again, trials and habeas corpus are granted to US citizens. If we give it to someone we deem a terrorist, then we're expanding those rights further than they were intended. An enemy combatant has no choice but to be classified as such by Congress and the President. And it is.I understand your stance, I'm just struggling to see how it would work in a worse case scenario.

       Trials and habeas corpus are granted to all citizens and non-citizens as a practical matter.  Because if we arbitrarily decide that some foreign national doesn't get extended the courtesy of a trial or
       <em>
        especially habeas corpus
       </em>
       which is intended to prevent governments from
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance">
        "disappearing"
       </a>
       individuals, then foreign governments will claim the right to disappear U.S. citizens based on U.S. precedent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bill of Rights specifically refrains from any requirement that the rights are only to apply to U.S. citizens.  The language is intentionally broad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of these discussions confuse "being a non-citizen" with "being an illegal resident".  There's a vast grey area between them of tax-paying, social-security funding (even when in fact they do not receive those benefits), well-behaved (because they'd get thrown out if they weren't) legal residents who could easily find themselves losing out if citizenship was the boundary of human rights in the US.

       Being charged does not imply guilt; if one is confirmed in a procedure fitting one's citizenship status to have committed an act of treason, then subsequent trials will assume a different quality, if they occur at all.  However, the fact of being charged does not formally suspend legal rights; it merely drives the media to agree with wanton abuse.

       So if someone were to go overseas and commit atrocious acts against the US while still maintaining citizenship, you would have to be arrested and charged before any guilt is issued beforehand in your example. Though this is ideal, this isn't how the powers given to Congress and the President are interpreted, thus why we are allowed drone attacks.

       So...you think it's unfair for people to pre-judge this guy before he's tried, but totally cool to pre-judge the judicial process he's going to go through before it has even begun? Yeah, that makes sense...

       The difference is that this guy doesn't have a proven track record of being "broken."
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words: "So you say that scratched pan you've never cooked things on might be perfectly fine, but you're going to prejudge the stove that caught on fire and burned down as being broken and unable to heat up the pan before you even try to turn it on?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, we don't have an alternative working stove with which to test the pan. We've got the stove we've got. And that leads to even more conspiracy theories about why the pan doesn't heat up.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I'm not supporting either side, just explaining that there's no black and white here at any level of the issue.)

       Also, the brokenness of the US criminal justice system is overrated and most of the people who rant about that don't have much to compare it to. Yes, it is fucked in many disturbing ways, but as someone who lived in China for years and worked with dissidents there, I'll put it this way: if I was going to be arrested and tried for a crime I didn't commit, I would sure as shit want it to be in the US and not there.

       Why do you need to compare it to something? I get that you're saying that there's a scale of brokenness, and that the U.S.'s criminal justice system is less broken than others, but does that make it not broken?
      </p>
      <p>
       I just see that kind of logic used constantly to justify actions that probably shouldn't exist in a nation we like to call "free." "Well, you think your rights are being trampled on in America? Just try going to Uganda!" It's nonsense. Just because something's worse somewhere else doesn't mean it should exist without questioning where you are observing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like saying you shouldn't fix your car's brakes until the whole thing's as broken as the neighbor's rusted out jalopy growing weeds in the front yard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit to add: I didn't see your initial link, and again I say that this kid did not have a proven track record. This kid had NO track record. The article in question is regarding his brother, and there's a paragraph in there that clearly states the FBI found zero relation to the allegations after a thorough investigation. It's hearsay (and the allegations could have come from anyone - a jilted lover, an angry boss, anyone), not a proven track record. If a "tip from a foreign government" ends with zero evidence and no leads for the FBI, how is that proven evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, that's neither here nor there, because the person in question in that article is NOT the person we're discussing in the thread.

       Brevity is a good thing on reddit, especially.  Ever noticed how your short comments tend to get way more upvotes than the ones you put a lot of thought and effort into?  I admit, I'm guilty of not reading especially long comments, myself, depending on how interested I am in the topic being discussed.

       <em>

       to be held to a higher standard, comparing it to some horrible dictatorship (or whatever) isn't exactly very inspiring.

       Exactly. Every time my father and I get into discussions about current events, he brings up Nazi Germany and how none of us have anything to complain about because we don't live there/then. Or if I bring up issues in the healthcare system (he's a doctor), he'll say, "Well, whatever. Try needing a triple bypass in the Middle Ages, if you think there's something wrong with our healthcare. Let's see how long you live then."

       I'm not saying we shouldn't
       <em>
        fix
       </em>
       the car's brakes. What I'm saying is that when people say "This car will never get us anywhere," that's bullshit. Sure, our car breaks down from time to time, but often enough it actually does get us from point A to point B. In comparison, China's car is missing most of its wheels, and can only get from point A to point B if being dragged behind a large truck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously we should fix everything about our system. What I'm saying is the fact that there are problems with the justice system sometimes does not prove that this guy isn't going to get a fair trial. He
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       not get a fair trial, because yes, our "car" sometimes breaks down. But let's wait until there's any evidence that's actually happening before getting upset about it.

       What do you mean "pre-judge?" The judicial process through which he'll be going (or not going, technically) can be judged on its merits. And, as such, it can be said with great certainty that "No, never:" he will NOT be getting a fair trial.

       From what I've understood from headlines is that the two guys were suspects. It really blows my mind that first they
       <strong>
        shot
       </strong>
       the another one and then it took FBI and Boston police forces like 10 hours to catch the another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that US has it wrong, but I believe this is utter bullshit. No police forces of anykind can take so long to catch a man, who fled from the very same car as the one ho was shot. This is all just wicked campaign to run your stupid gun law in, since your country's politics is so inefficient that nothing can be done without these media shows. No offence, but that surely what it looks like to me.

       If obvious evidence comes out that he is innocent, then people will change their minds.

       While I personally agree with you, the "court" of public opinion is not in fact a court. "Innocent until proven guilty in a court of law," is the full text. Not really a point in the justice system if the proper procedures aren't conducted fairly and honestly.

       I just think it's funny that people say he won't get a fair trial, because of all this media exposure. That's he's already been labeled guilty, and that he's basically already been sentenced to death. They seem to forget that a lot of these high profile court cases actually turn out to BENEFIT the defendant. Who here honestly thought O.J. was innocent? Doesn't matter, he was found not guilty. What about Casey Anthony? Doesn't matter, she was found not guilty.

       So, we are never supposed to trust any source that's not some guys Youtube video of edited together Family Guy clips? How do you personally decide which information you trust and which you don't? This is what bugs me so much about this subreddit. Selectively choosing what you want to believe, and from whom, when it fits your agenda. You'll believe an anonymous person on 4chan, who could literally be ANYONE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD, but not a police officer who was AT the scene of the crime.

       Are we sure? They could give him the ol' "James Holmes" treatment. Or he could be a seriously duped patsy like Abdulmutallab and believe it all. I'm actually leaning toward that. But I definitely could consider another James Holmes type situation.

       The Illuminati are real, and you don't know what all these slurs you hurl even mean. I believe in a puppet master behind the scenes that doesn't have everybody's best interest. Garbage?

       I live 20 minutes north of Boston. I don't have cable and got all the news from this week online. If I were picked for the jury, I'd have a pretty clean slate. I've been bombarded with opinions but not many facts. I haven't posted any Facebook statuses or tweets in reference to "Boston Pride" or anything like that. I think I'd be a damn good jury member. He deserves a fair trial, like the rest of us.

       He should get a fair trial, but nothing he did makes him deserve it other than being a citizen (is he?).

       He is NOT an american citizen,.. his brother was. He only has his green card. Also as many sites are reporting they have NOT read him his Miranda rights,.. as he will be tried as a combatant against the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will see as much real court room coverage as you see for the gitmo trials.... oh ... wait... that would be none. They will classify this under national security and ONLY announce his sentence to appease the sheep... I doubt if anything this man says will hit the lamestream media.

       Good point. I remember a criminal justice class early in my college years where they mentioned that very high profile criminal cases are virtually impossible to have a fair trial because everyone has an opinion and there are tons of facts every where.
      </p>
      <p>
       But seriously, the guy deserves a good legal defense. A local forum I was reading brought up the possibility that the older brother might've led the younger brother into doing things he might not have known the actual consequences.

       Just... come on... he's 19 years old; you know that KILLING PEOPLE is wrong when you're 19, and you know there are consequences. Granted more will come to light, but to date there is no reason to believe he's insane or mentally handicapped either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand how anyone can- especially at this point where there is no evidence to support his being mentally incapable- could throw out the "he didn't know what he was doing" routine. It makes me a little angry/sick; I feel for the families that will have to put up with hearing people go down this road, telling them that it's ok- he just couldn't help it/didn't know what he was doing. Fuck that.

       I'm sure he will. Lawyers all over the place will be chomping at the bit to get their name associated with this case. He'll probably get free representation from a (few) big law firm that will drag the case out as long as possible to get as much advertising out of it as they can.

       The evidence against him is pretty damning. The guy that lost his legs identified him for starters. Saw him drop the bag that blew up

       This is the first ACTUAL terrorist caught since 9/11 in the US. It's going to be a massive news story for years probably.

       But if he is, and the videos of the planting and shooting are released after the trial (needs to be fair). And the witness testimonies (car driver and witness who lost his legs + cops) are you going to pfut this to rest? No, of course not. The car driver was a plant. The marathon witness was coerced. The video isn't clear enough (because all video is hd until they want to put up cameras, then they're overstepping, right? 1984!!!!!). Give me a break.

       Why are you sympathetic toward this individual? There appears to be overwhelming evidence he is a pussy-ass terrorist that have come in the form of

      </p>
      <p>
       Once proven guilty (which he ultimately will be given there's far more video evidence that hasn't been released to the public), he will deserve nothing short of death. I know there's a lot of anti-government sentiment in this sub, but these types of individuals must be made an example of. You don't fuck with our peaceful civilian events. Innocents do not need to die.. it's not their fight. If you bring terror to our populace, you're going to pay.

       Okay then, so read them their rights as U.S. citizens. The thing is, if you are going to have a small number of people controlling a large number of people, as with government, then hypocrisy must never be tolerated. If they make rules, they should never break them. It undermines authority.

       Exactly. This is why our leaders must take an oath to uphold the Constitution.

       Any violation of that oath should result in being dismissed from public office and possible treason charges.

       I think the constitution at the time granted the government more authority than it deserved, but of course, it was not enough. I prefer the articles of confederation. N State rights, no fiat currency or commerce clause.

       Yes. He has been proven guilty of atleast shooting at police officers and throwing explosives at them, as well as carjacking. That much HAS been proven, because it was witnessed happening.

       They are not withholding his maranda rights to screw him over. They want answers, and they want to know what happens. If what they get from him can't be used in the court of law, then maybe he will be more likely to talk.

       Notice how everyone had all sorts of theories as too who the bomber could be? Then when the authority figure (the fbi) said they knew who it was, all the major subreddits etc made a knee jerk follow the fascist "IT WAS HIM."

       They never said those two did it. They said that they were suspects. The FBI has video proof that they wouldn't release publicly because it would compromise the integrity of the trial.

      <p>
       The 14th amendment gives you the right to a fair trial by due process. If they release the video of them placing the bombs, everyone (including prospective jurors, witnesses) know he's guilty. Those videos are withheld until the trial and then shown to the jury. Witnesses who testify already saw them do it. They describe the video without having seen the video.

       Oh, the old "secret evidence" ploy. If you have the proof fucking show it. This is a national event, if the evidence can't stand up in the court of public opinion, why the fuck should it stand in a trial?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Quite aware that is the normal justification given, and it normally would suffice. But jesus christ they initiated a military level response to find this guy. In light of what they have done, perhaps justly, there should be NO SECRETS.

       Descriptions of what? Even if they didn't place the bombs they killed a cop last night, stole a cop car, possibly robbed a gas station, and ran from the police. Why would they have done ANY of those things if they weren't guilty?

       "Witnesses who testify already saw them do it." - as in descriptions of those who supposedly saw the placing the bomb(s). These other issues have nothing to do with the core issue, which I would like to remain focused on.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your other comments though, I only have this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine yourself, you see yourself on the news. You hear the news about the militarized police search. You didn't do it. You're a smart kid, you know about guantamo, brutal US police, torture etc. You'd do anything to escape that. You know what the United States security forces due to people it deems "enemies."
      </p>
      <p>
       You also know that if they blame it on you, there realistically isn't shit you can do. You know what you might do? You just might do something crazy like jack a car, jack an atm, try to escape the encircling net.
      </p>
      <p>
       What seems crazy to someone who is safe and comfortable, wouldn't seem so crazy if the powers that be decided to use you as a patsy.

       I know people do stupid things when they're desperate. I think that it's hard to not find them guilty of the bombing after what happened last night and today. Suicide vest on the older brother, throwing bombs/grenades at the police, etc.

       I love how you use these vague sweeping statements to prove[sic] your point.  Just because you don't have the evidence doesn't mean it isn't there.  They shot at police, jacked  a car, got in a chase while throwing fucking bombs out of their car, black hat died with a bomb strapped to his chest, there is a picture of white hat setting his backpack down at the place where the bomb went off on marathon day, and I'm sure much more evidence that is being withheld and/or hasn't been leaked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you attempt to disprove the entire thing and imply it's some type of set-up or inside-job with sound logic like "if they don't show all the evidence to whiny redditors right now then they have no evidence!".
      </p>
      <p>
       This is only the beginning, assuming he survives there will be a loooong trial process where any evidence the state has will come out and any defense the suspect has will come out.  As of right now you are desperately trying to make this big conspiratorial plot where there is none and you look downright silly.

       The police are not required to read you your Miranda Rights when they arrest you. This is a common myth fostered by television shows. They only have to read you your rights prior to a custodial interrogation; if they don't, then the only consequence is that they can't use any of your statements from that confession. They could still use any other legally-obtained evidence they have against you in court. It's important to remember that you still have those rights whether the police read them to you or not.

       You actually just reminded me of how they've conducted trials for Guantanamo prisoners in that the evidence against a person is not revealed to them because it could compromise national security. The person is then conflicted with everyone just taking their word for it that evidence exists.

       They don't have to actually release and prove anything.  They make the rules. Until we as a populous can rise up and take what is ours NOTHING will change. They will come into our cities and rule with Martial Law.

       There is more evidence to show that he was shooting than he wasn't. We have a picture of suspect #1 dead which matches the pictures, we have witness video of shooting taking place in the area, and we have a picture of suspect #2 on the ground near the boat. I would highly doubt a city would be put to a standstill and the officers carrying out a "fake" mission with people in their houses recording everything they're doing. There is also evidence of suspect #2 running from the scene without a backpack and a picture of him at the exact blast area with his backpack on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       What evidence is there that he wasn't shooting? He doesn't look like a terrorist... so? One person who looks like one of the police officers from Sandy Hook, is that good enough? No. Some guy on 4chan who made a general outline of what would happen which was partly correct, is that good enough? No.
      </p>
      <p>
       You people are merely grabbing at sticks because you, for some reason, want it to be a conspiracy. What is so good about conspiracy? What makes you crave for conspiracy? It makes no sense and you are just putting yourself in a box in which you cannot live without being afraid of your surroundings.

       You need to format your thoughts a little better, you don't make much sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also a lot of people who "believe in conspiracies", which you must not, have done a lot of reading, a lot of studying history, a lot of leg work that got them to that mindset, it's not just an "INSTANT" thing.  Took me about 5 years to come to the realization that things aren't as they seem, that there are manipulations happening in the public psyche, that they are intentional, and that it's all been planned out for about 100 years.  The people who planned all this wrote books about how they would do it and
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       they are doing it.  A lot of this isn't just speculation, people see a concerted effort to drastically change society into a one world government run by a technocratic elite.  In order to keep the people in line they need to scare them, they need to create problems that they have a pre-made solution for.

       This is a very good point, and I appreciate the effort and thought put into many topics here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was frustrated earlier due to the fact that claims are made and when there are holes in those claims, people try to fill in the holes by themselves  with information that is simply not there. I was personally trying to use examples that were showing that one aspect of the story has at least some backbone.

       Why is this surprising to you on the

      <p>
       There are more reasons than what you paint here for people to think this might be some sort of set up. Most importantly, what is the motive? The Boston Marathon is a global event, made up of all different nations, religions, and other affiliations. If the attack were religious or even nationalistic in nature, this type of event doesn't really make much sense symbolically. These big picture pieces of the puzzle do not make sense yet, and the fact that you can parrot the 'official' story does not impress many here (other than the shill army).
      </p>

       <p>
        It makes no sense and you are just putting yourself in a box in which you cannot live without being afraid of your surroundings.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The whole thing doesn't make sense, so that's not saying much. And nobody here is afraid; what the hell are you talking about? People on this board are not afraid; they use knowledge as a tool against those who would conspire. A 'conspiracy' is not really such an outlandish idea; people secretly working together towards a common goal is not a hard concept to understand or imagine happening. Until the information comes forward that makes this whole thing stand up, people are going to doubt. It doesn't help that the previous 2 massacres were left with so many questions unanswered either...

       Are you really a person? With a functioning brain? Can you feed yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can be a dickhead too. Why don't you try and provide evidence to defend your opinion rather than being a toolbag?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I was merely saying that conspiracy theories should not be formed until there is evidence of collusion occurring. If you look too long at any situation you will always find something that looks off. No matter who the suspects were, no matter what evidence there was you people would still point at there being conspiracies.

       It's just that in these types of events, one way or another, some person or persons were without a doubt covertly scheming or conspiring. It's in our face - someone has done this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's a great thing people are looking at all angles, because its not as if authority figures haven't been known to conspire (in the negative sense) in the past. Why rule that out prematurely?

       Another question is why didn't they kill the owner of the Mercedes?  They allegedly told the driver of the Mercedes they were the guys responsible for Monday.  LE also claims they were prepared to kill innocent people, yet they let the driver go or escape after they admitted to the attacks on Monday?  Kinda odd they would let that person live..

       Exactly.  Why would they say that, who does that?  Also, the picture of the kid in the "robbed 7-11" .. it just looks like he's casually strolling in the store to me.  They don't show any footage of him near the register or actually robbing the place.  Don't the cameras usually point down to the register?

       And why would they walk into the 7-11 without even the slightest disguise?  And so casually, when their faces are plastered over every news outlet?
      </p>

       Why would Tamerlan walk up to the window to watch what Dzhokar was doing inside?  Why risk being placed

       I know they needed gas, so it was probably inevitable that they had to show themselves on camera, but I just got a funny feeling about this.

       I just don't see how all the pieces fit together.  Until I do, I gotta stay skeptical about this.

       There are reports of multiple cops with injuries from the shootout. If you're going to say that the FBI, BPD, paramedics, and hospitals were in on it too you might as well go to "well how do you know your reality is real and maybe this is all just a dream?"

       The point is how do you know that the Police didn't shoot first, which is an automatic presumption that you've made without any evidence to back it up, because your natural instinct (like almost all of us raised in this culture) is authority=good guys.

       The cop was shot inside his police car. And why does it matter who shot first? The fact is he shot at police. Also,  what about the grenades that were used and explosives found?

       To use your own logic:

      <p>
       Cops shot at him. What is he gonna do? Just let them shoot at him and take it?

       Surrender and try to provide an alibi for being the suspect, maybe? I'm assuming the police had already announced themselves as such pre-gunshots... or at least pulled up in a squad car. Shooting at a cop or a soldier is usually a really bad idea.

       Seriously...seriously? Not everything that ever happens is a conspiracy.  This sub is a joke. Remember how ape shit it went during the olympics?  Aliens, terrorist attacks, zionist takeover.  How about we have some factual discussion and investigation rather than "Nuhuh you can't provehe did".  Yeah man the paramedics at the scene must be part of the conspiracy.  Along with every forensics investigator who will investigate, every cop who responded, every possible eyewitness, you get the point.

       How would it compromise the integrity of the trial? I don't buy it. U.S. intelligence/authorities are the worst lying scumbags in the world. They may be planning to kill the next dude, too, so there's sure to be no trial. Don't just believe whatever the FBI says; that's ten times more idiotic than any "conspiracy theory."

       The 14th amendment gives you the right to a fair trial by due process. If they release the video of them placing the bombs, everyone (including prospective jurors, witnesses) know he's guilty. Those videos are withheld until the trial and then shown to the jury. Witnesses who testify already saw them do it. They describe the video without having seen the video.

       I swear man every tinfoil hatter here thinks everyone is out to get them and the FBI will be knocking on their door to strip them of their rights any day now... It's just irrational.

       Why would the FBI release information?  Are you dumb or just a bit tapped in the head (I ask as someone who is borderline schizophrenic)?  You think a day after naming the main suspects they would give away all the information they have, giving the defense a heads up on how to find loopholes and make a case? I don't think you understand these things in the slightest.

       To be honest I read yours after reading a bunch of other posts that made me angry and must have just read it whilst assigning those feelings to your post.  Re-read and I understand your post, and my reply was pretty bad.  For sake of discussion I do disagree with number 2 though slightly.  Perhaps if you stayed there for a while yes, but if it is only a day or two after you find the suspects (who are quite possibly heavily armed...whether that turns out to be the case or not remains), seems fine to me.  I do however understand the possible negative implications if this were to become the status quo, but I believe it will be a matter of opportunism, rather than conspiracy.  With a suspect, who is fleeing and able to watch the news, search the internet (social media, forums, police forums, etc), call someone, get a precise longitude and latitude location on the globe, use satnav, have a camera and video camera and zoom camera, have a flashlight,have a stopwatch; you can't be giving away too much information.

       This x 100000000. It sickens me. The "GOT HIM!" post that shows him with his face bashed in hurts me, despite whatever crimes he may have committed with or without his brother. I don't believe hate and violence compounded into previous tragedy solves anything. We should be looking for the solution to these things rather than revelling in the revenge.

       His face wasn't bashed in, the blood was from the bullet he took to the neck. He also took one in the leg. In the boat, he was bleeding out for over 18 hours. They didn't assault him, he was on the verge of death when they captured him.

       No one took "revenge" on him. He was curled up in the fetal position, bleeding out for 20 hours. He was ushered out of the boat, and given medical care. Not exactly my definition of hatred and violence. Please take an objective look at what actually happened before posting sensationalist crap

       I'm talking about the thirst for blood and the 'FUCK YEA AMERICA' that comes from a big section of people when things like this happen. A suspect is dead without trial and people are partying because of that. There is no want to understand why this kid did what he did; they just want him dead. That saddens me. I thought we were better than that. Violence doesn't stop violence.

       I agree with your overall sentiment. I too felt ashamed when people threw parties when Osama Bin Laden was killed, because it seemed moot at that point. This is different though. People celebrated their capture because this guy posed a legitmate threat to the city of Boston. I have family Boston. They were terrified to leave the house with Suspect2 still loose. I think the celebration was more about feeling safe again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree with the sentiment that people want them dead. No one really celebrated the killing of Suspect 1. It was the capture of the second suspect that was celebrated, because it brought closure to a week's worth of anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also-"violence doesn't stop violence." In this case, it quite literally did. The dead suspect was a known killer, and he was trying to kill more innocent people. Killing him was a measure taken to prevent more violence. If you shoot at police officers, they're going to shoot back. Thats standard operations.

       Trawling through reddit as it was unfolding, I saw and felt differently. But to your point, as much as there are people/media/authorities being ugly about this, there is also the opposite in effect as well. We're seeing both the best and worst of it at once.

       You have no proof that his face was 'bashed in' by the police arresting him. Considering the boat owner reported someone in his boat because he saw blood, it's entirely possible that his injuries were previously sustained.

       Where did I say that? I said it hurts me to see that; I don't really care who did it. What does the fact that he is a suspect have to do with 'large liabilities with their assumptions'? Read shit more carefully. I never spoke against anybody other than people getting a hard on over this whole manhunt. Police have a job to do; I don't blame them for doing it. I do blame the media tho.

       Enjoy your hatred, man. I prefer to go without it. Also, he's a fucking suspect; he hasn't been convicted of shit. Don't get ahead of yourself; part of this country is having a fair trial. When and if his part in this gets proven, i'm sure the punishment will fit the crime. Also, where's your fucking passion when it comes to the 50 some odd bombed in Iraq a half day after the Boston thing? Why aren't you asking for anybody to be executed there?

       Seriously, why did I have to scroll down this far to find this comment? OP may be technically correct, but there's no doubt this guy is guilty of at least one of these big crimes.
       <strong>
        We also have only been exposed to a controlled amount of evidence against this guy.
       </strong>
       It's not like the FBI decided
       <em>
        this is the guy
       </em>
       based on the same news stories we've been seeing. The FBI has a LOT more evidence on these guys than we've been exposed to. The chances that he just coincidentally
       <em>
        happened
       </em>
       to be an innocent bystander at the Boston Marathon during a terrorist attack
       <strong>
        the same week
       </strong>
       that he got in a shootout/hijacking are extremely unlikely.

       He does, I'm just saying that it's a little naive to back this guy up when the evidence is pretty clear. Obviously WE haven't seen any
       <strong>
        hard
       </strong>
       evidence that he was a bomber, but the FBI found him the most likely. He was obviously running from
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       all week, and it's pretty apparent (judging by their social networking sites that have been exposed, particularly YouTube) that they have an interest in terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       He deserves a fair trial, but anyone with that much evidence will most likely be convicted. And that's not unfair, that's just how court works.

       One thing everyone forgets is that he can be "innocent until proven guilty in a court of law" and still be super guilty. One refers to the actual guilt, and one refers to legal guilt. No he has not yet been tried, but the general public does have enough information to come to a conclusion on our ideas of whether he is guilty or not. Oftentimes we should refrain from judgement because we don't know the facts, but at this point we do have enough information to make an informed decision, even if that decision is not the legally binding kind that we send people to jail for.

       He honestly does, but the majority of America will probably never care if he doesn't. It's probably because most people assume no matter what he  will end up in the same situation. Also it will be almost impossible to find an impartial jury in this country that has not already been biased by the news and events.

       If it is such an open and shut case, then why be so opposed to treating him like the murder he is, and have an open and fair trial put the evidence on the table for all of us to see, and let Avg Americans send his ass to the electric chair? 
 Some people would say that it is a resource issue and that taxpayers shouldn't pay for him to stay alive, but considering the cost of the manhunt and shut down, I call BS

       The problem is that you're already saying "neutral towards your guilt." That is not how the justice system works, it relies on the fact that he's innocent until proven guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't stand the majority of this subreddit, but I'll be a lot more nervous when the population stops asking questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I think this is the person who planted the bombs? Yes, his pictures came from hundreds of bystanders, you can do the detective work yourself. Do I still think he deserves a fair trial? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I think the government coordinated these attacks in any way? No. Do I think the government takes advantage of EVERY single one of these events to trade freedom for security? Indisputably. People get scared and emotional, and they don't notice when the Patriot Act or the NDAA goes through, because it's America vs. the bad guys and it's okay that we're being protected.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that CISPA is going through right now is just a terrible coincidence, but it is unquestionably being affected by this incident. That is not an opinion. I have been talking about CISPA for the last few days, and almost everyone I've talked to outside of reddit has no problem with it, because it would help stop things like 'the Boston marathon from happening again.'

       Because he did allegedly commit the crime.  You don't get to remove that word without a trial; it doesn't mater whether you have video evidence watching him do it, a signed confession and 20 million witnesses.

       There is something that is misunderstood about "innocent until proven guilty"
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't mean that he didn't do it. We, the citizenry, don't have to put on kid gloves. It simply means that until he gets a trail, the government must act as if he is innocent, with only reasonable precautions like holding him in jail before and during the trail. They must also distinctly prove guilt, and not just disprove innocence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he were to be treated correctly, he would be eligible for the death penalty and the people calling for blood will get their wish.

       Well to counter the government aspect of your post, I don't think the government is smart enough to come up with ways to trick the US public, but I do believe they are pawns in a game higher up in the food chain. Politicians are just front-men. They are the middleman between the real owners of this country, and the masses. They take orders. They do what they are told. If they are told to feed us shit with a smile, they do it. That being said, I believe its
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Elite">
        the power elite
       </a>
       that are taking rights away from us, with the help of the government cronies they elected to assist in easing the transition. The government doesn't want to take your rights/guns etc away, the power elite do. But the government is just the lobbyists for the power elite, and assist in marketing their agenda for the masses to consume.

       So would you say if hypothetically someone is directly seen by many shooting someone in the head and is captured on camera, that man is still "innocent until proven guilty"?. I think it is fair for people to just downright know he is guilty, not neccesarily of the boston bombing, but atleast of all the shit that went down last night

       That's the justice system you'd like to live with, one where we just "know you're guilty?" This exact thinking is what allows the NDAA to exist. Well if we deem them associated with Taliban or Al'Qaeda, then we "know they're guilty." First of all, since when is being associated with a group illegal? Oh, and then they go ON to say that a damning cause can be as vague as a "belligerent act." So now a "belligerent act" is enough to "know you're guilty," with no need for trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you requesting that he be denied due process? If the evidence is as clear as it appears to be, then justice prevails and the system works.

       Was he "directly seen by many shooting someone in the head?" Source? And if he was, then a trial would be the way to establish that the person seen doing this was indeed the man in custody. We may consider it likely, based on what we have heard, that the man is guilty, but our standard of evidence is not as rigorous as the court's.

       While the FBI is allegedly notorious for solving their own crimes - that methodology isn't similar to what a clearly distraught mother is claiming, and it most certainly doesn't match up with what you're proposing.
      </p>

       It's even worse when the main sources proposing a set up rely on already disproven misconceptions and snippets of coverage from when this whole story just began to unfold (you know, the most rapid fire and unreliable information.)

       Ah true true, i was recalling incorrectly the pre-trial of Zimmerman. Anyways, that's a defense for someone else's remark. My remarks still stands, all three are thought to be guilty by the general population. Zimmerman still is, no one needs to hold an opinion on OJ Simpson anymore and Casey Anthony got away despite the entire country raging over her "obvious" guilt. So yeah i'd say all three were thought to be guilty by the general population, all without time traveling!

       The innocent don't run like that.  You are incredibly naive.  I for one hope the doctors give him too much morphine and he dies.  The families of those killed and those that were maimed should be spared a trial.

       It's a good reminder that humans are pack animals, capable of irrational behavior. Was Freud wrong in thinking humans were gripped by Thantos and a negative, aggressive impulse?

       "..and sympathizing with the murderer."
You do realize that many of the conspiracy theorist you're critiquing don't believe he's the murderer, right? The rest believe there are other forces behind these incidents, which kinda explains the "sympathy" the whole not believing he's completely at fault is what defines them

       I get it. But it doesn't make it any less disgusting. They can believe whatever they want, right or wrong. But when you start to harass people that got their legs blown off at a marathon or lost their child to a bullet to the face then you can clearly go fuck yourself.

       It honestly does not take much skill to build a pipe bomb. Anyone who's reasonably intelligent and has access to supplies can do it. we just need to keep the attention off of the shooter.

       There was a lot of confusion, but there were only two explosions reported at the marathon itself.  There was an 'explosion' at the JFK library, but it turned out to just be a fire in an electrical room.

       I was watching live coverage after the bombing and another explosion happened while a reporter was giving her report. She thought maybe they were setting off other explosives they had found. I can't recall the source... it was available online.

       No, I knew that wasn't related. However, I do recall many mentions of other explosives being found in trash cans-- but the two bombs at the forefront of this story were beside the track. And there were controlled detonations of additional explosives found, if I am not mistaken. This is all just a compilation of what I have heard on Monday and the days following. I actually have not heard at all that it was only two explosives. All I've seen has offered a final count of at least 3-4.

       Eh, Bomb Disposal guys do that with suspicious things to be safe quite often. I knew a guy who had his Ipad blown up because he accidentally left his bag in the wrong place. And when there's already confirmed bombs, they're going to play it safer than usual, as well.

       From all eye witness accounts that I've heard, there wasn't more than 2 explosions at the marathon.  They did however reportedly use explosives while being chased after killing the MIT police officer.

       I will go back and read more into what exactly happened Monday, because we have apparently gathered different information. I didn't truly look deeply into this situation until about Thursday, aside from watching the news Monday. So since Thursday I have been playing catch up with the details of Monday's events (which have been a little drowned out by Thursday and Friday's).

       There was an even more strange situation in the holmes case, where I have seen a picture that suddenly vanished and no one seemed to remember that it even excisted. Gladly there was one person who replied to me that he has seen that picture too, otherwise I would've needed to question my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit, I can't even remember today what the picture exactly showed, I sure make notes from now on and save everything that is suspicious. I think it was a picture where you could see two persons, holmes and another one, exactly like the people in the cinema described in the beginning, that there were two people, him and a man who looked like a SWAT in body armor and helmet, but that was forgotten completely later and it was only him in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you remember the stories of another one involved amd there was a man with a full body suite and pictures on the parking lot with just holmes in normal dress without professional clothing?

       Well, no, I do not remember that. But I believe it. 
See, until this incident I never paid any attention to anything conspiracy related. I have always fully trusted the government and anything they tell us-- hence why I signed up to serve and protect the country under their thumb... 
But this Boston Marathon changed everything for me. I will never believe a word they say again. Trust no one.

       That's good, but please be careful. You have to make sure that you won't climb too deep into the rabbit hole and make sure that you don't get mad about the fact that there is almost nothing you can do. It's dangerous to take it all too personal and let it affect your life. Things like that can trigger a psychosis by some people. If you start to see a conspiracy in everything and feel like they're onto you, please pull the emergency break and stop.

       Yes, I agree totally. Just from last night's 8 hour internet scouring session I feel stressed and frustrated. I think it's time for a break. But it is very upsetting to see such obvious flaws in this story and to believe that we as a country are just oh so wrong...

       A trick that did it for me is to think logical to not get into the state of a helplessly . I compared it with the same mechanism that stops me from crying about every dead person I see in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the Illuminati for me which made me start to look more into things than we get presented. I was kind of a freak about it when I was 19 and feeled that I had to step back from the emotions I put into it. Stay calm and think logically, not emotional. I think that is a dangerous combination if it goes too far. For any questions or discussions about every excisting topic, feel free to shoot me a message.

       That's the only picture I can find now. (Note-- not even a backpack in that picture, but a bag.) But of course we've all seen the picture of the black backpack near the young boy. And I remember hearing on Monday that there were supposedly bombs in trash cans being found. I found the final unofficial count of at least 4 explosives here:

       Well the photos were minutes before the bomb went off and then the second bomb was 10 seconds. That probably means they were walking down the track putting each bomb down and the last two didn't go off.

       The question wasn't whether or not they went off, it was the logistics of two men with 4 explosives. Not calling it impossible, but if there were, in fact, at least 4 explosives... Where were they? In the backpacks? Did they remove them from the backpacks and place them and then leave backpacks? Did they make a second trip from the car to get the others? It just seems unlikely.

       they could probably find them here! although flooded with media intel, not everyone formulates an absolute opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. I for one don't have an opinion about any of this other than to say i don't like to see us as a compassionately capable species be so blood thirsty! guilty ppl should serve theie penance but more and more we just seek death in all matters disagreeable!

       They have their scapegoat, taken alive. I'm not sure if its just me but the cheering and rejoicing is pretty sickening. 
Human sacrificing is alive and well in modern society.

       Did they force this "scapegoat" to shoot and throw explosives at police? Cheering and rejoicing over him dying would be sickening, but he was captured alive, with strict orders to not return fire by FBI and SWAT, and was given medical attention. What's sickening about rejoicing that a dangerous man was captured and is no longer putting the city in danger?

       come on man. the guy has left an entire city in torment for 32 hours and aided in one of the largest attacks on American soil in recent memory. I don't find the cheering sickening whatsoever, it's just people celebrating that they don't need to worry anymore.

       As far as I'm concerned, he is innocent until
       <em>
        proven
       </em>
       guilty in a
       <em>
        fair
       </em>
       trial. A fuzzy video doesn't convince me. The police or the FBI claiming that eyewitnesses identified him doesn't convince me. The police or FBI saying that they threw bombs at them or fired on them doesn't convince me.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does
       <em>
        appear
       </em>
       that these are the right two guys. But until I see evidence that is beyond doubt that it is in fact them, I'm not going to celebrate their being caught or their being killed.
       <em>
        Statements
       </em>
       from the police or FBI don't convince me. I know that those guys will say
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       to keep from looking like they fucked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's at stake here is not that we think these two guys are necessarily innocent, or are good guys for bombing people. What is at stake here is the basic right for people to receive their fair day in court.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that the government
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       set up false flag events. I know that they
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       set up false flag events in the past. I know that the government
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       set up innocent people for crimes they didn't commit. And almost all we have to go on right now is the
       <em>
        word
       </em>
       of the government - a government that has proven itself to lie about this stuff before.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I am skeptical. Because if no one is skeptical of our government, then it will do any and every thing it can to feed itself and grow more powerful, up to and including killing innocent people, and framing innocent people for some political agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying these guys didn't do it. I'm just saying that until he's proven to be the one who did, he has rights. And that knee-jerk 'MURRICA stuff about cutting off his head, well that just puts people at the same level as true terrorists - striking back without narrowing down your target to people who you are positive deserve it.

       What mob mentality?  All I'm seeing is people grateful bombs and shootings going through redditor's homes have stopped. If you had to hide in your closet while a gun battle raged through the streets of your city, I think you wouldn't be above joining in on the mob. The mob hasn't and won't murder this man. I am looking forward to the trial so that so many potential conspiracies will fail.

       I believe however, I did... They are exercising their rights to deploy armed military in the streets.

       Again, I spoke about how these things dont happen overnight, it takes time, decades even, just because you dont see it within 48 hours does not mean its not at work, that things arent at play.

       They bussed in hundreds of police... they had multiple MRAPS deployed with troops walking the streets and guys at the gunner position... for one 19 year old

       While everything is in fact a combustion, a coup of this size take decades before your average minded individual can see the results of the explosion.

       1933 Germany no one thought Hitler was evil... 1943, entirely different story.

       Its ok though, again, enjoy your pint, I'm happy that this event is over and that our Police State got to demonstrate the extent of their power over a 19 year old

       Play on your emotions? This thread is about stopping the "witch hunt" in MY city. While basement dwelling armchair warriors defend the guys and say it's not really happening. That we no longer have rights because people were outside cheering because they could leave the house for the first time that day and the guy throwing bombs was no longer hiding in their neighborhood. Do you realize how stupid that makes you sound?

       What makes you people happy? The guy was arrested in a peaceful surrender and you're going on as if this was Dorner, pt. 2. You're going to feel foolish when he stands trial, but I'm sure by then Infowars will have something else to say.

      <p>
       And as for the chanting, it's really not so unbelievable or crazy mob activity, it was a show of gratitude for and pride in the uniformed personnel who worked so hard to make today's arrest. Not all cops are Constitution-shredding jackboots out to disarm and illegally search you, they really do get it right sometimes.

       He won't be given miranda rights, as he is a terrorist suspect. Whether he survives long enough to make it to trial is another thing. A fair trial is unlikely.

       I can't shake that this is either to distract from the 4chan images of possible mercinaries, OR this is one of those entrapment stings that either got away from them... or worse they let it go on.

       I've not understood this part fully.  I understand that the Patriot Act has some modifiers for rights granted to suspects, particularly some rights that were guaranteed in the bill of rights (attorney etc.)

       So, whats to keep the guy from just shutting up?  Say nothing, absolutely not a word.  Do they just have intense psychological interrogation techniques that would just 'break' him?  Would they starve him?  Dehydration?  Withhold medical care (he was injured)?  Practically I can see them finding a vacant cell in Cuba, but that seems like a hard sell to the public.

       There is nothing keeping him from shutting up.  Miranda rights aren't required to be read.   You
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       have Miranda rights.  If they aren't read to you at the time of your arrest, self-incriminating statements can't be used against you in court,
       <em>
        except
       </em>
       in the public-safety exception (which was probably invoked here)... i.e., "did you plant other bombs".

       If he shuts up, then america would have to resort openly to torture for information. That's if the people OK it. If not, there would be serious backlash.

       I just want to know if the only fair trial is one is which he is found not guilty. There are mountains of evidence against him, so it isn't "fair" but I do think it will be done through our legal system in a court of law. I would hope no military tribunals or any such nonsense, and apart from some GOP who want to use this to label Obama weak I don't think that is a serious option.

       excuse us for keeping an open mind to other possibilities.
plus, your statements are not backed up by proof, so they don't have too much weight here.
him being taken alive is simply common sense btw. plus, we accept everyone's opinions, we are not convinced that there is one truth, we just like to think that the truth isn't always what it seems to be. until the truth is out we're just speculating with proof.

       I have not been able to find any video of the suspects throwing bombs at the police. Is there any evidence that suggests that was what happened at this point? You have to understand that official channels are suspect on this subreddit/ so the word of the police/FBI/ whoever is not enough on the subreddit. Do you know of or can you link video of the suspects throwing bombs at the police?

       The only way to stand above scum is to treat them well. Put them in jail after a trial but don't torture them. That's what Jesus was all about, and I'm no religious man. Too bad most religious people DON'T FUCKING UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN RELIGION.

       Wait until its your family who gets their legs blown off or has to jump out of a 100 story building onto the pavement rather than burn alive in jet fuel.  While I disagree with the Watertown streets turning into Fenway park after a homerun, I don't blame the people for publicly commending law enforcement and cheering the fact that they can start to feel safe again and come out of their houses.

       They have shitty dashcam coverage of the supposed shootout. Only police chatter on the shootout. Explosions could have been them just throwing grenades saying it was explosions. People believe anything police or media tell them.

       Exactly. We can't just jump to conclusions based on the mayhem that's been going on this past week. The point is, we don't know what exactly happened or who exactly did it. That's what a trial is for, but even then some trials convict the wrong people and vice versa. Let's just hope that he survives and is allowed to speak. Also, mass media says that the man who saw the suspect in the boat said that he was covered in blood... but I only see a little bit of blood on the face in the picture that's circling around.

       I too hope he doesn't die and we get to hear why he did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       His family are just trying to look for any defence possible, which is understandable. Other suspects were chosen from pictures. Maybe they are clinging to the hope this is the same. Main difference is the other guy walked into a police station, he didn't shoot them or try and blow them up.

       What is deplorable exactly? They are giving him medical attention. A guy 1000's of people right now want dead is being given the gift of modern medicine because of the awesome justice system america has in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other places in the world giving medical attention to someone who is suspected  by the public of killing innocents would be a joke, and you would be shunned from your community for doing so if not killed yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that so many people in this sub have a kneejerk reaction to any sort of authority? I fucking hate certain things large governments have done, their are without a doubt a bunch of things that never became public domain that governments did which are immoral and despicable and their will be more in the future. But that doesn't mean every god damn bad thing that happens was in direct relation to a government like it seems this sub would have you believe. To the contrary if one were to look at all the horrible stuff to good stuff any country has done when comparing our somewhat corrupt government to most of the highly corrupt governments around the world you might stop criticizing every single action and start giving props when they are deserved.

       Something Doesn't seem right with all of this. I am not a nut job by any means SO please ... I just finished reading about the younger brother and by all accounts from hundreds of people he was a happy sweet gracious young person . Could this be some sort of ruse staged to make us think it could be anyone, anywhere, anytime and to try and divide us through paranoia and fear of each other ... I am a totally normal down to earth guy  that likes to look at both sides of every story but something just isn't right here .

       It is obviously a tragedy of what ideological motivations can do to screw with an otherwise normal person.  It isn't right, and it should make us think. But we need to accept that there is something wrong with ourselves as humans that can make horrible choices, and that it isn't some government or secret society that is causes all of our problems. The fact a good man can turn bad in the wrong circumstances is a very scary thought because it means it could be anyone you know, and you'd much rather it be someone that was an alien.

       Even if he is guilty of the crime I think it's more important to get to the bottom of things so we can do whatever possible to try to prevent it from happening again. They were both so young it just breaks my heart that someone so hateful could be so influential to such young minds. It makes me wonder what they had going on in their personal lives that would enable them to think doing something so horrific was a good thing! Makes my heart ache for everyone. It's all so senseless, and there's never any winners :-(

       Honestly, we always say we have to do what's possible to prevent it from happening again, but there's really no way to do that.  There's shit like this that happens every fucking week in the Middle East.  Don't you think if there was a way to prevent it from happening again they would've found it decades ago?  Just sayin.  I think it's just the government's way of trying to gain control over us little by little.  While everyone's busy worrying about this situation, the CISPA bill was passed by The House of Representatives this week.  I'm convinced it's all a set-up.

       I completely agree that it's more than likely a government set up. I feel that way about a lot of things that go on. It's just upsetting that so many ppl continue to get hurt. Not only the victims but the criminals too. Maybe something could have been done to save them too. Unfortunately the world is run by evil. I just can't help but remain optimistic. May be ignorant or silly but I'll always hope for better.

       I get the sense that the big brother brainwashed the kid brother. I didn't hear a negative thing about him from his former teammates, friends or neighbors.  While it certainly looks like the kid participated and should suffer the consequences, there are a lot of questions that need to be answered before we know how deeply involved he was.

       I wonder how come they aren't reporting on the character of the older brother who died already?  They're just telling about the character of the guy who's still alive.  The media uses some slick tactics.  Or maybe I'm just too much of a conspiracy theorist for my own good.

       I have seen a lot of information about the guy.  He apparently was the ringleader of this operation, and was interviewed by the FBI a year or so ago about potential terrorist leanings, but they found nothing, and I guess there wasn't much followup?  He spent 6 months back in Russia and the authorities want to know what he was up to there.

         He is a suspect in the bombings but was in multiple shootouts with police.  It's pretty much accepted that he is guilty of shooting at cops, because, well, he did and there are dozens of cops as witnesses.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Miranda rights protect him from incriminating himself.  As he was shooting at dozens of cops, they don't really need a confession.  They have enough eyewitness reports.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         His apartment was described as a bomb-making factory.  It's safe to assume they were planning on using these bombs they made, and they waived his miranda rights until they know no more bombs have already been planted. (In theory at least, this one could be open to interpretation.)

       well, he did get shot twice during the shootouts.  I guess it's possible that he was a civilian in the wrong place at the wrong time, but if that's the case why would he run and hide for something like 18 hours?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if it was one (or two?) cops OK I might be skeptical as well, but we are talking a small army of police men.

       I support the kid kind of (If he is from Chechnya). The US government has been involved in covert operations and the destabilizing of the area. If there is one thing you Americans lack it is empathy, which is odd after 9/11. People from all other parts of the world have every right to hate you; you run around policing the world and dictating law over areas that you have no rule. Anyways, I think it was probably these 2, but the bigger question is Why they did it? In my Eyes it's blowback from American involvement in Chechnya, or else the FBI set this up with the intent to catch them before it happened but failed. And don't look at me like I'm a conspiracy nut because The New York Times have covered the FBI doing this a handful of times over the past decade. Also worth nothing is this 4chan post

       Not even sure if it's legal to post links in reddit comments, hopefully I don't get bombarded with down votes for my opinions or the wrongful posting of that link. Note the post in that link was made on Monday before any suspects were confirmed.

       The only comments I've seen like that have been in the non-conspiracy threads.  Like normal reddit users forget that in the U.S. everyone is innocent until proven guilty.  It really seems like the vast majority of reddit is ignorant, and clearly have the hive-mind mentality.  It's quite sad to see so many dumb people in the normal threads.  A lot of people on reddit are dumb enough to believe CNN if they said the Moon was flung out of Earth's orbit.

       And really, people don't know that CNN is controlled by the US Government (I think I first read that on reddit actually).  So we're really just hearing what they want us to hear about the situation.  We'll probably never know the truth.

       Yup, but unfortunately, he won't be talking to the media, his family, his friends or a lawyer for the unforeseen future.  He may be innocent until proven guilty, but he will receive no Miranda Right, and is expected to be handed off for a "Military Interrogation".  I'll let the readers decide what that means.

       I think the Intelligence Interrogation is a bad idea.  He's an American citizen and deserves due process.  When we start making exceptions to that notion, then one has to question the process.

       I think it's bad for many reason.  First for all the reasons I've previously stated, and the fact that once he shut away, we won't ever learn the truth.  At least if he had a lawyer, she could address the public on his behalf and make a statement (hear his side of the story), but that's never gonna happen.

       There's a reason that the press calls him a suspect.  This new panel doesn't treat him that way.  All his friends are shocked and find his transformation into a terrorist hard to believe -- this alone makes me want to know more.

       It stands to reason that these guys had some help someway somehow.  One does not build a bomb by accident. Are they guilty of that which they have been charged?  The old axiom still applies, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck...most of the time you've got a duck.

       This is one of my responses to someone in another post. I am quoting but I think the logic is sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Again. It is not my responsibility to prove these person's innocence to their accusers.
Those whom are making the allegations against them have to first prove reason as to why they are suspects to begin with beyond eye witness testimony which has been proven to be the most unreliable source of information due to the ease of persuasion most individuals can succumb to.
However, what creates my distrust is the number of possible suspects being narrowed down two these two individuals based upon the these facts which were given:
      </p>
      <p>
       They had backpacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were seen there.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were seen running.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking away eye witness accounts, all of which have not been made public (who, what, when, where and why) how many individuals can be named as suspects meeting this criteria?
This is why in the fourth amendment it states the need for probable cause.
According to what has been put forth about these individuals a case for probable cause is broad and can apply to many suspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the reasons the media has chosen to single them out over photographs of people who; look more capable, are actually seen via photographs at the scene, visual confirmation of the same packs worn by these individuals then viewed again actually abandoned on the ground right at the bombs location (via photographs), all seem to me to have more "probable cause" than these suspects.
The probability increases when taking into account that we know the media has lied in the past and is not a reliable source of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all assuming that you, an individual, values your own reasoning skills and do not defer them to institutions which have a history of dealing in secrecy and deceit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do "trust" that these institutions have your best interests in mind than you would have to disregard an entire history of them contradicting your trust on countless cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you wish to refute my logic in the future please point out what specifically you disagree with along with providing an alternative framework so that I may properly rebuttal."

       100% with you OP.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  I don't like the guy (assuming he's the one who did it and wasn't set up), but I don't think he deserves to be treated horribly.  He's a human, he has rights. All these circle jerking "true patriotic" americans who are saying he should have just been shot, or toss him in prison and let him rot, or give him the chair (figure of speech).  I'm like "you do realize that part of being a patriot is adhering to the rules in this nation that make sense, principally one that we pioneered- a fair goddamn trial with due process (correct me if I'm wrong about the pioneering part, I just feel that its a core value of this country).

        Anyways there is dash cams and surveillance cameras and I want to see one or both of them in the action because this is all info that was told to us by the media not once have i seen with my eyes yet evidence.

       There's already evidence of him walking to the scene of the explosion with a backpack. A picture of him immediately behind the poor 8 year old who died, possibly with his backpack on the ground. And then a photo of him fleeing with no backpack.
      </p>
      <p>
       He absolutely deserves a fair trial (which is why they haven't and shouldn't just publicly dump all the evidence they have).  What is available so far is pretty damning, though.  There's a possibility it's all coincidental, but it seems rather unlikely at this point.

       I agree, two wrongs do not make a right. People don't seem to think that by wishing death upon them they are just as bad as the people that brought death to us. Justice will prevail but eye for an eye is not the answer, if we all done that there would be just one guy left with on eye in the whole world...

       I just can't believe that he is the only suspect left. They shut down the entire city of Boston and two other smaller towns close by, and you're going to tell me they did all that for one 19 year old with a gun? Plus I heard a recording of a police scanner that said they were chasing a stolen state police SUV when the chase of the two boys supposedly happened, but the media told us they stole a mercedes

       Dude is probably guilty but you are right. What happened in Boston is a part of the Human condition. The rush to judgment is often clouded by our rose colored glasses.

       That kid is still an AMERICAN. His 6th amendment rights are being violated. how is he going to get a fair trial if the news and the population already decided he is a terrorist. Has anyone seen any evidence of his connection? NO. Also all the "Shoot out" videos online do not show them shooting back only the police shooting at them.

       No. We
       <em>
        assume
       </em>
       innocence until we are given concrete evidence to support the notion of guilt. That means that, yes, we should treat him as if he is innocent until he is legally convicted of his crimes. That's not the same as him actually being innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a reservation of judgment, not an actual inference of innocence or guilt. You insisting upon his inherent innocence is no better than people assuming his guilt and crying for his blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents.

       I understand the burden of proof is with the prosectution, but then why run?? Why not, if falsely accused, walk to the nearest police station with a lawyer and turn yourself in so you can be cleared. There were a couple other wrongful arrests and those guys were cleared pretty quickly...

       Yes. A 19 year old kid knows better. But the point is HE IS A KID.  There is more to this story and he deserves a fair trial.

       I'm not even going to bother to watch the news, I've been watching since the 15th non-stop. But I know exactly how the crowds are reacting right now, i'm going to spare myself. If he is guilty he should be punished and all and its very fucked up the things he did. I can't stand the herd behavior from the crowds.

       Can someone explain why when I opened up my front page I saw literally (that's dictionary literally) 15 posts congratulating the BPD on 'such an amazing job' (edit; or joking about boats, or blasting the LAPD) on the first two or so pages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really? Reddit doesn't work like that. People don't upvote that much of the same stuff. (3 whole subjects? Lapd sucks, burning boats, or hide and seek masters?) It feels like propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:This might sound kinda ramble-y, but all I'm saying is that reddit isn't that focused. I've been here for a year- it's not like that or getting better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll also admit that I'm subscribed to adviceanimals, but I still find it odd that the top posts of that subreddit (and mostly only that one, oddly) are following the trend I'm referring to.

       It all starts with a story. Once they have the story about you it doesn't matter if it's true. If you're reading this you've probably already had the feeling that maybe the courts were all game made to vindicate the stories that are told.
      </p>
      <p>
       99.99% of all Americans and 99.9999% of all humans did not see or have any contact with the bomber but we believe that it happened as it did because the story was told from the moment the shrapnel flew. False Flag they call it when a Ship flies the flag of a foreign nation to elude or ambush an enemy. Well friends I would say indeed that there is a ship flying a false flag in America- and it is the Federal government. The Federal reserve is allowed to prop up the markets and keep the global ponzi scheme alive just long enough to get the Federal assets trained and into place.
 What better exercise is there than a manhunt in a large populated metropolitan area. Find the one man- that's really all there is isn't there. What if I disappeared tonight? What if you disappeared tonight?
      </p>
      <p>
       All it takes is a few voices on NPR; a few angry talkshow hosts to rile you up, some sensational images of men acting serious with guns; a lot of high definition pictures and lastly- a few dead Americans. The FBI has now trained everyone to be their cheerleaders- memes are sprouting up making jokes about miranda rights. We WANT to help them catch the terrorists- it's a serious cool game to us now! Well let me tell you there are no terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a false flag. The dead Americans are not a big deal to the people who detonated it. Why? Because they know that the banks, the stock market, the dollar- it's all going to collapse. It's all propped up through printing and promises and derivatives.And when it collapses theres going to be a lot more blood. When the oil runs out- when the oceans collapse- when the water is too toxic to drink- when the "Rapid, Non-Linear, Unpredicatble" events begin to occur that we all know are going to
       <em>
        happen
       </em>
       - begin to
       <em>
        happen
       </em>
       ----&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
       Then those who sow the seeds of false flag terrorism will begin to reap their harvest- The harvest of a plastic and willing public. A public who is not only easily fooled- but made to feel as if they are in on the fight. Happy to kill and convict- excited to join in on the shaming and high-fiving, the joking and boasting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time will tell what is to come dear friends, it seems that the night has grown dark and my light, dim as it may be, is radiant in this inky black. You need to ask yourselves a few questions before you too turn out your lamp tonight;
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think things will be better a year from now? 3 Years? 10? 50?
When (not IF) your light doesn't turn on one morning- what do you do?
when it doesn't come on for a day? 3 Days? a Week? A Month....A year?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if you look on the computer one morning to find your picture under the banner "Lone Wolf Terrorist"?

       This week we bore witness to an appalling act of violence.  Then we were treated to the spectacle of a disaffected Elvis impersonator/janitor mailing ricin letters to a Senator and the President.  Friends and neighbors said he seemed like such a mild mannered guy.  At the same time a fertilizer factory blows the hell up, and we learn that two Americanized brothers morph from average, low-stress guys to terrorists.  The press were reporting themselves reporting anything that slipped into their shiny heads, and furiously interviewing each other.  In actuality, they proved distracting and many people got their news from social media.  I ask myself:  how hard would it be to recruit people to do things they wouldn't normally conceive of?  People will debase themselves for fifty bucks a night to be a pop star these days.  How hard would it be to manipulate the sore and simple-minded among us?  People on the street where the guys stayed mentioned that the brothers had a crew coming around their place in recent weeks with clean cars, stylish clothes, and expensive shoes.  Who was calling the shots of that crew?  Was it a gang?  How hard would it be to hide this activity from the press?  Easy as throwing them a cookie?  I hate to sound like Alex Jones because he is stark raving mad, but ultimately I have to wonder if all this stuff has more to do with the Sequestration than "they hate us for what we stand for."  If certain shadowy elements within the industrial/military complex who are well versed in Psy Ops and Counter-terrorism wanted their funding restored back to full levels—if they wished to flex some muscle and make everyone (including the President) scurry to their tune, the events of this week could effectuate that readily.  Now, whenever we see a Blackhawk helicopter over a major US city, instead of thinking why the military has deployed basically a tank in the air over our heads, we'll be more apt to say, "they must be looking for bad guys."  Pretty soon we will forget when it was different.  Surveillance will be second nature, we will do it to each other with our devices.  We will never feel really secure again, but it will be OK.  Perhaps if we re-establish and strengthen the defense spending supply lines these sorts of things will abate, and we can be wrapped in the full bosom of freedom forever.

       Even if he is considered to be 'guilty' by a court, if I'm not in there I will forever remain indifferent. I've been in court cases where I've gotten off on a technicality. There was "eye witnesses", descriptions, reports, a million things. Even people who admitted their own guilt said I was there. But I was innocent. It was looking absolutely hopeless, but I found a flaw and, on a technicality, I was found to be not guilty. But I shouldn't have been, and anyone else who wasn't me wouldn't have found this technicality, and they would've been caught. From my own issue I will never judge anyone unless I'm presented with the full facts from both sides of the fence.

       Do you mean the innocent guy that had a shoot out with the police before being captured, less that 24 hours after his brother died while having a shootout with the police?  Seems logical that an innocent guy would lead a man hunt for 5 days and shoot at some cops.

       I'm right there with you. I can't honestly remember the last time they actually did it the legal way and brought someone in to be proven guilty. There are far to many "self inflicted gun shots" that end the lives of "suspects." Instead of real police work and handling the situation legally we see giant manhunts that end with bodies one way or the other. Dorner gets locked into a cabin by police who then burn it down not know if there are innocent hostages inside with him. Yesterday in order to find a 19 year old kid who's elder brother they killed in a shot out, a major American city was put under Marshall law while they went door to door violating peoples rights and our laws by rummaging through the homes of innocent civilians. And even are all that effort they still barely took him alive.

       Agreed. We are not judge, jury, and executioner. No matter how flawed the justice system may be, we have to believe in it and strive to do the right thing. If we kill the bad guys with no second thought, we are no better than they are.

       Because he was seen throwing bombs and grenades out of a car window. He had not one, but two shoot outs with the cops. He murdered that officer from MIT. ...yes, 90% of it is on video. If this kid isn't guilty, he's crazy as fuck and still needs to face the repercussions of his actions. 
Yes he'll pass through the legal system as usual. Yes, he'll face traditional judgement. 
However some people in here (not you specifications. Just saying..) need to get the fact that this is a very passion-inducing event. People are going to react violently to violence. When they see wanton death and destruction they will cry for blood. 
They'll see reason later. They will. They always do.  But Jesus, let people fucking vent their anger and outrage.

       I don't know who here is calling for blood. I would be happiest the more normally this case proceeds. I'm more concerned that that incompentent beotch Carmen Ortiz is invoking a "public safety" exception to mirandizing Tsarnaev when the police and FBI publicly stated the danger is over. She could botch the case by making it exceptional.
      </p>

       This is probably pseudo-terrorism. I bet one or the other brother had some kind of setback and psychological break that made him want to go out as some kind of self-styled avenger. The less unusually the case is handled the better.

       its super fishy that two brothers (if unconnected to this event), would run away from a bombing-seperated.

       i know that if i went to the marathon with my brother and it was attacked-we would be running away side by side.

       I havent heard ANYTHING about what type of guns this kid and his brother used. Is anyone else curious about this? After all we've heard of these magnificent gun battles not once have we heard anything reported on what weapons were used. I remember during Sandy Hook, they were reporting on it with in the hour after it occured.

       He is legally presumed innocent until proven guilty, if they treat him like an American Citizen. But the evidence is overwhelming, and he most assuredly is guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, they are refusing to give him his rights as a citizen. If I were a crazy conspiracy nut, I'd be far more worried about that fact.

       The point? They don't have time to dick around getting a lawyer and for him to get a story and bullshit together. They have to act

        NOW

       to see if he had accomplices and if so, where they are. BEFORE they leave the country.   Because if he did, and if they do get out.. guess what.

       Everyone seems to think that this guy is a piece of human garbage and doesn't deserve the rights of an American Citizen, but it is precisely this kind of human garbage that the rights need to be fought over. Because it is there that a corrupt government will put the wedge of injustice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope he dies, frankly. I don't want our tax money going toward keeping him alive. But if you love your freedom, you must admit that even the dregs of society, the human garbage, have rights, too. Our Constitution, and the numerous documents that influenced it worldwide, outline those rights.

       I want to know, too. We all do. But that is not an excuse for the removal of a person's rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       We protect the rights of people who have killed far more people than this guy. We protect the rights of drug dealers and gangbangers who have links to international criminal organizations. We protect the rights of foreign nationals who commit "normal" crimes in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't we want to protect the rights of a citizen, in any situation?

       Because it falls under an act of terrorism.  I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but people keep freaking over it. Well, if he didn't want to deal with being questioned like a terrorist, he shouldn't have committed an act of terrorism.

       If he is to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, he is to be afforded his rights in the meantime. It is that simple.

       If he is not to be presumed innocent, then none of us have the right, except when the Government decides they'll allow it.

       Have you read the details of how/what they can question him on without him being mirandized? It's not like they can just ask anything and use it in court while he's drugged up in a hospital.  It seems like this sub is full of kids watching the news, hearing "no miranda rights" and freaking out because of that without actually looking anything up.  They're limited as to what they can ask. The primary purpose is to get information regarding possible accomplices. Not to get information to be used in court. This isn't them questioning him for his court date. It's for the immediate safety of the residents of Boston and potentially surrounding areas. It's so they have the chance to locate and capture any/all accomplices he has. It's not to do a full questioning of the events.

       Don't you understand the implications of questioning a suspect without a lawyer present? That right exists to protect the innocent from being railroaded, and if they suspend that for any reason it is meaningless. If he has no right to a lawyer, then they have no obligation
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       to use the things he says against him. The Miranda ruling even applies to the obviously guilty. It should not be suspended over suspicion of guilt.

       Look, I'm not one of these tinfoilers, but I like the knowledge that my freedoms are intact. What happens if the government declares that anyone who hacks their Wii is supporting terrorism, or some other ridiculous nonsense? They already say you're doing it for bootleg DVDs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that "exception" is their not for the people's protection, but to make arrests easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if they were to balance that with a protection for the accused, such as immunity for new facts which come to light, then I'd withdraw my objection. That would mean that if they refuse to provide an attorney, any statement he gives can be assumed to be under duress. We have the evidence that he set those bombs, stole that car, tossed grenades, and shot a cop. He's going to be convicted, but if he is forced to disclose an unconnected murder, they shouldn't be allowed to use that in court.

       I agree, it needs it's limits however it isn't hard to see the logic behind them claiming this to be an act of terrorism and focusing on finding any and all people who helped him in this as soon as possible.

       There is video of them laying the bags down that contained bombs. The 2 brothers threw grenades and pressure cooker bombs at police officers. They shot and killed 1 police officer. They admitted to being the Boston bombers when they hijacked the car.

       My thought on it all is like this, 9/11 was a bad time dr America. It generally scared the public of these "terrorists" so naturally when something like this happened and it came to light it was a terrorist act, the American public of Boston had enough and actually got shit done.  I can see why we are blood hungry.

       If he's guilt we should publicly execute him, maybe then people will see America is done fucking around.

       there are groups behind the scenes- but they can be expected to act the same way they always have. keep people entertained and distracted, and enforce the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are both evil and kind people, most are a mix of both. its safe to say that evil people take what they want a bit more aggressively- and at any cost.

       its also safe to expect that some of these evil people will rise to positions of power along the way.

       No man this was a complete FBI set up. Think about it, could an innocent  Muslim extremist yielding explosives and killing police officers after being captured on camera  directly at the scene of the attack really be responsible? Stop being so closed minded.

       The FBI has video of them placing the bombs, seen fleeing crime scene with smiles on face with no bag, man who had his legs blown off woke up in the hospital to confirm with police it was in fact him (he had looked him straight in the eyes after he placed the bag), he placed explosives all over the city, shot at police, and hid in a boat for god knows how many hours. Seems innocent.

       ...but he's not innocent, and you're blaming society for this. Look, I agree. He's just a kid. Regardless of the nature of his crimes we still have human compassion. I just think its fucked up you're providing some sort of justification for this kid. To further elaborate on my first comment, this is not what you expect out of an adolescent..

       By "innocent", you probably refer to formal language on court but i am referring to a mere adjective we use in daily basis. I really think he is innocent for being dragged in all these nonsense and i am sure that he doesn't know what he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people don't get along, then everyone is sinned. Being an adolescent, an adult or whatnot doesn't serve any meaning. I believe this still applies in our age of stupid. That's why when shit happens we don't have to spread hatred unnecessarily on "terrorists", "murders" or something, the police just gotta do what they should and that's all.
      </p>

       I am afraid they will probably torture him or something, he isn't going anywhere anyway. I feel sorry for him, actually.

       I'm sure he was convinced but knows damn well what he did..you don't attend a prestigious college and still can't decipher right from wrong. If people don't get along, then everyone has sinned? I got bullied throughout high school for being weird, but always kept to myself and never lunged back. I must've sinned somewhere along the line, thanks for catchin that. I agree we can use this as a time to look inwards and reflect but you can't justify any actions this kid has made on his own free will.

       Who is to say that is even the right guy, because America wanted blood so the FBI gave them "Suspects" so they could get their blood.Also think about the guy who identified him, he got blown up, went into shock, was stabilized in the hospital, and though all of that he remembered a guy who set down a back pack? Is America really that blood thirsty? Or am I missing something here?

       The evidence I have seen (just on the internet) is enough to make me believe these men did this.  I am, however, acutely aware they were most likely not working alone, and want to have answers as to how they got started etc.  I hope he makes a full recovery and we get to hear the full story in a trial.

       Exactly, and he took 3 (Or did they confirm more?) and ruined dozens more. And yes, I do agree with you, he is still innocent until prove guilty. But the fact that they got into a high speed chase, killed police officers, and hid out for hours after the marathon? I mean, I understand kind of trying to stay hidden, but killing police? The one who got in the chase, at least, is proven guilty because of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       An eye for an eye. If he is proven guilty, have his limbs cut off one by one, and THEN kill him.

       I don't understand why Americans complain so much about America, yet they choose to live here. If you hate it so bad, and if it's so unfair, and if you feel that your rights are being taken away, move, why stay? Move out now while you can before they close the borders and declare martial law. Why stay and fight a fight you always feel you will lose anyway? Why complain about what the government does day in and day out, if you hate it here that much, then move to another country and call that place your home.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am one for conspiracy theories, but a lot of people here sound so ungrateful, and if America and it's government has been so bad to you, then I ask you to please move away, so you can make room for the people who want to leave there poverty life and country and come here.

       Because if you want to live in any other first world country, you most likely won't get in permanently or become a citizen.  Do you know how hard it is to get an extended visa and citizenship?  For Canada and any European country I have researched, you need to be a student or hold a job to have an extended visa.  In the European Union, each country is forced to fill a job with their local country's citizens, then EU citizens, and then finally if they can't possibly find someone to fill a position, they will seek someone applying for a job outside of the EU.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you act as if any normal citizen has the money and means to just up and live in a completely different place.  As someone who holds a "normal" job after getting a 4 year college degree, I can't even fucking afford to go on VACATION in another country, let alone move to one.  What you are saying is just like telling any downtrodden people tired of their country to "just leave", as if becoming a refugee is the easiest choice to make.  Imagine telling that to someone whose in a country stuck in deeper shit, like places where civil wars are taking place.  Sure, it's easy to say from your position, and it's easy to define our standard of living as being better in a world view sense, but have some fucking empathy for ALL people.

       Well that's not the point, is it? "They" could be of any age, any demographic. Moving to another country requires years of preparation on top of significant work to ensure citizenship or work visas upon arrival - it's not an easy feat.

       Tho I don't agree with anything the bombers did, it's horrifying, but just saying he did it have him hung isn't solving the problem either. It seems like of you just want to investigate the reason why to prevent something like this from happening again you will be called a traitor (not literally)

       “He was controlled by the FBI, like for three, five years,” she told Russia Today during an interview. ”They knew what my son was doing, they knew what actions and what sites on the Internet he was going [to], they used to come…and talk to me…they were telling me that he was really a serious leader and they were afraid of him.”
“How could this happen?…They were controlling every step of him, and they are telling today that this is a terrorist attack,” she added.

       The 14th amendment gives you the right to a fair trial by due process. If they release the video of them placing the bombs, everyone (including prospective jurors, witnesses) know he's guilty. Those videos are withheld until the trial and then shown to the jury. Witnesses who testify already saw them do it. They describe the video without having seen the video.

       If obvious evidence comes out that he is innocent, then people will change their minds. And people are cheering the fact that the guy who was involved in a shootout with cops that involved bombs and his brother rushing at cops with a bomb rigged to his chest, is now in custody and off the streets.

       You actually just reminded me of how they've conducted trials for Guantanamo prisoners in that the evidence against a person is not revealed to them because it could compromise national security. The person is then conflicted with everyone just taking their word for it that evidence exists.

       What is deplorable exactly? They are giving him medical attention. A guy 1000's of people right now want dead is being given the gift of modern medicine because of the awesome justice system america has in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other places in the world giving medical attention to someone who is suspected  by the public of killing innocents would be a joke, and you would be shunned from your community for doing so if not killed yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that so many people in this sub have a kneejerk reaction to any sort of authority? I fucking hate certain things large governments have done, their are without a doubt a bunch of things that never became public domain that governments did which are immoral and despicable and their will be more in the future. But that doesn't mean every god damn bad thing that happens was in direct relation to a government like it seems this sub would have you believe. To the contrary if one were to look at all the horrible stuff to good stuff any country has done when comparing our somewhat corrupt government to most of the highly corrupt governments around the world you might stop criticizing every single action and start giving props when they are deserved.

       Trials and habeas corpus are granted to all citizens and non-citizens as a practical matter.  Because if we arbitrarily decide that some foreign national doesn't get extended the courtesy of a trial or

        especially habeas corpus

       which is intended to prevent governments from
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance">
        "disappearing"

       individuals, then foreign governments will claim the right to disappear U.S. citizens based on U.S. precedent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bill of Rights specifically refrains from any requirement that the rights are only to apply to U.S. citizens.  The language is intentionally broad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of these discussions confuse "being a non-citizen" with "being an illegal resident".  There's a vast grey area between them of tax-paying, social-security funding (even when in fact they do not receive those benefits), well-behaved (because they'd get thrown out if they weren't) legal residents who could easily find themselves losing out if citizenship was the boundary of human rights in the US.

       You have no proof that his face was 'bashed in' by the police arresting him. Considering the boat owner reported someone in his boat because he saw blood, it's entirely possible that his injuries were previously sustained.

       Exactly. Every time my father and I get into discussions about current events, he brings up Nazi Germany and how none of us have anything to complain about because we don't live there/then. Or if I bring up issues in the healthcare system (he's a doctor), he'll say, "Well, whatever. Try needing a triple bypass in the Middle Ages, if you think there's something wrong with our healthcare. Let's see how long you live then."

       There are reports of multiple cops with injuries from the shootout. If you're going to say that the FBI, BPD, paramedics, and hospitals were in on it too you might as well go to "well how do you know your reality is real and maybe this is all just a dream?"
