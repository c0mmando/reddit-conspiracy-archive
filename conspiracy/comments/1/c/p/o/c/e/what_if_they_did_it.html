       What if they actually did it? What if the answer to all of this is really simple: two foreign kids immigrate, never fully integrate into the culture, and, for whatever reason, decide to set off a couple of bombs.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the events played out exactly as you'd expect if they are actually guilty?

       This all just seems too weird to me. Being at the marathon when the initial bombs went off until now just seems a bit too surreal. I donno, maybe I've been watching too much tv... just seems strange. just feels somewhat orchestrated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no evidence either way, and I know people's lives were lost and I feel horrible about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: what if they are pushing emotions to have more of a police presence be accepted in the future. all this clapping and 'yaaay good job' and 'i felt so safe' things just seem strange.

       Well, I totally agree with you, in fact I work in government ::get him!!:: and that's actually why conspiracy theories seem silly to me: the higher-ups are just "people" too, they are not hyper-competent or able to pull off the level of skill and planning necessary to stage these incredibly elaborate and secretive conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm actually not totally sure what you're saying with your response; if there WAS a conspiracy, the "people in charge" would just have their special black ops team do the dirty work (theoretically, in conspiracy world view.)  So why not kill the framed suspect?  I can not think of a single valid reason why an organization trying to frame this guy would let him live when they could have easily killed him.  The guy was in a boat completely surrounded by the police.  If they just lit him up for whatever reason, everyone would buy it, and it'd be perfect for the "conspiracy."  So why didn't they?

       I think they could have easily convinced people it was necessary; I certainly didn't expect him to make it out alive, and I don't believe it's a conspiracy.  Not to mention there were no media or civilians around.  If they just told us "he's been killed in a firefight" I know that I would have believed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: In reply to your comment about the local PD seeing it, that's fair enough, I guess I don't know enough about conspiracist thinking to know who they think is part of the conspiracy and who is not.

       Right...  But are bomb sniffing dogs trained to seek out gunpowder?  Or is it more likely that they train them to look for C4, dynamite and other, more dangerous, explosives?

       That is also very true. I didn't even think of the psychology of the whole thing. And we as people tend to put ourselves in the shoes of others when things like this happen, but like you said, you just can't nor can you assume their actions.

       This is a thought that will never cross a conspiracy theorist mind. It could only could be the government to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because what other reason is there to claim the government is evil. There are many legitimate criticisms of the government but making but story's with no evidence and class them as fact is not the right way to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have subscribed to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       because I think its good to be sceptical and challenge the powers that serves you, but all I see is irrational theory's being a weapon to convince them selves and other people that there is an invisible evil tyranny that you cant see, how you do that is, take all the bad things created by humans and point it at the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a tactic used by many agendas, Nazis, Athests Zeitgeist, Christians, Muslims.

       100% complete transparency. Address the seven "contractors" seen before and after the bombing at the finish line. Openly discuss the "drill" that was being conducted before and during the marathon. Those two for now would start to soften my resolve.

       I have a hard time believing anyone would buy the ridiculous theory you're putting out right now. The evidence is
       <em>
        overwhelming
       </em>
       right now. This was an obvious false flag operation, and all the facts support that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But willing to be reasonable. What is your evidence that these kids are actually guilty and that this went down as the media claims it did? Please be detailed.
