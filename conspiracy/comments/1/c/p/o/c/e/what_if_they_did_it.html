<p>I have no evidence either way, and I know people&#39;s lives were lost and I feel horrible about that. </p>

<p>edit: what if they are pushing emotions to have more of a police presence be accepted in the future. all this clapping and &#39;yaaay good job&#39; and &#39;i felt so safe&#39; things just seem strange. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I totally agree with you, in fact I work in government ::get him!!:: and that&#39;s actually why conspiracy theories seem silly to me: the higher-ups are just &quot;people&quot; too, they are not hyper-competent or able to pull off the level of skill and planning necessary to stage these incredibly elaborate and secretive conspiracies.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m actually not totally sure what you&#39;re saying with your response; if there WAS a conspiracy, the &quot;people in charge&quot; would just have their special black ops team do the dirty work (theoretically, in conspiracy world view.)  So why not kill the framed suspect?  I can not think of a single valid reason why an organization trying to frame this guy would let him live when they could have easily killed him.  The guy was in a boat completely surrounded by the police.  If they just lit him up for whatever reason, everyone would buy it, and it&#39;d be perfect for the &quot;conspiracy.&quot;  So why didn&#39;t they?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they could have easily convinced people it was necessary; I certainly didn&#39;t expect him to make it out alive, and I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s a conspiracy.  Not to mention there were no media or civilians around.  If they just told us &quot;he&#39;s been killed in a firefight&quot; I know that I would have believed it.</p>

<p>edit: In reply to your comment about the local PD seeing it, that&#39;s fair enough, I guess I don&#39;t know enough about conspiracist thinking to know who they think is part of the conspiracy and who is not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a thought that will never cross a conspiracy theorist mind. It could only could be the government to them.</p>

<p>Because what other reason is there to claim the government is evil. There are many legitimate criticisms of the government but making but story&#39;s with no evidence and class them as fact is not the right way to go.</p>

<p>I have subscribed to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because I think its good to be sceptical and challenge the powers that serves you, but all I see is irrational theory&#39;s being a weapon to convince them selves and other people that there is an invisible evil tyranny that you cant see, how you do that is, take all the bad things created by humans and point it at the government.  </p>

<p>Its a tactic used by many agendas, Nazis, Athests Zeitgeist, Christians, Muslims.</p>
