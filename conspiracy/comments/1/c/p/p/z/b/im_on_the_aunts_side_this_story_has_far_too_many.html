       They said they threw out grenades and pipe bombs from their car trying to hit pursuing law enforcement. Well all law enforcement vehicles nowadays have dash-cams, so start releasing some of that material!! Goddamn I love this earth but hate how governments run it.

       how about the photo of suspect 2 dropping the bag feet away from where martin richard was propped up on the barrier.
      </p>
      <p>
       they have him at the scene of the crime, with the backpack, they have him dropping the backpack, and they have him walking away calmly while everyone else runs or cowers in fear. To say they have no evidence is ridiculous, to say they were set up may be a completely different story.

       Yeah, they made the front page and were immediately declared innocent, similar to the saudi suspect.  Why? Because he's 17..?? What about other supporting evidence? Forget it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why with everything else they claim, "this is an investigation, we cant yet say for sure". Why not hold him for questioning until we know for sure?
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless they knew all along who did it (the truth) -- or at least, who they were going to BLAME it on. That's how they could be so certain about SOME claims (who's innocent, who's guilty)

        Why I am trying to point out in that picture, is
* the guy in the blue appears to be near the mailbox at bombsite 2, WITH the suspect (#2) in the white hat. Coincidentally , blue shirt was also photographed with another "white hat" earlier. Decoys?
* also, the fbi cropped this part out of the photo they released
* shouldnt we AT LEAST consider him if he's seen at the scene of the crime as the 'real' suspect?

       They did not go on a manhunt for a guy in a white hat. That is just what we here on reddit have been calling him (or suspect #2) because he has name nit easy for english speakers.

       all im saying is that, if you were trying to frame someone, the first thing you would do is try to create evidence against that person. There is no way the government would set this up, but not leave a trail of evidence pointing at someone other than the government.

       She seems to ignore the pictures of them at the marathon with then w/o the backpacks. The younger brother casually walked away after the explosion. That is very unusual. As far as if they were a victim of some MK-Ultra scopolamine washing operation is pure speculation but still a possibility. They appeared to be normal kids and to just kill random people at an event like that isn't just a sudden decision. The FBI was monitoring them and according to the younger brother's twitter his thoughts weren't deranged or unusual. I don't think we'll ever get to the bottom of this but the fact that the young brother is alive might lead us to more info.

       This is one of the biggest things for me. If you really were innocent or perhaps you were even set up, i really doubt you would just be jogging away seemingly unphased about what happened. Perhaps he isn't bothered because of his past and where he comes from?

       Awaiting trial.  This is how these things work.  Evidence is gathered, analyzed, then presented at trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no faster way to completely fuck your chances at trial than to start just blindly releasing evidence immediately after an event.  The trial is when he's determined to be guilty or innocent, and until then it's ridiculously premature to start claiming that there's no evidence (or that there is).

       Again, that will all come out during the trial.  This is how the criminal justice system works.  The police need to get an arrest warrant from a judge, not from the public at large.

       No, I'm saying that the time for showing evidence is at trial, not less than 24 hours after the suspect is arrested.

       They arrested the kid at the scene.. if he was innocent do you think he would have like idk come out when they asked him to. Jesus the trail has no happened yet they do not need evidence until then. But then you will just say hey well you can't even see who is throwing out the pipe bombs.

       Yes, I'm sure that's exactly what I would say.  You know me so well. Maybe it doesn't matter what I
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       he would've done.  And evidence can be reported before trials.  It's quite simple, especially if the cops had dash cams.  There have been pictures released of the dead bodies, but they can't release video of the car chase?  You said it was a
       <em>
        fact

       -but what you meant to say was you believe the story without any evidence.  Smart.

       i am pretty sure it is the ones the FBI released. You are so god damn crazy its funny. Do you really think every FBI agent, DHS, BPD, ATF agent there was in on it too? Or were they just chasing two guys throwing fucking bombs? I heard the police scanner, I was on it when the cop got shot and they were throwing bombs. I heard when the suspect was shot and have seen the autopsy photo. Just let it go you sound 12

       The bombs are evidence, sure.  The dash cam vids would be evidence as well.  But you hearing a police scanner describe a chase does not identify the suspects as the same ones at the crime scene.  How does the audio identify them?  How does the audio prove there were pipe bombs thrown?  Did you hear explosions?  That would be something.
      </p>
      <p>
       And where are the pictures of the suspects dropping their bags as you previously claimed?

       Ok then, so a firefight went down, explosions were heard.  That still doesn't prove these were the guys who did it.  As far as I'm concerned, evidence would be videos from dash cams showing the suspects throw the bombs, pictures of their bombs and guns recovered from the scene, etc...  That would be more convincing.

       Their is evidence it is just not released. Dude I fucking heard the bombs go off on the scanner, the bombs are the same ones used..the brother was killed..the other brother took off. i do not understand why you refuse to believe this..innocent people don't run and throw bombs out the window. THE SAME EXACT BOMBS used. any photo i provide will not be good enough.

       wait so the patrolmen that just happen to stumble upon them were in on it too? 5 patrol cars were driving around and those 5 just happened to be the closest? that is just pure chance there is no way all 5 could be in on it. do you think these two brothers just happen to make the same exact bomb in the same exact way that was used? innocent people dont kill two cops

       Saw something interesting on Willyloman blogspot. He clears up some "crisis actor" confusion, and this:
"check out Angelo’s photo comparison looking at the location of the man in the wheelchair and some of the other victims. “Wheelchair guy” seems to be gone and the black woman victim shifts over and lies in his blood for some reason. it is odd to say the least."
       <a href="http://postimg.org/image/ibxqc2qlh/">
        http://postimg.org/image/ibxqc2qlh/
       </a>
       although I disagree with much of willyloman's posts, and much of his commenters- the image is really bothering me. So is the "hero" Mr Cowboy Hat: Carlos Arredondo. He is the media darling, and was right there! with a wheelchair. I mean, if your legs were blown off, and your bones and sh!t were sticking out, who do you want- some nobody moving you around, or an EMT (wasnt the place crawling with cops and trained authorities) and isn't it common knowledge DON'T MOVE someone if injured? And the images of Mr Cowboy Hat with the American flag in his hands.. ugh it makes me ill. He appears to be the media's' "hero" sniff sniff

       You don't move injured people if they might have back or neck injuries because it might make things worse. However, if someone is
       <em>
        bleeding out on the sidewalk
       </em>
       then hell yes you should move them, because potentially exacerbating a back injury is better than letting them die right there.

       The wheelchair guy was probably moved, the woman tried to get up and move but fell back down. It happens a lot when people are in shock. 
There's a video with Carlos where he's shaking terribly and the person filming the video asks him to hold up the flag so he can get a good shot.
I really enjoy reading conspiracy theories and trying to expand my mind, but sometimes you have to exercise a little logic.

       Yeah, and no independent witnesses to this impossible mission car chase.  Oh and they just happened to tell the hostage "we are the marathon bombers", they then put a CD in the player it was the soundtrack to kick ass, and they turned to the hostage and said "and we just killed a cop"!  They drove around using his credit card laughing hysterically and drew out $800 and dropped him off at a service station and said "you take care now", and drove right back towards Boston and were spotted by police, luckily they'd managed to bring an assortment of weapons with them, handguns, long rifles, explosives and even another pressure cooker bomb, they drove around throwing these things around like they were a clown at a kids party, all the while laughing hysterically and listening to death metal (they changed the CD).  They quickly decided that driving into a housing estate would be the best place to stage their next move, a quick change of CD 'Ennio Mooricone's fistful of dollars' and they started a shoot out, spraying bullets everywhere, the brother who'd fashioned an explosive vest during the shoot out, ran out screaming "you'll not take me coppah" and the brother got back into the SUV and screamed "so long brother, muhahahaha" and promptly ran him over, then drove through a police line, firing his gun and laughing.  He changed CD again and went for the Impossible Mission theme tune, drove a block or two, jumped out, climbed in a tarped boat and went to sleep.  Yeah, sounds realistic!

       they must've been the luckiest "support teams" alive, considering the fact they were standing feet away from the initial bomb blast, then photographed working with the FBI during the cleanup process here:

       nevermind the fact bomb squads and spotters were already running drills before the explosions took place:
       <a href="http://www.local15tv.com/mostpopular/story/UM-Coach-Bomb-Sniffing-Dogs-Spotters-on-Roofs/BrirjAzFPUKKN8z6eSDJEA.cspx">

      </p>
      <p>
       an obvious coverup orchestrated by the FBI at the very least, given the fact they refuse to acknowledge drills were being run.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: oh even better, the FBI were "controlling" the suspects for years, according to the mother.  No wonder the FBI had to finally admit they knew the suspects.

       What part of the information I posted was incorrect? The Massachusetts 1st Civil Support Team had been present at the Marathon for a number of years. Two members of the team standing 50 feet away from one of the explosions is not evidence of a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The argument is that the pictures people are members of Craft International. The only evidence is one logo on one hat. There is no other evidence for this assumption as I have shown, and a shitload of evidence that they are a Civil Support Team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are Civil Support Teams allowed to wear civilian clothes by National Guard regulations? Yes. Is the mysterious black unmarked SUV unambiguously the same make and model if vehicle with identical communications equipment used by every Civil Support Team in the country? Yes. Is said vehicle pictured with other National Guard teams and described in National Guard manuals? Yes. We're the Massachusetts 1st CST known to be present at the Marathon? Yes. Is a unit that specializes in supporting civilian authorities and responding to events like this behaving unusually or suspiciously by helping the FBI cleanup? No.

       fact of the matter is, you have ducked various links proving that bomb related drills were being run that day.   fact of the matter is anyone can speculate who those unidentified security personnel are.   at the current time, you, nor anyone else, is able to positively confirm who those security personnel are that were standing just a few feet away from the blast site.   you have also failed to answer or give  plausible explanation how THOSE unidentified security personnel escaped from the blast site, while hundreds of others either died or suffered major injuries.  no wonder the FBI refuses to even acknowledge their presence.
      </p>
      <p>
       but hey, keep refuting even the possibility of a conspiracy because you're not able to prove that craft/cst/unknown agency was or was not there based upon random clothing guidelines posted on the internet.  i'll stick to proven photos and eyewitnesses accounts on the ground of bomb drills being run and authorities lying to eyewitnesses on the ground when they stated no drills existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       keep ducking.

       LoL bullshit. you've stated before it didn't make sense for there to be a conspiracy, then completely ducked the fact eyewitnesses mentioned drills being run.    of course you won't acknowledge the fact the FBI ducked acknowledging them as well.

I have readily provided an abundance of freely available evidence that all indicates that the pictured individuals were members of the Massachusetts National Guard. If you can read my links and come to the conclusion that they are some mysterious mercenaries, I'm impressed.

       LoL bullshit. you've stated before it didn't make sense for there to be a conspiracy, then completely ducked the fact eyewitnesses mentioned drills being run.    of course you won't acknowledge the fact the FBI ducked acknowledging them as well.
