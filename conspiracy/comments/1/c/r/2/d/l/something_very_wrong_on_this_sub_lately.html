The ideas we all post here are not the complete truth, but just the bits and pieces we seem to pick up from our own research. </p>

<p>But lately almost every top comment has been trashing OP, claiming they are blatantly wrong and people are up voting them for some reason.</p>

<p>So I ask why? Why the sudden hate and spite over people trying to convey useful information? Nobody claims to know all the answers, so why are people suddenly in disarray? </p>

<p>This is exactly what they want to happen... they want us to be afraid, and you guys are certainly showing it by attacking each-other. We need to unify on common grounds again, not ridicule others for presenting information we find, and GET BACK TO WORK solving this thing. </p>

<p>There appears to be a small group of very aggressive fascists monitoring every post, as if they were sitting around doing nothing but hitting &#39;refresh&#39; and waiting for new posts to pop up. Then they immediately defend the status quo&#39;s position. Their downvotes are always multiplied. When you look through their history, you will see that they defend the status quo in every aspect, not just the current topic. You will also see that they spend an inordinate amount of time with people that they label as &#39;stupid&#39;. That&#39;s the real stupid part. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve actually spent a little time on a few specific posts playing the skeptic. This is <strong>specific</strong> posts, mind you. Though, not in any trolling or hateful manner; just as informatively as possible.</p>

<p>Some &quot;theories&quot; or conversations here are detrimental to the argument that there may be a conspiracy(ies). When we start assuming barely researched, hardly analyzed subjects and topics as truth or proof, then we start to lose a lot of credibility -- at least among ourselves. We absolutely should be questioning, but there&#39;s almost just as much finger-pointing going on as there are questions.</p>

<p>Throughout this subreddit, people have been labeling the men with the black backpacks, black pull-over half-zips, and tan pants and boots as Craft International, Blackwater, or private contractors instead of describing them as we see them, which is, vaguely, uniformed men. Here, people have foregone <em>actually</em> identifying these guys, and delved straight into possible explanations <strong>of their involvement</strong>, all the while completely dismissing any information that would <strong>suggest the opposite</strong> or a different explanation. <a href="http://usarmy.vo.llnwd.net/e2/c/images/2013/01/29/280064/original.jpg">They&#39;re Civil Support Team</a> btw (edit: most likely). I don&#39;t know why it has been said almost <em>nowhere</em> in this entire subreddit, and sure, they could be disguised as CST as well. Everyone&#39;s more focused on analyzing photos and posting conjecture, before ever <em>actually</em> researching anything. Hell, that is probably the main problem here. <a href="http://www.idaho.ang.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123237536">related National Guard CST image/article</a></p>

<p>Whether theorizing of conspiracy or trying to debunk evidence or information relating to conspiracy, the two divided parties are on either side the fucking spectrum, and nobody wants to meet in middle and accept information that <strong>doesn&#39;t</strong> support their argument. </p>

<p>&quot;Why did they say they were &quot;pulling&quot; him out if he got out himself?&quot;<br/>
Fuck, I don&#39;t know! Why do people say they&#39;re &quot;running late&quot; when they&#39;re actually DRIVING?! Something&#39;s not right!</p>

<p>Sure, there are people just &quot;shushing&quot; the &quot;crazy conspiracy theorists,&quot; but goddamnit, there are also just some fucking stupid arguments being made here. If we could all make arguments for and against certain information without indulging ourselves in confirmation bias and emotion, then maybe we can actually sift through the shit. </p>

<hr/>

<p>edit: Case in point:   <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1crr9y/proof_that_craft_international_aka_blackwater_did/c9jcogw">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1crr9y/proof_that_craft_international_aka_blackwater_did/c9jcogw</a></p>

<p>Only 6 upvotes, but whatever. <em>2 downvotes</em>. <strong>We&#39;re downvoting someone because they completely disproved someone&#39;s faulty and deceptive information.</strong></p>

<p>Don&#39;t act like the &quot;shills&quot; or the &quot;skeptics&quot; are the only problem here. Just about everyone&#39;s acting more on bias than they should.</p>

<hr/>

<p>edit: in this very thread now:<br/>
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cr2dl/something_very_wrong_on_this_sub_lately/c9jenfx">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cr2dl/something_very_wrong_on_this_sub_lately/c9jenfx</a></p>

<p>He&#39;s simply stating, in no spiteful tone or harsh demeanor, that the information that was being tossed around wildly during the last few days&#39; events, might just have been simple misinformation, in response to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>while evidence of any earlier reported stories are disappearing from most news sites, youtube and etc.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both of these statements are likely to be true and false in their own varying degress, and on a case-by-case basis, but we will only upvote the one we want to be true, or whichever follows our argument.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>OP says, &quot;Why the sudden hate and spite over people trying to convey useful information?&quot;</strong> Yes, actual, useful information is being attacked, but that shit is going both ways, and sometimes the &quot;useful information&quot; is just faltering conjecture. </p>

<p>ya&#39; know how there&#39;s a <a href="/r/gaming">/r/gaming</a> and a <a href="/r/truegaming">/r/truegaming</a>? A <a href="/r/music">/r/music</a> and a <a href="/r/truemusic">/r/truemusic</a>? a <a href="/r/reddit">/r/reddit</a> and <a href="/r/truereddit">/r/truereddit</a>?</p>

<p>Well, if this subreddit followed the same convention, this subreddit would certainly be the circle-jerker that all the bullshit gets diverted to, while all the actual discussion happens elsewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can swear I read an article that was talking about the CIA hiring people to carry out misinformation/disinformation and smear campaigns on forums and social media.</p>

<p>&quot;According to Lynnae Williams, former CIA clandestine service trainee and DIA analyst, the FBI and CIA use trolls to monitor social media and interact with users to discredit information disseminated on the web. Williams explains that the CIA provides training videos to new recruits on how to troll the internet. Once a target is locked-in, all open source information is obtained on the individual, and then any angle to discredit them in public forum is used on social media sites.</p>

<p>Software is used to sift through the “mountains” of users on social networking sites. At the Atlanta CIA branch where Williams was trained, she personally witnessed CIA-sponsored and sanctioned trolling of Americans on social networking sites.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seeing the same thing.. Every relevant thread is getting instantly derailed and the sub is getting spammed with disinformation.  Seeing the same thing on 4chan.org/pol/ ... Clearly the internet has become the battle front in this war and what we are all seeing is the influence and power that is being used to control very key parts of the internet.  Look at Reddit frontpage.. it&#39;s nothing but propaganda and diversions.  They want another post-9/11 uprising against &quot;terrorists&quot;.  </p>

<p>This is a crucial time for our freedom.  Once the mounting legislation over this incident passes truthers will lose the power they currently have to fight this regime.  NOTHING about how this entire thing was executed is legit.  You&#39;d have to be a complete fool to fall for it.  </p>

<p>Those of you too naive to even consider what is really going on are only supporting those oppressing you.  Step out of that social norm that has been created, use you&#39;re brain, put this puzzle together like you would in a video game or anything else you&#39;re passionate about.  Ask the right questions.  Look at 9/11, the Iraq war, the central banking, the situation in Israel, the excessive show of power and force America is making.  You know this system is broken.  You know things don&#39;t add up.  This society is tailor-made to keep you in the dark.  Brilliant individuals have been studying the human mind and how we tick long before you were a thought.  Every war has taught them more, every person is a number and a statistic in a massive pool.  Consider you&#39;re daily life and where all of you&#39;re motive and desires begin.  It&#39;s not all chance nor by choice.  Ask the questions, get the truths.  We are contributing to the oppression of ourselves and our entire species.  </p>

And just to reiterate what you&#39;re saying, billions and trillions of dollars have been spent to keep folks in the old paradigm.  Operant conditioning was penned in 1937.  Oh, and the father of operant conditioning left psychology and went to work for a marketing agency.  Think McFly, think.  Break the chains.

<p>If people make condescending remarks, they&#39;re going to get them in return.  They even dedicated a subreddit to be condescending towards r/conspiracy, I&#39;m sure you&#39;d be welcome there.  </p>

<p>What&#39;s a bigger waste of time?  Speculating about how an event occurred or making fun of people on a dedicated subreddit for the sake of it?    </p>

<p>Sorry that you take everything here seriously.  Some people just post stuff for fun or have a wacky speculative idea of what might have happened from a conspiratorial viewpoint.  It doesn&#39;t mean that the OP fully believes what they wrote.  The fact that I have to explain that makes me feel that I really am dealing with immature people.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently you&#39;ve never had a circle-jerk :)</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is just that, a place to discuss conspiracies.  You would (not) go to <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> to talk about hockey or <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> to post pictures of gore!  amarite.jpg?  That having been said, I never said people should agree with everybody&#39;s theories.  Simply that the point is the theory and that should be the discussion both positive and negative.  Down votes* are supposed to be used to disagree.  They are to be used to wipe out conversation that isn&#39;t contributing to the discussion.  Yet the shills are all meeting in their chat rooms saying red-alert.  Something&#39;s getting exposed over there, lets go down-vote it out of existence.  That&#39;s not suppose to be what happens.  It&#39;s suppose to be &quot;well good sir, your theory is flawed based on premises a, b, and c being incorrect thus your if and only if is invalid.&quot;  You see?  Therefore, if someone is posting gore on <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a>, you DO down vote it out of existence.  But if someone is posting conspiracies to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, SOP.  But I get what you&#39;re saying. </p>

<p>*&quot;Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don&#39;t personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you&#39;re downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.&quot;  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette">http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually a pretty common phenomenon on Reddit. When you go to a popular post, one of the top comments will be very negative--either explaining why the submission is false, misleading, etc., or just insulting it. You get a lot of the former in <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> and <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> and a lot of the latter in low-content subs like <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a>.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve seen, the &quot;hate and spite&quot; tends to be people pointing out that a submission is sensationalized, or inaccurate, or pure speculation.</p>

<p>Mainly I just find it strange that the front page is full of people asking why anyone on the sub would bother to question the narratives <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have established. Isn&#39;t questioning narratives kind of the point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who the other day was on the top of one of these said posts disagreeing with the OP, let me add my two cents. Let me also preface my post by saying I was overly antagonistic and sarcastic in my initial post, but replied as politely as I could to various name callings and other accusations, etc. To get to the point, just because someone disagrees with you it doesn&#39;t mean they are signing on to r/conspiracy because to sway the movement, that may very well happen, it&#39;s not the reason I do it. I come here because I want to participate in debates that don&#39;t always take what&#39;s reported at face value, I want to engage with and learn from people who take time to dig out facts and information in order to know what&#39;s going on in the world. Those aren&#39;t my only reasons, but maybe the largest factor in me coming here is because I have never liked the jump-to-conclusions attitude of my culture. Now this brings us to why I posted things that were against a popular post the other day. I think it&#39;s outrageous to constantly assume everything is a conspiracy and the information and arguments, made under the assumption that certain events were planned and executed in a certain way, are going to hold true no matter what information comes to the contrary. The post I responded to and got negative feed back on was titled &quot;4chan solved the bombings.&quot; As a critical thinker, I cannot sit by with that and I know a lot of people here could not either. In no way did I condemn challenging the MSM or government or whomever, I just said that it is better to reserve judgments till all the facts are released and a proper analysis can be made before we say &quot;the official story is full of holes!!!1!&quot; Of course it is, 24/7 news will report incorrect information for ratings. There are times where what they report may be a piece of the puzzle, but again prudence is a good policy. In short, I think r/conspiracy thinks of our group as dissenters, but even dissenters need to be put into check. Sources are important, unbridled claims and theories are dangerous to make because people sometimes take it as fact. It&#39;s just important that we be able to meet anyone&#39;s claims to the legitimacy of our theories by carefully, academically approaching these arguments and not getting upset or accusatory when someone calls you on the info. Who knows it could always be someone new to conspiracies that is just curious or needs some direction that doesn&#39;t include being called a fucking shill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s weird, I made a couple comments yesterday and ended up with a few other posts in other threads I made about being a shill (?). I&#39;m guessing I upset somebody by implying their trolling contributed nothing to the discussion. The trend of paid shills on Reddit is bad enough, raiding subs you disagree with is a bad way to get your point across. Especially if you do nothing but attack others while making no logical points. I don&#39;t even consider myself a conspiracy theorist, I just find the information coming from here to more substantive than the mainstream media lately. It seems like the mainstream sources are trying to manipulate the public more than usual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, some good things have come from the influx of trolls. Things have become a bit more civilised. Due the high amount of people using personal attacks the accord between skeptics and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has been good for the most part.</p>

<p>Each and every time someone uses a verbal attack and offers nothing else, report it. It detracts from the discussion completely. Don&#39;t even reply, just down vote and report. The mods have been good in the last few days banning obvious trolls who do nothing but inject negativity in the debate. If you like this sub, build on that accord and don&#39;t engage with trolls. That will be effective by not even acknowledging them. I don&#39;t mean anyone who disagrees wiry you and also notice that most people that are calling others shills <em>are</em> the trolls.</p>
