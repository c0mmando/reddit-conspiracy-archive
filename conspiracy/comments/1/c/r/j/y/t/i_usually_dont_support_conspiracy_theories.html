       But there is a lot that doesnt add up at all
      </p>
      <p>
       1) These kids that they are saying must have had some formal training, did virtually nothing to hide their faces when they had to know there would be photographers/video cameras everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The younger one which they say never left the country for training, somehow managed to evade FBI/police on foot after being gravely wounded in a firefight and survive an intense manhunt for 24 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) These guys while trying to escape hijacked a car and bragged about being the bombers, and let the guy live.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Not only did the fbi look into the older brother in 2011, the mom is claiming that the FBI were putting them under surveillance for some time and even told her that they were terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look Im not saying these guys are innocent, it would be very hard to stage them throwing bombs at cops, but there is a lot to this that doesnt make any sense.

       "I don't usually support conspiracy theories."
      </p>
      <p>
       Exactly my opinion, but something really stinks here. I haven't been paying attention to the ones floating around so this is just the picture I've drawn in my own head. Y'all can judge for yourselves how it aligns with any other discussions. Anyway, here are my thoughts on the matter:
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI investigated these guys before (and as Chechen Muslims they were presumably on a watch list) and nobody saw this coming... but they coincidentally held a "drill" the same day as the first attack, which helped them minimize casualties and control the response. While the bombers miraculously avoided detection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody who knew them saw any previous signs of this sort of behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       The devices at the marathon detonated low, to inflict damage more than fatalities. And they chose an event with a high EMS presence. What's the use of a diversionary tactic if you're not tying up substantial resources to clear the way for a simultaneous operation? Since when do terrorists care about saving lives or minimizing the chaos?
      </p>
      <p>
       A Saudi national was picked up and Islamist blame began. He was later released, but the stage was set.
      </p>
      <p>
       IDF was called in immediately, but Putin is still out of the loop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberal and conservative media both start giving the official line before they had these suspects identified, and they
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       agree about who is to blame.
      </p>
      <p>
       They then "discover" it was more Muslims, but this time it was RUSSIAN Muslims. And unlike your average Islamist extremist bombing nobody has tried to claim credit or call them martyrs. They've never been shy about admitting their culpability after the mission is over.
      </p>
      <p>
       The suspects wore suicide vests, but they weren't suicide bombers? They were prepared to die, and one of them followed through, but the other was taken alive after hiding out for 24 hours? They searched the whole neighborhood, except for the immediate area where he was last seen?
      </p>
      <p>
       After five years of calling Obama a socialist tyrant the GOP is now complaining the suspect has too many rights? It's the Reichstag Fire Decree all over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems to me that this served two purposes:
1) To assess the public response in preparation for further curtailment of civil liberties, leading to full martial law.
2) To pin it on Assad and use public sympathy (now that the true cost of war has been brought close to home) to press pending Syria legislation (military aid and democratic transition efforts.) Funny, isn't that also where Saddam's WMDs supposedly went? Plus, there's the tie to current North Korean sanctions...
      </p>
      <p>
       Making the world safe for democracy (Why do we never make it safe for constitutional republics? [rhetorical - I assume it's to implement the tyranny of the hoodwinked majority]) one phantom menace at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption of authority. It is hardly too strong to say that the Constitution was made to guard the People against the dangers of good intentions. There are men in all ages who mean to govern well, but they mean to govern. They promise to be good masters, but they mean to be masters."

       interesting bit as well: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama met with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal at the White House on Wednesday and discussed the conflict in Syria, a spokeswoman said. The meeting was not on Obama's public schedule.

       that they just passed with an overwhelming majority... while they act out their public drama, complaining how broke we are and how they can't get along, they spend tens of billions of dollars to stockpile more bioattack counter-measures... FEMA camps... training and equipment for "stakeholders" (which apparently means the government, as if the citizens don't have a stake in biowarfare)... that one sure didn't make the news. And folks just meekly allowed themselves to be rounded up and stripped of their rights "for their own good." It's just like the fascist/communist propaganda bloodbath when Hitler was taking over. Maybe they weren't just holding a drill at the marathon, maybe the whole thing was a drill.

       Is there any video of that shows them throwing bombs or grenades at cops?  They also accused the two brothers of robbing a 7/11 which turned out to be false.

       there were many witnesses saying they heard loud explosions like grenades right before the shootout. there is also video of the shootout as well as a detailed crime scene around the area of the shootout. at the crime scene there was evidence of multiple explosives. 7 news boston has all this info and its funny because one of their reporters was basically caught in the shoot out.

       Whole thing didn't make sense about how they were having a fight with cops and then he managed to get away even with a helicopter on him? With the WHOLE CITY on lockdown??(so they can even identify him even easier).

       You know those high speed chases they have on tv with helicopters? How many of those guys got away? Yeah exactly, this whole thing is bullshit. Younger kid's backpack is a completely different color than the exploded ones.

       The bombs were primitive which would support the idea that they weren't sophisticated.
      </p>
      <p>
       FBI contact means they were investigated or under investigation.

         really really suspicious, but could work for either side of the argument. surely they would have a file on both of them with clear pictures. instead of the blurry pictures released in the conference they could have released clear close-ups, their names and stated they are known. it is either the biggest of bumbling fuck ups or signs of deception

       The relevance of number 2 ties into the overall contradicting elements of the story they are presenting us. On one hand they are saying that there was no way they could do this alone because they werent trained, yet the supposed lesser of the two makes a mockery of the fbi/police for a day. Indicates that he has some type of training or help. Yet they are also presenting the story as two kids who not only failed to hide their identity, but also wore distinguishing clothes(backwards white hat), and that they stayed around and went to college parties, indicating that they had no idea of what they were doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elements of the narrative seem to conflict with eachother.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Suspect 2 didnt wear glasses and wore his hat in a way that helped to identify him not hinder the effort
      </p>
      <p>
       3) There was plenty of reason to kill a guy who could identify them while they were trying to get out of town, they also are accused of being terrorist who want to kill Americans. Its suspicious they were bragging about the bombing in the first place when the narrative is that they were trying to flee. Even more that they let somebody they hate who could identify them live.

       i dont think evading the police for that short time indicates training or help.
      </p>
      <p>
       staying around afterwards just suggests they still hoped to get away with it.

       the older brother though.... he had been investigated previously and didnt think he would be suspected? going to parties and stuff hardly looks like they were preparing to make a last stand. a lot of it doesnt quite add up at the moment, but we have next to zero details on any of it.

       He was discovered just a couple blocks from the shootout. They were searching that neighborhood all night, it's unbelievable that they couldn't find him right under their noses. Especially since he was bleeding and they had all those dogs.

       I don't know exactly where the inner perimeter was set up, but it was definitely within the outer perimeter. It's not like a bleeding suspect is hard to find for a K9 unit, and it doesn't make sense that he fled the area and then slipped back so close to them only to hide in a boat and bleed.

       I just don't see how they could have missed him unless they didn't want him to be found right away. My guess is they wanted to see how easily the sheep could be rounded up and searched. When the government comes for your guns they don't come with a database, they assume everyone is armed and sweep house to house in a lightning war. Welcome to FEMA Camp Boston. Showers are to your right.

       This generation hardly remembers anything about Hitler except his name and a few details about the holocaust. My family was there, they saw it coming and got out in time. There are just too many eerie similarities to the way he assumed power. Remember, the eugenics movement was very popular here before it moved to Germany. That's part of the reason FDR stayed out until international pressure forced his hand. He and cousin Teddy didn't actually object to the policy. Nobody wants to remember that either, but there are some who still think it's a good idea. Fascism is rearing it's ugly head in another duel with communism, and if we stick our heads in the sand we're going to pay dearly.

       I clearly heard the commands on the scanner telling them to hold fast on the outer perimeter after they found him.

        Here
       </a>
       is a map showing where he was found (point A) and where the three block inner perimeter was established (point B) around the location where Richard Donohue was killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really odd that all the activity was to the east of this, as if they never even thought to cross Walnut Street all night. I think the MSM is talking about the inner perimeter to make it sound like he had escaped their net and it was only luck that found him. I don't think it's a lie, I think it's a deception. For me it just doesn't make any sense that he was hiding that close to the shootout, wounded, and no police dog could follow the blood trail. It's not like they weren't looking anywhere else, the old man was robot-searched a mile in the other direction.

       he initially escaped by car and the blood trail (if there was one) is unlikely to have been like you see in films with a couple of dots every few feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       regarding the search, they couldnt search everywhere at once so odds were against them finding him sooner rather than later. im not sure what people are suggesting by insinuating they could have found him sooner?

       That's what I meant when I mentioned sneaking back.... he escaped by car only to walk back to the scene of the crime, while injured and dripping blood, and hide right next to the hottest search zone? Why would he do that?
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not like there was nobody searching the rest of Watertown, as evidenced by the other stops and searches made well outside the inner perimeter. Even if there's no direct trail a K9 could certainly pick up on the blood.
