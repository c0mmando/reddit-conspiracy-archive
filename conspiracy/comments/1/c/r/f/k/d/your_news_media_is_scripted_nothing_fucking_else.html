    <div class="md"><p>OK, not going to lie - lots of Americans are really, really fucking stupid. Unbelievably stupid. You see, they put this poison in the water here. I bet you don&#39;t have it in your water, it&#39;s called fluoride? It&#39;s one of the deadliest neurotoxins known and they put it in our fucking water supply. <em>Just let that sink in for a minute.</em> And then add on the TV, the fast food, the bad education system...it&#39;s a recipe for disaster. Honestly, it&#39;s very difficult to fight off all the fucking evil in this country that bombards us on a daily basis, and if you are poor and disenfranchised...you don&#39;t stand a chance.  </p>

<p>But we are not all stupid. Millions of us are awake and aware and getting more pissed off by the day. And that is why I&#39;m getting very sick and tired of foreigners looking down upon us because of this &quot;Stupid American&quot; stereotype. No offense, but if you don&#39;t live here you really don&#39;t know what we are dealing with.</p>

<p>&quot;Stupid American&quot; is nothing more than a stereotype, you are taking an incredibly diverse group of people and condensing them into a neat little package that just so happens to boast your own ego. If this can happen to Americans, it can happen to you too. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t broadcast our viewpoints on the scripted news, but we are here. And there are so many of us. We are the silenced majority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m an optimist, so I believe it&#39;s happening right now! Is this thread not an example? However, it&#39;s a process (an evolution), so it happens gradually, often &quot;below the surface&quot;, until the environment demands a quicker adaptation (a crisis point or &quot;arms race&quot;). This thread is just one tiny example of the millions of connections that are being made every day on the internet. That is why they want to control the internet so badly! We found a loophole in their system (they have to control all the information to control us), and we are started to us it for our best interests, so I think they are shaking in their boots! Thats why they are so blatant with their propaganda, they are desperate. </p>

<p>I take it as a compliment actually because if they are paying attention to us maybe it&#39;s because we are starting to catch on to the truth? Evil hates truth and will always attempt to repress it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question, With a few exceptions, bottled water is just as bad or worse. Private water companies are under less oversight than the public water supply. Many brands of water are nothing more than bottled city water with sodium added to make you more thirsty. The FDA allows fluoride to be added to bottled water if theres &quot;not enough&quot; but it does not have to be labeled. Also, the bottles are often stored for long periods of time in plastic containing BPA, a known carcinogen. Most disgusting of all, they sell here &quot;Baby Water&quot; which has even MORE fluoride in it. They think our children need a double dose of neurotoxin. For the teeth! It&#39;s fucking sick. </p>

<p>Fluoride is intended for topical treatment, the same as sunscreen. You don&#39;t see anyone drinking sunscreen, and if the government told you to drink it, you&#39;d call them crazy. Also, if the government really cared about the dental health of citizens enough to medicate the water supply, why don&#39;t they also add vitamins and minerals - so lacking in typical US diets? </p>

I studied philosophy and while that has nothing to do with acting/drama/production, this is the most unbelievable piece of news reporting ever. </p>

<p>FUCK. I am so scared for America, and I&#39;m not even an American. Please, Americans, get to the bottom of this and EXPOSE IT ALL. If you have to go to your local or national court, so be it. If you have evidence of a cover up or conspiracy on a national scale, PRESENT IT TO A FUCKING COURT OF LAW.</p>
