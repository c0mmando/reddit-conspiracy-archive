        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The fact that this forum is subject to censorship is proof that forces controlling the media and information are muzzling r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>Posts are frequently deleted, posters are frequently banned and the remaining content doesn&#39;t even resemble the kind of discussion I would expect from a community with a suposed interest in conspiracies.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been checking r/conspiracy constantly since the first word of the Boston bombings, and the hand of censorship and discussion control is blatantly obvious in this forum.</p>

<p>Discussion over points which aren&#39;t already considered by the mainstream media are conspicuously absent from the top posts and comments.</p>

<p>THIS SUBREDDIT IS SUBJECT TO ACUTE CENSORSHIP.  Literally, the same powers you are trying to bring to light are exercising part of their power to selectively delete content from your discussions.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t let this post get deleted or inexplicably is downvoted.  The lack of awareness about the censorship in this subreddit makes it the community look very stupid to those who don&#39;t read very deep into the content. </p>

<p>EDIT: You can also just look around to see how many other posts there are like this one, but NONE make it to the front page.  It&#39;s almost like they won&#39;t let fly-by visiters to r/conspiracy know how censored it is by keeping discussion of censorship off the front page.</p>

<p>EDIT AGAIN: Grammar...  And remember, the legitimacy of prevailing lies over truth depends on the marginalization of the skeptics.  Especially in the last few days, forces have distorted the face of this forum to make us seem much less reasonable than we really are.</p>

<p>EDIT-O-MATIC: <a href="/u/In-yo-diddly-hole">/u/In-yo-diddly-hole</a> appears to be a user who exists only to throw people off of the scent of the truth.  <a href="/u/dasstrooper">/u/dasstrooper</a> mentioned <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a> which catalogues deleted posts from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> <a href="/r/darknetplan">/r/darknetplan</a> <a href="/r/france">/r/france</a> and <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.  Still, coordinated downvoting and other means of controlling discussion are not so easily accounted for.  I am also not sure that <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a> comprehensively lists posts deleted by moderators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Large scale economic plots are clearly real--international bankers have ambitions and make plans which affect the daily lives of huge populations.  It is obvious that international economic forces affect the lives of all Americans tremendously, but Americans are not allowed any influence in international economic matters since such things are outside of the range of mainstream discussion.</p>

<p>The fact that economies get squeezed dry as the result of immoral banking isn&#39;t so much a conspiracy as it is the truth of post-industrial capitalism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny that people always talk about guns when preaching revolution.  If people could just coordinate to stop paying income tax simultaneously, the government would do ANYTHING to get people paying taxes again.  This is seemingly impossible though with our current media and communications controls.</p>

<p>BONUS FACT: Income tax is not legally required from American citizens.  It is collected without proper legal authority, but we all pay it since we know that the IRS can drain your bank account and garnish your future wages.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE8RtL3azDg">AMERICA â€” From Freedom To Fascism</a> is an excellent documentary which opened my eyes to this brutal lie.  The documentary investigates with integrity the fact that the IRS operates completely above the law, with no interest in the American people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if the Craft International pics have been taken out of context to frame the guys as suspects, are they really totally invalid?  Those pictures aroused my suspicion, and the original poster may have arranged the pics to paint the guys as guilty, but that doesn&#39;t really matter unless the images were hardcore photoshopped.  The guy running is the weakest piece of evidence in the bunch, but it doesn&#39;t make the whole thing bogus.</p>

<p>I feel like the &#39;black powder&#39; prediction is being promoted as &quot;the top crazy 4chan conspiracy theory,&quot; while this one is being marginalized without getting due consideration.</p>

<p>And perhaps you are correct about the recent influx of people who won&#39;t take part in conspiracy circle-jerks, but I cannot believe that they would drown out all discussion which goes beyond the limits of acceptable suspicions set by the mainstream media.</p>

<p>anyway, i do think they are a bit of a non-issue compared to a few other things.</p>

<p>the strangest thing for me is why it took them 4 days to identify the brothers. one of which had been named by foreign intelligence and investigated for years....known to have visited mid east/asian countries and followed extremist people/websites etc then....would he really have pursued this knowing he was being monitored? its alleged the training would have occurred during the 6 month trip to russia. isnt that a bit risky for the &quot;trainers&quot; knowing the fbi are keeping tabs on him?</p>

<p>the fbi arent being honest/open about the brothers, but i have no clue what the truth is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At least 13 relatives of Osama bin Laden, accompanied by bodyguards and associates, left the United States on a chartered flight with Ryan International Airlines (Ryan International Flight 441) [20] eight days after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, according to a passenger manifest released on July 21, 2004.[21] The passenger list was made public by Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), who obtained the manifest from officials at Boston&#39;s Logan International Airport. None of the flights, domestic or international, took place before the reopening of national airspace on the morning of Sept. 13 and the 9/11 Commission found &quot;no evidence of a political intervention&quot;.[22] </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The deleted posts don&#39;t even leave a [deleted] space.</p>

<p>You can only know about them because you either saw them yourself prior to deletion, or you see other comments referencing them.</p>

<p>Let me go look now to see if I can find an actual link to some evidence.</p>

<p>EDIT.  I won&#39;t bother literally looking for evidence, since that evidence can be just as easily deleted, or down-voted, or edited.  But just look at the front page.</p>

<p>Shouldn&#39;t someone be presenting logic that hasn&#39;t already been broadcast by major new outlets?</p>

<p>Can conspiracy theorists really only muster up the point that the father and aunt of the victims say they were innocent?</p>

<p>How about the fact that they were caught in the most predictable and impossible way according to the official story?  They were caught not because of an investigation, but because they were trying to plant more bombs a few days later and happened to be caught red-handed this time?  One of the suspects is then murdered and the other is a Russian speaking Muslim?</p>

<p>The front page has clearly been run through a sort of &#39;mainstream media&#39; filter if one of the top stories is that the suspect&#39;s Father thinks they were innocent...  This forum is supposedly a discussion place for conspiracy theorists, not a compilation of crazy conspiracy theorist arguing points as presented in mainstream media outlets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m here downvoting a lot of stuff I see in this sub not because I&#39;m a shill but because there is a LOT of loose brained nonsense being spouted, not least this post and others like it. The arrogance of thinking that the gub&#39;ment/Reddit mods &amp; admins are censoring the fallacy ridden speculation in this tiny tiny corner of the Internet is laughable. I came to this sub to see if anything worth reading was going on, as I suspect a few other redditors have. Finding essentially nothing but paranoia and this sense of &quot;I&#39;m not like the other sheeple&quot; I&#39;ve been downvoting pretty much everything here. Ill accept my downvotes in kind from all of you now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of the speculation is wild and untrue, and please downvote what you think is stupid.</p>

<p>I was specifically prompted to write this post by a very specific post which I saw, and was subsequently deleted by a moderator.</p>

<p>If hard censorship is occurring here, then there is little hope of actually piecing together meaningful truths which aren&#39;t entertained in the mainstream media.</p>

<p>Everybody who reads or contributes to this forum should realize this.  This forum is subject to censorship, and is thus very limited in its ability to expose the conspiring elements who expend resources to keep themselves hidden.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t find the specific post that got me started with this, but it involved accusations of corruption among the corporate owners of reddit.  It was mostly critical of Reddit, rather than being critical of the usual conspiracy theory subjects...</p>
