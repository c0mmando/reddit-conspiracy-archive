       I havent seen any credible evidence. A photo of them walking down the street and thats about it. Then we are told they were throwing bombs out the window at cops???
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they are photoshopping him by the kid who died???
      </p>
      <p>
       You are in contact with this guy since 2011 and he managed to get SEMTEX???
      </p>
      <p>
       its ridiculously hard to get semtex, even harder when the fbi is watching you. I cant buy into this story. The only facts we have about this situation that are supported with witnesses and others are
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         FBI was running drills(A usual security measure in false flags) and LIED ABOUT IT
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They had bomb sniffing dogs all over and failed to sniff out the bombs
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         FBI was in contact with the suspect for 2.5 years and LIED ABOUT IT
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If they were buying RDX crystals or PETN to make semtex it would immedietly be noticed by NSA, DHS, or FBI.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Chechen areï»¿ funded by the US
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       6.FBI says "dont look at any other pics only ours" while there are more credible pictures being circulated by 4 chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE AT.
      </p>
      <p>
       To people claiming them getting into a shootout makes them guilty, thats not the case. Where is the evidence or blasts on the streets from these bombs they were throwing out there window? where are the witnesses to this?? there is not one credible, tangible piece of evidence to tie these 2 men to the bombings, its fucked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is more evidence that 4chans suspects were the bombers then these guys. I just dont like it and they are the perfect patsies

       +1 to this.

       We have no evidence of him committing the act, but I'm not sure that there is hard evidence of a setup yet either.
      </p>
      <p>
       For both claims, we should demand proof.

       Actually, burden of proof falls on the prosecution. We can say any number of ways he is innocent, merely on conjecture and anecdotal evidence alone. It is up to the prosecution to provide prood that the act was committed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm really surprised there are pictures of streets where sides of cars have been damaged by grenades exploding in the street. Its Boston, EVERY street is littered with cars.

       Burden of proof does lie on the prosecution in court, but OP isnt merely suggesting innocence, hes suggesting a coverup or something of the like, which demands proof as well.

       OP is also not the FBI leading the case(therefore no burden). So, him suggesting cover-up is second to his request for evidence from the FBI since they claim they have it, then I believe we would have to see evidence for OPs suggestions. Provided all of the new video proof released. I cant wait.

       I think we all know that a lot of people here think it's a coverup without proof. But instead of outright saying it, they ask questions that allude to their thoughts about the matter. There's no reason to expect to see evidence before they've been tried in court.

       Yes, if they used this picture in court, you couldn't simply say "It's Photoshopped, next evidence pls" without PROVING that it was faked.

       I've been screaming for everyone to look at the pic of him near the kid that got killed, the backpack is clearly visible, it is black with white finishings, now go and look at the video of the bombers walking, it is clearly a completely different backpack.  It is in fact the polar opposite, why has nobody else even noticed this.  The photo of him near the kid with backpack on the ground proves his innocence....

       I just don't know where you get the idea that criminal evidence is generally distributed for public viewing. The evidence is shown as it is entered into the public record, If there is an indictment, you will start to see the evidence offered.

       There is a picture of the bomber next to the kid who died with his back pack on the ground.  The OP allegedes it is photo shopped.  Which is fine if he can prove it.  I am just asking for proof.   This is the picture

       What I donât understand about this photo is the fact that not a single person seems bothered that some random guy has just dropped a bag in front of them. If someone dropped a bag in front of me at an event like this I would immediately move out the way and report it, yet not a single person here looks remotely bothered.

       Heâs at least 4ft away in that photo and obviously just walking off. Are you honestly telling me you wouldnât be suspicious if someone did that right next to you?

       Those kids probably had no idea it was near them. It's impossible to tell what the people walking the opposite direction were thinking from a photo. It's been brought up that a lot of people had bags and it wasn't out of the ordinary for someone to put down their heavy bag.

       But how many of those people putting their bags down just walked off afterwards? Itâs completely unnatural behaviour, Iâd like to think at least one person would have noticed it.

       Yes, there would need to be proof that the picture was photoshopped to make that claim. I do feel a little uneasy that this appears to be the only photograph showing him close to the crime scene, and there are no photographs showing the other suspect (who is now dead) near the site of the first explosion ... just the testimony of Jeff Baumann.

       The DC madam also "wrote" a letter saying she committed suicide, of course it didn't matter that friends said that was not her writings, or that just few days earlier she was on the Alex Jones show saying she would never commit suicide and she was absolutely going to fight in the courts, it didn't matter that statistically a very small portion of woman actually hang themselves and the proffered method of suicide is poison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets not even go that she could have exposed hundreds of high level white house and congress people about prostitution and what not, she committed suicide with a fake writing just days after claiming she won't commit suicide and after friends and relatives said that wasn't her writing.

       I don't know if you're familiar with police procedures but from what I've experienced, they tend to have confessions in writing. It's crazy, most of the time it's not even in the suspects hand writing.

       I remember it in a law class I took, It was back in 2005 but I remember a video we watched about a former cop turned attorney. He took a case pro bono for some kid that had been charged with murder. The police wrote his confession in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also when I got arrested, the cops tried to get me to sign a pre-written statement absolving them from entering my house without a warrant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also this is what I could come up with in a search.

       he has been tried already by a court of public opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are still calling them "bombing suspects" but they were claiming definitively all day yesterday that the suspects KILLED and officer and robber a 7/11.  There was no allegedly.  The media has told us that he is guilty and most people are already convinced.  Hell, there was a PARADE in boston yesterday when they caught him...
      </p>
      <p>
       it's the same parroted language on every channel:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The suspects' bloody rampage claimed the life of MIT Police Officer Sean Collier, 26, who was found shot to death in his squad car at 10:20 p.m. Thursday in what Davis termed a "vicious assassination."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/20/second-boston-bombing-suspect-in-custody/">
        http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/20/second-boston-bombing-suspect-in-custody/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The really interesting thing about this case is the way they are ritualistically using the public.  They managed to gameify the manhunt.  They used the public to "help them find the bomber" (the public was useless there) and by shutting down boston and opening it up at 9 on friday night, they created this amazing climax of conflict and resolution.  Now, they will try him by a jury of his peers and we will al be the jury.  The media will gameify the trial itself.  It's really amazing to watch this.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit:  also- according to the media: Moments after the shooting, the brothers carjacked the Mercedes SUV from Third Street in Cambridge and forced the driver to stop at several bank machines to withdraw money. The driver later told police that the brothers had bragged to him that they were the marathon bombers, law enforcement authorities said.
      </p>
      <p>
       really?  so they are terrorists on the run 4 days later, carjacking people and having them make SEVERAL ATM stops?!  You people realize that can't possibly be true, right?  But the media says it's true.  So show us the ATM videos.  There is always an ATM video.  But we will never ever see that.

       Semtex wasn't used at all, pressure cookers were used. These bombs use gunpowder or other extremely fast combustable powders in to create an enormous amount of pressure inside a strong casing (pressure cookers being ideal).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's as simple as filling up a pressure cooker with the powder from fireworks, sealing a broken christmas light inside the hole and attaching it to a clock. If anything the bombs were missing a component though, no shrapnel. This would have made things a hundred times worse. The basic principle is that the combustion of the powder happens so quickly in such a strong container that it saves up a huge amount of energy before the container fails, once it does fail all that energy escapes at once.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, pressure bombs, not semtex.

       The most evidence they likely have at that point is something that places the suspect in the vicinity of the crime scene/some object or person who could tie him specifically to the crime. Hardly enough to convict a person; enough to see that he is a definite person of interest. Most times, I do not see them lay out their whole case on the news prior to even making an arrest. Also there is a reason that, even now, he is called a suspect. His guilt will be proven in court with, DUN DUN DUNNNNNN, concrete evidence.

       Now, this isn't definitive proof. We likely won't see that until the trial begins. And honestly, that's how it should be. He deserves a fair trial. Evidence should be presented for court, not for the court of public opinion.

       They are obviously 2 different people, you have to be delusional to think they are not.  That's just from looking at the images.  Try actually examining who these 2 men are and it becomes overwhelmingly obvious that you're a disrespectful moron with little to know compassion in your heart.

       To accuse a man who nearly just died and who lost both his legs of being a plant based on the fact that he sort of looks like another guy who lives on the same planet as him is disgusting, and you should be ashamed.

       That is true, however it is also clearly true that witnesses are sometimes correct.  The man who lost his legs in the attack clearly led them to the correct suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if he hadn't led them to the correct suspect, or hadn't remembered anything, I'm not sure how your statement has anything to do with mine regarding the fact that he was not a planted actor.  I said nothing about him identifying the suspect.

       The videos led them to the suspects (if it's true.) A sick and injured man may have confirmed what they wanted confirmed. Or he may be guessing. I wonder how good my memory would be of a stranger that stood near me right before an explosion. I kinda wonder if I'd remember at all.

       You're veering off topic and I don't know what point you're trying to make.  I explained that the man who lost his legs was not a plant.  You keep talking about whether or not his identification of the suspect was accurate.  I don't care.
      </p>

       Also he wasn't "sick and injured," he was simply injured, and on medication.  Don't sensationalize.

       How do you now he isn't a plant? Have you examined his biology?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now a false witness, he could easily be one of those. Seriously though, who would volunteer to have his legs blown off so that he could falsely ID a suspect?
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't believe anything the MSM says these days. I don't even know that he was a victim, much less that there were bombs. I haven't seen anything that could have been made in a studio with actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep accusing people here of being sensationalistic, and repeating that you don't care if his identification was inaccurate, but that is precisely the issue at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       So allow me to make a:-
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;dr- There are three things I could see having happened here:
      </p>
      <p>
       `1. The story is as the MSM has portrayed it and this poor man saw the suspect plant the bomb, then experience his legs getting blown off, then volunteered this information to police after life saving surgery.
      </p>
      <p>
       `2. The story is slightly off from the MSM's portrayal and this poor man did see someone leave a backpack, but was traumatized when his legs were blown off and volunteered to help the police but misidentified a suspect and caused a manhunt for suspicious persons not connected to the bombing who ran for other reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       `3. The story is completely fabricated by the MSM. The man is a paraplegic crisis actor planted at the scene to evoke the public's sympathy and he has provided false testimony to distract the public from the real bombers, be it hired goons, government agents, or terrorist groups.

       His identification of the suspect was entirely unrelated to my original point.  It is in that context that "I don't care" if it was accurate.

       Sure, I guess I could find that plausible if I was a paranoid schizophrenic.  As a non-delusional adult human who is able to reasonably analyze information, that is clearly a complete fantasy and I feel sorry for anybody who thinks it's plausible.

       I'm just pointing out the hard plausabilities. I believe this is a conspiracy theorist subreddit, not a lamestream media subbreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is you don't know that this whole media event has been planned from start to finish. The bombing, the subsequent spreading of the "terror" by the MSM, the poke at the reloading crowd and gun rights, the gargantuan lockdown and manhunt for one suspect. It very much looks like a script. Just like 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM is publishing bullshit and retracting it every two seconds. The FBI has tunnel vision and is following only 1 lead. Private military, whose motto is "Violence solves problems" was literally on the scene of the blast! Am I the only one talking about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are delusional. Definitely an adult because you have zero imagination. You're only able to recycle the filth that is programmed into your mind by the television set.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do us all a favor. Turn off the TV, and the internet and go outside. Try and grow something, build something. Go play! Leave the investigative armchair conspiracy exposing to imaginative young folk like me.

       Why do you assume this is the correct suspect. Even if he did throw bombs at the police it doesn't mean he is guilty of bombing the Boston Marathon.

       The only thing that incriminates him is one eyewitness. A handicapped guy is just as capable of mistakes or deceit as any other human. Don't be so quick to join the mob.

       I'm not taking sides here but this is just idiotic. So you're standing in a mass public event, and someone makes eye contact with you, drops a bag by your feet, and walks away... and you don't think anything of it and just hang out there by the bag?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean come on. I know this guy is a victim and what happened to him is horrible beyond words but how stupid can you be to admit that you saw someone drop a bag at your feet and walk away and not only not say anything about it but also just stay there next to the bag? Unbelievable!

       Hindsight. It is easy for you to say this now that there is a precedent of a bombing via backpack at the Boston marathon. Previous to this happening, it wouldn't have been so suspicious.

       Have you ever been to an airport or massive public event such as a carnival, fair, sports game, etc? There are signs everywhere saying "please report unattended bags". I've seen hundreds of news reports about suspicious packages or bags left unattended over the past 10-15 years. It's common sense that bags unattended = suspicious.

       Don't get me wrong and lol @ downvoting because I'm being insensitive or whatever. Obviously I'm not saying the guy deserved it or anything. It's horrible beyond believe and looking at the picture of the victims gray emotionless face of shock makes me want to throw up every time I see it, but he really should have found it suspicious.

       Psychologically speaking, I think most would try to convince themselves that their not in danger first. I mean, if a guy dropped a bag in front of me at a marathon- not an airport or on a bus or anything that usually gets the bomb threat- I would probably be thinking "Huh....that was weird". I don't think most people would jump straight to "This stranger dropped his bag off in front of me....it must be a bomb!"

       Maybe he saw the guy drop his bag then turned back around and focused on the race or the friends he was with. Seriously, before this event if somebody set a backpack on the ground and stepped away for a minute would you be like "Shit, BOMB! Everybody run!" No. You might think it peculiar for a moment but then think nothing of it. Maybe he thought he was just going to go talk to somebody or grab something. I'm sure he didn't just drop it, make eye contact and walk right away. He was probably a little more inconspicuous than that. I'm sure he stuck around for a bit. Don't call a victim an idiot when you have no idea what happened.

       One eyewitness does not a case make. I'd prefer a picture. Why is there a blackout on the presence of Craft International? They were standing right where the bomb went off prior to it detonating and didn't notice anything. You'd think trained mercs would have training in spotting that kinda thing.

       Picture of what? It's not like investigating is so easy that there is always a picture o someone red handed - it's more like a pattern of events and changes that result in the assumed reason for doing what they did. FBI has been all over their facebook/twitter accounts, heard from people who knew them, and we've had reporters interview relatives of theirs. After that younger brother gets questioned we'll hopefully get some more answers, but don't expect a picture of a guy placing a pack on the ground with a sign of their name in bold print above them.

       There are cameras on nearly every cellphone in Boston, in addition to surveillance cameras. 4chan has done an excellent job of compiling suspicious persons. The FBI said directly to disregard all these images.

       Let me turn that question back to you- why are you more willing to believe some stranger online than the professional investigator? One lists suspects based on photos, the other based off of photos, witness reports, and questioning.

       I trust organizations over individuals! Take a look at the news about how reddit, 4chan and other sites had people play 'pretend CSI' at home, circling anyone by themselves with a backpack at the marathon and call them the bomber.

       I doubt the news, since it's an organization. I find it untrustworthy at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself, "What is an organization?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Merriam-webster defines it as "an administrative and funtional structure:
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       the personnel of such a structure."
      </p>
      <p>
       I take this to mean three things that sit ill with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly - an organization has hierarchy. As an egalitarian, I hate hierarchy. Doubly true when searching for "truth." Hierarchy inspires mistrust, and thus lies and doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly - an organization has rules. As an outlaw, I hate rules. "Do what you want" should be the only rule. I hate when people tell me what to do. Especially when it's for "my own good."
       <strong>
        I
       </strong>
       decide "my own good." Who is someone else to tell me different.
All rules do is criminalize the innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       And thirdly (and I believe most importantly,) an organization is comprised of individuals. "A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link." Assembling a congregation of individuals, giving them a hierarchy and rules almost guarantees mistakes to be made and lies to be told.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, I think 4chan (a loosely knit group of individuals,
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       an organization, and reddit have done a reasonable job of assembling a list of suspects. The former moreso than the latter perhaps. (
       <em>
        sorry guys!
       </em>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       All the FBI managed to do is provide two photographs of one suspect and instruct the public to put on a blindfold. Hardly good investigative work.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side note, have you forgotten how good the FBI is at entrapment?

       Thanks, but I do think I needed to the actual definition of an organization. Just about everyone is part of one, and if a doctor says "you have diabetes and need an insulin pump", you don't get a second opinion from your neighbor who has 0 medical training and trust his word over someone who went to school to get the qualification/skills/experience to diagnose you.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it may not apply to all things, like I said before, in cases such as these damn right I would trust an organizations word before some strangers! At least when the FBI says they have a suspect, you know they have people who had to have experience in investigations like this rather than just trusting other individuals simply because they share your opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes I know the FBI is good at entrapment, and I also know individuals can be full of shit, paranoid, arrogant, self absorbed, etc etc - that's why we see so many self-help books around. Rules don't criminalize the innocent, rules are guide lines- laws are debatable, but that comes down to who makes the laws, and that wouldn't be the FBI.

       At the risk of being repetetive, I see that we disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think that organizations are everpresent and beneficial.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that organizations are temporary and downright useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate to say, "let's agree to disagree", so why don't you just admit that I'm right and you're wrong.

       Now you just sound like one of those people who believe they always have the right idea, not to mention grouping everything into black and white categories (i.e.
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       organizations are bad,
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       individuals are reliable)
      </p>
      <p>
       Since that is the case, I would highly suggest you reassess your reasoning.

       You're finally making sense, albeit through asserting that I mean that which I did not say.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never once said the word "all." Nor did I ever mean to insinuate that "all organizations are bad, all individuals are reliable."
      </p>
      <p>
       I gave you the definition of organization a few comments back to put a context to our discussion, but since you seem to have missed that I suggest you go back and check it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Organizations as "administrative and functional structures" are useless,
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       bad. The incompetence of individuals as the "personnel of such a structure" is one of the qualities of organizations, that I alluded to, in order to show
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       such structures
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my own history, I've found far more examples of competent individuals than competent organizations. Is it neccesary that I should make a list of the former for you, that you should make a list of the latter and let's compare? I do not think this necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please refrain from putting more falsities in my mouth in your next comment.

       I think this conversation had gone on long enough for you to know you just explained you don't trust organizations because of people, individuals, who work in them are incompetent. I was arguing that you would be much less likely to find reliable information from individuals, specifically information relating to the Boston Bombers or most murder cases, than you would be able to from organizations from the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       To spell it out, your basically just saying you don't trust any individual person by reasoning no organization can be trusted due to the unreliability of the individuals involved. So, either
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       is useless, or a group of specifically trained individuals would be slightly less "useless" than one regular jack off.

       No, you misunderstand me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am saying that an organization, as a conglomeration of competent and incompetent individuals, is less competent than an individual. And further, that a non-organized volunteer group, such as 4-chan or reddit, is more trustworthy than an authoritarian organization that is known to be corrupt, such as the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       To further my point, consider the fact that the entirety of Boston's militarized police force was at the disposal of the FBI; yet it was one individual citizen who found the suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone is useless, unless they are burdened by the hierarchies and regulations of a "functional and administrative" organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am all for people voluntarily organizing to solve problems. But when people are stuck in the muck of bureaucracy, they are less apt to actually solve anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't trust organizations as functional administrative structure, because I don't believe in hierarchies or rules.

       this just confuses me more.   isn't part of the story that the younger brother got away during the "firefight".  despite the fact that Apache fucking helicopters where on the scene yet it was "too foggy".   now i didn't buy this for one second.  we all watch cops we know what type of cameras helicopters are equipped with and those are just local police.  i can only imagine what a military copter has.   and here this picture shows that fog wouldn't have mattered.......help im confused

       yeah.  you're right i could have sworn i heard Apache (fuck cnn). but still a military helicopter, piloted by military personal. my question still stands even if i was wrong about the helicopter.  they couldn't find one kid fleeing a crime scene due to fog?  they didn't ground the helicopter.  it was in the air, they just couldn't track him?

       This isn't directed toward you specifically, but of course it's the kid in the boat! The federal government is conducting a manhunt for him, and they killed his brother! The question isn't who they're tracking, it's of the people they're tracking are guilty! Who cares about the boat!

       Why didn't he shoot it out? Did he loose hit huts pah all the sudden?   He evades the swat etc for 12 hours in the largest lockdown in u.s. history and he is hiding in someones boat?
      </p>
      <p>
       These guys robbed liquor stores and shot an MIT cop they obviously wanted to get caught.  When they were caught they had a gun fight and tried to through a bomb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why then run and hide? What was he going to do wait till things blew over?

       The younger brother gets away by driving at the police.

       This now justifies placing a population of 400,000 on lock down, forced entry searches on a massive scale.   Keep in mind these guys are just suspects because like this post points out there is not evidence presented to us yet......

       Considering all of OP's "points" have a different format.
      </p>
      <p>
       Top ones are just double spaced, then used bullet points, and one has "6." before it when it about 9th "point". OP just copy and pasted these "points" from another source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't even bother to reformat.

       So not only is this impossibly stupid, and misinformed OP is also incredibly lazy.

       I doubt it will. Quite a few people on here will believe facts when they are presented to them, but most will just say the wheelchair guy is a shill if he identifies the bomber as one of the suspects.

       Did someone witness that crime, or do they have video evidence that it was them? I'm honestly asking, 'cause the only thing I've seen/heard so far is that the MIT cop was found dead in his car. And for several hours after that, they were looking for a lone man wearing a cowboy hat, which doesn't seem to have anything to do with the brothers.

       Considering how much is still unknown about this case, such as if the two were working with a larger group or something, we probably won't hear from the car jacked witness until who evers in charge decides he won't be in danger from "spilling the beans". That's just assumption though, did hear he heard the two suspects "bragging" about the bombings

       Yeah and where is the evidence for that? You believe it because the government said it. I'm not saying they didn't do it but they only place I've heard that is on the news and they lie all the time, so why should I believe them now?

       Do you know how easy it is to shred any papers that they had detailing what their plans are? Do you know how easy it is to destroy a hard drive or other type of digital media? It's very easy to destroy what you do not want to be found. There is most likely dashboard cams and any videos from those will be held as evidence so as to not impact witness memory.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an ongoing investigation and it will take some time to bring said evidence to light and to trial.

       The FBI has much more footage and videos that they have not shown to the public, including suspect #2 planting the bomb. They only released what they felt was necessary to identify the suspects.

         Most importantly, and this is something I wish a lot of others understood, the FBI cannot release all of their videos and images of them because it could potentially harm the case against the suspect.

       it was found out to be a pressure cooker. when you know.. they actually stopped to look. You cant really do that when you are on a highspeed chase. And no, no cop ever said pipe bomb, i listened to the entire thing happen. They said "gernades", and "explosives"

       I listened to the whole thing, and I heard them say a pipebomb was reported. Twice. (in addition to what you said) If you want to find it in a recording, I think it was before the hospital was evacuated or on lock down.... before the hospital reported "code black".

       As an American citizen his right to trial should and must be preserved. Regardless of what we think we know right now, the burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed this crime.  While everything that has been presented to the public causes me to believe he is guilty, if I was a juror chosen for his trial I would need much more concrete proof to find him guilty.

       A couple of questions for the OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Who said they were using SEMTEX? I can't find any article which even references it. Where are you getting your information?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) In regards to:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They had bomb sniffing dogs all over and failed to sniff out the bombs
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well it is a 26.2 mile race and the largest in the world with over 500,000 spectators and 20,000 participants so I think it's reasonable to conclude that you can't lock down and find every possible bomb that might be placed. Bomb/Drug sniffing dogs have an
       <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/legal-challenge-questions-reliability-police-dogs">
        alarmingly high failure rate
       </a>
       . They are not an end all solution but an aid in finding something a human might miss. Which then requires further human investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) This is not really a question to you but this...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Chechen areï»¿ funded by the US
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I assume you mean the US provides assistance in the form of the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development">
        USAID program
       </a>
       and other programs some of which might be back-channel. You might be interested to know that a ton of countries receive aid from the US. Chechnya is so low on the list it doesn't even
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_foreign_aid#Recipients">
        make the top 25
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like I could keep picking away at what you wrote but I'd rather give you a chance to respond with sources because right now I feel some of your claims are dubious at best.

       The investigation just started; unlikely the Feds are going to make the most critical and sensitive information immediately available to the public. I would imagine the FBI had a critical piece of footage showing them drop the bags - likely video by a spectator in the stands. But again, don't expect them to make that immediately available.

       Where/who is this carjacking witness? I mean, besides being in a room, currently coached by the FBI. No one has seen him or heard from him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't he have provided the Officers with something more than, 'Oh, they told me they were the Boston Bombers...but they nicely dropped me off at the local gas station.'
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were carrying explosives, what is reportedly two long-armed guns and 2 additional firearms and suicide vests, wouldn't he make that his first statement?

      <p>
       This is false. The FBI did not lie about it because they didn't know the identity of the bombers when footage was released. It was not until after their identities were determined that it came to light the FBI had interview Suspect #1 before.

         FBI was running drills at an extremely large international event. Seems plausible that they would be there on hand in case something went wrong, or simply to, you know, train.

       Nothing makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       These guys had no reason to do anything. they were fucking Americans dam it. 
If these two had anything to do with it they wouldn't have stayed in Boston
And they sure as hell wouldn't be at711 after having their pictures released.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cop at MIT who was killed? Why? Its crazy to think they would do that just randomly.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no proof of this car chase or shootout. No photos of them at MIT. No photos of them with any kind of weapons or bombs etc. The bags didn't match either.
      </p>
      <p>
       So were supposed to believe these terrorists carried 7 pressure cooker bombs on 2 backpacks? Reaaally?
      </p>
      <p>
       If these guys were terrorists I bet they would have killed more than 3 people. This was done to cause fear not casualties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every person who knew these guys said they were great people and were leaders, and volunteers.

       Sorrry, but this smells of bullshit.

       "Proof?" should be the standard reply to most claims on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       regardless of originator. (I can guess most conspiracists will answer that question less - unless they use terms like sheeple, TPTB, etc. - which they wrongly believe relieves them from giving proof.)

       I see the opposite. Older brother was a Muslim fundamentalist who was taking care of his younger brother. Many reports state that they have separated themselves in the last 2 years from family and friends. The older brother was already questioned by Russian investigators and FBI about a possible connection to Al Quida. His YouTube channel has a playlist with a lot of crazy Islamic shit including some video many terrorists use as a calling to killing infadels. This all adds up for me.

       I find it terribly odd that the government is able to set forth on these massive conspiracies, yet are so terrible at concealing them from internet detectives.

       Quite frankly, if it came out that these two weren't the bomber, the city and family would have one hell of a lawsuit against the military/FBI for numerous reasons. For legal purposes alone, I don't think they'd admit any mistakes once tanks are rolling through a city on lock down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't necessarily disbelieve that the 19y/o pictured was on the boat, but Let's hypothesize this guy is not the bomber.
Imagine that this guy is you.
You wake up one morning to find out the freaking FBI put your picture on blast, telling an entire nation that you're the bomber because you wore a backpack to an event.
You don't have a getaway plan, much less enough money to put one together in 24 hours. 
City goes into lock down and tanks are filling the streets.
What do you do?
      </p>
      <p>
       You sit your ass down in the back of a boat that hasn't been moved in awhile and shit yourself until your brain comprehends the timewarp your week just took. 
"Come out on your own terms" yell the authorities, weapons drawn. 
You have deja vu of your brother being shot the night before.
Fuck that!

       That validates eye witnesses who claim to have seen him being pulled out of the boat since no clear videos/photos exist WITHOUT supporting the FBIs claim that he is the bomber/a valid suspect. It's also a believable reason for a young man to hide from police since people argue "if he wasn't guilty, why did he run?"

       FBI hires the 2 kids to act the part of bombers for the drill. They are shown the insides of their backpacks so they know they are only carrying used books. The real bomb is planted by the older guy in blue with the knapsack with the stripes on the straps. The FBI pins it on the Muslims (ex-Russians for bonus points) and gains further psychological reasons to invade Muslim areas (Syria, Iran) to gain oil, minerals and markets. Rights are removed from Americans. This bombing seems very similar to the bus and train bombings in London.

       I heard on the police scanner that they were throwing explosives out the window. I personally heard the despair in the cop's voice who was driving behind them when it happened. The urgency in the cop's voice even scared me! There are several witnesses of the shootouts, and I've seen videos of them put up on youtube from residents in Watertown. All the evidence in any case doesn't come out immediately. Just have patience

       I actually went back and turns out I was wrong. I watched a video of them, didn't finish it, and thought I read that the video did show them committing the act. Turns out it said that the FBI SID HAVE footage of them dropping off the second bomb, but not the first. It'll all come out in his trial, though.

       The FBI does claim to have footage of Suspect #2 planting the bomb. I imagine they did not release it because what they did release was for the sole purpose of identifying them.

       Not taking sides, but him being in the same photo of the bag doesn't prove that he dropped it. There's a lot of other people in that photo too. Until video evidence is shown of him actually placing the bag there, that photo is not proof at all.

       I agree with you completely.  This subreddit is demanding proof about the suspects and throwing out crazy theories without any proof.  I think everyone needs to calm down with the MK-ultra, mind control stuff thats being thrown around and just wait till more concrete evidence is released or till the trial starts.

       He is in a walking stride, why would he be setting it down mid stride?  There is more evidence pointing to these 2 kids being radical muslims that put down home made bombs than a false flag attack.

       He could have stepped aside to look between people..? He's not exactly the tallest person there. When I sit my things down, I don't stand directly next to it still as a statue the whole time. Sometimes I wander 4-5 feet away to look around.

       The FBI does claim to have footage of Suspect #2 planting the bomb. I imagine they did not release it because what they did release was for the sole purpose of identifying them.

       So then why on Earth believe him?  You
       <em>
        shouldn't
       </em>
       believe him just because he "said" it.  He hasn't responded to any of the other people that have asked him the same question, so I'm personally not sure he isn't full of shit.

       I'm still waiting on that footage of either one of them placing the bomb.

       Also, how did the older brother die? They claim his younger brother ran him over? I was listening and watching the live feed and police scanner and I distinctly remember the police claiming they apprehended Suspect #1 and had him strip down naked. They placed him under arrest. How was he killed?

       The guy who they had strip down was just a random guy walking home.  They didn't know if he was one of the guys they were chasing and they had him strip to make sure he wasn't carrying explosives.  If you kept listening they confirmed that the guy was innocent and let him go on his way like 20 minutes after they stopped him.

       A little later after the naked guy, the police on the radio said they shot the older brother and needed an ambulance. As of the ambulance arriving, the older brother was alive with bullet wounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't until the photo of the older brother circulating online that those in the medical field viewing it started pointing out that his injuries were inconsistent with reports. They were saying that his injuries were consistent with being ran over and hung upside down postmortem. I heard nothing on the radio about the younger brother driving over him- but even so, that wouldn't explain the part about being hung upside down. He was alive just hours prior to the photo, so it's not like he was taken to this overcrowded morgue where a coroner had to stick him in a freezer like cattle to be processed.

       I have yet to see anything concerning the Tsarnaev brothers that couldn't have easily been faked. Including the picture of the older one dead. And those backpack seem too small.  That may or may not mean anything.  But I keep on thinking of the patsy Oswald.

       If the police/FBI claim exigent circumstances to search every house in the area then maybe this case deserves exigent circumstances for people to look at the evidence earlier than the trial date.

       What does that have to do with anything? I don't care if the guy did it or not; my problem is with how they decided to catch him by using a unprecedented militarized take-over of a city.

       I don't know why you're getting downvoted (I probably will too) but there is NO tangible evidence of them shooting at police. I had a buddy and his sister of mine call conspiracy theorists "boring without conspiracy" "wahh" and "conspiracy theorists are bandwagoners" and this was directed towards me and another group of friends who genuinely don't feel like anything adds up. And if you look at it in hindsight it really doesn't. There is no evidence, about ANYTHING, and that makes me feel bad for the two who are suspects. They are innocent until proven guilty, but so many people are bloodthirsty. They want to see them killed, but for why? What the news reported to be true even though there is evidence that they have been changing their stories? It's a load of bullshit. And no I'm not trying to come as a conspiracy nut, I just genuinely don't feel like anything the media says is true. And a police state? The fuck?

       Not taking sides, but him being in the same photo of the bag doesn't prove that he dropped it. There's a lot of other people in that photo too. Until video evidence is shown of him actually placing the bag there, that photo is not proof at all.

       Where's a photo of him walking away and the bag left behind right there? Sometimes I bring a bag with food and water bottles to events and I set it down when I stand in one place for awhile so I can give my back a rest.

       I agree with you completely.  This subreddit is demanding proof about the suspects and throwing out crazy theories without any proof.  I think everyone needs to calm down with the MK-ultra, mind control stuff thats being thrown around and just wait till more concrete evidence is released or till the trial starts.

       Picture of what? It's not like investigating is so easy that there is always a picture o someone red handed - it's more like a pattern of events and changes that result in the assumed reason for doing what they did. FBI has been all over their facebook/twitter accounts, heard from people who knew them, and we've had reporters interview relatives of theirs. After that younger brother gets questioned we'll hopefully get some more answers, but don't expect a picture of a guy placing a pack on the ground with a sign of their name in bold print above them.

       this just confuses me more.   isn't part of the story that the younger brother got away during the "firefight".  despite the fact that Apache fucking helicopters where on the scene yet it was "too foggy".   now i didn't buy this for one second.  we all watch cops we know what type of cameras helicopters are equipped with and those are just local police.  i can only imagine what a military copter has.   and here this picture shows that fog wouldn't have mattered.......help im confused
