<p>This Boston Globe story from last night describes the events:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police were cautious in their approach, concerned that Tsarnaev could be wearing a suicide bomb vest. A Globe photographer at the scene could hear police calling, “We know you’re in there. Come out on your own terms. Come out with your hands up.” An FBI hostage rescue team was eventually able to <strong>pull him out</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they &quot;pulled him out&quot;, I don&#39;t understand this photo. (Also, when the homeowner noticed &quot;something amiss&quot; with the boat tarp and lifted it, why didn&#39;t Dzhokhar shoot him?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been wondering this as well. I heard that he was injured in the shootout last night, escaped on foot and came across this boat and decided to hide. If that&#39;s the case, he was in that boat (bleeding) for at least 8 hours. Supposedly, the owner of the boat noticed a &quot;pool of blood&quot; but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true. </p>

<p>I listened to the whole thing on the scanner. When the helicopters first came, they reported there was no movement in the boat. So then they used flash bangs and he began moving a lot, &quot;frantically&quot;. Then a few moments after the flash bangs they again reported &quot;no movement in the boat.&quot; To me this seems consistent with him being very injured, perhaps in a semi-conscious state from the loss of blood. </p>

<p>So, how is it that a skinny kid who has spent half a day losing blood has the strength to lift himself out of a boat? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly what I heard. Along with the infrared readings that there was a half a tank of gas at the stern of the boat, yet they still went ahead with the flash-bangs.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it was a 40 gallon tank that was about half full. For a moment they thought they spotted a flame on the bloat. Soon after that, they asked for radio silence, and it went dead for 5-10 mins until it was over...&quot;WATCH YA MICS WATCH YA MICS&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, but we can&#39;t just make assumptions off of hypotheticals. It&#39;s very possible that they&#39;re withholding video from a helo to hide something, or that they specifically refrained from using the helo for the same reason, or they just didn&#39;t have a helo at that specific time for any number of reasons.</p>

<p>In all those videos around the time of the shootout, and &quot;capture&quot; of the first brother, we never see a spotlight, and it was made pretty clear that the area was dark as shit. They probably would have benefit from some illumination. They could have intentionally called off the helo, but we probably would have heard that over the air. Did anyone in the area at the time see or hear a helo? It&#39;s very likely that they weren&#39;t able to get one up on such short notice. Though, I&#39;d imagine them to be a little more prepared.</p>
