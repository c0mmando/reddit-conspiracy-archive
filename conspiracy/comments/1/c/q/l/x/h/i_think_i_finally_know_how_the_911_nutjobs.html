        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>(This is just a rant - no question asked - just need to get this off my chest before I explode.)</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m one of those people who believes 9/11 was &quot;fishy&quot; to say the least, but not really enough for it to bother me that so many accept the official story. I figured I was probably missing something - and was just buying into the &quot;conspiracy&quot; stuff because it makes for entertaining YouTube time. I was not invested in the idea of 9/11 as a false flag - so I suspected, but shrugged it off.</p>

<p>But this Boston thing - I can&#39;t do that.</p>

<p>On Tuesday I downloaded the screen cap that has been floating around from 4chan that you&#39;ve all likely seen. It is the one posted on 4/15 after the bombings about the &quot;campaign&quot; that was planned and pulled off in Boston. It accurately gave the ages of the perp(s), when they would be found (after nearly a week of letting the US stew in its hatred of all things muslim), and that a house would be searched on Friday. All happened exactly as predicted. Now we wait to see if this is actually a play for &quot;reloading supplies&quot; (a direction it seems to be heading in).</p>

<p>This just seems so &quot;in your face&quot; sloppy that it really should be the &quot;gotcha&quot; moment for most citizens to finally realize that as much as we want to cheer the armies of law enforcement that shut down multiple cities in an effort to capture one injured 19-year-old, we really have been &quot;played&quot; this time. This event really should be our nation&#39;s &quot;a-ha!&quot; moment!</p>

<p>But what do I see around the internet? Blood lust, cop worship, and a hungry acceptance of whatever the MSM is dishing out.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to be &quot;crazy.&quot; I don&#39;t want to be a &quot;conspiracy nut.&quot; But dammit I can&#39;t ignore this. There is something seriously wrong - and it is escalating quickly. I fear we really can&#39;t do anything about it. Many of us (like me) are opening our eyes when it is too late to pump the brakes and avoid the collision we&#39;re barreling towards.</p>

<p>We&#39;re losing. They&#39;re winning. And in the end - as bad as it gets - average Americans will still believe we are a great country, upholding the world&#39;s moral standards; a city on a hill - and that everyone who doesn&#39;t agree with the mass of mundane is the &quot;enemy&quot;. We&#39;ll watch TV, chat on our cell phones, and fiddle while the country burns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re contorting the facts to fit the 4chan post.  He did not predict two people.  He got the NRA part wrong.  He implied domestic right wing terrorists, these were not.  He failed to predict the entire Thursday events and the entire Friday standstill of a city.  There was no raid, there was a standoff in a boat.  He managed to guess the age, which had about a 50/50 chance of guessing right, and the ordeal happened to end on Friday.  Not a whole lot of accuracy in there.</p>

<p>And, for a little thought experiment, look at the post with skepticism, as if you were looking at a psychic prediction.  Pretend you had to debunk the post in a debate.  If you&#39;re <em>looking</em> for things that don&#39;t fit, you will find a lot.  You would come up with a convincing argument for why it was bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The day after the bombs went off I predicted that the bomber/s would be caught on Friday.  I based this prediction off no real evidence, just my conviction that the FBI is pretty good at its job.</p>

<p>Sure enough, on Friday they caught the bombers.  What does this mean?  Am I in on the conspiracy?  Do I have secret facts not in evidence?  No, it means I guessed, and got lucky.  I only wish I had posted my prediction somewhere.  Then this subreddit would be mystified at how I could have possibly known that they&#39;d be caught on Friday -- unless I was in on it!!!</p>

<p>The internet is full of prognosticators. Tens of thousands of predictions were made as to what and why and who and how.  When there are so many predictions being made, it is inevitable that someone will get multiple &quot;hits&quot; and come eerily close to guessing right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A bomb made using black powder went off and killed some people, and created mass panic.  There are 535 legislators at the federal level.  It is pretty much a given that at least one of them will propose some sort of legislation aiming to prevent the exact same tragedy from occuring in the future.  This legislation will almost certainly be over-reaching, ineffective and based on faulty premises.</p>

<p>But that is hardly evidence of a conspiracy.  The legislature has <strong>always</strong> been reactionary and prone to idiotic overreaching.  That&#39;s practically the definition of a legislature.</p>

<p>(Personally, I am a bit shocked to learn that no background check is required for purchasing 50 lbs or less of black powder, as I had always assumed that <em>some</em> sort of check was occurring.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI/CIA keep tabs on all of us, ESPECIALLY suspected foreign (or naturalized, as is the case here) radicals. An interview with mama Tsarnaev revealed that she had been approached by the FBI years ago - they said they were &quot;worried&quot; about her son, who seemed to have leadership qualities that can inspire radicals to do fucked up shit like this. Not sure how long exactly, but I think he&#39;s close/right on the 5. But had they been following him, wouldn&#39;t they have been able to recognize him without releasing photos publicly? Wouldn&#39;t several photos of him be in some database somewhere?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s watch this play out. I am sure some will claim &quot;coincidence&quot; if it does turn out to be a play for gun powder in some way. Does the post have to be 100% accurate to give a person pause? And in the light of recent (and not so recent) history, at some point a sane person has to question what they are being told.</p>

<p>One correction for you - they did search the house where the suspects lived on Friday. Yes, there was a standoff in a boat - but that is not all that happened. Did they find anything related to reloading and/or the NRA? I don&#39;t know. Have they released their findings from that raid yet? I am not aware that they have, but perhaps you have read the report already?</p>

<p>I for one do not buy the story. So it doesn&#39;t go exactly &quot;to script&quot;. It&#39;s like a play that has a plot, but the dialogue is ad-lib. The 4chan post is a hell of a lot more &quot;on point&quot; than any bible prophecy, and yet that shit is &quot;iron clad proof&quot;. If the guy who posted this read palms, I&#39;d pay.

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s watch this play out. I am sure some will claim &quot;coincidence&quot; if it does turn out to be a play for gun powder in some way. Does the post have to be 100% accurate to give a person pause? And in the light of recent (and not so recent) history, at some point a sane person has to question what they are being told.</p>

<p>One correction for you - they did search the house where the suspects lived on Friday. Yes, there was a standoff in a boat - but that is not all that happened. Did they find anything related to reloading and/or the NRA? I don&#39;t know. Have they released their findings from that raid yet? I am not aware that they have, but perhaps you have read the report already?</p>

<p>I for one do not buy the story. So it doesn&#39;t go exactly &quot;to script&quot;. It&#39;s like a play that has a plot, but the dialogue is ad-lib. The 4chan post is a hell of a lot more &quot;on point&quot; than any bible prophecy, and yet that shit is &quot;iron clad proof&quot;. If the guy who posted this read palms, I&#39;d pay. He&#39;s pretty damn good even if he was off just a smidge.</p>

<p>So, just asking, what <em>would</em> it take for you to believe this was just two crazy kids acting on their own, and that they were tracked down and captured/killed by law enforcement?  For that matter, how can ANY event like this be seen as unfolding as it does, without there being a larger conspiracy behind it?  I know this is /conspiracy, but the question, I think is valid.  CAN there be any kind of bombing or attack or mass murder that isn&#39;t controlled by a larger conspiracy?  If so, how would that look differently than this?</p>

<p>Why is it that people like Alex Jones call you a sheep if you believe everything you&#39;re told.  But then you believe everything he says?  (That&#39;s not directed at you specifically, just people who buy into every conspiracy.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Context&quot; and &quot;response&quot;.</p>

<p>Mind you - I have never been a serious conspiracy minded person so I do not have a lot of background in defending my views. However, there are some unknowns to this story currently and at the end of the day, I could be persuaded to believe that it was - as you said - just two crazy kids. That said - what is the context?</p>

<p>What has been going on that could prompt a government to do such a thing? Of course, random terrorism against your own citizens doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense. But if it were part of a bigger picture (the coming collapse of the dollar, militarization of local police forces, gold prices collapsing, gun laws being pushed by the powers that be and popular consent, Russia&#39;s resistance to the Euro, the quickly eroding support for random foreign wars, etc.) then it starts to make sense.</p>

<p>And if this is simply an act of &quot;two crazy kids&quot; then we can simply write it off as that, good job cops, and move on with our lives. There is certainly no reason to believe that random kids are going to start bombing public events - and certainly no reason to alter our lives and laws because of it, right? But if we are next met with a slew of new legislation aimed at &quot;keeping us safe&quot;...</p>

<p>Well - I think you see my point (as to why I see this the way that I do - not that you should agree. I appreciate civil and intelligent disagreement, as you have presented.)</p>

<p>BTW - I never listen to Alex Jones. I can&#39;t stand his voice or his politics for the most part.</p>

<p>The problem here is you&#39;ve placed yourself on one side of the argument based on very little evidence (coincidence), but have demanded overwhelming evidence to convince you otherwise.  It&#39;s the definition of bias.  It&#39;s always good to question authority and the official story, but you are kind of outright refuting the official story BEFORE anyone comes out with it.  </p>

<p>You have made your mind up early on that there is a conspiracy and no amount of evidence to the contrary will ever convince you, and that&#39;s why this sub has become pretty ridiculous lately.</p>

<p>How does it make sense? If they manage to ban reloading powder like 4chan poster says, then what? how does that bring the price of gold back up, or save the flailing US economy?</p>

<p>Something big like 9/11 forces change. These Boston bombs just get everyone excited for a week or two</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yesterday someone linked me to a site where any senator pledged for the control of gun powder accessibility. It seems like he deleted it, I can&#39;t find it in my history. It was an actual date article.</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t the 4chan post posted here before we even knew that they used gun powder for their bombs? I&#39;m not entirely sure.</p>

<p>What really kicks me off is that the state seems to have this cased closed and were not mentioning with one word that there could be more than two suspects, the entirely time. </p>

<p>Then there was up to 4 bombs planted, one of them was confirmed and they did an controlled explosion of that and nowhere is to find that it wasn&#39;t a bomb, the discussion about that just vanished.</p>

<p>It could all be completely true what the news says and we are thinking too much into it, but there could also be the some truth in the conspiracy.</p>

<p>The whole boston lockdown feeled like a big training scenario and a test on how far they can go if they want to. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t know. I coulb be entirely wrong but I don&#39;t want to blindly believe what is said and it is always good to see things in a different light and look for conspiracies until there is enough evidence to debunk it.</p>

<p>If I were the editor of such a thing and would change my plan slightly if I find a script of it on the Internet. </p>

<p>I found something (more funny than everything else) on a conspiracy tard page that I posted in an unedited post and will see tommorow if there is some truth in it. It&#39;s a boy that had visions about it, sadly on a forum where you can edit your posts whenever you want. So, if there is something related to flashes on sunday I will know more.</p>

<p>I for one will stay critical and try to not run with the hivemind because my gut tells me otherwise, even if I look stupid making posts like this, but that&#39;s a strategy I would also use, make everyone look stupid who believes that some of the truth is missing.</p>

If you know even the basics about the weapons law enforcement officials used, then you know they are incapable of firing &quot;dummy bullets&quot; without a blank firing adapter.

    <div class="md"><p>The other questions I have, maybe people can help me clear this up. Yesterday morning didn&#39;t they say they had a suspect in custody yesterday morning around 7 am? What was the story with that?  How come after an exhausted and extensive search and things are wrapping up at one end of the neighborhood, suddenly he&#39;s found in a boat way on the other side of the neighborhood? The car jacked person lives to tell the tale of them saying they&#39;re the bombers.  I&#39;d love to see the video of them setting the bombs off. I&#39;m actually conflicted about the whole thing. I&#39;d really like to hear what he has to say. Like that&#39;ll ever happen. I really believe the local police are on the up and up it&#39;s when the other agencies are involved that my bull shit meter starts going off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well from the news reports, the older brother had a bomb strapped to himself, but no mention that it went off.  And obviously they have not released the dashcam footage. It is amazing how much information we do have at this time.  Many of these crime scenes are probably still roped off.  And it is probably a good thing people weren&#39;t standing outside trying to get cell phone pictures of the chase or more people would be dead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just going to comment on the &quot;hungry acceptance of whatever the MSM is dishing out&quot; part. One of the remarkable things about this whole ordeal is how little control the &quot;MSM&quot; had over the narrative. Social media (for better and worse) drove the storyline throughout nearly the entire event. This thing exposed for all to see that the Internet is making traditional media obsolete. Now the People can go directly to the source for their info. As the events of Thursday night/Friday morning were unfolding, I was listening live to the Boston PD scanner and watching video and reading first-hand accounts from private citizens right there in the heart of it. In other words, the Internet is making it harder and harder for any government to hide anything and heavily diluting the influence of the traditional media on public opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have some basic questions:</p>

<p>What guns did they use? </p>

<p>Where did the gun that &quot;suspect #2&quot;  go that he was using to &quot;exchange gunfire&quot; with the law enforcement with while in the boat before being rendered incapacitated by a <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2011/03/09/swat-officer-killed-by-non-let">flashbang grenade</a>?</p>

<p>Does anyone have video or photos of any devices that were thrown out of the cars at the police by suspect #1 and suspect #2? </p>

<p>Does anyone have any photos or video of the brothers with guns? </p>

<p>Does anyone have any reports of the guns, guns devices or bombs that were used aside from the mangled items the media has allowed us to see?</p>

<p>How does one manage to be shot at in a hail of bullets in a car, and then in a boat, while returning fire and only receive 2 gunshot wounds? </p>

<p>Does the &quot;suspect #2&quot; look like he is &quot;bloody&quot; or &quot;covered in blood&quot; in the released photos when he climbs out of the boat? Or when he was arrested on the ground? </p>

<p>Why did they not shoot anyone except law enforcement personnel? They carjacked people, held people hostage and yet injured no one during this process except law enforcement officers? (aside from the direct injuries resulting from the 4/15 bombs they are accused of having been involved with) </p>

<p>How did the &quot;suspect #2&quot; manage to drive away from a massive shoot out and get lost for another 12 hours requiring a full lockdown and sweeps of the city when there was likely over 200 cops and helicopters in the actual vicinity of the shootout at the time?</p>

<p>How come no one is talking about the saudi national&#39;s, Abdul Rahman Ali Issa Al-Salimi Alharbi, <a href="http://shoebat.com/2013/04/17/innocent-saudi-has-ties-to-several-al-qaeda-terrorists/">ties to aq</a>, his deportation, visit from the whitehouse and special treatments? Or <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/17/usa-saudi-obama-idUSL2N0D42O520130417">the meeting</a> with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal had with an President Obama on syria, or that the president now is requesting to include <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/20/us-syria-130m-military-aid-package">funding for the rebels</a> into the budget?</p>

<p>Just what the heck is going on?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Predicting that they would be captured friday and getting the rest of his post wrong/being generalized is ZERO proof. As someone who works in media/has family in media i have heard no one thinking that they were professional attacks. In fact, from the bombs they did not assume they were &quot;professional&quot; attacks but bombs made at home by domestic terrorists. Because of the history of the week it seemed likely it was a domestic attack instead of a foreign one.</p>

<p>how does one go professional in terrorism? Is the pay good?</p>

If the attacker was found weeks later and everything else was right, no one would be reacting this way. They were assumed to be professionals because they would have to have testing and training in bombs to pull this off successfully. That same training would also assume for them to get away from the area they were targeting, i.e. leave town.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As others have pointed out, I think the 4chan guy just made some good guesses that if you had sat down and thought about it, may have been able to come up with yourself as well.<br/>
Predicts someone wanting tighter gun laws - gun powder specifically?  Ok, gun powder is kind of odd-ball I guess, but so far one guy is pushing for that.  Others will be pushing for tighter gun laws and facing the societal push-back from that soon enough.  Nothing too thought-provoking here.<br/>
Predicts age - late teen to mid-20&#39;s.  Suspect 1 was 26, so that isn&#39;t 100%, but suspect 2 being 19 is.  From what we&#39;ve seen recently of terror acts - school shootings, the Batman movie shooting where the shooter was 24, again, 4chan may have just made a good guess.<br/>
There&#39;s a bunch of other things that should make you question his authority on the matter, such as that he/she claims to be posting it from work.  We all know that most employers can track your actions online, so posting up a government security issue online is a bad move.
So then, if we don&#39;t believe that guy, then why are we here?  Well, this is a really interesting case, we have a guy alive which is increasingly rare.  Usually what will happen is they&#39;ll make him out to a crazy person, or maybe a religious extremist, but because he&#39;s 19 and had a big online presence, he doesn&#39;t seem to be crazy or a religious fanatic (the brother, maybe).  I&#39;ll encourage you to look at and question other aspects of the story and what motives might be behind them.  What emotions were being evoked this week?  How does shutting down an entire city make other people feel about their safety?  Why is it news that suspect 2 gained his US citizenship on September 11, 2011, and what emotions are stirred up?  How did the guy who got his legs blown off (in probably the most famous photo from Monday no less) become a key player in the capture of the suspects?  Why is the family of the suspects making such a bad name for the family?  Why the link to religion?  Why the link to smoking weed?  Homemade explosives?  Is it a distraction from something else - North Korea, CISPA?  Why was the house arrest lifted before the second suspect was in custody?<br/>
Don&#39;t spend any more time praising some kid on 4chan who &quot;totally called it,&quot; because you&#39;re just keeping your eyes shut.  Think for yourself!  So sorry for the novel, this is one of my first posts here, apparently I also had a lot to get off my chest!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right. It could be a complete coincidence/lucky guess. But yet, it made a pseudo-skeptic like myself take a serious look at the other things that you are posting. Who cares if the 4chan post was actually legit - what matters now is what goes on from here.</p>

<p>It made me think - and has made me question - and it made me read your post with attention because these are the very things we should be looking at. It is novel and interesting - a good plot piece in a spy movie. Whether it is true or not is certainly important, but it is the little things like this that catch the eye of people like myself. And then we look in the right direction.</p>

<p>Maybe when enough people are looking in the right direction - whether they&#39;ve stumbled over truth or novelty - something can be done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s a good attitude to have. </p>

<p>Speaking generally though, not specifically about you, we see it again and again here, if a report comes out that conflicts with a conspiracy theory it is picked apart by all these great inquiring minds, but some poorly written, poorly sourced report on some crappy blog comes out in support of the theory, and it&#39;s &quot;Yeah, cool&quot;</p>

<p>That trend, in my opinion is the single most thing which erodes credibility here. The unwillingness to apply the same standards across the board. </p>

I only fear the weight of my own fists once I lose control, once I lose my humanity and mercy gives way to malice as I struggle to crush anyone who tries to stand in my way. No matter what I do I still lose and I am helpless in this way. All I can do is run as fast and as far away from all of this as I can but there&#39;s nowhere to run to. I&#39;m like a caged animal contemplating the sharpness of his own razer-sharp teeth and the brute strength of my jaw. I&#39;ll find a way out of this ... but I&#39;m almost certain it won&#39;t be pretty. Occasionally I look up at the sky and wonder if that isn&#39;t somehow our last best hope ...</p>

<p>They don&#39;t want you to pay attention. They will ignore you if you try to expose the truth. Ask the dead what they think about patriotism ... we&#39;re supposed to believe that if we try and escape that we are cowards. Was Albert Einstein a coward for fleeing Germany? No, and I&#39;ll tell you why: dead people don&#39;t write history books.</p>

<p>Escape while you can and don&#39;t bother to look back. Once you&#39;re safe you&#39;ll see the curse that flew right by you. If you only knew the plans they had for us ...</p>

<p>there were images of them standing together during the event, and there is a picture of them running away from the event with a significant gap between them, with Tamerlan lagging behind and apparently adding another jacket on top of the one he was already wearing.

<p>1)&quot;Pin this event  on a male late teen to early 20&#39;s&quot; -- in fact the FBI has pinned the event on two males one that fits this age range and one that doesn&#39;t.  The one that doesn&#39;t (Tamerlan aged 26) is currently being promoted as the &quot;mastermind&quot; behind the plot and his brother just followed him.</p>

<p>2)&quot;...say he did because he was unstable&quot;  ... I have heard no mention of any mental illness or severe depression, but its still early.</p>

<p>3) &quot;They are going to find firearms and NRA materials in his home&quot;....I havent heard any guns being found in their residence nor any NRA material.  They also don&#39;t really fit the assumed profile of an NRA supporter.</p>

<p>4) &quot;they are going to say he used reloading powder for the explosion&quot;....Haven&#39;t heard this anywhere.  </p>

<p>5) &quot;Raid issued to occur on Friday.&quot; ...The suspects photos and name were released on Thursday, presumably the authorties had already raided their last known address before this release.  </p>

<p>We&#39;re losing. They&#39;re winning.</p>

<p>Actually, it just seems that way.  if you look at the number of active users on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> vs the active users on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> (not the subscribed number), you&#39;ll note that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is increasing.  A vast number of people are beginning to question official stories.  It&#39;s not the end game for the truth movement, it&#39;s an end game for the existing power structures.  Don&#39;t worry about those with their heads buried in the sand.  They will not matter as they are only dead weight with opinions.  Those that are awake are either waking up others, or are actively doing things to change the system.  Just ask yourself... what&#39;s more powerful:  1 person doing something to change the world, or 10 that want the government to do something?</p>

<p>Also, it is not a do or die prospect for those of us looking to expose the truth.  It&#39;s getting to be a do or die prospect for those seeking to stop the truth from getting out.  All we have to do is to continue to expose the lies.  Those trying to garner more power have to become more violent and creative to cover their tracks.  The problem is, that each time they try some shit, those of us who are awake are getting better at exposing them, and giving us more ammo to expose the corruption.</p>

<p>In short, don&#39;t disrepair, and don&#39;t get violent.  We are actually winning this game.  The only thing we have to worry about is that those trying to pull the strings will get so desperate that they may try to do something incredibly vicious to cover their tracks.  But even then, they will not win.</p>

<p>As George Carlin said, &quot;You don&#39;t have rights, you have temporary privelages&quot;. If you think you have rights go ask Japanese Americans circa WWII.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here is an early <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152778880075249">video that was released about the &#39;chase&#39; -- shooting (via FB)</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note the uploader&#39;s name: </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Red Boston</em></p>

<p>From his feed we can suspect he&#39;s a promoter of some sort</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note the activity on his facebook feed from earlier in the day:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was tagged for an event called <strong><em>BOSTON BROTHER&#39;S</em></strong> promotion: <strong>STORYVILLE</strong>; occuring on Thursday April 18, 2013 </p>

<p>-- this guy is the one that first released &#39;evidence&#39; about the story of one of the <em>Brothers</em> apparently being gunned down...huge coincidence, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Final observation with regards to the video: </p>
</blockquote>

<p>there&#39;s <strong>heavy</strong> machine gun fire then they yell &quot;let me see your hands&quot; ... did they really miss the guy, just like in the Hollywood movies?</p>

<p>People seem to believe the whole story because of the tremendous levels of suspense and thrill it seemed offer, just like the shit they&#39;ve gotten used to seeing @ the movies...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI/CIA keep tabs on all of us, ESPECIALLY suspected foreign (or naturalized, as is the case here) radicals. An interview with mama Tsarnaev revealed that she had been approached by the FBI years ago - they said they were &quot;worried&quot; about her son, who seemed to have leadership qualities that can inspire radicals to do fucked up shit like this. Not sure how long exactly, but I think he&#39;s close/right on the 5. But had they been following him, wouldn&#39;t they have been able to recognize him without releasing photos publicly? Wouldn&#39;t several photos of him be in some database somewhere?</p>
