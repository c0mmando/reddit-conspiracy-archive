       All my posts have been buried. Every post questioning the Special Ops guys on site are being thrashed by hundreds of accounts that are downvoting, not necessarily commenting anymore. They were getting to obvious. But down voting doesn't require commenting, so I suspect that is happening.

       AKA Craft International are signifiganly more suspicious than these two children. we have photos of them wearing earpieces, carrying radiation detection equipment, and they just appear to be watching as the bomb blows up. They aren't helping people, clearing debris, just standing around like goons.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have also seen zero evidence that these kids did anything. No videos that they murdered an MIT officer, no videos or proof that they shot guns and threw bombs at police during a chase. Zero fucking evidence yet people are saying "where is the evidence that they are innocent???"
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought it was innocent until proven guilty. Guess things work a bit different here in Nazi Gestapo America 2013.

       I'm not trying to say that it's not Craft International but... how many different organizations have 9.11 tactical clothing as their uniforms and wear black baseball caps with logos (logos aren't particularly clear in the photos.) Not trying to disprove just encourage the thought that maybe these guys aren't who others think they are.  In regards to them not helping out there are a million reasons why that may be.  First and foremost that comes to mind is they were unsure if this was an IED explosion or something further in those first initial moments.  If they're there for say a WMD threat then they're going to need to stay available to counter a possible WMD attack that may lie in wait from a secondary device.  Once again I'm not saying that you're wrong just trying to point out that maybe there's a logical explanation, if this forum is all about critical and free thinking we should accept critical and free thinking that is contrary to our own from either view point.

       To be fair, the original post was fairly disingenuous.
      </p>
      <p>
       They showed a cropped pic of the two guys, pointing out the bags they had in comparison to those found at the scene.

      <p>
       It was
       <em>

       inferred that this was a pre-blast pic.  The full picture was post-blast, and they had the bags.

       Is it weird that these guys were there? Somewhat.  Is it worth asking questions? Absolutely.  Was the post disingenuous? 100% yes.

       I found it funny that when the craft photos were released it wasn't very long before the FBI released the photos of the two suspects with absolutely no video or photos to support there claims.

      <p>
       Then the sub reddit or thred that was excepting photos of the event/disaster the OP stated that he will not except any more photos and delete anything that wasn't the two suspects, not sure if he did delete everything as people were pissed about the idea.

       Why would these guys wear the hats? I don't understand. These people are not stupid, why would they dress men up in uniforms and make them wear an identifying hat to commit a terrorist attack, when they know there are cameras all around.

       If they were going to do that, why not do it in a more divided state? Like North Carolina or Flordia. A state that is 50/50 ideological wise. Why do it in one of the most liberal states in the country. The headlines are not going to be as good.

       These Craft guys interact with the FBI lady, firemen and police officers right after the bombing. They were suppose to be there. What if the suspects were asked by the FBI to participe in the drills by dumping backpacks filled with nothing special. Dropped just for the dogs to sniff out as part of the drill? The Spec Ops drop real bombs. Remove themselves from the site. Detonate the bombs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three days later they plant bombs around the neighborhood surrounding the guys. They then plaster pictures of these guys carrying backpacks to the bomb site.

       The guy wasn't making much sense and had no sources other than 4chan.  Then he tells people to go to infowars.com. I don't trust infowars, they make there money by telling bizarre stories about how every damn thing is a cover up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only suspicious thing about this case is the fact the feds seemed to know who these guys were days before the story leaked.

       OK, fair call but, why were they the only ones with backpacks? huge ones it that, also they look nothing like

       Quote from page you linked us to "Here with a backpack that looks identical to those of the uniformed men in Boston:"

      <p>
       Again how did they know to move away form ground zero shortly before the the device was detonated?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly why were they walking away from the blast zone when all the rest of the CST that were showing up to help, were moving toward the blast zone. lots of questions and no answers?

         They were not the only people with bags, lots of people with them. Every suspect 4chan identified( the guy in blue jacket and white hat, the 40 year old dude I'm a red shirt, craft guys) had one that looked similar.

         There is no proof that they knew to move, maybe they were just lucky. They were pretty close to the explosion when it happened if I remember right, alot closer then I would personally want to be if I knew a bomb was about to go off.

         That picture does not prove they were walking away. They look stationary and grouped around that Chevy.

       Sorry, but i would like to point out that you also are just speculating about the purposed craft operatives being the CST.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it totally not possible that the craft operatives were in CST uniforms knowing they were going to be there that day as to not look out of place?

       I'm not saying you are wrong I'm just throwing questions at reddit about photos that were taken on the day that to me look a little suspicious and need solid answers, where as some people will have nothing to do with any of it unless it points toward the two suspects the FBI gave us.

       Sorry blip blip but im pretty confused by your response. I think your missing question marks or have added words. IDK, if your agreeing with me or not really.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is totally possible that those guys, who we have been refering to as the craft guys(with no proof they are actually craft as many companies use th elogo), dressed the way they did to blend in. Doing that proves nothing though. There are a multitude of reasons to blend in at an event. Both to not draw attention from the people they are trying to watch for or as to be able to set bombs off without being noticed could be valid reasons. Being dressed that way does not prove either though.

       Sorry, i was suffering comprehension issues at the time. I reread your post and in my original reading of your post i was under the impression that you were hard line against any possibility of conspiracy, my bad. Also I did forget to add some question marks.
      </p>
      <p>
       In saying that when somebody states that there is no proof to a question in a place that is designed for conspiracies and answers alone, it sort of a moot statement because we know there is no proof, that is why we ask the hard questions in the first place.

       I can't edit on phone but rebooked at your picture. Men from the group appear to be walking both ways. So are many others in the crowd though. These guys look military and therefore wouldn't be the most useful At the bomb site where they needed medics the most. If anything I would want them looking around for more suspicious activity instead of standing around.

       i'd like to see this posted here in this sub. I've read comments of people claiming they are Navy Seals team 5, and military contractors, and their backpacks are the ones containing the bombs, etc...

       I personally don't think Glen Beck is the most rational of conspiracy theorists.  I also think he has a reputation as an alarmist and a crazy person.

      <p>
       He is far from the best person for rationally exposing the censorship of media or other grand things which people are inclined to write off as crazy.

       Yeah, training killers is not funny, that's the same as the terrorist cells training people to kill, is it not, Its just that craft are used to kill people outside of America and now quit possibly within America as well.

       It is very much a possibility my friend. With the authorities/FBI in complete denial on the subject and absolutely no evidence other that the two brothers just walking along in photos just like everybody else, it does beg to question. Then they spend tens of millions on trying to find people that they already had in custody(
       <a href="http://farganne.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/tsarnaevs-arrest-location-faked/">
        as far as i can tell
       </a>
       ) (also there was a video of the what looked like the older brother in custody, which i can no longer find) with a fake ass story of how they were on the run the way they locked down entire suburbs whilst invading into peoples homes at gun point. It all smacks of a coverup.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one need hard evidence before i can give myself a green light, and atm i haven't seen or heard one iota of real evidence against the brothers, i have only seen evidence to indicate that this is some sort of cover up/false flag operation.

       It definitely wouldn't be the first time a gov't did that. Operacion Verdad in Cuba literally hinged on employing people to infiltrate blogs/websites/etc. and masquerade as civilians. They would actually craft comments to discredit dissent and wanted to make people perceive that the majority of Cubans were in agreement with gov't policies.
