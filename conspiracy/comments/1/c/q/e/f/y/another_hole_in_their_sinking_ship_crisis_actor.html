        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok maybe someone is already onto this ... but I just found it accidentally:</p>

<p>The guy &quot;Paul Sutherland&quot; from interview on FOX25 today [he witnessed gunshots and the police response] is none other than:</p>

<p>HARLEY GUY, yeah the witness from FOX on 9/11. Listen to their voices. He&#39;s trying poorly to hide it, and he&#39;s aged some. But his energy and DOUCHE BAG INTERPRETATION of what &quot;ordinary people&quot; talk like FAIL again:</p>

<p>Harley guy interview: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edrTAh36Do8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edrTAh36Do8</a></p>

<p>Paul Sutherland interview: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FhNFTj5fr8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FhNFTj5fr8</a></p>

<p>Doubled up for fun...easy comparison: <a href="http://www.youtubedoubler.com/?video1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DedrTAh36Do8&amp;start1=55&amp;video2=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7FhNFTj5fr8&amp;start2=11&amp;authorName=">http://www.youtubedoubler.com/?video1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DedrTAh36Do8&amp;start1=55&amp;video2=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7FhNFTj5fr8&amp;start2=11&amp;authorName=</a></p>

<p>Other similarities...in both he makes certain things clear that most people would never say, &quot;im a resident...i witnessed...i think he was in a boat...&quot; etc. other inside knowledge/loaded rhetoric</p>

<p>ALSO:
&quot;Paul Sutherland was born in Toronto, Canada December 7, 1930 and died in Toronto, Canada May 15, 2004 from a heart attack. Paul was the co creator of &quot;Tales of the Riverbank&quot;. He produced the first series with his partner David Ellison, in 1959. Wikipedia&quot; ---- recycled identities?</p>

<p>They were not expecting to have to call in Harley guy! But he stepped up and gave us clues yet again. He reported the boat before the police released the info!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a troll, I&#39;m just calling you out. I went though your post history, and you clearly have an agenda, and aren&#39;t willing to listen to opposing view points. You&#39;re either an absolutist, which is akin to being willfully retarded, or, you&#39;re on reddit for reasons other than entertainment, education, and the like. I&#39;ll say it again, you have an agenda. </p>

<p>I guess perhaps I&#39;m just jealous of you, truthfully. I had dreams of making it big in the government/military myself, but my genetics put a grinding halt to that. </p>

<p>At least do us a favor, and just admit that you and your ilk are here for &quot;damage control&quot;, and that you&#39;re here to ensure subservience to the State; something with which I have no problem with, by the way. However, I have a caveat to giving myself to the State, well, two: 1) Our uniforms aren&#39;t nearly cool enough for a Fascist State; 2) I just want the government to come out and me to bow down, I would respect that much more. </p>

<p>There you go, faggatron. How much leave do you have built up? You should burn a few weeks in some place nice for me, won&#39;t cha, please? </p>

<p>Kisses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a troll either.  I&#39;m a user of reddit.  My only agenda is that people stop spreading moronic factoids they learned from pictures posted on 4chan or any other unverified source.  I am no longer in the government and while it exposed me to the world of intelligence agencies and foreign policy, it never made me an outright pawn.  I just hate it when people are second guessing why a guy isn&#39;t bleeding enough when his leg is blown off.  Or he doesn&#39;t have a big enough look of horror.  They post pictures of military with their legs blown off and claim he&#39;s acting and it gets upvotes.  It&#39;s beyond ridiculous and borderline offensive to all of those who have ever really seen what trauma looks like up close.  Where the smells and the sounds vastly outweigh the sensory of sight.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s sickening to see conspiracy theory turn into a subculture of anyone who is unhappy with their lives and wants to blame it on something bigger.  They smoke weed and fail to realize how paranoia affects their thinking, connecting dots that aren&#39;t really there.  Delusions, if you will.  i have been close to some truth and boy is it eye opening but if there are masters of manipulation, they already thought ahead in how they would manipulate the crowd that wouldn&#39;t accept the official story.  They&#39;d give them the pipe dream they&#39;re looking for and call it a day.</p>

<p>Perception is reality.  Stop giving in to group think and learn how to use google and the dark net for truth... not personal gain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. They have SCORES of identities &quot;on-tap&quot;. This is their JOB.</p>

<p>Did you ever see him in Watertown? It&#39;s pretty easy to create &quot;some kind&quot; of trail for a person. They never expected to have to use this Paul Sutherland guy in the fashion that they did. And the holes in the story prove it.  </p>

<p>What kind of &quot;oil company&quot; has that many social media profiles, but 0 facebook fans and no website? fake!</p>

<p>Look up &quot;persona management&quot; and what was exposed by Anonymous about HBGary and federal research into social networks.</p>

<p>Create cover-ups of cover-ups. And they have to be believable. They know people won&#39;t usually question a facebook profile, twitter profile, or a reddit commentor of 1+ years and some post history. </p>

<p>But you will find patterns in these personas! They are all stereotypical &quot;people&quot; with generic interests and relationships.  They pay their lowly slaves to man some accounts (aka. the &#39;master&#39; personas) and troll forums where dialogue is taking place. Arent we all tired of these trolls and their upvoting/downvoting slaves?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or perhaps i&#39;m a college student from Michigan and Paul Sutherland is just a guy from Waterville who they talked to on the news. </p>

<p>Everything isn&#39;t a conspiracy.  The government doesn&#39;t post to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  Saying such nonsense only hurts your cause and makes you seem crazy.</p>
