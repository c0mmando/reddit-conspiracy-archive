    <div class="md"><p>Sure, everyone makes mistakes, politicians lie, etc.</p>

<p>But in my experience, conspiracy theorists are in a class by themselves, in these ways:</p>

<p>1- Every CT I&#39;ve met has claimed to know the &quot;real truth&quot; about EVERY possible conspiracy.  Not credible.</p>

<p>2- Every CT I&#39;ve met escalates the denial of every fact.  They claim something, I give a countering fact, they say my source is &quot;part of the conspiracy&quot;.  Ad infinitum.  BBC, NPR, US govt, UK govt, individual reporters, web sites, whatever.  If it disagrees with them, it&#39;s not credible, or part of the conspiracy, or both.</p>

<p>3- Every CT I&#39;ve met ascribes great skill and cunning to orgs that we can SEE screwing up every day.  They claim US govt is able to hide aliens and alien tech for 50 years.  Heck, US govt wasn&#39;t able to keep someone from selling names of our agents in Russia for $1M or so.  Our biggest secret, and they couldn&#39;t keep it !</p>

<p>4- Every CT I&#39;ve met thinks the &quot;US govt&quot; or &quot;scientists&quot; or &quot;Big Pharma&quot; or whatever is a monolith.  As if there aren&#39;t layers of govt, different agencies, different officials all trying to stab each other in the back every day, or competing for positions or jurisdiction or budget money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You discovered the difference between conspiracy culture and actve skepticism. </p>

<p>Many people who are &quot;awake&quot; are just as &quot;asleep&quot; as those they try to elevate themselves above, they just follow a different narrative. </p>

<p>One (of many) examples is illuminati. Thus is a christians fave as it sets the world up in a glorious good vs evil battle where satan-worshipping corpratacracy is slowly self destructing by bringing about the apocolypse. </p>

<p>To the skeptic this is inane, but the the CTC seeking confirmation bias through their religion, it is the barebones reality of the world, and questioning the iluminati is a hairs breadth from questioning god himself.</p>

<p>Edit: #2 is the worst and aliens are very very very rarely featured here. </p>

Things like that don&#39;t happen.&quot; Now, I don&#39;t buy in to all of the conspiracy theories there are, but one thing is for sure: The government of the United States has used false flag attacks before, of which we have proof, in order to declare war on foreign nations. The motives were not for the benefit of our country or our people. The tides have changed, but history remains the same. That alone is enough to warrant vigilance and critical thinking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never forget? Note that I&#39;m disproving you but the only thing that happened were two engagements, neither having resulted in the deaths of U.S. sailors. </p>

<p>First was confirmed to be North Vietnamese torpedo boats attacking a U.S. destroyer Maddox in open waters, which was repelled by both the destroyer and jets from the U.S.S. Ticonderoga and resulted in the deaths of just North Vietnamese sailors.This attack was confirmed by photos and testimony of those on the Maddox and Ticonderoga and North Vietnam itself.</p>

<p>Second was &quot;Tonkin Ghosts&quot; incident, false radar images that the Maddox and Turner Joy both fired on guided by radar under heavy weather as they believed were more NVA boats attacking and believe they&#39;ve sunk. This was obviously false but still exploited enough by the Johnson Administration in order to send us into the Vietnam war.</p>

<p>Bingo, I do not wish to to base my life on any &quot;workable &quot;truth&quot;&quot;, because that is dogmatism.</p>

These guys represent the far, far right wing in the U.S.- fascists. They took power in the assassination of Kennedy in &#39;63, and it matters little who&#39;s in the Oval Office- the &quot;militaryindustrial complex&quot; interests are running the show. We should stop believing every word these &quot;authorities&quot; say because they&#39;re psychopaths and liars at the highest level. The honest people who are in there don&#39;t get very far; see for instance Colleen Rowley, who was pulled off investigating Bin Laden pre-9/11. We should believe an average Joe on the street <em>much more</em> than we should believe what U.S. intel/police says; that&#39;s just common sense based in history. At the absolute least, we shouldn&#39;t treat it as the automatic truth, like almost everyone does. Just because the media says that this is what the cops/FBI says *does not mean it is the truth.&quot; Think for ourselves.</p>

<p>Maybe it is true that this kind of thinking can lead to complacency, however that conclusion is as little contains as little Truth as any other Truth. Always is a long time.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There is no Truth in mathematical truths. Only truths which conform to the axioms of the specific branch being practised. We did not discover 2 + 2 = 4. nor is it a basic Truth. It is the logical conclusion that can be made after accepting the defintions of &#39;1&#39; and &#39;addition&#39;. These definitions of &#39;1&#39; and addition are useful, along with many other definitions, for describing this macroscopic amalgamation of energies that we can interact with (what we call the universe), and constructing models that behave in accordance with this universe.</p>

<p>However this is getting all a little too philosophical (which i realise is my bad). Back to the social sciences, my point was that everybody lies constantly, We consciously lie to each other, We subconsciously lie to each other, We subconsciously lie to ourselfs. 
The reasons behind any event can never be fully known since even the people behind those events probably don&#39;t even know the True reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re missing the key component here. That is evidence. I have never seen a credible &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; and you will never see a single social science say anything without evidence. You can tell the difference, if you really tried. One such difference is the publisher, if it&#39;s not attached to a college press or noteworthy press, chances are it&#39;s bullshit. If they have no primary sources (either they said it, wrote it, or you have picture evidence) chances are it&#39;s bullshit. There also needs to be a way for you to find said evidence. Too many people read popular history or mainstream crap as it where and think it is the truth. For instance do you really think Bill O&#39;Riley wrote an accurate protrayal of history in his books? Know the difference. Conspiracy nuts are exactly that nuts. They have no validity or credibility. </p>

<p>Nope not even close. This was his <strong>career</strong>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m going to need a reference to where that&#39;s known exactly.</p>

<p>Going to need an elucidation on this rather than an opaque reference.</p>

<p>In the meantime there&#39;s a book full of minutes, tables and minutiae unveiling the all too simple nature of our respective empires: Acquiring control into an exclusive mandarin class, the retention of capital and influence, and the exercise of control and influence.</p>

<p>This is simple History, it simply happened. The fact you don&#39;t like the simplicity of our own pasts has no bearing on the facts and fortunately it isn&#39;t for you to whitewash the entirety of the written records of man, indeed we could only do with more people of such cunning yet egalitarian nature as Quigley exposing how a <strong>hyper wealthy</strong> few have employed entire nations into shitty jobs they&#39;ve settled for as opposed to seeking the fulfilment of their own creative potential.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazon reviews are great for fiction books, horrible for academic books. All you would have to do is hope onto JSTOR and search for book reviews on anyone of his books. Amazon reviews are like Wikipedia. I will explain this once, I am a history major political science minor in college right now, so yes I do have access to a lot of sources.  </p>

<p>This ranging from the 60&#39;s all the way through the 80&#39;s different reviewers from different decades all generally say the same thing. Simplistic analysis, convoluted, and unnecessary. Often they only cite bits and pieces of the book as having any worth to further academic study. </p>

<p>I could sit here an explain how the American&#39;s have built up new Jim Crow laws, I could even explain the Nazi movement and who voted for who, I can explain most of the history to US foreign policy, to include US aid and development and so on. The difference here is, I evaluate a source before using it or even reading it. Just because it&#39;s in a book and just because a person has a degree behind them does not mean the book is any good. Much less trust the strength of the book to some online rating. To reuse the Wiki reference it&#39;s like writing a paper or argument based off a Wikipedia positing. </p>

<p>My look into reviews on the book and the sources and the fact it was published privately suggests its probably not credible. </p>

<p>I want to stress that I don&#39;t doubt your personal capacities in the slightest, and I welcome that you&#39;re using them to adjust what might seem like fanaticism on my part.</p>

<p>The fact that you bring up aid and development is excellent. It seems everyone wants to paint western governments as almost wholly self interested and malevolent, either completely ignoring offices for foreign aid or presuming ulterior motives and long leashes.</p>

<p>However if you could link me to what you&#39;re talking about exactly that would be great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Foreign Aid as Foreign Policy by Jeffrey F. Taffet, Aiding Violence by Peter Urvin, George Bush&#39;s Foreign Aid: Transformation or Chaos? by Carol Lancaster. These are some books I can think of off hand, and they were required reading, I am in no way suggesting they are 100% correct in their argument. In fact, in some instances I disagree with Jeffery Sachs, especially &#39;shock therapy&#39; Sachs. The MCC Sachs is still up for review. There&#39;s also two types of aid at least in my book, that is Government Aid and NGO aid. Government aid typically mirrors our foreign policy which has ADHD. If you want to read a guilt trip book read The Life You Can Save by Peter Singer. Some of these might even be considered &#39;popular&#39; history, there is much literature on the history of development. </p>

<p>The place someone teaches or taught has almost zero effect on how I weigh a source. I base it solely on the work before me, sometimes you get someone who has a reputation and often times fall into a rut where their reputation can carry shitty scholarship. </p>

<p>Also, sometimes the truth is right in line with what we already want to happen or what is already convenient.</p>

<p>Second, what many people call a lie I would often state is just a different view on the same issue.  A lot of these are complex issues and there is a wide margin of acceptable and reasonable opinion.</p>

<p>Also, it seems many conspiracy fans will not accept credible sources.   I have a personal friend who was witness to the flight 77 flying over and crashing into the pentagon.  Him and several hundred are on record as witnesses.  He has received nothing but hate and venom from others.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are jumping conclusions here. I do not care what you think and my intention is not to indoctrinate anyone or to win you over. Who told you otherwise? It is in your own interest to become a well informed adult and to use and understand at least one language properly. I tried to help you out, but you are not interested in reading the links I gave you.</p>

<p>Edit: OP was simply pointing out the similarities between scientific methods and so called conspiracy theories. Only the latter has negative connotations because it is politicaly charged. Here is a quote from the scientist page of wikipedia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Scientists are the people who <strong>ask a question about a phenomenon</strong> and proceed to systematically go about <strong>answering the question themselves</strong>. They are by nature <strong>curious, creative and well organized</strong>. They need to have the ability to <strong>observe something</strong> and <strong>see in it some of the properties other people overlook</strong>.&quot;</p>
