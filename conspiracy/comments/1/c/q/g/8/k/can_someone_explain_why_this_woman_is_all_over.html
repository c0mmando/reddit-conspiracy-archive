        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">77</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-04-20 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Alienm00se.html">Alienm00se</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I first noticed her in the original CNN coverage back at the beginning of the week. She is the middle-aged brunette at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=SMY8hlrCIoA#t=28s">0:31</a>. I thought nothing of it until I saw her <em>again</em> here almost a week later in a completely different part of Boston talking about a totally separate event in the case that she supposedly also witnessed.</p>

<p>You can find her at 0:12 on the video attached to this article <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/20/us/boston-attack/index.html?hpt=hp_t1">here</a> (sorry, CNN doesn&#39;t allow you to link to the specific time stamp.)</p>

<p>Am I wrong? Are these different women? Their facial features: nose, mouth, eyebrow shape, aswell as their voice are identical. I am not necessarily saying this means the whole thing is a fraud, but CNN has not been above inventing news or modifying reports for their own ends, and it is entirely plausible to me they might have hired this woman (and potentially others like her) to embellish their reporting. Although they risk getting caught in this as many of you reported after Newtown and Aurora; the method to their madness could be that it would be an enormous embarrassment if it ever leaked that this was a practice in the infotainment &quot;news&quot; industry and therefore they would need to keep the pool of actors small in order to limit the potential for leaks.</p>

<p>Have any of you seen this woman anywhere else? Can anyone identify her? Do you know of other incidents of the same people being interviewed for being witnesses to completely separate events in the Boston Marathon Attacks, particularly by CNN?</p>

<p><strong>Edit: CNN has altered the video on their site - will try to find the original</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit 2: Special Thanks to u/muondragon for finding the <a href="http://cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/us/2013/04/20/nat-pkg-boston-bomb-search.cnn.html">original</a> once again!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit 3: Special thanks to u/7777773 for posting <a href="http://vimeo.com/63602119">this</a> video showing how different lighting can alter facial features; even making a person appear radically older or younger depending on position, intensity and color</strong></p>

Their thickness, shape and everything is different.</p>

<p>Lips, again different.</p>

<p>As for her nose, you can only see one side of it in that video and only see it front on in the other video.
You can see that the nose of the first woman is visibly flatter and wider than the second video.</p>

<p>Then you get to the voice, it&#39;s completely different.
You guys are just seeing things where you want to see them.</p>

<p>The only thing they have that would lead me to believe they were the same person is the necklace they both have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The eyebrows are cut exactly the same. In fact her left eyebrow has a district sharp cut down to where it thins in both pictures, where the right has a gentle slope. </p>

<p>The nose is the same. Of course we notice a bit more flairing in one, because you know... Possible irritant of the dust and debris in the air. Same for the voice. It&#39;s not unusual, in fact its quite normal, for someone voice becoming very raspy when they are breathing in toxic air. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are crisis actors. You should expect to see them at any major event. They&#39;re used to make sure the public hears what the people behind all these events want them to hear. For example, the crisis actors used during 9/11 near the pentagon would constantly reiterate &#39;It was a plane!&#39; &#39;It was a plane!&#39;, so when you&#39;re average minded person is confronted with the possibility that a plane never hit the pentagon they immediately dismiss it because they recall hearing said phrases over and over during the event.</p>

<p>EDIT: listen closely to the CNN video, 2 people both saying the same thing (gunshots, 3 booms/bangs) within 5 seconds of each other.</p>

<p>EDIT: I assuming there trying to emphasize that the supposed scenario where both suspects were firing and throwing explosives at the police actually took place as no solid evidence proves it even happened, only the testimonies of these &#39;witnesses&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about that logically though. </p>

<p>She &quot;was there&quot; at the original explosions in downtown Boston having lunch at a nearby restaurant. Okay, thats fine.</p>

<p>Then she &quot;was there&quot; a week later to hear the gunshots as they attempted to arrest the man who supposedly planted that bomb in the first place.</p>

<p>She doesn&#39;t bother to mention how weird is that she happened to be in both places, she doesnt even give her name. If she wanted to tell her story, wouldn&#39;t she talk about how crazy it was that she was right there on the front lines as the news was breaking? Or about how satisfying it was after the fear of the first day to watch in come full circle at the end?</p>

<p>As to a/v differences, you have to realize the second clip is much higher quality than the first. Lower resolution, worse lighting, background noise and other factors contribute to there being slight differences in her voice tone and the illumination patterns of her face.</p>

<p>If you listen to her inflections and compare/contrast specific features in both clips, you&#39;ll find they are identical.</p>

I guess if you want to believe they are the same person you wont be convinced otherwise.</p>

<p>Stranger things have happened, ever heard of Tsutomu Yamaguchi?</p>

<p>It&#39;s highly likely that she would have come in from where she lives to watch the marathon and eat and then unfortunately the bombers headed in her direction to retreat.</p>

If it was the same person twice (Which you seem dead cert on) she could have very well talked about being in both of those places, but it could have been edited out due to time constraints or not containing information that they wanted.</p>

<p>But then again maybe the people in the videos don&#39;t comment on being in both places because they were in fact different people.</p>
