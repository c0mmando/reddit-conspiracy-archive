    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s a baby currency.  the market hasn&#39;t settled on a long-term value yet, and thus, it is still volatile.  the fact that last week&#39;s problems didn&#39;t kill the currency (BTC is still around $100 USD apiece...) is further testament to the longevity of bitcoin.  the difference between bitcoin and our current system of fiat bank notes is that in order to control the value of bitcoin, you have to own close to 50% of the market share.  possible, but not probable.  bitcoin isn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s a hell of a lot closer to being perfect than the IMF and Fed printing money out of thin air, loaning it to us, then getting it back with interest after they&#39;ve reduced the value through more controlled inflation.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is a dangerous fiction that will continue to lose people money in the bitcoin market. Do you think that this most recent drop was instigated by someone that had 50% share of the market? NO. It was instigated by players that together owned a partial share in the market and look what happened.</p>

<p>The simple truth is that bitcoin&#39;s mortal weakness is it&#39;s tie-in with a fiat currency system. As long as that&#39;s true, any sufficient level of fiat currency can move the market around by the nose. Last week was a (successful) test of that. </p>

<p>Expect more of the same. It has all the earmarkings of the algorithms/people that game the fiat market. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bitcoins that you mine yourself are very untraceable.  Virgin Bitcoins will go for a premium someday if Bitcoin stays around.</p>

<p>I believe that crytographic currency has a strong future.  I find it unlikely that the first successful implementation will survive all of the technical hurdles.  There is one very obvious roadblock to Bitcoin and that is that the block chain that registers the transactions will grow to the magnitude of 1TB or so within 10 years if Bitcoin does in fact become popular.  This means that every device that uses Bitcoin will need to store 1TB of records but it seems like that file size might be irrelevant in the future.  It seems likely that the file size will grow faster than storage technology though if Bitcoin is in fact popular.  Unless hoards of clever PhDs solve these problems Bitcoin could be swamped once it has cemented itself as something that is long term viable.  For these reasons I find it somewhat likely that the source code will be incompatibly branched into a new direction that solves these problems.  Then that new cryptographic currency would no longer be a &quot;Bitcoin&quot; but a new creation that would face many of the same struggles that Bitcoin now faces.</p>

<p>All of these computer scientists are going to need to take quite a bit more economics classes across Keynesian to Kayek.  I&#39;m unsure if implementing a hard coin limit into the currency is completely ideal.  Now that all of the math is out there and being circulated there will be much more discussion about the ideal qualities of money.  Personally I feel a slight bit of inflation in the currency might end up being very ideal if everyone can participate in that inflation somehow.  Perhaps the inflation is tied to total participation or velocity of money.  These are all serious questions worthy of doctorate papers.  I suspect that there will be dozens of new Bitcoin specialist PhDs over the next ten years or so.</p>

<p>tl;dr In short I believe that cryptographic currency still requires another major breakthrough.  I don&#39;t believe that a Bitcoin in its current form is something that would be there to hand down to my children.</p>

<p>That was the intrinsic idea behind BitCoin, and what can now be seen as its chief weakness.  The volatility in the value of BitCoins can be at least partially be attributed to the fact that there aren&#39;t very many of them.</p>

<p>But an idea, once going mainstream, is hard to kill.  Decentralized crypto-cash is not going away.  It simply does, as you suggest, require a better economic model.</p>

<p>Because based on your argument for Bitcoin. You are more than likely a con man trying to get people to have faith in a virtual currency that is volatile, and therefore does not have any tangible asset of value for trade. Bitcoin, and their proponents are nothing more than the same flim flam artists that got people to invest in with the likes of Kenneth Lay, Madoff, Ebbers etc...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been around for 5 decades and built my retirement from savings to investment in restaurant establishments. I&#39;ve heard and seen it all, and you are a proponent of such Bitcoin con man investing, and no doubt probably have your little nest egg invested hoping others will follow suit. Then when it comes time to pay. You will have nothing to pay them with, and with you and other originals of Bitcoin laughing with an offshore account calling everyone a sucker. Therefore  you are a shill. </p>

<p>Toward all others out there thinking of investing such. I warn you that you will get burned with this crap. Take it or leave the advice. I have no time for fools with their money.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem to begin with. It has no worth. It has no value of trade. It&#39;s is not oil or precious metal or food or water or even real estate which is what resources that countries need to trade with. No country is going to recognize such. Tell me when you come into my store to buy food. Why should I trade for a bitcoin? Understand? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i dunno if you&#39;re being sarcastic or not.  honestly since gold has hit a 2 year low, now is the time to buy.  if you think the value of gold is going to stay this low and the value of the US dollar is going to stay this high you&#39;re not paying attention to enough variables.  </p>

<p>Just think.  If someone had actually listened to you and your &quot;buy now&quot; advice yesterday, <a href="http://goldprice.org/">they&#39;d only have lost $138 an oz.</a></p>

<p>But hey, it&#39;s sure to go up TOMORROW, right?  Ron Paul said that hyperinflation was going to be hitting us ANY DAY NOW.   So invest now! $10,000/oz prices are right around the corner!</p>

<p>Ron said so!  And when it comes to gold prices, who can you trust regarding gold prices and the threat of inflation more than a guy that has most of his fortune invested in gold mines?  </p>

<p>Buy now!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>are you stupid, or just trolling?</p>

<p>the dollar&#39;s buying power is steadily dropping.  look at everything from gas prices to dollar menu fast food.  the federal reserve creates $85billion PER DAY to buy up bad debt.  how could you not realize that pumping this much currency into the economy will eventually result in hyper inflation?  this is the way it&#39;s worked for every single economy who&#39;s solution to debt was to print more money.  if you deny this you deny every example history has to offer us. </p>

<p>Crude Oil is down, Gold is down, silver is down, many other investments and commodities are down.  By God, you&#39;re right.  Absolute proof of the dollar is in free-fall with no sign of recovery.</p>

<p>But hey, what do I know.  I don&#39;t own any gold mines.</p>

<p>You (and Ron Paul) are obviously right.  So why not pick up some gold and let us know what price you got in at?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>gold is at it&#39;s lowest price in 2 years.  2 years.  that means if you bought gold in 2009 and sold it today, even after the dive, you still would have made a profit.  but whatever, time will be the tell, if gold continues to drop and the dollar stabilizes i&#39;ll eat my words.  we&#39;ll see what happens in the next few decades.  </p>

<p>i&#39;m gonna keep buying gold. you keep having faith in our flawless fiat economic system, the fed, and the IMF.  we&#39;ll just see what happens. </p>
