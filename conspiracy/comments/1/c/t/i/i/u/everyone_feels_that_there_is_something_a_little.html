        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was lying down in bed with my girlfriend and we were discussing the case and the different possibilities. At one point we were considering the possibility that the Tsarnaeve&#39;s are innocent and framed. So, we looked for hard evidence that they are guilty to falsify our proposition. All of a sudden we realized, we don&#39;t have a single photo of these guys with guns, we don&#39;t have a single photo of these brothers in Islamist gear, we don&#39;t have a single video of them firing at police or otherwise. The aunt was right: No evidence!</p>

<p>Every police car has cameras installed on it and at the final raid where Jowhar was arrested they differently had cameras. Why don&#39;t  the authorities release a few pictures and videos so that the public can be comforted that the police got the right person? I know for myself, I would be satisfied if I saw a video of a firefight, there are tons from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq shown to us. So why can&#39;t we see this one too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to remember that, in an investigation of a crime, the majority of evidence is not going to be released to the public right away. They keep it under wraps until the trial where it is shown to the jury, and then sometimes released to the public. The police aren&#39;t required to convince the public in any way, their job is to collect evidence to convince a jury. It is common for evidence to be held until the trial because releasing it to the public beforehand can cause something called jury contamination, where the people called to serve on the jury have already seen all of this stuff and made up their minds before the trial. If this happens the entire case can be thrown out of court.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The misses the point. It&#39;s not about what the media portrays when the actual trial comes; it&#39;s about the evidence used by the prosecution. If they use dashcam video that has never been seen by the public, then it&#39;s more likely to prevent an appeal on the basis of jury contamination or lack of a fair trial. Again, it&#39;s only about the evidence at trial. We may never see the footage until after a trial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This actually would most likely be the decision of the US Attorney charged with prosecuting the case. Here is the issue in this circumstance: it is likely the federal authorities knew within hours that the brothers placed the explosive backpacks on the basis of the vast amount of finish-line footage available. But, they didn&#39;t know who they were just yet. In the time it took to determine who they were, I guarantee the US Attorney&#39;s office got to work on a number of issues: 1) evidence collection; 2) the constitution in times of martial law/domestic terrorism; and 3) the charges they would bring when the suspects were brought into custody.  With regard to evidence collection, it is likely that the USAs demanded all dashcams - one to collect evidence, but also to reduce the likelihood that the suspects could make a demand for a venue change (more the ego of the attorney wanting to prosecute it).  </p>

<p>So in the end, it is likely the US Attorneys want to keep the evidence, or lack thereof, close to the vest in order to procure a &quot;fair&quot; trial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not even sure this is 100% true.  In exigent circumstances the law can give investigators the option of not reading someone their rights however this does NOT mean that the suspect does not still have those rights.

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s a nice Jack Bauer theory you have around the pigs.  </p>

<p>in reality, his Miranda rights were ignored because the pigs want to have total impunity to screw the public.</p>

<p>notice my use of the word &quot;pigs&quot;.  in fact, i actually love <em>real</em> pigs, the hooved animals.  they have hearts made of gold.  on the other hand, <em>cops</em> are more like <em>demons</em>.  in most people&#39;s minds, the image of a fat, greedy, self-obsessed, self-gratifying pig is the kind of image they should associate with police, because that&#39;s the reality of it.    </p>

<p>i&#39;ll explain how it is for you.  <em>they want to be able to ignore Miranda rights, because they want every random person they abduct to blab their mouths off until they incriminate themselves, and then have the case stand up in court even though they violated their rights, because, thanks to armchair legal commentators who have then cemented this ridiculous theory into the popular idea of &#39;law&#39;, they can  then claim it was justified due to &#39;public safety&#39;</em>.  and you know what?  their &#39;confession&#39; - even if it was coerced, and even if the &#39;suspect&#39; was never read their Miranda rights - would probably be admitted into court anyway.</p>

<p>and you know why they do all this?  <em>because it helps their careers</em>.  the more people they put in cages, the more people they can point to and say, &quot;we put these bad guys away!&quot;</p>

The guy snapped, and killed people, and got what was coming to him, what is so hard to understand? You think he is an actor, innocent, and what, the people who died are just in witness protection now? What are you getting at exactly with Dorner, yeah maybe his death was untimely, but it certainly was his fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You obviously don&#39;t understand the point people are trying to make. Nobody is defending the action of killing innocent people. But it is vitally important to uphold certain basic principles of law despite the emotional circumstances of a case. Did the families of those killed want to see him die? Probably. Does that change how justice is supposed to be served in this country? No.</p>

<p>The problem is that if it becomes commonplace to basically assassinate people that are accused of a crime because someone deems it &quot;appropriate&quot; we have a huge problem on our hands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like you switched back to the Boston brothers. I think the point of this whole thread is that there is very little hard evidence linking either one of them to the bombings known to US, the public. Maybe that evidence exists and is in the hands of law enforcement and it was necessary to kill the man. People are discussing what they know, which isn&#39;t much, and which for some is troubling because people died and they want to know the truth.</p>

<p>And, by the way, I&#39;m not up in arms about anything, I was simply trying to clarify why it&#39;s important to follow the rule of law and the implications of not doing so. The person who seems the most up in arms at least in these comments is you.</p>

They burnt that house down with tear gas by accident, didnt they? if he was innocent, he could have turned himself in, there was no need to be so hostile and he knew what cops would do.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s discuss, do you think they are innocent?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With most things of this nature, there are conflicting stories. There is the LAPD who claims it was done by accident. Then there is audio footage recorded by Carter Evans (a reporter) in which you can clearly hear the cops yell things such as &quot;Burn this motherfucker&quot; and &quot;Burn this fucking house down&quot;. In my opinion it&#39;s pretty obvious why the LAPD would be this adamant that it was done on accident, but yeah...</p>

<p>As far as the bombers are concerned, I honestly don&#39;t have enough evidence to be sure. All I have is pictures of them with backpacks at the scene and those videos of them walking around. And the authority&#39;s word that they are the suspects. I would have to see more evidence just like a jury is going to see before they render a verdict. Again, it&#39;s innocent until proven guilty.</p>

I mean they had to hire A LOT of people for the Marathon, and had to make sure NO civilians were around the finish line.  Also I am surprised they hired an activist<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Arredondo">(Carlos Arredondo)</a> to &quot;help&quot; Bauman stop from bleeding out and get him to an ambulance.  </p>

<p>can you link me to your sources?</p>

So, again, just because there is no evidence released, does not mean there is no evidence.</p>

Sending a text message (which there&#39;s not much evidence of anyway) doesn&#39;t mean they were getting bombing instructions.  It means he was sending/receiving a text, that could be anything from a wrong number, to asking what time dinner is.  These were completely normal seeming people, with friends who text them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya, but where your story falls apart, is that they did place backpacks at the scene of both bombing sites. So, again, taken what we know (aka the obvious) into consideration, then we have to stop and take a look at those photos, and realize that something is going on in those snapshots...</p>

<p>And i didnt say they were getting bombing instructions. I will leave this open to interpretation. They probably were patsies and were needing more information at this point as to where the drop off point would be or something like this. And, again, patsy implies that they may not have known they had a bomb on them at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So &quot;waiting for more information to proceed&quot; is leaving it open to interpretation?  </p>

<p>The only thing you can infer from the pictures is the obvious... They were there, they had backpacks.  Deciding they were patsies and then molding your story to fit the pictures is the exact opposite of what you should b doing.</p>

This case had thousands of police and military pouring through the streets, armed with the latest technology and there are NO VIDEOS OF THE IMPORTANT PARTS. No shoot out, no bombing, no murder.  All we have is the word of witnesses.  Well, after what we have learned from other cases similar to this, the words of witnesses are not sufficient.  Lies from liars does not truth make.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I&#39;m still hung up on this one thing.  Law enforcement had the images of the Tsarnaevs a day before they released them to the public.  It looks like the AP was reporting about the Lord and Taylor video by 2 pm on Wednesday as reported in this <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/2013/04/17/boston-medical-center-reports-five-year-old-boy-critical-condition-victims-treated-from-boston-marathon-bombings/UiktKly60y4m8UVHeNu8NP/story.html">Boston Globe Story</a>.  This was more than twenty-four hours before the FBI public release of the Lord and Taylor images.  What were they doing with the Lord and Taylor video in that twenty-four hours?  Should I just think that they didn&#39;t share the video with FBI officers who work in the Boston area?  Or should I just think that the FBI officers who got familiar with Tamerlan and his family in 2011 saw the video, but just didn&#39;t recognize the Tsarnaevs?  </p>
