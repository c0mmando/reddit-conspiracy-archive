    <div class="md"><p>My current pet theory is that they&#39;re patsies: hired bag men who realized too late that they were being set up.  But once they had been identified, they panicked and caused enough of a disturbance to make them incontrovertibly guilty in the eyes of the public.  For the record, I can very well believe they were armed and even injured and possibly killed cops. But we won&#39;t really be able to rule out some degree of friendly fire unless it ends up in court.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say the older brother probably did turn to the dark side. He probably has a powerful influence over the kid and basically forced him to be a part. </p>

<p>Their plan was probably rehearsed but they probably had no plan for what to do afterwards. Maybe they thought they would never be identified. Maybe they were planning more attacks. Maybe they wanted to go out in  hail of bullets.</p>

<p>We probably will never get the full story.</p>

<p>I&#39;m open to any theories but I am not open to the fact that these two were innocent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a chance what you say is true. I know there are reports that at the start of the marathon there was a LOT of security. People that had run many times said it was definitely more than usual. Also, many pics have been posted of the guys in tan pants with black jackets. They might have been hired as extra security because of a threat.</p>

<p>So where&#39;d his bag go? Why is he so calm for a bomb going off? What&#39;s the white thing in his hand? If he simply left his bag, wouldn&#39;t he have noticed long before any explosions? Why didn&#39;t he go back for it then?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you tell that he&#39;s any more calm than the old man in the picture. Or the guy standing around taking pictures? The backpack could be in his hand or on his shoulder, hidden by the woman in the way. Why the heck would you run towards explosions to go get your backpack? D: 
And finally, what white thing? (possible cell phone? but I don&#39;t see anything)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The possible cellphone yes.</p>

<p>He just looks very relaxed. And my point was, he puts the bag down before the explosion. If you put your bag down and go to leave without it, isn&#39;t your first thought, &quot;oh crap! Almost forgot my bag.&quot; He would&#39;ve gone back for it before the first explosion since the pic of the bag beside the little boy appears to occur before then and there was about a minute between the explosions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a good point, but I have qualms about that picture. Something just doesn&#39;t sit right with me about the placement of the bag. 
The picture you posted has the woman circled (and very much alive), she&#39;s circled because in the picture OP posted, she&#39;s also seen very close to the boy who ended up dying. To me it just seems little odd.</p>

In the pictures of him with his backpack, it appears that one of the zippers on his pack is opened. Could he be putting something back into his backpack at that point?

<p>It&#39;s hard to tell if he&#39;s calm, he looks to be in good shape and he could be jogging. A lot of the people in that picture don&#39;t look all that worked up about that, hell that old guy right in front of the camera looks pretty damned pleased.</p>

I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s calm that&#39;s your call. White thing don&#39;t know. I think he could still be wearing his bag. Now you answer my question here.</p>

<p>Answer this:</p>

<p>In the picture you posted, you can see in the back his brother with the cap. How can they be so close to eachother? The bombs had a huge walking distance between them. In every picture they are seen together. It doesn&#39;t add up.</p>
