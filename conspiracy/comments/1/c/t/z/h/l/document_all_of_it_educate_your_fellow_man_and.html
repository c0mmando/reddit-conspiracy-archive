       Document every inconsistency you find. Show your friends, your family. Impel them to do research of their own and form their own opinions. The public will not be swayed by a pissing contest, so shake your dicks and do some digging.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can keep on making predictions, "debunking" official statements (and then not doing anything about it), hating the powers that be, laughing at our "unawoken" brothers and sisters, or we can choose to finally say enough is enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prepare for a nonviolent revolution. Education is key; the media's hold on the general public must be loosened. The best part? It has already started.
       <a href="http://www.infowars.com">
        InfoWars
       </a>
       has jumped 100 places in terms of global site traffic since Monday. Many of us may not agree with them or their methods, but they definitely create a want for more research. A similar thing happened with searches for terms such as "False Flag" and related terms. This is phenomenally
       <em>
        awesome
       </em>
       in that, at the very least, people are swimming away from the MSM current.
      </p>
      <p>
       Save all the "incriminating" evidence you can - regardless of its perceived pertinence or accuracy. You can
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       know what might come in useful in the future. Better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it, right? Save articles, download YouTube videos, save images, everything you need to do to feel secure that any and all "
       <em>
        controversially-opinionated
       </em>
       " accounts and reports stay in circulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       What
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       are doing is a good first step, but it is
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       the best way to educate our peers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love one another. Stop being a dick. Don't fight over politics, religion, sports, race, TV, whatever it may be.
       <em>
        We cannot bring about change as a divided people
       </em>
       . Pointless "conflict" manifests itself in these arguments. It doesn't matter your political affiliation, religion, or ethnicity. Change needs to come, and it will only come if we bring it crashing down in a wave of thunderous unity and conviction.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Scare tactics and anger are unwise and make us no better than "them," no matter where they come from. They almost always serve as negative-reinforcement to those on the other side of the fence
       </strong>
       . Psychology shows us that positive-reinforcement has exponentially more statistical probability to change somebody's mindset. Likewise, these same studies go to show that negative-reinforcement often reinforces an opinion. Keep this in mind when conversing with friends who don't see eye-to-eye with you. Be kind to one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make your own choices about your money, family, and friends. Don't let people on these forums - or MSM, of course - be the deciding factor of your fear.
       <em>
        Trust your gut
       </em>
       . You will know the appropriate actions to take, and when to take them, if you prepare. Precious metals have already taken a dip - be wary. Stay on your toes, but live in peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prepare for the worst, and hope for the best. Do not do anything rash, of course. Violence is
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       acceptable from either side at this point. As said before, this "war" has a greater likelihood of being won with the pen rather than a sword. Educate your loved ones, branch out, form clubs with people who think the same way you do and open them to people who don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take up shooting, get in shape. Do what you need to do. Not next week, not tomorrow, start today. Hit the weights. Do some research on local ranges. Try to get a few reps in with the jump rope. "The" Boston Bomber's actions alone are a great reason to have a gun in the household, guilty or not. Random men breaking into your family's home is not acceptable.
       <strong>
        Not ever
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       We're on a good path so far, but let's make it even greater. If we walk the path of nonviolence and gain the confidence of our fellow man, we can achieve the change the world has almost left us bereft of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's start this. We've seen the collaboration sites like 4Chan and Reddit can bring about in times of crisis. We sure as hell can accomplish that in real life if we tried. Branch out, talk to your friends, do research. Communicate, become active in your community (if you're not already), and take the fight to the hearts and minds of the people. Start clubs, make friends, and get ready to watch the world flourish.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can do this. We are smart, strong, and capable. Let us spread like wildfire.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR
       </strong>
       : A lot of people talk about following the white rabbit. Why not catch it?

       Sadly the public has been brainwashed into the idea "I'm just one person, what could I do?" , and when everyone thinks like that NOTHING will get accomplished, we must assimilate, organize , discuss , and come to a solution for ending government corruption , and giving America back to the PEOPLE ,
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we going to let these ass holes rape the planet, deplete it of natural resources and beauty , kill millions of innocents in wars of profit , all while sending our children to die in wars we don't support , but also have to pay for ? Let them genetically manufacture our food with carcinogens? Laugh as the rate of education drops, and we all become fat, uneducated consumers ? Let them take away our rights , and charge us money just to occupy space in this nation? I SAY NO MORE

       Odds are, guns won't play the main role in a successful conflict - I agree with you there. However, if someone feels owning one is important to keeping themselves and their family safe, regardless of the reasons, I'm not one to claim to know what is best for themselves and their family.
