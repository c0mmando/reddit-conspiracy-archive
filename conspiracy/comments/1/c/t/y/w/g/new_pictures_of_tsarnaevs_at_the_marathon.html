       These pictures were posted within one of the /conspiracy subreddit threads. I don't think any of those have been seen before:

       It seems that all of these photos came from Bob Leonard, as noted by CBS Boston:

       This may be hard to believe, but chances are they didn't set the backpack down and just stare at it. So it seems possible that they may have been texting, watching the race, maybe even strike up a conversation with someone, normal stuff.

        Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick told 'Meet the Press'
       </a>
       the following about Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his backpack placement,
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "It does seem to be pretty clear that this suspect took the backpack off, put it down, did not react when the first explosion went off and then moved away from the backpack in time for the second explosion," Patrick said on “Meet the Press.” "It's pretty clear about his involvement and pretty chilling, frankly."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       He has yet to see the videos for himself, but this sheds light on what we should expect to see whenever footage is made available to the public. Nobody can yet say for sure when that will be but it should be clearer after the suspect is formally charged, which NBC reports will be Monday at the earliest.

       I think Deval Patrick's statement is implying that Dzhokhar took a few seconds to clue into what was in his backpack. Which of course means that he had no idea what was in the backpack. Ie: this is more evidence of at east Dzhokhar being a patsy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did his older brother, Tamerlan even know? If his brother knew, then he would have informed his younger brother, and therefore, Dzhokhar would have moved away IMMEDIATELY after placing the backpack down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this leads to the conclusion that #1 they were both patsys and knew nothing about their true role that day and also #2 that Tamerlan might have known more than his younger brother, and therefore, this is why we have Tamerlan being arrested nude, and relatively unscathed, and then, after in custody, they beat the crap out of him, shoot him, and remove the main link in the truth chain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dzhokhar knows fuck all, and they want to keep it that way. If you havent seen it, there is a hospital photo of Dzhokhar with ear plugs in his ears! Don't let him hear tidbits of facts from agents in room!
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone agree disagree with my reasoning? We are all speculating here, so please, poke holes, offer up counter reasoning.

       Do you really think they would put earplugs in someone's ear so they can't hear secrets? Wouldn't it make
       <strong>
        so much more sense
       </strong>
       to just, I don't know, leave the room?

      <p>
       Those earplugs are probably to help his ears recover from possible damage. I can imagine that your ears are ringing after a couple of flashbangs were thrown your way.

       Bring it back to common sense... In case something slips out in conversation, that they do not want the suspect to hear, they would indeed take this precaution of putting earplugs in his ear.  We are talking about the CIA, FBI, ATF, etc here.. they are going to cover their bases... you really think they are going to take a chance on this issue and possibly jeopardize a trail, or accidently let him hear something?? cmon.

       I'm pretty sure the CIA or FBI won't hire you if you tend to let something slip during a conversation. Blabbering about important information while the suspect is in the room would be the most unprofessional thing ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are talking about guys who (well, some of them) manage to hide their real jobs from their own friends. They don't let things slip.

       Again, you dont take chances. These are indeed professionals in the sense that they probably would not let important information slip... but again, if you are the CIA.. FBI... you cover all your bases, since it is not only your men in the room.. you also have doctors.. nurses... police...etc... look at what has leaked out so far... the Tamerlan death photo... The Jahar hospital photo...
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, we are talking about basic protocol... you dont say "oh, we are CIA, nothing will slip off our tongues"... but what you do do, is have a policy in place, to put ear plugs on
       <em>
        enemy combatants
       </em>
       . plain and simple. not sure why its so hard to understand such a basic method of protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA, FBI dont operate on maybes.

       Yup. In this case, where you have such a HIGH PROFILE ENEMY COMBATANT, whose room is frequented by NON-FBI, NON-CIA personal, then yes, im sure whoever is in charge ordered that.
      </p>
      <p>
       He WAS NOT moved to a secure area. He is in a public hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jahar is a patsy and they obviously want to keep it that way and not do him any favors and let him overhear anything if something is mentioned in his hospital room.

       No i'm saying if the FBI agents need to talk about something the suspect should not hear, I would think standard protocol is to leave the room, not just put earplugs in. Most plugs like that don't even stop sound all together, they are used to stop damaging sound from large machines and the like, not to block sound all together. The FBI agents would move to a secured room to talk. Why would they talk about pertinent info within earshot of the suspect. That sounds absurd.

       Again, if you are the the FBI, you take no chances. At this point in time, you have a leaked photo of Jahar in his hospital bed and a death photo of Tamerlan. They know leaks happen and even professionals slip up on purpose or accidentally.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, again, you have doctors and nurses going in and out of there as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get why this is so hard to understand about the ear plugs. This guy is an enemy combatant. They are not going to do him any possible favors and would like to keep him in a position where the information he gets is totally controlled by them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, he is NOT in a secure location. He is not in a holding cell and in an isolated environment. The FBI and CIA are going to want to simulate that as best they can by blocking out his hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont see why its hard to understand that they would want to CONTROL this enemy combatant by blocking out his hearing.

       You say you take no chances. Wouldn't that include not talking in the same fucking room as the suspect. Ear plugs are not perfect, so talking in the same room as him is taking a chance of leaking info. How is that hard to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I never said he was in a secure location, I said the FBI Agents would move to a secure room to speak, not the god damn patient. Jesus you have no reading comprehension.

       This isnt about playing musical chairs and having the FBI move in and out of the room for every conversation of a sensitive nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, earplugs are not perfect, but they would definitely obstruct his hearing quite a bit.  But again, this is about controlling an enemy combatant. Not about how or when the FBI talks about things of a sensitive nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do have good reading comprehension, but again, Jahar is in a hospital. There is more than just FBI there. You got nurses, police, doctors, etc. I didnt state Jahar would move to another room, you are jumping the gun yourself in terms of what you are reading. Reread please.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, again, i will restate, that they take no chances. And once again, I will state to you, that this is not just about the FBI and their conversations. This is also about what the nurses, doctors and police say in that room. How is that not clear?

       I was never saying anything about police nurses etc. I said the FBI would not talk about sensitive info in the same room as him, that would be the easiest way not to make any mistakes.

       Again, your mistaking what I say too quickly..
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just stating the fact that he is not in a secure location. This fact needs to be said, because it provides context to the situation at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am bringing UP the fact that there is more than just highly trained FBI agents in the room, such as nurses, doctors and police, because THEY might let information slip.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALSO, the FBI is definitely going to want to control all conversations in the first place. Various interrogations will take place right?  But, if your the FBI, you do not want any conversations taking place off the record and Jahar engaging in banter with nurses, doctors or police, HENCE another reason for earplugs...
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I don't see whats the big problem in pointing out that the FBI would want to control as much as possible what happens in that room.

       Yes I understand that, what I am saying has nothing to do with anyone but the FBI agents talking about sensitive information. It has nothing to do with other police, nurses in the room talking. You obviously don't get what Iam trying to say so I will stop at this, its just annoying now. We can agree to disagree, we are both now just repeating our initial comments.

       I never said that, I said that the FBI would not just use ear plugs to keep the suspect from hearing sensitive information. ANd honestly I don'tthink a nurse would, why would a nurse be let in on the investigation. Other police yes, I could see that,but not a nurse.

       Hmm, how about what his friends are saying? Saying that he is innocent? How about what his family and relatives are saying (sans uncle aslan) -- that he is innocent. How about a nurse who sympathizes with him, and lets him know all this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Further more... how about Jahar asking how his brother died? Does Jahar know that they are trying to pin his death on him? That they are going with the story that Jahar ran over his brother and killed him?

They never said they are trying to pin his brothers death on him, all they are saying is that he did in fact run him over with a car. How is any of that sensitive to the case?

       Ya, Jahar said he didnt do it. But again, you want to control the information he gets. Why is this hard to comprehend?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why give Jahar hope and encouragement from a nurse who says his friends are cheering him on, saying he is innocent? You might as well allow Jahar to have a fucking laptop with wifi in the room...
      </p>
      <p>
       There was some law enforcement alluding to teh fact that he may face charges for his bros death as well...

       If he cant talk today... maybe in a few days... who knows? Not really important...

       The main issue here is information control. Prisoner Control. Securing the prisoner. However you want to put it. But, again, you have to put Information Control AND Unsecure Hospital Location together.

       I feel you're stretching if you think Deval Patrick was implying some sort of unknown involvement on Dzhokhar's behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
       That line of thinking may be reaction some will have when viewing the evidence on their own when it's made available, that's something for those individuals to broach for discussion at that time. I don't feel the Governor was alluding to any such activity, nor do I think it would make sense for him to within context of the current public information available (he would be instantly tagged as a conpiracy theorist and eaten alive by the media/public).
      </p>
      <p>
       It does appear that the direction the information is leading is Tamerlan will appear to have more involvement/knowledge than Dzhokhar.

        I think this leads to the conclusion that #1 they were both patsys and knew nothing about their true role that day and also #2 that Tamerlan might have known more than his younger brother, and therefore, this is why we have Tamerlan being arrested nude, and relatively unscathed, and then, after in custody, they beat the crap out of him, shoot him, and remove the main link in the truth chain.

       How did they get Oswald to be at Dealey Plaza with a rifle? How did they get Mohammed Atta to think he was a secret agent?

       Developing a patsy is a thing done by professional CIA agents.. they don't just ask one day for some idiot to carry a backpack a drop it down the street. This is something that was developed over a period of time.

       It's about 70% of the US population that agrees that Oswald was a patsy and that there were others involved. Oswald said it himself when he was caught "I'm a patsy".
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also a very large percentage that believes 9/11 was an inside job, and you are going to see that percentage increase as the internet generation gets older and the younger generation being exposed to more NON-MSM news...

       Atta was a confirmed cokehead. He frequented hookers. His girlfriend was also a hooker. He had tons of money all the time. Is this the picture of an Islamic Radical Ideologue? Or of a patsy enjoying living like a rock star? You be the judge.

       There have been dupes before.. You can dismiss it with a semi humorous statement if you want...

       How about what they told Oswald? How about what they told Mohammed Atta?

       Again, they were all lied to. They can have these guys thinking they are part of some team.. they can feed their ego and have them think they are a secret agent... maybe they did drops like this before. Maybe they were ordered to and observed doing those drops in the prior weeks and made sure they always followed instructions not to look in the bags...

       Atta never flew the plane into the building. You are missing the obvious. The patsy can never physically do the even that takes place. They just cant do it. Atta nor any of the others could fly the plane in that manner. You cannot decide to turn off your reason, and ignore this fact. You think a cocaine addict, hooker addict, cat mutilator like Atta was an expert pilot  after a few lessons? All of the hijackers become expert pilots, just because of a few lessons? They cannot pull it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, you have to go by what the empirical evidence shows you and it all points to these being patsys. The MO fits patsy, more than anything else, by far.

       Hey Tamerlan, since your a secret agent doing important work, you are going to follow instructions to the T. Hey Tamerlan, dont look inside or tamper with this envelope. It contains 10 grand in it, and you cannot get your finger prints on it. Hey Tamerlan, here is a heavy suitcase with some guns, ammo and cash in it. Dont look inside of it. Take it to our Chechen friend at this mosque....

       Just because someone wrote a book about doesn't mean everyone agrees.  In fact, it's usually quite the obvious.  People write books because they are trying to spread an otherwise unknown viewpoint.  The "Oswald is a patsy" story is just one of ~dozens~hundreds of scenarios published on the JFK assassination.  So it's not so much a "record" as much as "cacophony" or "ongoing argument."

       Well, you stated that not everyone believes in Oswald being a patsy, and I pointed out that about 70% do in fact believe this. This has nothing to do with books. It has to do with actual opinion polls taken.

       Jeff Baumann ID'd Tamerlan saying he saw him put the bag down. Video of them dropping the backpacks at the bomb site. I would guess there is forensic evidence from ballistics to fingerprints matching the gun up to one of them from the MIT shooting. Tamerlan had a suicide vest strapped to him when he advanced on the police. Pretty clear it was him, otherwise someone else would have been shot dead by the cops.

       I'm almost certain that the only one of those that you can confirm was the Jeff Baumann ID and since when is an eye witness credible. Why would he remember exactly who put down a bag during an even like this, and after an explosion... Not that he couldn't, but it's not exactly "proof."

       What other evidence though? That's my issue. You can condemn them now and say they did it, but you personally have absolutely no proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying they didn't, and to be completely honest, when it comes down to it, I don't care all that much, but to say you know they did and that there is evidence that you have seen is just untrue. Someone somewhere has? sure, but you? No...

       I'm not saying I have absolute proof, I don't think I ever could. But what I do think is that there is a pile of evidence that does link them, from forensic to ballistic evidence. I'm not saying I know for sure, but that it was I believe.

       There is not a lack of evidence, it just has not been released to the public. They can't release it before the trial, how is that so hard for half the people in this sub to understand you do not release the evidence before the trial.

       I've been going back and forth with a guy saying that the FBI would use ear plugs to talk about info around the suspect instead of leaving the room. Saying it is standard protocol for them to use ear plugs instead of walking outside the room,away from earshot. Pretty much sums up my experience here.

       they are definitely guilty,theres plenty of evicence. but the FBI have been known to set people up and then bust them, making them look as terrorist. what if this was allowed to happen, with CISPA passed and a couple other things that slip my mind. just my 2 cents. take it or leave it at the counter where i left it :]

       Your source is a publication of a radical right wing political organisation, and doesn't mention the confession of the accused, in which he states he was intending to cause mass deaths. A set up would indicate an
       <em>

        You're trying to cast doubt on the fact that the FBI is setting up its own busts, correct

       Not at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm asking for evidence for the 'fact' the FBI has 'set up' people like the Boston bombers. So far, no one has been able to provide any.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone posted a very biased link to a defence attorney's arguments to stop his client getting a life sentence, that wasn't even proven to be fact based.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think that proves a fact, you should be asking yourself the questions you think are relevant to me.

       i guess set up isnt the correct term. most of the homegrown terrorists theyve busted sine 9/11 have been them finding out about their hatred of america or some other way, getting in contact with them and supplying them with fake explosives or a detonator. im not saying thats what happened, but thats what they did in the past to make it look like there was a war on terror on US soil. basically i think they entrapped a bunch of idiots and waved the mission accomplished flag on homegrown terrorist busts to scare people into thinking that your neighbor could be one of "them"

       There is a difference between making noise about doing something, and actually doing something about it. For every entrapped person, we have no idea how many, when given the opportunity to take the next step, backed down.

       So you have no evidence at all that the FBI is helping people like the Boston Bombers. You have evidence that they successfully infiltrate terrorist cells by going undercover.
Just to get this straight: you produce evidence that an organization that is charged with infiltrating terrorist networks actually infiltrates terrorist networks.
In other conspiracy news: water is wet.
You making the claim that they are aiding terrorists. Infiltrating they and then arresting them is not siding terrorism in any universe.

       It's not particularly odd, as the younger brother is probably being swept along by the personality of his brother.  The older brother is almost certainly the leader of the pair, and takes the whole operation far more seriously.

       I don't really think there is a significant difference between how recognizable they are.  I don't really get what you're trying to say.  They're both wearing normal street clothes and baseball caps.  The only real difference I see between the two is that the older brother seems more serious and intent.

        dude, come on. You're just arguing for the sake of it. Everybody that ever watched a movie, read a book, turned on a TV knows that if you're going to commit a crime you need to hide your identity a.k.a your face.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think your problem may be that you think movies and TV are apparently reality.  I mean, what exactly do you expect them to do -- wear a hoodie and sunglasses,
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/2MVaZ9u.png">
        like this
       </a>
       ?  I would call the Dumbest Plan Ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       These guys were probably assuming that if they dressed normal and made no attempt to stand out, they wouldn't draw attention or arouse suspicion.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        yeah maybe because he's hiding behind sunglasses and a [forward facing] hat in clothes that don't stand out.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I actually meant his demeanor, the expression on his face.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I find it odd that after they committed this terrible shit they didn't even leave the area. they didn't even seem to have a escape plan at all.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Their escape plan was Not Getting Caught.  They mistakenly assumed that if they went about their normal lives after the bombing they wouldn't arouse any suspicion.  It was only after their names and pictures were spread all over the news that they had to formulate an escape plan, which is why they robbed the convenience store -- clearly a hasty plan for escape.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think where they messed up was in vastly underestimating the FBI's ability to recruit ordinary citizens in turning over photographs -- and that's not that surprising, since this is the first time that its really been done.  This is the first major public bombing since the advent of the smartphone, and they likely forgot to factor in that the entire area would be being constantly photographed by a thousand handheld, web-enabled cameras.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure bombers in the future will study this case and learn lessons from it, but I'm guessing that the elder Tzarenov hadn't accounted for the ability of thousands of people to instantly email all the photos they took of the event to the FBI, nor did they account for the FBI's ability to rapidly sort through the photos and identify them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the elder brother clearly made a mistake in recruiting his younger brother.  I suspect that he was so wrapped up in his own alienation that he didn't think about the vast social network his brother was enmeshed in -- the FBI's facial recognition software was apparently useless, and the pair was identified by the numerous people who recognized the younger brother.  Had he acted alone and only set off one bomb, the hunt for the Boston Bomber might still be ongoing.

       Also... I think at this point, when he exist the ATM, Jahar is heading back to the stolen SUV where his brother is w/ the car hijacking victim. This makes sense, since Tamerlan is the stronger of the two, so Tamerlan sent Jahar in to get cash from the ATM.

       I'm still surprised no one spotted them in the initial reddit image hunt. There were lots of photos around the finish line so I would have thought at least one of them would have been spotted, even if only in hindsight after the faces were released.

       At least the ones that I saw circulating the days before we knew the suspects. Most of those 4chan photos of people near the finish line were from a flickr album that I'm sure is still up there. In the full photos, the race time for runners is visible to be around 2 hours and 30 some minutes.

       Just seemed like they were zoomed in cropped versions of larger photos. I'm guessing they were photos of the area and the brothers were found in the background, so the photographer blew up and cropped where you could just see the brothers as the main focal point.

       I don't think they were targeted at the brothers ex ante, to be frank: some of the photos were cropped before uploaded, so that they seem to be focused on the brothers - but that focus is a result of the ex post crop. I don't think anything is off. But they do seem as if they were waiting to meet with someone.

       Need some help. Has it been determined by law enforcement on the sequence the bombs were dropped? I was under the impression that the suspects turned left onto Boyleston (heading the same direction as the runners), made the first drop in front of the Forum, continued in same direction toward finish line, made the drop there, detonated bombs near finish line and then exited the area in same direction they were previously heading. Is this correct? If not, where am I going wrong. Any help would be appreciated!

       I'm sure it has been determined... Their statements sure make it seem like they got everything on one camera or another, before, during, and after the bombings. But I'm not sure I know for certain which order everything was in.

       Thanks for the reply.  I was confused. I thought I heard somewhere that they were spotted at the finish line when the bombs were detonated. And according to the FBI film, they were heading the same direction as the race was heading with both packs on. That being the case, I assumed they made the first drop at the forum and the second drop at the finish line. Now I see this picture of the white hat suspect exiting the scene from the Forum area and not the finish line area.

       Yeah, I think they have only released the clearest images to identify both suspects in, when they were walking together. I think that we (the public) are still missing a large chunk of their movements on film. I do seem to recall some law enforcement official saying that the second bomb was still in Dzhokhar's possesion when the first went off... then he dropped it and moved away quickly and it exploded soon after. So I think they split up to make the drops, and at least one of them fled back the way they came from.

       Ok. That's exactly the conclusion I just came up with while looking through  all the pics on this site.  I'm pretty sure they both turned left onto Boylston St. heading in the same direction as the runners were heading. They both continued past the Forum toward the finish line. They stopped somewhere between the Forum and finish line. Split up.. black hat guy heads toward finish line to make the drop while the white hat guy goes back towards the forum to make his drop. Then each departed the scene in the same direction they were previously heading. Sounds as if the white hat guy heard the explosion at the finish line and probably knew he had ten seconds to drop his bag and get out of the area.

       Maybe I am just not seeing something, but it looks as if he has no legs.

       When I look where his legs should be, I see the green chair, and then seemingly nothing but sidewalk until there appears to be someone else's foot behind him.  Nothing but air.

       It looks like he's in mid-stride, not standing still. You can just see the edge of what looks like a leg next to the chair, and the other one by the lady. His crotch is just to the right of the top of the green chair.

       Can someone give me a quick rundown of the sequence the drops were made? I was under the impression that they headed in the same direction the runners were heading.  That they placed the first bag in front of the forum, continued down boyleston (same direction as the runners) towards finish line, made the drop nearest to finish line, after detonating, continued in same direction as they were previously heading. So, the first drop was actually the second to be detonated. Is this all correct?

       If you look at the footage the FBI put out there, the suspects are traveling in the same direction as the runners in the race and each is still wearing their backpack. That being the case, they had to make the last drop at the finish line correct?

       Ya, that's true. I haven't seen a single picture with them traveling against the runners with their backpacks. That being said, #2 supposedly dropped the further bag (according to the picture of him near the 8 year old who perished) and #1 dropped the one closer to the finish line (according to Jeff Baum's eye witness account).

       There's a pic of #2 running away from explosion 2. I don't know the order of the drop, however it is clear that #2 walked back against the runners and either dropped bag 2 or triggered bag 2 after bag 1 explodes. Source: Fox25 exclusive photo &amp; runningforum photo

         A Justice Department official says the Boston Marathon bombing suspect will not be read his Miranda rights because the government is invoking a public safety exception to USA cit constitutional rights. [AP Intelligence Writer Kimberly Dozier via Huffington] .. The public safety exception permits law enforcement officials to engage in a limited and focused unwarned interrogation of a suspect and allows the government to introduce the statement as evidence in court. The public safety exception is triggered when police officers have an objectively reasonable need to protect the police or the public from immediate danger.

Unlike his older brother, Dzhokhar made little effort to prevent cameras from capturing his face, making him easier to identify when the FBI released security camera photos on Thursday. Indeed, classmates at University of Massachusetts–Dartmouth did see him in the photos, but dismissed the similarity because it seemed so far-fetched.

         Leave the car in the shop. The Wall Street Journal reported that Dzhokhar stopped by an auto-body shop in Watertown on Tuesday to pick up the Mercedes he'd brought in for repairs.

         Stay in Boston. The second bomb exploded at 2:49 p.m. last Monday. Dzhokhar and Tamerlan carjacked a Mercedes at 10:39 p.m.* on Thursday. What did they do in the interim three days? Go to the gym, check in on their busted car, and, in Dzhokhar's case, go to a party on the UMass–Dartmouth campus. During the three-day window in which their involvement was unknown, they made no attempt to flee.

         Kill an MIT police officer. Why did the brothers shoot 26-year-old Sean Collier? The murder at 10:30 p.m. on Thursday set in motion the events that would ultimately lead to their capture.

         Rob the kidnappee .. When Dzhokhars carjacked a Mercedes on Thursday night, he and his brother had one thing in mind: Get cash, and fast. They emptied $800 from an ATM using their victim's PIN number, before they reached the account limit. Holding up a stranger for money suggests a woeful lack of planning, but quick thinking given they had just bombed and murdered the MIT campus, why not some quick ATM cash?

         Become witnesses to Armed Robbery.  7/11 coincidental meeting of robbers and bombers.  Not understanding how ATMs work. After reaching the daily withdrawal limit at one ATM, the Tsarnaevs, apparently not realizing that the machines are part of an interconnected system, decided to try their luck at two different machines. The quest to find a working ATM was how they ended up, coincidentally, at a 7/11 in Cambridge around the same time it was the scene of an armed robbery, and were spotted on the store security camera.

         About five hours after federal investigators published photos of the the two suspects taken at the Boston Marathon, police say,  they killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Thursday night and carjacked a Mercedes SUV nearby.

         On Monday, April 22, it became official: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was charged with "use of a weapon of mass destruction" and "malicious destruction of property resulting in death" for his alleged role in last Monday's bombing of the Boston marathon. The federal criminal complaint comes three days after police captured Tsarnaev in a boat in Watertown, Massachusetts, and four days after a manhunt for these specific suspects began in earnest.

         To recap: after the FBI released images of the two on Thursday night, the men sprang into malevolent action. They first shot and killed an MIT campus police officer. Then they carjacked a man — who has not been identified but is described as a Caucasian in his 20s — and rode with him in his black Mercedes SUV. According to federal authorities, the Tsarnaevs used the man’s ATM card to withdraw $800 from bank machines in the area. Caucasian escaped/released whilst the bad men get 7/11 snacks.

         April 22, 2:55 p.m.: A federal affidavit released today asserts that the carjacking victim “managed to escape,” though it doesn’t explain how. The affadavit also describes how one of the Tsarnaev brothers showed the victim that he had a loaded gun and told him, “Did you hear about the Boston explosion ... I did that.”

       </li>

         Naturally, the carjacking victim provided police with the make and license-plate number of his vehicle. Even better, the Tsarnaevs now had their very own GPS beacon, as authorities tracked the location of a cell phone the man had left in his car. Within minutes, police had found the men and an ensuing gun battle left Tamerlan dead and Dzhokhar in hiding, soon to be caught. End of rampage. (TIME By Michael CrowleyApril 21, 2013)

         The Tsarnaev brothers were armed and had multiple explosive devices. (The carjacking victim told police they drove to another car and transferred arms from it into his vehicle; by some reports the brothers were driving in two separate cars when police confronted them in Watertown.

         Boston, U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) today announced that he will reintroduce legislation he has proposed in a prior Congress to require that sales of explosive powder be subject to a background check.  Lautenberg's drafted damnation of all things gunpowder and subsequent amendments came hours before it was confirmed that gunpowder was the main explosive component in the Boston bombings.

         University of Mobile’s Cross Country Coach, who was near the finish line of the Boston Marathon when a series of explosions went off, said he thought it was odd there were bomb sniffing dogs at the start and finish lines.  "They kept making announcements to the participants do not worry, it's just a training exercise," Coach Ali Stevenson told Local 15.   Stevenson said he saw law enforcement spotters on the roofs at the start of the race. He's been in plenty of marathons in Chicago, D.C., Chicago, London and other major metropolitan areas but has never seen that level of security before.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       "Evidently, I don't believe they were just having a training exercise," Stevenson said. "I think they must have had some sort of threat or suspicion called in."
      </p>
      <p>
       CNN reports a state government official said there were no credible threats before the race.

       I actually noticed that about Tamerlan as well, but Dzhokar appears to be in jeans.  The other photo linked in response to this, if blown up to full size, readily shows one of his shoes and the edge of his jeans.  His legs are apart.

       He's wearing dark pants, you can clearly see part of his right leg extend from his body, behind the green chair.

      <p>
       Stop it, just stop - what do you think, his legs disappeared? That this was photoshopped, and they forgot to throw his legs in? Get a life dude .. there's skeptic, then there's people like you ..

       I've seen so many horrible, gruesome videos (NothingToxic, LiveLeak, MentalZero, TheYNC, etc.) and the perpetrators always have a certain look about them before going through with whatever it is they're about to do. You can see it in their eyes, their movements... All the pictures I've seen of these two at the race... Sorry, can't see that "look."

       What's more scientific than seeing it in video form? That's pretty good evidence for the claim. Someone who knows their/other's death is imminent has some special mannerisms about them. I can't really explain it.

       Ya I'm not trying to pick a fight.  But if your trying to say you have some special ability to read people, that won't go over very well in this community.  You may have such an ability.  But it certainly isn't proof.  I mean even the FBI behavioural specialists are not taken very seriously.

       Then what's the point of having these specialists if all their work is for naught? Just to get a "base" to work off of? It's not a science as to whether or not someone might "look" like they're about to do something, especially when it involves killing multiple people. It's just reality. I realize suspicious != malicious. I get it. However, body language is more than half of the communication. And you can
       <em>
        see
       </em>
       it in the videos I speak of. There is a different kind of attitude about them, I really can't explain it. I don't know what else to say.

       I still don't get why a picture from the FBI is so damn low quality. It's almost as if it was done on purpose to throw everyone off. I'm certain that the FBI has higher quality camera's than this image is worth.

       I think it's safe to assume that these images were part of larger pictures that got cropped down to focus on the suspects. We live in an age where everything and everyone in public is being recorded. This isn't very surprising.

       this means they have same wardrobe. And any witness would describe wardrobe not a face. Bait and switch
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Bait-and-switch is a form of fraud used in retail sales but also practiced in other contexts. First, customers are "baited" by merchants' advertising products or services at a low price, but when customers visit the store, they discover that the advertised goods are not available, or the customers are pressured by sales people to consider similar, but higher priced items ("switching").

       People holy fuck look at the backpacks. IT HAS A GRAY STRIPE. They could have possibly been told by the FBI to drop this backpacks off and we will signal you later. They were double agents who turned to Islam. FBI knew so they framed them.

       this means they have same wardrobe. And any witness would describe wardrobe not a face. Bait and switch
      </p>

       <em>
        Bait-and-switch is a form of fraud used in retail sales but also practiced in other contexts. First, customers are "baited" by merchants' advertising products or services at a low price, but when customers visit the store, they discover that the advertised goods are not available, or the customers are pressured by sales people to consider similar, but higher priced items ("switching").

       It appears that a majority of these pictures were specifically targeted at the brothers, prior to the explosion. Odd, considering they wouldn't be suspects until after the blast.

       Just seemed like they were zoomed in cropped versions of larger photos. I'm guessing they were photos of the area and the brothers were found in the background, so the photographer blew up and cropped where you could just see the brothers as the main focal point.

       Patsys do exist, they are hundreds of examples, if not thousands. It doesnt matter if you got population sectors in middle and rural American that have low information access and have not developed their critical reasoning.

       yes, but they did have very similar wardrobe to suspect. Maybe it is coincidence..maybe not. Just keep it in mind, maybe it will pop up somewhere else.
