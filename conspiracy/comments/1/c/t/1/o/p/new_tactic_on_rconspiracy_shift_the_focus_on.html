       As the title states I've noticed a trend lately in which obviously stupid and not well thought of posts and/or comments being made and dozens of people going along with it and upvoting it. Anyone who has something sane to say about the matter and explains why these posts make no sense or why it's obviously not well thought of, is being downvoted (censored).
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that there's an active force of people who're trying to dismiss this community by putting the focus on the fairly obvious lesser posts and comments and by reposting and spamming things that are already been dismissed or discussed to death. This makes it easier for the outside world to dismiss
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       as a whole or conspiracy theories in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       One good example how people
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       keep spamming the same "prediction" from 4chan and label it as "this guy was right", when he made very broad statements of which perhaps only one actually "came true".
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example of the focus being on the fact that the Blackwater guys are the ones who put the bags of explosives there, how it was their bags, how they "fled the crime scene" afterwards, while there are pictures out there in which you see that whole team with bags still standing near the finish line
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the explosion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's where I stand in all of this: I think this whole bombing incident is obviously fishy, many things seem extremely off and at the moment I don't trust any "official" statement. I think the whole martial law thingy is ridiculous for
       <em>
        one boy
       </em>
       , I think it's a disgrace that house were stormed in and people treated like suspects, I think it's weird and telling that a team from Blackwater was there, I think it's telling that the FBI had contact with the brothers for years now, I think it's bullshit that someone who would do this would hang around MIT (in public) afterwards, I think they don't fit the profile of scheming evil stuff at all, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though I think all of the above, I don't want the fact of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to be that of teenagers who don't really think things through and simply spam anything that they either think of themselves or simply repost from other stuff they've seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1csemz/innocent_family_ripped_from_their_home_at/c9jk21m">
        this comment
       </a>
       and the responses to that comment (and to mine comments especially) are also a good example of the immaturity and degrading of this subreddit. It's actually
       <em>
        top
       </em>
       comment right now.

       I think that along with a massive influx of new subscribers over the past six months to a year there has been an equally massive influx of trolls. It's to be expected and there's not really much that can be done about it except to call them out, downvote and move on.

       The downvotes seem to be used more often for provided information that supports arguments
       <em>
        against

       a theory, rather than for trolls or ridiculous, unfounded conjecture.

       I don't think anyone should be banned under any circumstances (excluding submission spamming in which new account creation/timers would reduce load). It simply is not an effective way with dealing with a problem: You take an identified troll and force him to come up with an as-yet unknown identity to rebirth the cycle all over again. Most trolls soft-ban themselves in time through their behaviour anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you are banning is a username not an idea and not an ideology, and certainly not a mode of behaviour which feeds on negative reactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings me to my next point; banning a troll sends a very clear message: you are succeeding!
      </p>
      <h2>
       We should not encourage them with such ineffective measures that are quickly circumventable for free.
      </h2>
      <p>
       But who isn't circumventing these bans? Actual users who may have become passionate about something they don't fully understand in a world they find threatening. People who, while possibly disagreeable and abrasive, actually want to learn, to teach, and to improve their world, but were banished from our sub for actions we couldn't perceive from their perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banning is a poor solution and
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1bdrcf/we_need_a_new_moderator/c9676rz">
        there are better ways to improve the sub

       That post is banned because it broke the first rule that is listed on the right. The least that's expected when posting is to adhere to the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do however agree with you that people should not be banned for sharing their opinion. Banning should happen when it's certain that a user is either spamming or its behavior is ill minded. The problem is to prove the latter though.

       And what should we mods do about every post?
      </p>
      <p>
       When we go around banning trolls and folks we get people bitching that we are nazis. When we let things go, we get blamed for letting the sub being overrun.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is that there is a battle going for attention and thought and one shouldnt trust anything being posted represents the whole truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The top post with the Humvee - I personally would not remove that image because the fact that we have such a militarized police force that is looking to using military hardware, weapons and vehicles on the streets, to me, is a fucked up reality that we should never forget, nor be comfortable with.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a fine line between "informative image" and "meme" - and just because there is an image posted, I don't like to censor them as being "memes" if I find the content to be relevant or informative.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they are jokes, then I remove them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of the image of the top post - even though the complaint is against
       <a href="/r/guns">
        /r/guns
       </a>
       - I think that having a US military equipped police force in any city in the US is a sad state of affairs.

       I am all for banning people that act like asses. I had to tell multiple people; Just imagine you're actually in the same room with the people you are replying to. Would you speak to anyone the way you are to another persons face? Would you expect not to be physically attacked for the way you are communicating with another person?

       This is one of the problems with people in general; people are looking to be handed a set of truth. People are not interested in self-education, paying attention and tracking things long term.
      </p>
      <p>
       One can have a discerning eye on the information posted not only here - but everywhere, and determine where the lies come from.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am beginning to think the only way to help create a pure "conspiracy theory" subreddit is to make one that is invite only.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shills, disinfo, LH, troll, sockpuppet attacks etc are to be expected to be the norm here - see throug hthe bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if conspiracy is something you are interested in, the level of increased trolling/shilling/cokpuppeteering should serve as some bit evidence that, irrespective of what the content is, there are entities who do not like to be scrutinized and do not want you thinking for yourself nor questioning anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who has follwed the political conspiracies of our world for 30 years, I don't care about hte ego-squabbles that occur here - what I am happy about is how much more mainstream the conscious of conspiracies has become.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though most have no clue how bad it is - the fact that people are waking up to the fact they are getting farked over is a great thing.

       I've experienced this all day today. I'm ready to be rational, but all the responses I get are self-imposed indignity about some insensitivity I possess or they twist the questions into direct assertions of a specific conspiracy. The only thing I'm sure of is that there is more evidence of funny business than there is that they caught the two guys responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I want is a video showing them shooting back, setting down a backpack, robbing a 7-11, wearing a backpack that matches that of the explosion, throwing the supposed IEDs from the chase the other night, or something they've done in the past that flys in the face of all the positive character witnesses, sans crazy uncle who changed his story, that have come forward. That is the entire basis of my questions. I don't presume the government is guilty, but everyone seems eager to declare the two suspects guilty. Show me the evidence, and I'll join in, in calling for their heads. SOMEONE conducted an act of terrorism, and I know our government to be incompetent, so is it so wrong to expect indignity from citizens who are being pushed around at gunpoint, because there are TONS of pictures and video of that on the internet. They don't need to be terrorists to earn their ridicule. There are plenty of documented conspiracies to cover one's ass, without being terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you telling me there isn't ONE security camera showing these guys doing something scandalous that counters all the facebook, twitter, blog, and character witnesses that they were pretty normal kids?

       There are all sorts of incriminating evidence you aren't privy too, of course, you are a member of a hostile public. Are you just gong to cry in this way after every event? If they do not immediately release footage, or claim to have none, than all other detective work should be forgotten? Since when are you a detective or lawyer who gets to have this information? No one is asking you to join in a manhunt, you are going out of your way to get caught up in the fervor f the event, by admittedly spending your day on this subreddit. You wonder why you see more fishy things than informative ones? Please.
      </p>
      <p>
       They never robbed the 7'11, in reviewing the footage they were seen making purchases. Wouldn't get a clarification on this sub though, would you?
      </p>
      <p>
       One of them is considered a normal kid, the other was monitored by the FBI for being such an extremist. Do you expect a 19 yr old college kid would be dumb enough to let on that he was plotting to kill children?, especially after watching his brother get caught by the FBI for the same thing a few years before?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think that the FBI are just doing a big play? That all of this is just a big pretend play time? Is that what you really think?

       That's projecting. I'd say curious at this point. My pitchfork is pretty dull, but I don't think there are any stupid questions, especially when they jump out at you. I DID just see for the first time the two brothers wearing backpacks and one of them was finally not the light gray one. It's not that I think I can do a better job. It's that the public has a right and a reason to be distrustful.

       I'm a newbie to the group here and I have seen this trend as well over the past 2 months. I just thought it was the norm around here and am glad someone has brought this up and maybe we can stop it somehow.

       Being new to the reddit family, could we just downvote the posts so there is no attention to them? Sorry for the ignorance but still learning around here.

       It seems to be impossible because you have sheep at both sides of the coin: the ones who dismiss anything that's
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       backing up the statements done by the authorities and major news agencies, is one side of the coin. The other side of the coin has those who use
       <em>
        every single thing
       </em>
       as "evidence" for their version of the conspiracy. When you explain to the latter people how certain thought are ridiculous and simply shift the focus of the real important theories, you get downvoted and called a paid shill.
       <em>
        Even if you admit that you don't believe the official stories and think there's a conspiracy.

       Agreed, you do get people from both sides. All we can do as individuals is to do our own reading/research and form our own opinions. Tho many will rehash the same thing over and over I think SovereignMan has is right. Not much we can do about them but downvote and move on.

       Because there isn't enough proof for either side of the story. There is, however, enough things off to question the official story. Many people here, including me, suspect that this was a false flag. We don't have proof of that though. That's why it's important to talk about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talking about doesn't mean that we should only look at it from one side of the story, because then it would mean we're no better than the ones we call sheep ourselves. If someone disagrees with us and has valid reasons for it, we should listen and see whether there's truth to it. Why? Because we need to know which things we can exclude and which things we can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, for example, we get definitive proof of who the guys with the black caps and black backpacks were and why they were there, we can stop pointing at them for answers and know that we need to look elsewhere. We can't just go an point at everything and simply
       <em>
        assume
       </em>
       that because it's weird it
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be part of the conspiracy. We need to be able to talk about these matters. Both with those who suspect it's a false flag as well as those who don't.

       I'm new to reddit and
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       just within the past few days. I naively assumed that the people here would use logic and critical thinking. You know: "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the way it actually goes:
1) Real possibilities are "eliminated" as impossibilities without any proof simply because it's somehow not right to question them. Statements like "Of course it happened that way, the guy who got his legs blown off said it. Do you want your legs blown off asshole?" Illogical statements like this get upvoted to the top but don't prove anything, and the arguments that make sense get downvoted to the bottom ... presumably because they appear insensitive. I don't really know.
2) People immediately jump to the improbable causes before first eliminating the other much more likely possibilities. The result being threads spamming improbabilities while more likely possibilities are ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       I came here because I have become acutely hyperaware that something just isn't right. I'm quickly realizing that something doesn't seem quite right here either.

       The fact that you think only one of those options could be the case as if they're mutually exclusive, says a lot about your (lack of) reasoning skills.

       How do you feel making fun of someone who's native language isn't English. In fact, English is the third language I've learned to speak and write. I hope it makes you feel better and is worth looking like a fool for.

       I am all for banning people that act like asses. I had to tell multiple people; Just imagine you're actually in the same room with the people you are replying to. Would you speak to anyone the way you are to another persons face? Would you expect not to be physically attacked for the way you are communicating with another person?
