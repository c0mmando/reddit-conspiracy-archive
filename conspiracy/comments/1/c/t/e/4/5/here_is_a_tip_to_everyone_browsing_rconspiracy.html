        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>In your preferences turn down the comment viewing threshold. Set the threshold to blank.  You will find something not too surprising: <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is more than likely being gamed to suit a certain narrative.</strong></p>

<p>There is a clear effort to suppress specific statements or questions about the Boston bombing.  Like many others have recently pointed out, this subreddit is now filled with highly rated nonsensical and/or fallacious replies.  Claims are also made to sound as fact while lacking any proof, evidence or citations.</p>

<p>While on the other hand, any question into an inconsistency or a skeptical comment with sources gets downvoted. But here is the thing for some reason many posts do not get downvoted into oblivion.  Instead the posts are being downvoted up until -2 or -4 the most.  Actually many posts tend to hover at around 0.  It is almost like magic. One moment it goes back to +1 and not long after it is back to zero. </p>

<p>How do I know this? I am going to admit to a secret, I cheated.  After the events around the Boston bombing began to unfold I noticed distinct trend of suppressing questioning and any evidence conflicting with the narrative being fed to the populace. </p>

<p>I particularly noticed <strong>three</strong> topics that were routinely subjected to downvote until zero pattern.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Craft International or more specifically the photograph showing them onsite prior to the bombing.  No matter how many backpacks they had after the explosion, the two security contractors were still near ground zero prior to said explosion.</p></li>
<li><p>The validity of the identity of Jeff Bauman and the questioning of the validity of the supposed aftermath of the bombing</p></li>
<li><p>Any comment specifically illuminating the tactics that are being used to game this subreddit or the pointing out suspicious user activity.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know this because I watched a couple comments of mine. I then noticed the distinct downvoting pattern to effectively hide any rational questioning or citation of evidence that didn&#39;t corroborate the mainstream story.  I also made multiple accounts, installed RES and used an anonymizing tool. </p>

<p>I had two experiments.  In each I purposely commented a rational argument in particular to the three previously mentioned topics.  Most if not all of the replies in my experiment had cited sources. With some I upvoted (I apologize for slightly gaming the system) therefore artificially inflating the amount of votes it had.  While with others I just posted and waited. </p>

<p>With any of my own self upvoted comments I noticed a sharp, sudden increase up until 0.  I didn&#39;t stop there.  I then waited hours maybe a day and upvoted it back to 1.  Now these are old, I would guess not many users are going back to day old topics and downvoting one comment.  I should also mention my comment profile did not show any sign of a mass profile downvote.  It was specifically targeted downvoting.</p>

<p>With the other posts that I left untouched until the real votes came in.  Some of my comments were upvoted too highly to be completely silenced others I noticed at times downvoted just enough to be at zero (or around -2).  Well at first.  I then repeated the method of upvoting the post back to +1.  What do you know a little while later it was back to zero.  Again the later upvotes were added about a day, or sometimes more, later.</p>

<p>Not everyone is a paid shill, some are likely trolls like the conspiratards at <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and others are likely people who rather enforce a sense of groupthink (even if they are unwitting players).</p>

<p>That said don&#39;t let this subreddit be silenced.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR - <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is likely being gamed by focusing on silencing comments.  Set your comment viewing threshold to blank.  View all comments and discern the truth for yourself.</strong></p>

<p>-Goodbye and good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of organized media manipulation going on here (paid? agency-run? either way) and some asses being covered by it. I believe that when that happens, there is truth in some of the speculations people post, and it validates their points. Someone has something to hide, or else why would such large and fanatic action be taken to try to suppress speculation.</p>

<p>I think this event was done to increase support for DHS and more financial expansion for it.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ, do a google search for him and the soldier and compare for yourself. They are different people.</p>

<p>This may be a HUGE conspiracy but that doesn&#39;t mean we should accuse a soldier who lost his fucking legs of being a criminal. And it doesn&#39;t mean we should tarnish the reputation of a guy who lost both his legs on Monday.</p>
