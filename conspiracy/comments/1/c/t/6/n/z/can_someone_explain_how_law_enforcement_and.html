        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Lets pretend there&#39;s no conspiracy afoot and everything that happened is true for the most part..let&#39;s pretend the firefights were not staged with blank rounds and there were actually hundreds of real bullets being shot back and forth between Dzhokar and police.</p>

<p>How in the hell does Dzhokar manage to not get fatally shot by any of these trained shooters? There were multiple shootouts documented. At any given one of these shootouts, you have upwards of 30 or 40 cops with assault rifles, chasing, aiming, and shooting at a common target, yet not one officer was skilled enough to shoot and kill him. Doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>It is possible the shootouts were staged in order to invoke fear, tension, and patriotic support form Americans to side with the law and military. With no shootouts, this manhunt is merely a chase and a good game of cat and mouse. There&#39;s no witnesses of them shooting the MIT cop, no footage of the &quot;car chase&quot; where they threw bombs and grenades out of the car. Literally nothing tying them to the events that unfolded. </p>

<p>And where are Dzhokar&#39;s guns he was using? Did he toss them while running and hiding? Why haven&#39;t they been found yet and reported about? Were they in the boat with him? Why haven&#39;t we seen photos of them yet? </p>

<p>shit, they could&#39;ve said Peter Griffin himself showed up with Quahog PD and assembled a tactical plan to find Dzhokar and that&#39;s all we&#39;d have to go on.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you guys, but if there&#39;s a bunch of cops chasing a car down the street with gunshots, you better believe I&#39;m gonna be nosy and look outside to watch what unfurls. Yet, no videos or pictures or anything of this &quot;chase&quot; that happened. It&#39;s almost like it never happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lots of things that sounded like bombs, maybe. i wonder how many live rounds were even shot? i guy reported a shot through his wall and chair. did they try and take out a bystander (more &#39;evidence&#39;) and fail?</p>

<p>there should be a shitload of bullet-holes everywhere since they especially  didnt hit the suspects</p>

<p>and at one point police said they were gonna detonate a bomb, after a airhorn warning.  they changed their statement on that later</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they weren&#39;t trying to kill him- the goal was to get him out alive. I live less than 2 blocks from that boat and heard those gunshots. I didn&#39;t hear anything about the gunshots being fake rounds, but I believe that the &quot;thud sounds&quot; afterwards were just flashbangs. They then brought out a bullhorn and HRT to negotiate with him bc despite the initial shots- they really were trying to get him alive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that&#39;s not true. There&#39;s no way you&#39;re trying to keep someone alive by riddling their location with hundreds of rounds and bullets flying everywhere. All it would&#39;ve taken was 1 of those bullets to enter his brain or heart and kill him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because I <em>don&#39;t</em> believe &quot;20-30 officers shooting at 1 common target will result in a non-fatal injury&quot; that I think it&#39;s more likely they were trying to disorient and wound him rather than kill him. Combine that with the fact that it took a fucking hour for this whole ordeal to be done with and reports that police were considering using dummy rounds and the fact that they bought in negotiators. Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense that they were trying to wound him and disorient him, rather than kill him? </p>

<p>I guess my question is - why are you assuming they&#39;re shooting to kill? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not assuming they&#39;re shooting to kill, but I can see how it seems that way.</p>

<p>In my original post, I said &quot;let&#39;s pretend there&#39;s no conspiracy afoot&quot;. I then posed a few questions and inconsistencies that only occur with the story that is given to us by law enforcement and the media. They reported multiple shootouts, and I&#39;m simply questioning why officers weren&#39;t able to kill him with the amount of bullets that were fired at him. Anybody with common sense would agree that that&#39;s not an effective way to injure but not kill someone. Like I said, all it would&#39;ve taken is one out of those hundreds (maybe even thousands) of bullets to kill Dzhokhar. Then there goes any chance of questioning him. Again, I&#39;m not assuming anything, in going off what law enforcement and the media is telling and showing us. Show anybody that video and they&#39;ll say they were trying to kill him.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you find it weird that there is literally no pictures or videos of ANY of the combat showing Dzhokhar shooting back? No proof of the chase, explosives, etc. </p>

<p>I believe those gunshots and firefights we heard and saw we&#39;re completely fake. Blank rounds were used, I don&#39;t believe Dzhokhar was responsible for ANY of those gunshots. Why was it staged? There&#39;s a few reasons. 1.) to increase public support for the government in this specific case. with no gunshots or explosions, this whole thing is a big ass game of hide and seek. 2.) to paint Dzhokhar as a true terrorist, since the other best evidence they have of him being a terrorist is inconclusive. It was like the cherry on top. 3.) The US needed someone to blame for this.</p>

<p>You seem to be a believer of the media. Why would the government give factual intel to a media station about the highest profile case in the US, currently speaking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because I disagree with your idea that the story is very improbably/impossible, it doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m necessarily a believer of the media. I certainly have questions about a lot of the goings on throughout the duration of the investigation. This investigation has illustrated how good the Feds are at shutting people out of an area (in the name of some sort of panic or fear) where there&#39;s supposed activity and making the public rely on their account of what happened after the fact. I guess many will chaulk that up to the nature of the job, and maybe it is. One thing that bugs me to this day is the whole bomb scare at Moakley Courthouse and the whole confusion about a suspect being in custody, but I won&#39;t get into that. </p>

<p>How about some other questions - How did the suspect not shoot at the guy who found him? (Where is that guy, anyway?) Why did Dzhokar not run the second he was found out? How badly was he wounded from the night before that he could&#39;ve survived for hours in a boat? Just thoughts. </p>

<p>I definitely have questions. All I&#39;m saying is, the media story isn&#39;t as improbable as you are thinking. Maybe combine it with some other pieces or find more solid information. </p>

<p>Of course, ultimately, my speculation is as good as yours. lol </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do have one question in all of this. How in the hell did the guy who discovered him not get shot?? Dzhokar was awfully quick, according to reports, to shoot at police. Wonder what happened there - sheer luck?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently they were most likely using Pistols. These were not necessarily trained marksmen, their weapon of choice was explosives which is why the police took the drastic measures they did. At the time they didn&#39;t know if there were accomplices, other bombs, etc. They had to shut down a city because if they didn&#39;t and some sicko went Joker and had explosives everywhere the consequences would have been unimaginable. Bombs are completely different than guns, and even though other recent tragedies focused on guns and had more fatalities this one could have been worse than all past events if what they are saying is true and they didn&#39;t get these kids in a timely manner.</p>

<p>By the way, the shoot out was with Watertown police. They had different groups of officers spread throughout two towns doing different tasks but the actual cop that stumbled upon the two men driving separate cars was a single Watertown officer who immediately summoned 2 or 3 more squad cars. I don&#39;t know how many times if ever the SWAT or other highly trained marksmen had either of these two in their sights. This was more like hide and seek than Grand Theft Auto.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your input, you&#39;ve given me 2 or 3 facts that I did not know previously. However, I still don&#39;t understand how not one Watertown police officer was able to fatally shoot Dzhokar. Watertown police are trained shooters as well. If you listen to the videos of the shootouts, there were so many bullets being fired, and only a very small fraction of those could&#39;ve been from Dzhokar&#39;s gun. All those shots and none happen to hit him in his head? His face? His chest? In fact, the kid didn&#39;t even bleed out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree, I wish I knew how this all happened. The only thing I can come up with is they wanted to take him alive, there was perhaps knowledge of possible suicide vests prior to them stumbling upon them. It appears as if most of the bullets were in his extremities, there is one on his left side which may have been accidental or was a suggested entry point to avoid any front/back devices. The graphic photo shows his front remained intact as far as I can tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find the fact that the fire fight was all played out and that &quot;blank rounds&quot; were used very insulting and distasteful. My father is on the Massachusetts State Police and was at the scene at the time. If you were not there it is very easy to start calling bullshit on everything and claiming this firefight was staged; but to say that these officers were in no danger, come on. There are new videos and pictures released of the brothers lighting bombs and reloading clips. My father described the Mercedes as &quot;swiss cheese&quot; just covered in bullets. When you are taking cover from pipe bombs, it is very easy to not get a clean shot on the target. Are there some things fishy about this marathon bombing, yes, but there will always be something fishy. But do not insult any of the first responders who were at the scene. Show some respect</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you&#39;re saying. however, you are obviously going to be biased in this particular case, since your father is on the MSP. Not holding that against you, simply putting it out there for the record. I will not take back my &quot;insulting and distasteful&quot; comments for 1 reason -- I was not speaking about your father. I&#39;m questioning the entire government and law enforcement in this case. It is how I truly feel and so for that I will not retract my statements. </p>

<p>bottom line, all those &quot;gunshots&quot; and cars that ended up like &quot;swiss cheese&quot; don&#39;t add up with the lack of injuries exhibited by Dzhokhar. Not only was he not killed, <a href="http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/ht_dzhokar_arrest_kb_130419_wg.jpg">but his whole bottom torso showed no evidence of a bullet wound.</a> We don&#39;t see much of his upper chest area, but there&#39;s not one speck of smeared blood that would reasonably be spread from the place of impact down to the lower chest and stomach area. That&#39;s either horrible shooting or a staged shootout.</p>

<p>Again, i might be sounding harsh and insulting, but you&#39;re in r/conspiracy. I&#39;m voicing my stance on the very potential conspiracy going on around this case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really urge you to look at the released photos from a resident who lives directly in front of the shootout scene. You can clearly see that the officers are almost a football field lengths away from the two. The older brother ran towards police, while the younger got in the SUV and drove straight at them. Reports from the man across the street claim that bombs were set off which created a huge cloud of smoke, limiting police visibility. Police fire was directed at the older brother, which allowed the younger one to get away. 
I understand I am in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and some of the stuff on here is believable in a sense, but just not this instance in my opinion</p>
