        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Where is this visual evidence? </p>

<p>-hands setting down backpacks</p>

<p>-hands on guns</p>

<p>-hands on grenades</p>

<p>-shootout</p>

<p>-interview of carjacking victim</p>

<p>-phone records</p>

<p>-store video feeds of them buying things to make bombs</p>

<p>-receipts of bomb making materials</p>

<p>They&#39;re talking about analyzing their social media. Twitter is their evidence?</p>

<p>Technology exists to do heat sensor and capture but there&#39;s no video camera or visual evidence of setting down backpack or shootout?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s censorship because they&#39;ve shown 26 yo&#39;s autopsy photo. If there was more, they&#39;d be showing it to us.</p>

<p>If paparazzi can show me photos of Prince William&#39;s wife sunbathing topless at a private home billions of miles away, someone can show me evidence of the crimes and not just the capture. </p>

<p>But they don&#39;t exist... so there&#39;s nothing to show...........</p>

<p>EDIT:::::: At marathons there are hundreds of official photographers to capture people&#39;s times when they reach finish line and other ones to sell memory photos to runners. Not to mention family capturing someone who had trained years to run Boston which is one of the world&#39;s most famous races because of the huge winners&#39; prize. It&#39;s total B.S. the visuals don&#39;t exist-- IF there was evidence someone somewhere could and would find a way to show it, but it doesn&#39;t exist!! there&#39;s no such thing as privacy, ethics, or legality in instant reporting or social media-- someone would sensationalize it and show it.</p>

<p>EDIT 2:::::: my conspiracy theory on what&#39;s really happening. boston can now justify $35 BILLION of wasteful spending by Homeland Security 2003-2013 (ten years) as investigated and reported by Senator Coburn. the report says we&#39;re not any safer since before 2003 and before $35 BILLION spent to protect Americans from terror. this report is released and we now have the first major act of terror since 9/11? fishy. This is on a government website on a senator&#39;s page reporting wasteful spending NOT a random blogger.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/oversightaction">http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/oversightaction</a></p>

<p>EDIT 3:::::: 9/11 has made corporations rich. individuals run those corporations. that $35 BILLION is going to those people who make things for us, to things that protect people, bullets, guns, clothing, vehicles, airplanes and ships transporting those people and things, computers, intelligence, satellites, services, training, food, safe drinking water, to salaries (corporate individuals and agencies and contractors). we even pay for storage of leftover iraq and afghanistan stuff and using land to place our people. not only that money but outside of it people are making money talking about 9/11: books, speakers, radio shows, advertisers on the news we read and watch. people&#39;s writing, reporting, politics, political careers are made on their opinions on terror. corporations and individuals fund and donate to those elections. hollywood, movies we watch, weekly tv shows, videogames-- there&#39;s a whole culture of 9/11. all im saying...there&#39;s 35,000,000,000 reasons to just question what&#39;s happened and ask for legit answers, and to not just accept gossip or third party accounts or photos of twitter or blacked out youtube videos or potentially photoshopped photos or videos of random people wanting to be on the news. im just asking questions and looking for answers. doubt isn&#39;t acceptable to me. doubt doesn&#39;t make me feel safe.</p>

<p>EDIT 4:::::: there are so many smart people on here. please find me a video of the kids with their hand on a backpack (not wearing it)-- REAL OR FAKE. either kid or either backpack. at this point ill take just anyone with a hand on backpack, you can even make me a fake one right now. it&#39;ll still never exist.</p>

The new story being pushed by the main stream media is that these videos don&#39;t exist, and they&#39;re not the reason the police caught onto these two.  The story is now that the guy who lost both his legs (the one in that famous picture) identified the man&#39;s position, and he told the police the guy set the backpack down and then walked away.</p>

<p>You will never see video footage of the backpacks being planted.  Ever.</p>

<p>Yes, it is the same thing. The 6th amendment gives every criminal defendant the right to a jury trial. Anyone facing criminal charges in civilian courts who invokes his 6th amendment right to a jury trial will get a jury trial. It&#39;s not up to the government or anyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Usually you don&#39;t release the critical evidence in an ongoing investigation assuming he is going to get a trial. Unless you&#39;re an insider in this investigation you can&#39;t know what kind of evidence exists yet, and that&#39;s a fact. Claims have been made though, by some of the people in charge, definitively claiming the type of evidence you want exists (in regard to video of the event). I&#39;m going on the assumption that it will be released at a later point in time but that the prosecution is not making it public. </p>

<p>Are you sure the autopsy photo wasn&#39;t leaked? Maybe the evidence they haven&#39;t released shows other stuff that the authorities want to appear unaware of or don&#39;t want shown yet for whatever reason. There are so many scenarios that it&#39;s almost worthless to even speculate, but the fact is the public has been promised this evidence exists and if it isn&#39;t released there will be outrage. This is still an ongoing investigation, on a recent event. You can&#39;t expect law enforcement to just show their hand like that.</p>

<p>And as far as all that stuff like phone records and receipts and other security footage, you don&#39;t just upload that in a .zip file overnight after you raid their apartment. </p>

<p>I try to have patience with stuff before getting 100% doubtful, the people running the investigation are human, and on the state level at least rarely have to deal with stuff like this. I have to believe most of them are working in good faith and that if there is anything really wrong that happens <em>it will get out</em>. The fact that the younger brother was captured alive is a good sign, pending his testimony. If he died, I think people would be demanding hard evidence be released.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re a fool, all your posts are ridiculous. I&#39;ve been reading up on all these theories all day and I&#39;ve yet to read one that makes sense.
 
of course people were taking videos but videos of the race not of those around them. and the videos that were taken, are where we got the pictures we have of the guys. It&#39;s asking for a lot to ask for a picture or video of a person laying a bag down. If there is a video containing that why should you have to have the right to see it? The police released what they &quot;needed&quot; to in order to help find the guys. The pictures of the autopsy, the helicopter or the shoot out were either leaks or news reporters.
 
The FBI released enough information to give the public an idea for who they were looking for and thats it. They&#39;re not going to send out their proof to anyone who asks for it. Their evidence will be revealed in court. Theres also the fact that they still havn&#39;t been charged or accused of anything. The media may have given them that title but the police have been very carefull to label them as suspects. Maybe recently that has changed since they began shooting and throwing bombs at the police. Up until the shootout they were suspects, and since have commited a litany of other crimes that if they were innocent, woudn&#39;t have happened.
 
Say they were set up, say the government is using them for political gain. How is throwing bombs, stealing cars, shooting at police officers helping? all of which they don&#39;t have permits for.
 
stop looking for a reason and look at what you know. If more information comes out that makes me rethink it then yes I will, but theres no proof stating that these boys are innocent. You&#39;ve asked a few times for a picture of the guy without a backpack, well here is a pretty clear one of suspect #2 running away the instant after the bomb went off, without a backpack. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/NFPlOCI.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/NFPlOCI.jpg</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I explained why there isn&#39;t a video of that, either there isn&#39;t one because it&#39;s a tad bit absurd to think at the moment he laid a backpack down someone had a camera pointed at him or Secondly if the police do have a video of it, why must you have access to it when it could be used during his trial? </p>

<p>The picture I posted demonstrates him running away seconds after the explosion when there are pictures of him with a bag earlier at the site of the explosion  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll say this again when the police began searching for him, it was a suspect. It was only after they were found with more bombs, a stolen car, a hostage, stealing money from an atm using the hostages card that they were labelled the Boston Bombers. That&#39;s the evidence that is out there look at that and make an assessment.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh..the myth of the hyper competent government rears its ugly head.  Given enough time to search through a database of millions of pictures, I&#39;m sure they would have found them.  In the meantime, two potentially dangerous people with unknown intentions are on the loose.  The images they had from my understanding were grainy and low Res.  Only after they released them, did the public come forward with higher Res photos.
Plus, the public was already going through photos and implicating innocent people.  Why not give them actual suspects to play &#39;wheres waldo&#39; with?</p>
