       Can you explain why?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is from the State of Connecticut's website which listed a FEMA event occurring at the same time on the same day and in same state (Bridgeport is around 18 miles away from Sandy Hook) as the Sandy Hook shooting.

       what do you think they do at these classes? Gather people who would be useful in the an event, and then talk about how to best mitigate the situation. Essentially it is a mental drill of an event rather than a physical drill.

       You know what disaster's they're talking about, right? Like, the hurricanes and snowstorms that absolutely destroyed my state and left tens of thousands without power or a way out of their homes? Ya, fuck you and the Sandy Hook thing. That hits close to home. I live nearby and I can guarantee you that there is no fucking conspiracy about that shit.

       And I'm saying that your source about Sandy Hook is literally nothing. I did bring up facts. Hurricane Sandy affected a lot of people in Connecticut and FEMA played an active role in helping restore power and stability in the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The link that you posted is a schedule that FEMA used in order to show the classes available in Bridgeport, CT. If you actually read to the bottom of the link, you would see that it was only a class and nothing more.

       It's just an educational course about disaster relief. It has nothing to do with school shootings. FEMA doesn't even relate to school shootings at all! They are focused on Hurricane Sandy and helping people in the tri-state area get back on their feet.
      </p>

       I think my anger is perfectly justified because you're being a fucking idiot. You have no evidence other than a fucking schedule to a FEMA course miles away from the actual event.

       You're right. I am imterpreting something. I'm interpreting that you are a fucking idiot. Who in their right minds posts a link to a

       Oh god! A FEMA event at the same time and same date as a shooting? Did you also realize that those courses happen all the time?

       I never claimed anything, just posted links of events or drills occurring at the same time an "terrorist" attack or shooting has taken place.  You are the one making claims.  Not me.

       Training exercises happen, sure, but what we are talking about is the fact that there were official drills/training exercises echoing all recent major disasters/terrorist attacks/shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once would be a coincidence, twice would be a big coincidence, three times, and even bigger coincidence... but some point, you have to admit that there is a possibility of a correlation.

       That was the original question, but you're drawing a false conclusion. The idea is not that the drills cause the event. The idea is that every event also happens to have a corresponding drill.

       Yeah, but that point becomes much less relevant when you bring up all the drills that
       <em>
        don't

       have a subsequent event.

       Maybe there's just a high chance of vaguely related drills going on at any given moment. Lots of agencies in lots of tangentially-related areas could make 'spooky coincidence' out of literally anything. I mean, were there bomb-related drills on 9/11? I don't know, and you probably don't either,  because nobody talks about the merely unspooky synchronicity. You can't draw correlation from half a dataset.

       Not sure what the name is for people who deny statistics. Lets say you run 12 drills a year, 1 a month, that a terrorist attack is going to take place in a major American city. Lets say there is on average 1 major terrorist attack a year. There is a 1 in 30 chance that the drill and the attack will fall on the same day. Now multiply 1/30 by the number of major cities that drills have been run in before. Now multiply the new number by the number of probable scenarios that could take place, bombing, shooting, airliner,subway, whatever they train for ect. Now you are left with a pretty large number. Now factor in that this not just some extreme anomaly of probability, but has taken place several times over the past 15 years. So you tell me the name for people who deny statistics, and I will tell you the name for people who notice a few coincidences.

       Also assuming you do a drill every week, why would you do a drill during an actual event?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean a drill is: gather in this park, wait till something happens (which you planned for practice) , then follow protocols.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas an event is: gather in this park, wait till something happens (could be anything or nothing, be ready) , then follow protocols.
      </p>
      <p>
       To some extend they are mutually exclusive. If you are securing an event then that's already a drill by itself. Why would you then have an actual drill?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I'm confused about this whole drill thing. Basically I'm under the assumption that when you go to secure an event, that is called "working" and not "having a drill".

       Drills are different - they actually simulate whatever attack and hire actors to play victims and bad guys, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does seem odd that there are always drills during real events lately, but I don't see what the point would be, unless it is either a) to pull away the potentially helpful forces and have them otherwise occupied elsewhere, or b) some kind of sick calling card of the government for false flag attacks.

       It is very rare that people will have the opportunity for hands on experience with large crowds of people. I would assume that they use events to not only be prepared for a worst case scenario, but also do some practice while they are there (as such a scenario is extremely unlikely).

       For the most realistic training they would do it at major events where the chance of an attack is high- The only major events in April are Red Sox games, and the marathon.

       I am not sure of the specific term you're looking for, but what people seem to be talking about here is the basic notion of "correlation does not equal/imply causation." In the wake of these terrible events, it seems people jump to find a hidden or significant reason behind everything. In turn, faulty logic comes in to play (in order to be "first" or due to emotions).
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that emergency drills are a regular occurrence, and disasters are not a regular occurrence, what other regular occurrences could you relate disasters to? It's not a coincidence that school shootings only seem to happen between 7AM and 3PM.

       It would be great to have some info as to the frequency of drills in different types of settings and not just "drills occur a lot." It would help that sort of rebuttal make a stronger impact on the correlation between disaster and drill. Also, I think you're misrepresenting the way that people focus on the connection between the two things; it's more about the drill being the same sort of event as the real disaster not that there is a drill happening. If you know that's what they are saying and you think it's silly, you just didn't make your argument clear. Saying that they are just connection mundane activities, such as school time, to a disaster is not at all what the drill/disaster people are saying.

        Until Sept. 11, 2001, NORAD conducted four major exercises a year. Most included a hijack scenario, but not all of those involved planes as weapons. Since the attacks, NORAD has conducted more than 100 exercises, all with mock hijackings.

       - just the first link on a google search. So the likelyhood of the kind of drill that was going on during 9/11 was roughly 1:91, except that particular drill was said to be "not a regularly scheduled drill," which makes it even more suspicious to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, to find out if this is coincidence or not someone would have to do much better research - find out how many drills of each type are performed and weigh it against terrorist events that happen, taking into account the similarity of the drills to the events, the institutions involved, the locations and distances apart, etc.
      </p>

       It would make an extremely interesting series of blog posts, if someone much less lazy than I were to take it on. But confirmation bias would have to be very strictly accounted for and neutralized.

       as ketomine said, " it does make sense that you'd practice for things like this when there are hundreds of people around." is there a more logical place to train for an attack than a place where an attack could actually happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this is a matter of interpretation. I do not interpret drills as being as significant/absurd/unusual as some might. I am not sure as to the exact frequency, but it would be reasonable to assume they happen more often than lethal attacks.

       You are correct that drills are not an unusual occurrence, but the coincedience of a drill running the same scenario as an actual disaster taking place is what people are pointing out. It's important to not get carried away, but these disasters are extraordinary situations so we ought to look towards these strange coinciding events. There is a transcript from 911 where a f15 pilot(or whatever the plane is, I'm not good with military names) has to ask the air controller giving him info if the report of planes being hijacked was part of the drill or real life. In that situation there were drills that followed the exact same format as the attacks. It isn't a smoking gun, but it's strange. There is a good list in the comments above, if you want a better idea of wht I'm talking about.

      <ul>
       <li>
        Getting your hands on all of that data would definitely be non-trivial
       </li>

        Writing the software to parse/examine the data and do the time &amp; location search is pretty straightforward. I could probably write it in about a day. Depending on the size of the dataset, it may take another day or two to run on my laptop, but nothing about that process would be hard or solving new problems.

       This very much. What exactly does a "drill" mean? Sure its a coincidence, but how does a drill make it a government plan? What is very plausible though is they had some indication of a bomb threat at the Boston marathon (with the amount of security/intelligence in the US i dont see how you could not have any indication) but not enough to shut down the event. So they had bomb sniffing dogs out there to try to find the possible bombs but were to late. Why dont they admit this? Most likely because they are still looking for those responsible and dont want to give out how much prior information they have to the terrorists so they dont know how much information they have about them, or how they got that information. As for the other ones on this list above, all the school shootings could be the same explanation, along with the london bombings. The 9/11 drills were fucking ANNUAL and happen every year at that time, and had nothing to do with passenger planes and buildings.

       No you're not.  Although I do have to catch myself from jumping to conclusions sometimes, Occam's Razor.  It's much more likely that there was some intelligence that there would be an attack than a worldwide conspiracy.

       And a list of tragedies with no drills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doing this kind of thing (list of tragedies with drills) is known as the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_sharpshooter_fallacy">
        Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy

       (thanks

       for the correct name and Wikipedia link).  Imagine a cowboy who takes shots at a barn, and then draws targets over all the bullet holes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that a list like this wouldn't be interesting, but I don't think it'd be all that helpful at identifying any kind of pattern without additional data.

       I definitely see where you are coming from. During the Sandy Hook incident, there was a link to DHS's calendar of events and they had some training exercise for dealing with children and tragedies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can understand training exercises for major events that involve a large gathering of people, but Sandy Hook doesn't fit that criteria. If it was a "spur of the moment" tragic accident with no significance to date or time.

       Also, to play devil's advocate, it's possible that once they identify a serious threat (like maybe noticing the very suspicious looking devices or receiving an anonymous tip) they tell the public that they're conducting a training exercise to not cause panic.

       Because they know
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       is "going" to happen.  You can either cancel one of the biggest annual events in the USA based on what you
       <strong>
        expect
       </strong>
       , or try to thwart an attack and pretend you didn't know anything.  The bombs could have been a dud like the NYT failed attack a couple years ago.

       Honestly as brutal as this attack was it seems like someone didn't want to go through with it at the last minute and disarmed a few of the bombs, or it just didn't go as horrifically as they planned, either way I think they expected it to be a lot worse than it was. Not that it wasn't fucking awful either way. I hate the fact that when you question the official story you're seen as a person who has no sympathy for the people who were hurt and killed, I feel terribly for the people involved and their families and that's what really breaks my heart the most.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people just aren't comfortable thinking anything different than what the media portrays because that would be saying our country knows something that we don't and possibly may have perpetrated such an attack and that is such an unsettling feeling, even for me.

       Why would you train on the day that your supposed to be doing your job. You don't see soldiers "training in battle" or firefighters practicing how to take off there equipment in the middle of a call. Why would you pull units away to train on the day where you were supposed to be ready to do your job. Training at an event like this I feel would take away key elements for no reason, especially if they have already been trained in their job, if not then maybe they shouldn't be there.

       Because they just happened to hold drills for passenger jets crashing into buildings, on the exact same day that passenger jets were crashing into buildings..because they just happened to hold drills for a mass casualty school shooting, not far from where an actual mass casualty shooting takes place...because they just happened to hold drills for bombings the exact time the London bombings took place..

       They were also holding drills for various other events on the same day, including a Bioterrorism threat, and a nuclear war with Russia simulation on the same day as 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also as for your sick sandy hook suggestions, the organization has a drill literally every 3rd day. Not to mention with the amount of organizations who are in the safety business, you could have a event where the president is being attacked by aliens made of jello, and SOMEONE SOMEWHERE would probably be having a drill about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention, exactly what use would a drill have? Considering the goal of these 'conspiracies' is to hurt and kill people to get laws you want passed, surely NOT having a drill would aid their cause, causing higher casualties and a more pressing 'need' for whatever thing the nutters on this website are against today.

       Shills are shilling tonight! Tone it down, you're too obvious. If you had been able to hold a decent conversation and provide facts to prove me wrong, your conversation would carry a lot more weight. Your response of attacks/name calling/aggressiveness has proven that you are here posting with an agenda. Sitting in mommy's basement making minimum wage to "fight the good fight" Wake the fuck up son, this shit's chess it ain't checkers. You're a pawn, a patsy, a tool.

       The purpose of the drills is to see how fast they can contain spread of word.

       They want to see how fast people use social media, internet, cellular. It was mentioned several times how social media "broke the news" before most news stations.

       They will use the disguise of drills, emergencies, events to utilize DHS's control over social media, internet, mobile

       . During a revolt they flip the kill switch on internet and mobile to prevent the general public from spreading any word and assembling.

      <p>
       I think that's how they will control the public.

       And you need a public facing drill to do a bomb drill there why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, for that to work you'd need to literally turn off the communication before the event, since this information literally travels faster than a earthquake.

       why would "they" intentionally give a "tell"? it's not like "they" just involuntarily make drills on the same day as these accidents/tragedies/whatever you want to call them; "they" have control over this shit. and what reasoning would "they" have for intentionally telling conspiracy theorists (for lack of a better term) unless "they" want us to know it's all a conspiracy? and why would "they" want to do that? all of it makes no sense to me personally, maybe you can clarify some of it. putting they in quotes because i have no idea who "they" are

What's the purpose of "drills" during a false flag operation, you're wondering? Simple, what happens if the operation goes badly and one of the "terrorists" should be caught by an honest cop? The honest cop can be told that the "terrorist" is part of a drill, therefore the "terrorist" is let go! Cute, huh?"

       It could also be used to put a bunch of dishonest cops on the ground, and they could very well be part of the terrorism also.  A drill lets the cops in the area be hand selected beforehand, no "first responders" in the area.
      </p>

       It also gives them a "valid" reason to be there beforehand.. you know, calmly walking on the roof.

       It gives them possible deniability to the lower level police, fbi ect. So they will say, were running a drill that a school shooting is going to take place, so when the shooting occurs there is a lot of confusion as to weather this is part of a  drill or not. It allows the people in charge to control the flow of information temporarily and clean up anything that needs cleaning up.

       I'm so confused, so what would it had meant if there was no drill? Would we be complaining and saying that they failed to do a drill and look for anything that could had potentially been dangerous? No one in this thread is every happy, if they do a drill, it's a conspiracy and if they don't do a drill, then they aren't doing their job and you complain and say they failed, etc, etc...what would you like for them to do!? If they do nothing, it's a tragedy but if they something, it's an inside job.

       These are the cops that are part of the drills.  It lets them hand select the ones that will be on the ground, to ensure that nothing "goes wrong."  It also gives them a valid reason to be in the area looking suspicious beforehand.

       When I saw that this happened, it broke my heart. Yes its sad, people got hurt and died. But shit like this happens all the time all over the world. I wonder what big news the media was trying to cover up? My first thought was "this is not a terrorist attack...." This is our Government trying to distill fear in the nation. David Icke says it best - problem, reaction, solution.

       If there were drills, there will be footage of it on somebody's camera. More likely, he saw the dogs that sweep the finishline looking for bombs... That is not weird. It happens every year.

       Could you provide source stating this kind of drill happens every marathon? There was one runner who was on record as saying that he has never seen this kind of thing in any of his marathons.

       The special ops cops are out every year that I have been down there (which is about 5 since 2003). They have K9 units out. The MA state police has confirmed that they swept the finish line before the race on the radio today. There is only one person (that was there) that claims there were drills going on. There are plenty of things the gov't is lying about. Don't dilute the pool with this BS.

       He's saying that you should look at times when drills did happen, and tragedies did not. He's not denying that a drill happened today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is fair. Compiling a list of drills that coincided with tragedies is like compiling a list of cloudy days that coincided with tragedies. It doesn't mean anything unless you can prove that it's more than a simple correlation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put simply, if you're to draw conclusions from a list of tragedies and corresponding drills, you need to look at tragedies with no corresponding drills and drills with no corresponding tragedies.

       Everyone knows the fact that the Boston Marathon has had these drills year after year (at least 6 years) is all just a huge cover up because EVERYTHING BAD THAT HAPPENS EVER is a conspiracy.

       I am presently unable to find a document suggesting that the Boston Marathon has bomb drills performed every year. Can you please link something that suggests that is the case, or are you and the GP speculating that they have a bomb drill at the Boston Marathon? I can see why it would be a sensible speculation, but is there something detailing these kind of drills in previous years?

       There is a long tradition of these operations taking place on "Jewish" or Israeli holidays...much too long to be coincidence.

       You are correct that drills are not an unusual occurrence, but the coincedience of a drill running the same scenario as an actual disaster taking place is what people are pointing out. It's important to not get carried away, but these disasters are extraordinary situations so we ought to look towards these strange coinciding events. There is a transcript from 911 where a f15 pilot(or whatever the plane is, I'm not good with military names) has to ask the air controller giving him info if the report of planes being hijacked was part of the drill or real life. In that situation there were drills that followed the exact same format as the attacks. It isn't a smoking gun, but it's strange. There is a good list in the comments above, if you want a better idea of wht I'm talking about.
