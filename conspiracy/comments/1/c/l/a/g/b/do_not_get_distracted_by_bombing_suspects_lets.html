       At this point it's obvious they were spec ops/undercover or something. I am referring to these guys:

      </p>
      <p>
       They are also seen in this video - walking around clearly more interested in security than helping anyone, and are all wearing the same thing (loading into a black SUV):
      </p>

      <p>
       A user pointed out (I will gladly credit you with this, but I don't know if you want to be called out, just being considerate) that the hat the one guy is wearing is this hat:
      </p>

      <p>
       which is also Chris Kyle's private security company, Craft Intl.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone jokingly suggested that COINTELPRO is spamming the bluejacket guys, etc., to divert attention. It's a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       But who are these guys, why were they there, and if they were SEALS - even more so, why were
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       there?

       Cause when we carry out secret public bombings everyone dresses the same and is obvious about it right? Theres no such thing as a military surplus store in America these days where people could buy all this clothing/backpacks.

      <p>
       Edit: Gonna leave this link of the Craft Intl. Online store here for yall. You'll find the boots and hat in there available to anyone.

       the pair can be seen after the explosion, it appears as though they are running, and the one without the hat has lost his backpack. Quite a big backpack to misplace, if you ask me..

       the clock says 4:11:40, bomb already went off and they both have their backpacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       in your picture you see that the clock says 4:15:49. In the meantime the black car arrived and one of their colleagues is handling a backpack on the ground. Probably the guy who dropped it to go wherever they're running.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to answer to OP: security guards in uniform is not exactly what i'd call "undercover".

       We've already established that the top photo was taken
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the bombs went off, and they're still wearing the backpacks. Also, if they were "undercover", they'd likely be toning down the military and PMC gear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks like private security to me - why they're there, i don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit
       </strong>
       - There were a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of these guys hanging around, many with black backpacks. Not sure what this means or why they're there, but the answer to those questions will be very interesting.

       Op wasn't saying they're suspects but just what were mercenaries doing there when the place was already packed with cops?
      </p>
      <p>
       People in other threads were saying the backpacks were to detect nukes and the earpiece was part of the device (like headphones on metal detectors).
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously they're covert security of some sort, but the question is was there a drill like some eyewitnesses reported that officials denied? Was there a prior threat reported which was also denied? Are blackwater-type security personnel common at non-vip events like this in American cities?

       They were most likely involved in the "drill" that was taking place. There was a lot of security there. Including bomb sniffing dogs as well. And agents telling people to "calm down its a drill" shorty before the explosion. In my mind the most likely scenario is inside involvement. While all departments were busy focusing on the real world drill that was taking place 2 bombs were detonated. 99% of the people involved with the drill were in the dark about the actual explosives. Only a small fraction of people at the deepest level planned and executed this attack. The bomber, if not involved directly with the conspirators, was places there by them. It feels like they may have fucked this one up though. They usually have a direct story or narrative by now. So either something else is in the works or they are racing to cover their tracks.

       No, timing. They need to break it either tomorrow or Friday so there's breaking news with which the punditry covers up the simultaneous passage of CISPA and possibly striking a two-fer in people missing the 'border security' provisions in the immigration bill (meant to fence us in, not keep immigrants out).

       Not throughout. Before. It's a four hour event with hundreds of thousands of people in transition during the entire event and with access to an entire city. I'm sure you could do better, though.

       this is a false dichotomy based on the assumption that the 'government' is one entity, and completely transparent at all levels and departments.  clearly ridiculous.  try again.

       I've figured it out:

      <p>
       If there is security present - gobmint false flag carried out by security group

      <p>
       If no security present - MKULTRA!!!!!!! patsy did it and the gobmint pulled security in that area so it could happen.

       Do not get distracted by the security personnel, lets focus on who actually set up and set off the bombs.

       Hey, thanks for posting that NBC link.  I've been trying to get this into the conversation for the last couple of days, but it just hasn't stuck yet.  Anyone that hasn't seen it should do so now.  It's like playing "Where's Waldo"? Keep your eyes open for "black hats, coats, back packs with khaki pants and shoes".  This may well be part of a civilian support group, but then again, why all the black back packs, and WHY are they loading stuff INTO a black SUV?  It also looks like some of them are wearing body armor.

       The black suburban is the Department of Homeland Security's satellite communication vehicle. The guys running around with radiation meters are probably with the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office.

       I just feel like the whole point of having those "agents" there was a giveaway. When the LA marathon goes on, I never see any of these people? Why this year, 13 years after the last attack would they be there? it doesn't make sense.
