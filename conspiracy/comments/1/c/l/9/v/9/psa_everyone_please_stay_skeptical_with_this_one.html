        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/J59KuC7.jpg">fake Donna Bruce image</a>, and the fake facebook thing (which turns out, you can change the name and URL of any page if it has under 200 likes or so),the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/fox-pulls-family-guy-episode-following-boston-bombings-024834408--finance.html">alleged foreknowledge of the attack in a Family guy episode</a> (which was actually edited form 2 different episodes), and the <a href="http://imgur.com/a/7bJWG">images of guys in NAVY seal attire</a> with backpacks (why the fuck would a covert op dress the perps <em>as</em> Seals?),  this <em>really</em> stinks to high hell to me. I personally think it&#39;s possible that these are not only misinfo/jokes but deliberate dis info. All I ask is that everyone be <em>extra</em> careful with what seems like evidence with this one. </p>

<p>the <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/04/17/298720/falseflag-meme-surrounds-boston-blasts/">mainstream speculation of a false flag</a>, , and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axQtAFtmtVA&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player">this video by Alex Jones</a>  are red flags to me as well.  </p>

<p>claims have been made in the past that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=alex+jones+stratfor&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Alex Jones is connected to Stratfor</a> and he <em>is</em> always making &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; look stupid. He gives a lot of good info but makes us look crazy in the process —whether that be through presenting no facts in his debate with Piers Morgan or just having absolutely no filter and screaming like a lunatic—further alienating us from the public. Very good controlled opposition if he is one. I always pondered there would be one day when he spread disinfo, and i think this might be it (or maybe he just got fooled or maybe this stuff is legit; draw your own conclusions!). there has already been way more disinfo than usual from this specific event and i think, if this was an FF— which i think there is some supportive evidence of at this point due to the drills, the shills, the disinfo, that CISPA and gun control are being voted on in the house right now, the drop in gold/silver prices, and <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/16/17781845-bush-era-torture-use-indisputable-guantanamo-must-close-task-force-finds?lite">torture/gitmo stuff</a> released today— that part of reason for it is to wedge the &#39;awake&#39; and the &#39;asleep&#39; further apart. But I digress.</p>

<p>Government&#39;s have plans and back up plans and back up plans to back up plans and decades of work that go into false flags before they are committed. To take something as big as the mercenaries wearing NAVY attire, reusing the same &#39;crisis actor&#39;, alluding to foreknowledge of a false flag in a cartoon, or making a facebook about it before it happened as truth without question and say &quot;<em>this</em>! This is it! Finally a smoking gun!&quot; is terribly naive. </p>

<p><strong>Regardless of your take on it being a false flag or not, or Jones, or whatever else you may disagree with in my post, just please everyone be very skeptical of any &#39;smoking gun&#39; evidence you see regarding this event, or just anything that seems too obvious, and double check your sources before circulating <em>anything</em>. Even from people you trust. Now is a time where we <em>especially</em> need to question everything and Trust no one!</strong></p>

His fandom need to listen to his Y2K broadcast, watch his disruption of an Austin peace rally, and know he is a millionaire living in a mansion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s the state between alpha and delta, so it is on the border of sleep. it&#39;s the hypnotherapists ideal state, as it offers access to subconscious structures. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Receptivity for learning is related to specific states of consciousness. Predominant brain wave patterns are associated with different states of consciousness or awareness. For example, beta frequencies ranging from 13-26 Hz are associated with concentration, and alert problem solving; alpha frequencies (8-13 Hz) occur when the eyes are closed and a state of alert relaxation is present; theta (4-7 Hz) is associated with deep relaxation with a high receptivity for new experiences and learning...&quot; Check the works of speech-language pathologist Suzanne Evans Morris. She explains: &quot;The presence of theta patterns (4-7 Hz) in the brain has been associated with states of increased receptivity for learning and reduced filtering of information by the left hemisphere&quot;. </p>

<p>Neurotechnology and biofeedback researcher Thomas Budzynski has done extensive research on learning and suggestion when the brain is in a theta state. Theta, Budzynski suggested, is the state in which &quot;super-learning&quot; takes place -- when in theta, people are able to learn new languages,accept suggestions for changes in behavior and attitudes, or memorize large amounts of information. He says: &quot; In this state, Budzynski says, &quot;A lot of work gets done very quickly.&quot; </p>

<p>Budzynski and psychobiologist Dr. James McGaugh of the University of California at Irvine have both found that information is also more easily processed and recalled in a theta state&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please read my first paragraph: <em>why</em> the hell would mercenaries <em>dress</em> as mercenaries in front of hundreds of cameras to commit a false flag? There are 3 options: 1) These guys just <em>look</em> suspicious but were actually just by standers 2) This was not perpetrated by the government but by some other, lower level, organization 3) The government <em>wants</em> people to suspect a false flag. 4?) Patsies to blame right wing ex-NAVY extremists?</p>

<p>Our government has plans and back up plans and back up plans to back up plans and decades of work that go into false flags before they are committed. To assume that something as big as the mercenaries wearing NAVY attire, reusing the same &#39;crisis actor&#39;, alluding to the attack on Family Guy,  or making a facebook about it should <em>immediately</em> stink to high hell to anyone who has been paying attention for even a few months. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;the images of guys in NAVY seal attire with backpacks (why the fuck would a covert op dress the perps as Seals?), this really stinks to high hell to me.&quot;</p>

<p>Could it be because maybe, just like your assumption above, people would never accuse seals in uniform of bombing civilians in a marathon.?In plain sight deception? It is one thing to not believe the Alex Jones shit, and it is another to also blind oneself of another possible alternative. Why couldn&#39;t the seals be planted in  obvious uniform , So identifiable and yet the perfect perpetrators in plain sight?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My speculations are unnecessary to the point of my post however i felt they could add to support it. Im not blinding myself of anything nor saying its impossible that what youre saying is true. All im saying is that everyone needs to notice when things dont add up and make sure that their evidence is sound and that they are following a logical pattern. As of yet, these &quot;smoking guns&quot; do not do that.  We often want to wake people up so bad that we will jump to conclusions at the first sign of a &#39;smoking gun&#39; and end up looking like idiots. For the sake of our credibility, and for the sake of just maintaining open mindedness, in lieu of what seems like deliberate disinformation, we must question everything even from people we think are on our side. Thats my only point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A reminder...Agent Jones is a STRATFOR employee hired for the sole purposes of spreading disinformation, making &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; look like lunatics, and to further any and all Zionist agendas.</p>

<p>He is a con, plain and simple. A &quot;honeypot&quot; if you will for the FAR less advanced &#39;conspiratards.&#39;</p>

<p>He is a slave to George Friedman--Zionist owner of STRATFOR--and for rabid Zionist Jeffrey R. Smulyan, chairman and CEO of Emmis (Hebrew for &#39;truth&#39;) Communications.</p>

<p>These people cut Jones&#39; checks and tell him precisely what to say, when and how to say it, and what adverts for shafty gold dealers, seed vendors, and ineffective diet products go in between his embarrassing disinformation rants--in which Zionists or Jews are NEVER called out. Some say that his Jewish Zionist wife, Kelly Preston Nichols, is his agency &quot;handler.&quot;</p>

<p>If Jones had the balls to talk about the REAL problem facing this country--organized Jewry--Smulyan and STRAFOR would have him off the air immediately.</p>

<p>Remember this simple chain: CIA&gt;Trapwire&gt;STRATFOR (Israeli agents)&gt;Molly Maroney&gt;Agent Jones.</p>

<p>It does NOT get any clearer than that. He is there to fleece the goyim while letting the REAL criminals, the Zionist Ashkenazi Jews, get a free pass every time.</p>

<p>Want to know who &#39;they&#39; will look towards first when the revolution comes? That&#39;s right...the suckers that are subscribed to PrisonPlanet and InfoWars and comment. If you do, trust me, it&#39;s too late--you have already been put on a list of &quot;suspected&quot; domestic terrorists.</p>

<p>This is TRUE information and a very quick Google/Bing search will tell you all that you need to know--if that fucking INSANE rant on cunt Piers Morgan&#39;s show didn&#39;t already school you a bit. AJ is NOT ineloquent and is NOT stupid. He fakes &quot;passion&quot; incredibly well and very convincingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive seen this view point a lot and they always seem to have some good points but the racism just makes it hard to believe it is founded in fact. Do you believe all jews are part of this plan? Do you believe there is something intrinsic to judaism that makes them evil?

    <div class="md"><p>For me, I enjoy being self-righteously angry, and yelling at people. Things like this get me in trouble with the girlfriend, so I&#39;ve chosen work (law) and recreation (hanging out here) that allow me to indulge it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not having the basic understanding to identify the fact that you begin dialougue in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> tells me you&#39;re bias. There are little to no facts known at this point so how can there be a conspiracy. It is called confirmation bias. It&#39;s a psychology term used to describe situations were people look past the obvious to see what they want. You even say someone is making you look stupid. You even look around that to conserve your bias. It&#39;s disrespectful to those effected to potentially misguide public on individuals involved. The soccer coach has been bashed continuously but yet despite information squashing one conspiracy, another one pops up literally from thin air due to bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what I asked. It&#39;s widely understood <em>why</em> people are skeptics, I&#39;m asking why you come here and instead of providing logical argument you just troll. If you get mass down voted for posted what you believe to be logical argument, and it pisses you off, why do you come here? </p>

<p>edit: and of all the posts to make a comment like you did, why this one? I am telling people to double check sources before claiming things, and to remain skeptical on <em>all</em> ends. I even put a disclaimer at the end that regardless of my speculations or your thoughts on my speculations, that you need to make sure your evidence is actually evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Partially based on how I &quot;Reddit&quot;. I scroll through the top threads of the hour. I was curious what content would bring this thread up this high that fast. It didn&#39;t take me long to figure out it is caused by a group of folk upvoting every &quot;conspiracy&quot; thread. There is no skepticism if all threads get up voted. I commented merely because it is one of a few I will ever read. I&#39;m <a href="http://deadspin.com/the-boston-bombing-witch-hunt-bags-another-innocent-kid-476001019?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&amp;amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=socialflow">pissed</a> because these victims are being treated as suspects due to such threats. There is no content in these threads, no thought, no skepticism. There is only fabrication that gets circle jerked around until climax occurs enough to move to the next <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this may be where your problem resides. &quot;Free thinking&quot; communities such as r/conspiracy do not upvote things based on their credibility, they.. We upvote things to get attention to them; to get more people to be able to check sources, to speculate, to be skeptical. This isnt r/news, this isnt r/politics, this is /rwhatif, or<a href="/r/whatdoyouthinkaboutthis">/r/whatdoyouthinkaboutthis</a>, or whatever else. Things which are interesting, things which we believe need to be analyzed by as many people as possible, things which we want more info on plays a part in what gets upvoted around here. The top post could be total horseshit but it is up voted so that we can anaylze and find out that it IS total horseshit. If you dont like thinking for yourself, you dont like questioning things, you dont like analyzing and proving or disproving credibilities yourself; you only want to be TOLD what is fact and only presented with information once it is absolutely confirmed as fact, then thats okay, but r/conspiracy and conspiracytheory in general is not for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive seen this view point a lot and they always seem to have some good points but the racism just makes it hard to believe it is founded in fact. Do you believe all jews are part of this plan? Do you believe there is something intrinsic to judaism that makes them evil? Zionists are not the same thing as jews, however i do think they hide under the guise of anti semitism; i dont think doing exactly what they want (blaming all jews) is helping our cause though. </p>
