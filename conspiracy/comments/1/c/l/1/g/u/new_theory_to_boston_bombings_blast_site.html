       But after combing through the photos of the blast site (not posting any, theres enough on here) I noticed the glass is blown outwards TOWARDS the street. Theres a good shot of the site with a bomb unit guy in walking through the site. The bomb may have been placed inside that shop/office. As for the black mark on the ground from the apparent bomb, Im not sure how to explain it yet. But, glass and debris blows away from the bomb. The way the glass is layed out does not make sense.

       No one here has pointed out anything "impossible" about the scientific validity of anything.

       Glass has a flex-point. It isn't completely rigid. When a large amount of force is applied against the surface, it will flex in the direction the force is pushing it (inward, in the case of these windows) before shattering with force in the opposite direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to test this yourself, go buy a tempered glass desk from Ikea. Lay it on its side so that the glass is vertical. Smash the glass with a hammer. The glass will not all naturally blow forward in the direction of your swing, it will flex slightly, come back, shatter, and send shards of glass flying
       <em>
        in your direction, which is the direction of the force acting upon it. Equal and opposite.
       </em>

       Do you even remember Newton's Third Law?

       You are remarkably immature, and even more remarkably unaware of simple science. I appreciate the fact that you completely ignored the rest of my post, probably because it didn't confirm your ridiculous conspiratorial thinking. Physics is not the gubment's doing.

       So you claim an honors degree, but you mix up your/you're, and interpret hyperbole literally all while working backwards from conspiracy theory to explanation rather than the other way around, ignoring Newton's Third Law to convince yourself of a conpiracy to...what, exactly? Place a bomb inside a building and then claim it was outside of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt you're even out of highschool. 
Also? If there really had been a bomb
       <em>
        inside
       </em>
       of the building, don't you think you'd observe more damage
       <em>
        inside
       </em>
       of the building? There's very little damage in there. Why? Because the glass protected the inside up until the point at which it shattered outwards. Because the bomb was not inside the building.

       You're just not very good at this 'refuting' thing. Don't claim to understand physics well if you find something as simple as newton's third law so perplexing. The explanation for the glass is rooted in it.

       I think everything? Hey look, you're contriving an argument out of thin air.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're nothing more than a troll. You've not published anything. You're reactionary and quick to dispose of logic and reason for paranoia and conspiracy-confirming re-explanations. You want to see conspiracy, so you take "this is a conspiracy" and work backwards from there, looking for circumstantial evidence to support that claim rather than letting evidence lead you to that conclusion of its own merit. This is not how a healthy person thinks.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, you said this;
"I can't find any with such little damage. It must have been a very small and feeble device. Look how little damage it did. Mostly noise and smoke."
      </p>
      <p>
       Which indicates you've spent very little time researching the subject of which you'd like to speak, as the composition of this bomb is pretty well understood at this point. It was a low-velocity explosive with primarily anti-personnel features, virtually the same construction as many IEDs. Powder and nails/bearings in a pressure cooker.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't be responding to you further because I'd rather not contribute to your delinquency.

       Biting one more time, at the risk of my own credibility;
      </p>
      <p>
       Our government covers up lots of things, lies often, presents half-truths more often, and murders more often than either, primarily overseas. MLK Jr's assassination was almost assuredly an inside job. Authority is far from infallible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument is a very, very thin strawman in which you project every quality you dislike onto me. I've not parroted any 'official narrative', nor anything at all for that matter. I've merely referenced the composition of the bomb, which is consistent with the injuries of the
       <em>
        real people
       </em>
       affected by this tragedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracies exist. This probably isn't one of them. Even if it is, the thought that
       <em>
        the entire thing is fake
       </em>
       is borderline insane on your part and displays absolutely no connection to reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I myself am a photographer for a particular independent news source that I will not reference here, but it is one that is typically considered to be anti-authoritarian and one that has been referenced positively in this subreddit many times before. I have plenty of contacts in Boston. This was a real incident, no matter who the source of the bomb turns out to be. Are the doctors and surgeons of every Boston-region hospital paid actors? Where does your conspiratorial line of thinking end, exactly? Who's real? Is the entire Boston Marathon a shill's convention, in your eyes?

       this is also hearsay.   you did not witness those injuries yourself.  to me they look fake.  the leg is especially poorly done.   did you not watch the videos that Stu Segall put out?  You refuse to consider any alternative theory, even when presented with evidence that it can, has and is being done - hyper-real training.   stress innoculation.

       watch it.  the guy with the fake leg injury (in a wheelchair!!!) is apparently one of the actors.   the cowboy hat guy is linked with prosthetic productions too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a real staged incident.   Tell me you believe that a guy with a real blown off leg would be sat in a wheelchair.  Ridiculous.

       I've seen Stu Segall's work before. While it's certainly very close, it's not hard to see the 'seams' of his prosthetic work if you actually are able to see where the prosthetic ends. One of the examples you yourself have posted before has a very visible 'end.' Simulations look much more realistic when you've no experience with the reality of such events, something you clearly lack.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy in the wheelchair was placed in the wheelchair because it was on-hand, not because it was the most medically sound way of treating him. Improvisation happens. Tourniquettes are an improvisation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Him being in the wheelchair only affirms even further that the event was real. If it were planned, they'd have thought to use a gurney instead
       <em>
        precisely because of people with your thinking.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The cowboy hat guy is a well-known peace activist who I have personally met and spoken with in the past for his criticism of the Iraq War.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not even going to touch the irony of linking to a fox news video in contrast to your tone about media, 'sanctioned stories', and the government. Positively, absolutely absurd.

       Lawsuits happen.  If that was my kid and had his legs blown off I'd sue the hell out of those 'responders' for putting him a position to risk bleeding out.  It's ridiculous.  A photo op.  A visceral and impactful one.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other photos that you can see the seam of the prosthetic where it attaches to his hips.  Another photo actually shows more detail of the prosthetic.  Besides,  the shape, length, and anatomy aren't done very well.   It's hollywood SFX, and the explosions were clearly pyro.

       He has tourniquettes tied to both legs, and his exposed artery is being pinched shut by "the man in the cowboy hat." He was at more risk of bleeding out sitting on the concrete waiting for a gurney in a panicked situation than in that wheelchair.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like how you claimed photos exist proving his injuries to be fake, but you didn't bother linking to them. I wonder if that's because you're just a troll conjuring things up for effect? Care to link to them?

       There were plenty of medics on scene (according to their visible labelled outfits)  why let this guy get the photo ops with the american flags and all.  do you know how Tough Ruck is?

       You realize the photo you're referring to was the work of an AP photographer, right? That people you don't personally know have names and existences that can be verified?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think the AP is government-sponsored?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no 'american flag' in the photo you're talking about, by the way. There are stars on a blue field in the background, but that is part of the decoration for the marathon route. Photographers do, in fact, make composition choices on the fly. For example, that photo obeys the rule of thirds. A photo being visually striking does not mean being fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still waiting on those photos you were talking about that prove his injuries are prosthetic. I suspect I'll have to keep waiting with no response from you on the matter.

       you sound really naive.  I understand why you might have such faith in the independence of journalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can see an american flag has been placed by the head of one of the alleged victims.   at first he sits up, then lies down, then a couple of frames later there's an american flag next to his head.   you can also see 'carlos' grabbing a flag before he attends to the leg wound actor.
      </p>
      <p>
       these photos are all available the same to you and me.  look yourself.  the photo with Vogt on the ground holding his 'leg' are ridiculously obviously fake.  zoom in you can see the seam that you mentioned was in the other faked trauma scene video using amputee actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       shocking?   you'd hope so, but we're on guard to look out for these shenanigans.  we've been conditioned to expect fakery, while others are clearly conditioned to be duped.

       First photo is extremely blurry, and not something you can glean
       <em>
        anything

       about Jeff Bauman Jr from, except that he has leg injuries and the color of the blood is consistent with arterial bleeding which would, itself, be consistent with his wounds.

       Third photo: he isn't waving the flag, he is holding it. Many people wave flags at the boston marathon. The only thing 'wrong' with this photo is that it has been over-sharpened, either by an amateur photojournalist or by image compression.

       Where did you get the information that this was the identity of that person?  Facebook?  If another source, where did they get their information from .. Facebook?   Do you want me to take Facebook as a reliable source?  Kooky.

       He picks up the flag on the scene.. you can see it in the photo sequence on Flickr.

       What's wrong with the photo?  You won't take my authority on it, so I've taken the liberty of arranging a discussion with experts.   One expert is a prosthetic special effects producer, another is a surgeon.  It seems you defer to authority, so I'll allow them to convince you, if you won't believe your own lying eyes.

       You linked to a photo taken from a website with that name. I was referring to that in a slightly facetious manner because it absolutely confirms suspicions about the type of theorist you are.

       No, not a facebook message. Jeff Bauman Jrs own profile, paired with photos he is in, as well as photos other people are in who are also on facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either there are a LOT of fake people, or he's a real person.
It's worth noting, by the way, that Nick Vogt bears very little resemblance to Jeff Bauman Jr. in any of the countless photos that exist of him

       Operations blends advanced special effects, actors, and rapidly reconfigurable sets to create training grounds so real that troops feel the stress of the battlefield--and hopefully innoculate themselves against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amputees are hired as actors, and given prosthetic limbs and blood pumps to simulate the goriest of wounds. Bilingual actors are also employed, dressed in authentic wardrobe, trained in cultural cues and jobs, and adept at playing out any number of scenes. For certain projects, the company hires as many as 400 actors and 250 part-time workers to polish a scenario. "It becomes so intense and real," says Lavell. "I've seen medics freeze up--some not knowing what's going on."

       That isn't proof of this being fake in the slightest. It is merely proof that military training aims to be as realistic as possible (although its still clearly
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       real when actually compared side-by-side with the reality of war.)
      </p>
      <p>
       You're also continuing to ignore the fact that it's known the blasts were low-velocity with the majority of the damage being the result of
       <em>
        shrapnel
       </em>
       not
       <em>
        concussive force
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       One cannot fake shrapnel without creating real shrapnel. Small shrapnel is obviously going to have a much more visible effect on soft tissue  than on pavement or brick. The effect is also obviously present on the wood surfaces at the scene, such as the barricade/fencing. You aren't thinking half-critically.

       I've endured more physics lectures and exams than you want to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your analogy is BS.  Nobody hit that window with a hammer, it was hit by a rapidly expanding volume of air.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do also  know that when an explosion occurs that a large volume of air is forced out of the area of the explosion.  This creates a vacuum.  That might explain some of the glass damage outside the store - but from the looks of it, it exploded outwards from inside the store, and the vacuum effect isn't consistent with views of the blast (e.g. flags blowing)
      </p>
      <p>
       here's a video of it.  watch the flags.  In a little, then out.  Possibly this is what caused glass to fly out of the window towards the explosion?   Do you have any video of another similar event?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't find any with such little damage.  It must have been a very small and feeble device.  Look how little damage it did.  Mostly noise and smoke.

       I know, it seems a bit farfetched but im thinking the same thing. Maybe even wired together so both went off but one being more powerful. Its just tht glass that goes right out to the sidewalk that concerns me. i was thinking maybe it was from windows above, but that wouldnt have shaped out the way it is in the pics

       See my response to marcy_anon.
Alternatively, here's a video of windows blowing out in Russia after the meteor impact, due to the shockwave. Note that they flex inward, then return outward. These windows were regular pane glass rather than tempered glass (which is the type of glass that shatters into billions of pieces, as witnessed in Boston) and remained largely in one piece. Tempered glass is designed to fragment with such force as a safety measure, as large shards of glass are typically more dangerous.

       The streets of that city were
       <em>
        littered
       </em>
       with glass following the impact, because this is entirely standard behavior for a window that has been blown out by an external shockwave.

       Either all of those buildings also had bombs inside, or this is just another case of people forgetting highschool physics.

       Yeah but the pics also show areas of concrete on the sidewalk blasted out, if the bomb was on the sidewalk it would have done that. On mobile so don't have a pic to reference but many of them show it.

       I noticed that at first when this came on air. But then I figured it was just so obvious that everyone knew and it wasn't out of the ordinary.

       The irony is palpable. I do, indeed, believe you are schizophrenic. Please seek medical advice.
