    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry to admit we&#39;re a tiny minority... But we actually care.  That&#39;s why we&#39;re here.  I can&#39;t speak for everybody in this subreddit, but I&#39;m here because of the injustice our government has imposed on the rest of the world through the most ruthless and systematic destruction of democratically elected governments in the history of the world.</p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t realize that slaves make their clothes and tires and gadgets and farm their food, and they wonder why they can&#39;t find a job.</p>

<p>Almost nobody realizes that THIS ALL HAPPENED BY DESIGN.  Our government knew that our manufacturing jobs would be outsourced as soon as all of these free trade agreements were signed.</p>

<p>Back in the day we had tariffs to protect the industries and workers in our country.  I don&#39;t know what happened, but if I were to guess I&#39;d say some threshold was crossed a long time ago where the largest corporations were able to wrest the control of our government (and hence our military) out of the public&#39;s hands.</p>

<p>Now corporations are international and they manipulate our elections and nobody knows the difference.</p>

<p>I think it probably happened with Kennedy&#39;s assassination, but it could have been before and nobody knew it.  Maybe before the Korean War?</p>

<p>Anyway, things seem to be accelerating.  More and more brazen actions are taken and more power is seized all the time by our government.  It&#39;s not a democracy anymore, it&#39;s not a republic anymore.  It&#39;s a corporatocracy where the highest bidder controls the narrative and the elections and the government.</p>

<p>We&#39;re so fucked.</p>

<p>I edited this post after I re-read it, because i fucked up some points I wanted to make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is because Americans and the media can identify with (predominantly) white middle class people being killed and injured. It is harder to identify with someone from a country around the world who is brown, doesn&#39;t speak your language and the government and media tell you are your enemy or at least an unnamed civilian.</p>

<p>This is where a good news media would put the tragedies in context, instead of just nonstopping tragedy and crying mothers (or barely covering it at all in the case of Iraqi/Afghanistan civilians). When was the last time you heard the name of a civilian killed in Iraq? What color was their skin?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the most productive discussion and opening statements, your tone could be improved as the OP! </p>

<p>As for your point, it&#39;s a worry, isn&#39;t it? The mainstream media is there to warp peoples perception of the worlds affairs (not even needing to delve in to a rabbit hole of any type here, we simply know how much major news is omitted from getting much coverage, if any, in the US) </p>

<p>One observation worth noting though is that <em>the people themselves</em> can ultimately be what in the end determines what kind of news we hear over time. theoretically, people could have simply been disinterested in news not directly concerning their immediate homeland, over time, that homestead issues were specifically prioritized over more global variants. </p>

<p>now, this does nothing to explain the obfuscation and lack of coverage altogether on some very serious events (ie: sadr city). the bigger issue here is quite simple: death is both completely marginalized and ignored, and exploited at the same time. why is this?</p>

<p>the huge loss of life suffered all the time around the world is caused by stuff we could work to prevent. yet it&#39;s not really on the agenda for those in power. that brings us up to this finger pointing step we have now, really trying to find out who&#39;s fighting for the other man, and who&#39;s fighting for themselves still</p>

<p>it&#39;s a very simple mindset, a global <em>consciousness</em> shift. it&#39;s inevitable, but we&#39;re continuing to feel the blood that is shed by it in turn for its welcoming grasp. like the caress of an incapacitating intoxicant slowly washing over your body, our manifestation of it is our planetary strife before it obtains true global link</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because they&#39;re different. I don&#39;t frequent this sub very often, so I don&#39;t really know what the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> general consensus is on drone attacks (just a guess, I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t like them), so just bear with me while I look at this from a purely objective point of view. </p>

<ul>
<li>Drone strikes in fact are highly controversial and receive a lot of press. In general however, regardless of your views on them, drone attacks are always on positively identified terrorist targets. Naturally, there will be innocent people in the area, and that sucks. However, the point is, is that they&#39;re known terrorist sites and the logistics just warrant a drone strike more than say, a ground assault. Not only that, but the US has admitted to them being from us, unlike terrorism where the initiators often go into hiding. Again, not saying whether this is right or wrong, just looking at it from a logical standpoint.</li>
<li>In regards to the Boston Bombing, it&#39;s generally regarded as terrorism more so than the drone strikes because the bombs were seemingly intended solely for innocent civilians, and they were secretly dropped and detonated unlike when the US conducts a drone attack, in which we all know that it&#39;s the US.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, this is open to debate and if anyone disagrees or whatnot, feel free to comment and open a discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why? Because many Americans completely absorb whatever the TV throws at them. Americans think that they are <em>directly effected</em> by stuff they see on TV, if the TV tells them so. Lots of comments on the Boston bombing are about the events effecting &quot;someone we know&quot; even though the commenter could be over a thousand miles away (and still be in the US).</p>

<p>Of course that mindset discounts the value of human life (by ranking one life over another) but it seems pretty common in the main subreddit comments on Boston right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a concept in philosophy, &quot;Moral Proximity.&quot;  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090922030127/http://www.revkevindeyoung.com/2009/08/social-justice-and-poor-1.html">Here&#39;s</a> an excellent description of it, though the term should be pretty straightforward anyway:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Moral proximity does not refer to geography, though that can be part of the equation. Moral proximity refers to how connected we are to someone by virtue of familiarity, kinship, space or time. Therefore, in terms of moral proximity I am closer to my brothers and sisters at University Baptist just down the road from us in East Lansing than I am to First Baptist in Tuscaloosa (Iâ€™m assuming thereâ€™s a First Baptist there). But physical distance is not the only consideration. In terms of moral proximity, I am closer to my brother-in-law who lives in Australia than to a stranger I havenâ€™t met who lives on the other side of Lansing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rationale is almost explicitly empathetic.  You can feel more empathy more easily for someone who you are proximate to than for someone who are not.  Just straight up, we can all say, here in America, even if we haven&#39;t been to Boston, I could have been there.  We can all say, that could have been my city, my family at the finish line, my friends laying in the street.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s scarier.  Few of us can empathize with those in Pakistan.  We can with those in Boston.  That doesn&#39;t make it more or less of a tragedy, it&#39;s just how people work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so much about the body count as it is that we saw this happen - practically live on television.  It was entirely unexpected and so raw.  The fear and panicked screams, the people rushing back and forth to get away or to offer aid - it was in real time and elicited an adrenaline fueled emotional reaction in a way that scenes of buildings that have already been bombed and footage of cloth draped corpses in a row just doesn&#39;t.  The bombed buildings and news of &quot;50 Dead in Suicide Bomb&quot; being reported a day after it happens on the other side of the world creates a different sort of emotional response - sympathy, sure, but also we are very disconnected from it and so it isn&#39;t as emergent as the Boston situation.   </p>

    <div class="md"><pre><code>What you are forgetting is there are usually 25,000+  people from all over the world who participate in the Boston marathon that has been going on for over a 100 years. At one point there were over 38,000 attendees, Plus there are usually 500,000+ spectators who come to watch this marathon. This could have been much much worse and it was already bad enough.  This is also part of 6 World Marathon Majors.   This to me is the almost the equivalent of someone trying to blow up the Olympics.  This event is for promoting good will and having fun. If this were to happen in any of the other countries that host any of the 6 marathons I am pretty damn sure you would be seeing it over here in the news.   So this isn&#39;t just about 3 dead, this is basically an attack on the 525,000+ humans from around the world who participated who were there.

    <div class="md"><p>This is the most biased rant and question I&#39;ve ever heard of. Why? Because the drones strikes and death tolls together are NEVER brought up until some shooting or tragedy happens in the U.S. and people start mourning. </p>

<p>Meaning you, the OP and others who do this, do not care for those people in the Middle East either until moments such as this when it fuels your bias. Sure, you and others may rant about drones all the time but there&#39;s never any actual mention of the victims or names or death counts.</p>

<p>Way to go on exploiting the deaths of those in the Middle East and at home to serve your own biased views.</p>

<p>Oh, and while we&#39;re on the topic of people needlessly dying around the world.. What about the people in Africa getting burned or killed for being gay or accused of being a witch? I&#39;m speaking of people getting shoved into fires and burned alive and all this is encouraged by the visiting churches from America. </p>

<p>What about the tribes in South Africa getting wiped out by drug Warlords, private militias, and mercenaries hired by companies in order for their land to be taken over? Or how mercenaries hired by Mars Inc. KILL workers who harvest and process cocoa because they actually want some minimum work benefits and quality? The very chocolate that goes into candy bars and m&amp;m&#39;s. Why is that never brought up?</p>

<p>You want to point out the travesties and massacres around the world every time America mourns for the loss of their own? Then stop being hypocritical and focus more on just the victims of drone strikes. ..Or don&#39;t, because it doesn&#39;t serve your agenda.</p>

This is a really hefty thing to ask, and as is being covered elsewhere in the thread, it&#39;s about how personally connected people really were. You&#39;re right, a lot of people are ignorant about many things, but it&#39;s changing.

<p>That is a big deal, but a bigger deal is the death of 40 people at the same day in Iraq caused by bomb explosions, and what sad about it is no one huge western media or politician payed attention as they did for the three deaths in Boston. </p>

Media is a manufactured perspective most likely giving 80% coverage to 20% of the dumbs***s .  Please do not let the media divide us,  we are better than that .  David Icke has identified your enemy it is Rothchild Zionism. If you want to refute me on that them fine , but at some point you cannot organize and attack if you do not know your enemy.

Everyone can improve their quality of life directly by fighting them. Just look at how people you know condemn themselves regularly with wrong beliefs.
