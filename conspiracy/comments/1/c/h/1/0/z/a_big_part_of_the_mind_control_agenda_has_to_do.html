Conspiracy means people plotting in secret. There is nothing crazy about that, it happens all the time. You&#39;ve been conditioned to think this way on purpose.

If I do, they will laugh at me, which will cause unbearable psychological distress.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see this statistic backed up by a source, but if it <em>is</em> the case, possibly because the have-nots are the ones being screwed by a plan among the wealthy to keep their wealth. </p>

<p>So throw away the &quot;theorist&quot; part and substitute &quot;analyst&quot; in the term conspiracy theorist if it fits better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Partially responsible could be the level of indoctrination into believing official stories that people of higher education go through (while, funnily, being told that they&#39;re learning how to think &quot;better&quot; than less educated people). In addition, people of higher education and higher income have a tendency to be more dependent on the system&#39;s smooth functioning in order to maintain their high level of living. Anything that challenges the stability of that is a threat.</p>

<p>If you have little to lose, you have little need to defend your status quo.</p>

<p>Edit to add: Most of my low-income, lower-intelligence friends on Facebook wouldn&#39;t bother to believe a conspiracy theory, frankly. They really don&#39;t seem as if they could care less. Moreover, I&#39;ve found that the majority of conspiracy theory forums are populated by many highly intelligent, well-written, and deep-thinking people, some of whom have far-out ideas, but the level of their intelligence is clearly astronomically higher than of someone any standardized scale would consider low intelligence. With further consideration, I think this &quot;correlation&quot; is wishful-thinking bunk.</p>

<p>As an example, a person who describes a conspiracy theorists as crazy will will often have that view adopted by another person to include a group of people.

<p>and, there is lots of terrorism and naivety associations in the full episode but now needing to find the original full video, post when find it.</p>

<p>Even on TubePlus the episode has changed, I watched the orginal this morning but did not copy it and went back earlier and watched one to try and save a cop and it was the edited version. we need to find the original copy. maybe still on one of these</p>
