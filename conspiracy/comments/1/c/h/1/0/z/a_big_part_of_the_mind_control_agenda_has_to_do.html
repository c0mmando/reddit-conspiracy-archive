       Many conspiracy researchers try to avoid this label instead of fighting it. They'll say "I'm no conspiracy theorist, but.." or "This is not a conspiracy theory, these are facts" which only serves to make this symptom persist. Conspiracy means people plotting in secret. There is nothing crazy about that, it happens all the time. You've been conditioned to think this way on purpose. Now what do you think the purpose of that conditioning is?"

       The term originated around the turn of the century, but was only loaded with a derogatory connotation by the establishment right after the JFK assassination. I wonder why the establishment would want to distort the meaning of the term? It is a cheap psychological device to get the majority of weak-minded people to think: "I do not wish to be laughed at by my peers of below-to-average intelligence, so I will not entertain those thoughts that are deemed a "conspiracy". If I do, they will laugh at me, which will cause unbearable psychological distress."

       So what do you make of correlation between low education, low income and higher percentage of belief in both conspiracy theories and religions? I'd be willing to bet that below-to-average intelligence people are
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       likely believe in conspiracy theories than average-to-high intelligence.

       I'd like to see this statistic backed up by a source, but if it
       <em>

       the case, possibly because the have-nots are the ones being screwed by a plan among the wealthy to keep their wealth.

       So throw away the "theorist" part and substitute "analyst" in the term conspiracy theorist if it fits better.

       Partially responsible could be the level of indoctrination into believing official stories that people of higher education go through (while, funnily, being told that they're learning how to think "better" than less educated people). In addition, people of higher education and higher income have a tendency to be more dependent on the system's smooth functioning in order to maintain their high level of living. Anything that challenges the stability of that is a threat.

       If you have little to lose, you have little need to defend your status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit to add: Most of my low-income, lower-intelligence friends on Facebook wouldn't bother to believe a conspiracy theory, frankly. They really don't seem as if they could care less. Moreover, I've found that the majority of conspiracy theory forums are populated by many highly intelligent, well-written, and deep-thinking people, some of whom have far-out ideas, but the level of their intelligence is clearly astronomically higher than of someone any standardized scale would consider low intelligence. With further consideration, I think this "correlation" is wishful-thinking bunk.

       Also check out the similarity in goal as the word Philosophy/Philosopher........."Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing such problems by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on rational argument." (source wikipedia)

       As an example, a person who describes a conspiracy theorists as crazy will will often have that view adopted by another person to include a group of people. Or you could call a gun owner a nut job or a gun nut which some would be inclusive to gun
       <em>
        owners
       </em>
       . See the media for guilt by association which is a type of ad hominem attack.

       Probably one of the main reasons that I end up being so drawn to former communist countries is that if I stay very calm and explain things then people seem to say "ya those fuckers can do that" because they have been through all kinds of hellish shit.  When I speak it doesn't conjure up so much uncomfortable cognitive dissonance pain and they don't have to worry about being guilty for knowing me because I'm a cool fucking American.  I feel much more intellectually free when I leave.  I have the Internet still and the ocassional good conversations but I know its not the same.  I've been back a few months and I'm already starting to deplete that resevoir.

Yes.  No, I'm not fucking with you.  Wha - no, Google isn't lying either, it's the sa - fuck me, every website that mentions it wasn't changed as part of some conspiracy to convert Christians to Islam.  It's a fucking offshoot just like Christianity is.  Yeah, from Judaism.  No, Jews were around first.  Jews, Jesus then Allah, in that order.  Jesus is even in the Qur'an.

       There are people here saying a woman from sandy hook had something to do with the Boston marathon bombing and its being upvoted to the front. Don't associate with the crazies and you'll have a much easier time.

      <p>
       If you don't believe in conspiracies, then you don't believe in history:  Watergate, Iran-Contra, Enron, Gulf of Tonkin, Worldcom, Tyco, etc. just in the last 50 years.

       Even the word theory is commonly misused in a religious debate.

       As for the purpose, it can at the very least function as an ad hominem. Discrediting what someone says based on who they are and not what they actually have to say.

       Anyway it's the same with like "buzzwords" or certain acronyms for marketing. Whether you are marketing a product or a message it's essentially the same mechanic.

       MSM has now edited the Family Guy episode to exclude the cell phone call that explodes 2 bombs , still including the drive through the Boston Marathon with the car killing everyone to win. and MSM is also now reporting that the video clip is a hoax and infowars and others are reporting that the two scenes are from the same episode.
      </p>
      <p>
       and, there is lots of terrorism and naivety associations in the full episode but now needing to find the original full video, post when find it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even on TubePlus the episode has changed, I watched the orginal this morning but did not copy it and went back earlier and watched one to try and save a cop and it was the edited version. we need to find the original copy. maybe still on one of these

       uh. it is a hoax. someone edited it. You're clearly wrong.

       I just watched it (grabbed it from a private tracker) and its different from what the hoaxed video shows.

       So what do you make of correlation between low education, low income and higher percentage of belief in both conspiracy theories and religions? I'd be willing to bet that below-to-average intelligence people are
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       likely believe in conspiracy theories than average-to-high intelligence.
