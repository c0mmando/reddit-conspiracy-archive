       Maybe a bunch of people came to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       after the bombing to check out some theories, decided that they were bullshit, and posted their thoughts.

       This the second time I've came to this sub. One after Sandy Hook, two after yesterday. No shill here. I just like to see the kinds of things people can find with events like this.

       Nothing wrong with being a "Conspiratard". You aren't hurting anyone. As much as I disagree with most of the stuff written here, vigilance is a hell of a lot better than complacency.

       Same. I spent all day monitoring mainstream media, then swang past here to see some alternative theories. No proof of anything, just interesting questions and connections. It's healthy to try and get both sides to something. You know... instead of just mindlessly absorbing corporate approved news media, it's kind of socially healthy to discuss these things amonst each other. It's what humans do. Nothing wrong with it at all. Sometimes we don't use the best phrasing or wording, but it's the discussion itself that's important.

       Yes.  I believe in all kinds of conspiracies - usually once I look at the evidence and decide I don't find it convincing.  The simple fact is there isn't much evidence to review at all so far, and all that the existing evidence indicates is that someone set a bomb off.  You can't have a conspiracy theory without a motive and an official story that doesn't stand up to scrutiny.

       I think you hit the nail on the head with this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Larger profile events will of course cause more traffic. You can't just jump to the conclusion that there are "shills" running around trying to discredit you. They don't need to when so many people will do it for them from a place of ignorance, but that is not something you can control.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you can do is be objective and honest with yourself. Deduce and analyze. Remember, a lie is a co-operative act. Educate yourself and ask questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, you can't control the comments; only the perception you want to reflect you.

       I noticed it last night. Heavily. There is usually a general consensus around here, but last night was fucky as all get out. Just so everyone is aware, be careful what you post here. Remember that it still is reddit, one of the world's biggest sites, owned by one of the most corrupt men in the world. This sub is no secret. I move to make this invite only, It has only gotten worse in the past 6 months. We all wear "tinfoil hats". Good post platinum_peter.

       Umm....

      <p>
       When nothing is happening, people who aren't members of this subreddit are much less likely to visit it.  Thus, the people here (during those times of decreased activity) are going to share the same conspiratorial views/opinions, and are going to be more inclined to reach that "general consensus" that you speak of.
      </p>
      <p>
       When something
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       happen, however, people who don't share r/conspiracy's views/opinions are going to come here either to ridicule, or just because it's interesting to read conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see how
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       can (logically) jump to the conclusion that the fact that people are flooding
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       after a huge event means that those people are government shills/plants.

       I reported people countless times for rule number three, just to see if anything happens. Did anybody get banned? No. Big surprise here. Yet when somebody is a "shill" (read: doesn't partake in the circlejerk) you scream for mods at the top of your lungs.

       Well all that I can say is that if you have a differing view, you should at least explain your viewpoints and support it with articles and other news sources. There's no need to resort to name calling and putting down other peoples views. There are trolls and there have been shills uncovered, but the most important thing is to keep an open mind and keep your panties from bunching up.

       What's the difference between a shill account and a troll account? If you're being an ass there shouldn't be any question about why you're being called a shill.

       No because he's a general troll who tends to provide no credible information for any of his claims and he uses obviously baiting tactics to provoke users into aggression and so forth. I feel he only serves to waste peoples time rather than substantiating a discourse and for those reasons I feel a person should be at least warned at first, but then banned if further action need be taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're 21+ and you used forums when you were a kid you'll remember there was firm moderation and it was clear to see the benefits it has. If a user gets banned they can always make another account and just use that, it's not that difficult of a problem to work around.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why you need to have clear structure and organization of topics and facts on those topics. I am glad this sub is taking that approach and I feel if we all work together we can make it even better, even to the point where we can turn it into a best selling conspiracy theories book.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you need to do is get a list of key conspiracies with actual data to prove them as true such as 9/11 being an inside job and JFK assassination being an inside job and so on. Expound on the main points with key facts and then cite not only those sources directly but at the end of each topic cite other sources and books and such.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - Read my post, why I think people should be banned and then how we should write a conspiracies book.

       How the hell is anyone supposed to reply to outcries of "SHILL!!" then? It leaves no room for discussion. It's like in the middle of a discussion someone uses "calm down man!". It's specifically said only to put a stop to the other persons argument and/or to inflame them into responding to it and thus going away from the actual argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whenever someone jumps up and down shouting "shill" at me whenever I express a contrary opinion in this subreddit which is supposed to be a "thinking ground" and "above all we respect everyone's opinions" I tend to get a bit cranky. Just because I don't automatically believe 100% of the absolute
       <em>
        shit
       </em>
       that get's posted by alarmist fearmongering websites and unstable individuals here/YT/blogspams doesn't mean I'm a plant/stooge. It means I dislike having information thrown at me and labelled facts without any possible way of checking. Other than "It's such an oddity/weirdness it has to be true!" No it doesn't
       <em>
        have

       As opposed to the avid fans of Conspiracy, who keep calling anyone who doesn't buy into their lunacy shills.
If someone says their theory may not make that much sense = 1 then reply = "You're a shill." Repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even when the theories developed by those anti-shills are so ridiculous they wouldn't qualify as crazy. Rather as "not even possible in any sort of parallel world".

       Now hold on, that's a little unfair. I'm kind of a lurking with my own theories that likes to see other people's opinions. Who are you to take that away because people can't sift through the "shills" and bullshit. All I'm saying is, how are lurkers like myself supposed to get an invite?

       I agree, and I don't support name-calling and degradation in discussions. But it still seems that any honest attempt at dissenting discussion is looked down on here. I ask for sources, evidence, or motives and people call me a shill or use derogatory names. It goes both ways, and I just wish there could be more open debate.

       That happens all the time though. If you look at
       <a href="/r/askreddit">
        /r/askreddit

       you see the top comments often have more votes than the actual submission. Especially if it gets linked by a subreddit like
       <a href="/r/bestof">
        /r/bestof
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: and you're wrong anyway. The comment currently has 419 points (510|91) and the submission has far more. 684 points (1068|384)

       post with that many points. it doesn't add up. It was not linked in

       so your best case scenario still doesn't pan out. It's not like we're not already in agreement that the govt hires people to go on reddit and go on voting brigades.. providing one weak counter argument in a certain case scenario is not really grounds for disproving what I and so many others have already inferred.

       So comparing it to the other comments there are still plenty of reasons it could have more upvotes than the other comments. A lot of people probably clicked on the comments to see if the article had been debunked. When they saw it had then they voted and closed the tab.

       Sure, there is a chance that they are shills.  Much more likely they are skeptics or conspiratards.  They love to pick at our discussions. I cannot blame them... sometimes they offer logical debates, other times...not so much.

       And you don't think the conspiratard sub and group was formed by shills? Do you think some random person hates conspiracy theorists so much that they created a sub that exists to do nothing but attack and slander

       There is a mix and that's why "they" use it. Suppose the CIA/NSA/Mossad can pay 30 people and use
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard

       as a meeting ground for sharing posts which need to have more chaotic distractions. Then they draw in real users who are just random people stupid enough to follow along, submit more posts, personal attacks, calling shit crazy, etc. From my experience it is obviously a lot more coordinated behind-the-scenes. but I would be surprised if that sub is a completely natural phenomenon with no intelligence agencies meddling around at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: same for this sub too it's very reasonable for the federal intelligence agencies to be crawling and keeping up with what some people are starting to put together.

       those are both your implications. I disagree with posts on here too, but I don't go into the comments attacking people and being an asshole. I move on and research something else. That sub is full of childish and stupid people who find it hilarious to be obnoxious and ridicule everything they deem is literally tinfoil batshit lunatic. if somebody disagrees with a conspiracy they can leave their opinion and move on, no need for trolling and personal attacks.

       With tools like Reddit Enhancement Suite, it is simple to tag users and switch through multiple accounts.  With just those two features combined with proxies, it is simple for people to mass downvote targeted users or reply with fallacious arguments from multiple accounts.

       almost immediately in his reply.  The "appeal to authority" used is the claim of being "a statistically trained researcher" in response to an admittedly snide remark from me.  In the previous post, I had jokingly implied I was talking to "master chaos theoreticians."  The convenience
is absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       The post then goes into a dense paragraph disguised as a  new intellectual response.  When in fact it is just a differently word regurgitation of

        Occam's Razor

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       this is not a correct understanding of a fallacious appeal to authority. it IS an appeal to authority, it simply isn't a fallacious appeal. let me explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       consider this sentence:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         I'm a statistically trained researcher who prefers data to wild-assed speculation and thinks that the notion of 'no coincidences' is nonsense, especially since they happen all the time with measurable probability.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       to begin with, this sentence is a direct response to your question:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         who are you people to be throwing out probabilities? did i suddenly start talking to master chaos theoreticians?
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       the ad hominem fallacy in this remark is apparent, as you admitted ("snide remark")--one need not be a "master chaos theoretician" to be able to knowledgeably discuss or act on probabilities (see, bookies).
      </p>
      <p>
       when you directly challenge someone to identify what credentials they possess to speak authoritatively about statistics, and the person replies that he is a trained researcher, this is not a fallacious argument from authority, it is the answer to a question.
      </p>
      <p>
       ex.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         X: what authority do you have to know whether widgets are capable of scrying?
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         Y: i invented the scrying widget.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         X: ah.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       as illustrated in the above example, ATomatoAmI's claim isn't a fallacy if he actually IS a trained statistician, according to the wiki article to which you linked.
      </p>
      <p>
       but secondly, and more importantly, according to that same wikipedia article, a
       <em>
        fallacious
       </em>
       appeal to authority only occurs when at least one of two conditions is met:
      </p>
      <p>
       a) the appeal is to an inexpert entity, or the misrepresentation of expert consensus and/or 
b) the appeal is used to claim that a subsequent argument is
       <em>
        true
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       in the case of a), AtomatoAmI has already illustrated why it is
       <em>
        improbable
       </em>
       (not impossible) that the man on the roof is the bomber, using the most commonly agreed upon understanding (i.e., consensus) of probability, namely, that there are 3,999,999 chances that the figure in the photo is not the bomber.
      </p>
      <p>
       however, even beyond this, ATomatoAmI's response to your question can be rephrased into a valid syllogism, according to your wikipedia article:
      </p>

      <p>
       here is AtomatoAmI's response, rephrased in the form of the above syllogism:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ol>
        <li>
         <p>
          ATomatoAmI holds that it is much more probable that the figure on the roof is a random bystander.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          ATomatoAMI claims to be a legitimate expert on probability statistics (indeterminate), and provides a valid example of probability--1 in 4,000,000--in the case of the boston bombing, and/or
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          The consensus among statisticians is that, all things being equal, 1 chance out of
          <em>
           any
          </em>
          number in the millions is fairly long odds, and AtomatoAmI's explanation of probability comports with the accepted understanding of probability.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Therefore, there exists a presumption that the man in the photo is a bystander, and not the bomber.
         </p>
        </li>
       </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       naturally, you can whittle down the 4,000,000 number with qualifiers, but each time you whittle down, you must justify your reasoning:
      </p>
      <p>
       if you say that only the people who were present at the finish line at the time of the bombing can be suspect, you must explain why. if you say that only the people on rooftops can be suspect, you must explain why.
      </p>
      <p>
       because ATomatoAmI provided you with a reasonable and elementary explanation of why it is less probable that the figure on the roof is the bomber, as opposed to a random bystander (
       <em>
        "the Greater Boston area is home to about 4 million, making any one person have about 1 in 4 million odds of being the bomber if this was a normal day and a one-person bombing"
       </em>
       ), and because a similar explanation of probability can be found explicitly in or inferred from any basic
       <a href="http://www.math.hawaii.edu/%7Eramsey/Probability/TwoDice.html">
        reference
       </a>
       on
       <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Echance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/book.html">
        probability statistics
       </a>
       , it is reasonable to assume that ATomatoAmI is correct, regardless of his claim to be a trained researcher.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, as AtomatoAmI explained, this probability does not mean it is impossible for the figure on the roof to be the bomber, simply that it is improbable, and his reasoning requires only a basic understanding of probability statistics in order for that probability to be
       <em>
        presumed
       </em>
       to be true. new information can change the probability, or, if the bomber were positively identified to be the person on the roof, would change the relative improbability into a certainty.

       Lets talk probabilities. First, I never claimed that the man in the photograph was the bomber. Second, there is more to the situation then what was being replied to.

       as i pointed out in my detailed reply, it wasn't necessary. his explanation of the probability that the figure in the photo is the bomber comports with the accepted definition of same, as anyone who has taken a junior high school math course can read for themselves.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       you have one person who claims that there were "spotters" bomb sniffing dogs on the roofs. do other people make this claim? is there any reason to assume that this would not be a normal part of security at any internationally televised public event, other than this man's testimony?
      </p>
      <p>
       it doesn't sound to me like this does much to support the notion of the figure in the photograph being the bomber. it does seem to suggest that the police
       <em>
        suspected
       </em>
       or were
       <em>
        prepared for
       </em>
       an event like this one, which
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       mean that they received advanced warning, but that supposition appears to be based entirely upon the subjective inferences of this one individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       again, the figure in the photo could be the bomber, and CNN could have been lying. the question is whether, at this point, there is enough information to act upon these assumptions. there doesn't seem to be, and if you're going to have an "open" discussion, then discussion regarding the likelihood that the coach's testimony and the photograph are simply coincidental cannot be excluded, particularly when the math plainly points in that direction.

       You are picking and choosing lines to fit your own context.  I never attacked anyone.  I pointed out that fallacious arguments (marking something as irrelevant due to improbability fits the fallacy I pointed out) are being used to quell discussion.  As if it was an open and shut case due to someone using probabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I never said or implied that the photo was or was not something, so I could not have "tried to discredit people who say that it probably isn't."  In fact most replies (like yours) are adding their own interpretation of my text as to what I was conveying.

       I remember him saying that like it was this morning. At that moment I got a chill because I said to myself...why would he even need to bring that up?
 It would make perfect sense for Obama's Cyber Warriors to flood social media with conspiracy related dog shit to further condition the general public into thinking we're all crazy.

       Cannot jump to conclusions. All we can do is point out "intent" and that comes after the fact. Like 9/11 we can go back and see what events came from those events. Like a detective you have to ask yourself what the "motive" was.
      </p>

       So right now this is observation time. You have to observe and not jump to conclusions. Watch the media and see what kind of spin it puts on the situation. For example; If they push for more gun control than all you can say is "The media is using this event to push for more gun control", this however doesn't mean they necessarily committed the act, they could just be capitalizing on these events.

       In the case of 9/11 the explanations given for the buildings collapsed originated from the 9/11 commission. Now we can ask "Why would they say the building fell due to structural fire" and compare that to knowledge we do have available about architecture.

      <p>
       Observe and deduce.

       It's the latest step in the subversive-to-overt control mechanism that we laughingly call our Federal Government. Pearl Harbor, Operation Northwoods, Waco, 9/11, Sandy Hook, Chris Dorner, and now this. That's not even mentioning the shootings at schools, theaters, and malls committed by individuals on violence-inducing "antidepressants".

       And you don't think the conspiratard sub and group was formed by shills? Do you think some random person hates conspiracy theorists so much that they created a sub that exists to do nothing but attack and slander

       and conspiracy theorists?

       Skeptics yes, but if I'm skeptical of something I'm not going to flame, mock, name call, or any other tool to discredit that person. COINTELPRO in full effect.

       Yeah. I imagine there's a ridiculous number of viewers versus people who post / interact. All they need is one high ranked post "discrediting" a thread and thousands upon thousands of quick eyes see, digest, and repeat it.

       You are picking and choosing lines to fit your own context.  I never attacked anyone.  I pointed out that fallacious arguments (marking something as irrelevant due to improbability fits the fallacy I pointed out) are being used to quell discussion.  As if it was an open and shut case due to someone using probabilities.
      </p>

       Again I never said or implied that the photo was or was not something, so I could not have "tried to discredit people who say that it probably isn't."  In fact most replies (like yours) are adding their own interpretation of my text as to what I was conveying.
