       My post:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1can13/every_time_i_post_something_about_bill_gates_and/">
        Every time I post something about Bill Gates and his vaccines which paralyzed thousands of children in Venezuela, it gets mass downvoted with no comments.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       TIL post by CorruptEagle:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1caxk8/til_that_bill_gates_has_saved_over_five_million/">
        TIL that Bill Gates has saved over five million lives by "bringing vaccines and improved healthcare to children internationally".
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I just need to find that other thread about vaccines I found a few weeks ago that was in either
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       , or
       <a href="/r/science">
        /r/science
       </a>
       that had a MASS of "Comment removed" posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm guessing my account was brute-forced, since the censorship came via deletion rather than reddit's moderation abilities which appear as "Comment removed".

       The voting system compromised anything this site could of been. Voting on links make sense, but comment karma is ridiculous. It just puts puns to top in a lot of threads drowning out actual conversation in a lot of threads, at the very least it's derailing. If five people disagree with you your comment is hidden by default.

       That's a valid, well thought-out point.

       But I disagree so I'm going to downvote you before I read it all!  And then log into my alternate accounts do I can downvote you again!

       This could be fixed by removing downvotes altogether and not by some custom thread look. I mean removing the downvote code from Reddit completely. That way if you don't agree you're simply forced to move on and actually post WHY you disagree.

       sometimes the downvote is a good thing as it alerts the moderator to something that ought not be there, but there is also the 'report' feature for that so i agree with you, 'downvotes' don't really have any purpose anymore.

       The main problem is that the downvote system is there as much to get rid of the botposting and voting. no phantom downvote system would let everyone with a script loose on the comments section.

       If up votes merely promoted comments to the top without the commenter accruing "points", every comment thread would be an independent piece of content rather than a small portion of a redditor's amassed points total.

       Comment voting might not be as bad if they would get rid of the points system. I'd like to see it with a voting system but the actual points are not known by the user.

       I think this might help sort out the posts but not have people try so hard to make shitty joke threads for free internet points.

       I disagree voting on comments is an incredibly successful way of curating content which is why reddit is so successful and so sticky. What you're objecting to is that this like any system can be gamed, and it reflects the base instincts of the herd. Now I've thought about that and what I think is this. Voting should be transparent. You should be prepared to put your money where your mouth is when you vote something up and down. This also allows for an evolution in the engine. So for example RES could allow you to remove the votes of people suspected of gaming the system.  The key here is you still have curation but it becomes impossible to control what people are seeing.

       The collective does. Millions of users means that it would be relatively easy to track clusters of users primarily down voting negative reactions to Israel for example. The point is that open data is the answer to conspiracies.

       I agree, if people are putting their "names" out there when giving an opinion, then anyone who disagrees will have their name out there too. Actually, it's against Reddiquette to downvote a comment simply because you disagree with someone, only if the comment breaks a rule or isn't part of the discussion. Other social media sites let you see who "upvotes" something, but hardly any of them have a "downvote" like Reddit.

       I disagree with your disagreement, but upvoted anyway cause I kinda agree. Though this voting system may be a 'successful' way of curating content, the problem is it is geared to, as you said, reflect the base instincts of the herd. As a new redditor, i actually thought the system worked against such ignorant herd mentality, but that delusion quickly faded. Any hope for it was obliterated when I found out you can
       <a href="http://buyredditvotes.com/">
        buy upvotes
       </a>
       . Upvotes mean jack shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting your money where your mouth is sounds like a pretty good idea but I think trusting the user base to read through lists of names and accurately prune out bad votes would make it even easier to game. Conspiratard would have a new toy to play with. You should be required to either post a comment along with your down vote or select a valid reason congruent to the rules from a drop list. OP could then challenge certain down votes and attempt to get a mod to remove them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all a pipedream though, since upvotes can be bought and in a way that fact is the proof in the pudding. Reddit has been compromised by commercialism. Maybe we could rally to restrict purchased votes to the front page/certain subreddits....?

       What? I think the downvote should get a "super" brother, a super "down 10 votes" downvote that costs 100 comment karma to use. This would punish the severely stupid posters and allow the community to better punish trolls and other miscreants.

       The site build is easy. Super easy. There are more than enough people with the skills and desire to make alternatives. The issue comes with the community. In an effort to allow open and free conversation tracking and moderation have to be kept at a minimum, and people will immediately take advantage of the complete lack of censorship. Posting child porn, or near child porn images, extreme and obviously fake racism (murder black babies, etc. ), and other means of implicating the site itself in "illegal" or at least reportable behavior. So you begin with at least some censorship, and it snowballs from their. For instance, I personally wouldn't allow people to argue whether or not 9/11 was bullshit. You could argue exactly how it was bullshit, but denying the lie would be an immediate ban.

       Sure. The first amendment has nothing to do with people communicating on private websites. An easy way to eliminate shills and the constant in-fighting is to either limit discussion, or regulate your community. It's just easier to be a dick to some people, then they don't come back. I'm speaking from experience here, not theoretically.

       I think it'd be more like banning someone for having a stupid uninformed opinion. Which I can't say I'd be for on principle, but it would definitely make me giggle. The enemy (those that perpetuate ignorance as a weapon to manufacture consent) alwaus have and always will cower behind ingorance for either plausible deniability or some other feign, and thus ultimate tolerance is counter productive. Think about that - I didn't say it's a weakness, I said it's counter productive.

       Now if you're saying, let the community effectively ban im through ostracization, hen I can get behind that.

       I'd be surprised if there wasn't a private conspiracy subreddit somewhere. That would
       <em>

       much solve the majority of the problems with the shills. I for one wouldn't have the patience to check the authenticity of every willing contributor, nor be the judge of whether someone might be payed off. I'm fascinated by conspiracy, but I have no interest in wading through a lobbyist convention.

       You mean against those things... Not the driver. Consider that if those legislative attempts at internet regulation comes true, reddit is screwed. Just because your for or against something doesn't mean you're 100% buying into an ideology. Also doesn't mean the admins here tend to be authoritarians once in awhile.

       You're/they're cherry-picking knowledge.  You could make the same argument in reverse.  Why is it up to reddit admins to decide how/if redditors can decipher info.  Who's to say they're the proper authority is mandating certain stories are okay.... for our own protection.  Sounds like the main-stream media.

       No you can't. A small percentage of people are negatively affected by every treatment to everything. That's a given. You don't stop a treatment because a tiny population can't handle it. Medical Science doesn't have your feelings in mind. The survival rate of the species is the priority.

       That depends on the damage done by the original disease the treatment is supposed to fight and the success rate of the treatment in preventing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a 100% deadly,  highly contagious airborne disease more radical treatments are justified than for the common cold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another factor to take into account is the fact that vaccination can eliminate the disease permanently while almost none of the side effects have long lasting effects beyond the current generation.

       Man... you sound like a lobbyist.... or perhaps someone who works of a corporation that has a major negative impact.  "Oh, yeah a few people may get hurt, but it's for the greater good."  Not so good for them.  The point was, you were basically saying it's okay to control information.  I disagree.  Your reasoning was that the public is ignorant...though probable you're still telling them what's okay to see and what isn't.  The story about Gates wasn't a lie.  Nor did it say his intentions weren't genuine.  But can you imagine if this happened to white kids?

       It does happen to white kids. Also I'm an engineer. Also a person who doesn't get things sugar coated. I was born with Hep B that lays dormant because my mom is from a country where she contracted it because there were no vaccines for it. All of my family are alive because of vaccines. I have 1 cousin who is sterile because of vaccines because he's allergic to the medication they gave him. Is it sad? Yes absolutely, but I would trade his inability to have children every day for the life of my entire family. He adopted some orphans from Korea, so it worked out in the end.

       Yeah it's called America. Vaccines aren't 100% effective because people are allergic to things. It happens. Even with r/conspiracy's love for "natural" medication. I'll die with any homeopathic medication that involves any kind of stone fruit.

       Okay.... I never mentioned homeopathic meds.  What I didn't mention is the restriction of information someone deems "harmful".  That's the issue i have.  Being married to a biologist (PhD) and personally being a sociologist (MA) I understand how vaccines work.  My beef is censorship... Born on the 4th of July "you can't handle the truth" is bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Articles that make it to the front page, and this sub reddit are irrelevant.  Using them to make a claim that my claim is moot is way off topic.  We're talking about Reddit censorship, not the success of this sub-reddit, and some of the naive people that subscribe to it.

       OK then. But the issue here is that someone thinks their minute opinion matters. That reddit would invest so much energy into making sure his ONE post doesn't get to see the light of day. There isn't much juice for the squeeze there. Especially since this is a hotly debated topic.

       I see, but your arguement was a bit misleading.
       <br/>
       "It's not about facts and free speech. It's that people know that vaccines are not perfect, but pointing that really obvious fact out doesn't do anything to discredit the incredible amount of positive work that they do."
My point was that the original poster was pro-info suppression.  I agree, people need to be educated, but you kept taking the discussion in a different direction.  My point was about the fact that knowing about possible dangers is important, and saying that info needs to be regulated to protect people from themselves is a dumb argument.  Info shouldn't be suppressed, people just need better education.  Let's focus on the more valuable goal.
       <br/>
       Suppression=control of meek and sheepish people=shitty society.  Education=equality and higher quality of life for everyone.

       Wait, what? he wasn't pro-info suppression. He was insinuating that if his posts were supposedly not deleted (which we don't know for sure if he's just making this shit up anyway) that there would be a wave of awareness about it. That everyone would know.

       If you start controlling information, and not tell people they are, will they just magically know?  Just because you know, don't assume others do.  Our government/politicians have been extremely successful at destroying our education system and keeping the masses ignorant.

       Yes, best colleges...we also have the worst for-profit online diploma mills that screw the same ignorant people I mention before. 
Dubai has one of the most modern cities, surrounded by massive poverty.  Just because it exists, doesn't mean all's fair and equal.  Opportunity is just that.  Try visiting an innercity school that has 10 computers where 3 actually work.  Meanwhile, the neighborhood is such shit that the ISP don't offer enough bandwidth thus the area of town the school is in basically has no internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       "we have the best quality of living amongst the world" You're delusional.  This may be true, IF you can afford it. We have less equality than Cameroon, Iran, the Ivory Coast, Mali, Laos, Kosovo... The list goes on (source:
       <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2172rank.html">
        https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2172rank.html
       </a>
       )  So... your argument is again flawed.
      </p>
      <p>
       "develop better everything than everyone else" Yep, just like Imperial England, Spain, etc.  When you have slaves and wage slaves, it's not too hard to be on top of the development ladder. However, you could argue Japan and Korea develop just as good of "things". It would have to be things, because it sure as fuck isn't education (we rank 17th).

         Online Diploma mills have to be sought out by dipshits. It requires absolutely no effort to get into one except to give people money. That's on the people using them, not on the country. I don't know what the point of bringing up Dubai is.

         Those inner city schools have computers. They're still leagues ahead of other countries. You realize that the fact that they have computers is an accomplishment, right? It's not up to par with a lot of other parts of the country, but they still have them. I have worked at inner-city schools. I get it. And, really, the ISP doesn't offer bandwidth? Really? Because the neighborhood is such shit? Where did you get all of your network engineering schooling?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Equality is not quality of living, dipshit. Also, holy fuck, are you seriously trying to say that Laos is better than America? Have you fucking been there, asshole? My family is FROM THERE. Equality of wealth is not an indicator of fucking shit if your economy sucks dick and your entire understanding of manufacturing and production comes from the 1800's. You're oversimplifying your understanding of how quality of living works because you're too stupid to grasp the complexities of it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Slave wages? And Slaves? Nobody forces anybody into those occupations. One of the greatest things about America is that you get all of the fruits of your efforts. And no you can't. Japan and Korea refine technology but America is still leading in the development of developing technology. Again, technology is only one aspect. We lead in medicine and technology and research. PS, I'm an engineer. Don't pretend that you somehow have an education in technology, retard.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Education rankings are horse shit. In China and Japan, you have to qualify to even get onto those census scales. If you can't cut it, you don't get to be in the education system. They don't report their education. You really think a country like China who has never given anybody full disclosure would fully disclose that information? Grow the fuck up, asshole. And the educational index doesn't mean fucking shit. You have to look at the human development index. That is the important one. And America ranks at #3, right behind Australia and Norway. Both of which have a population that can fit into New York. So that makes it incredibly easier to have a higher index of human development. America has over 10x the population of Australia and almot 100x the population of Norway. On top of that the population diversity is infinitely more and that comes with so many more issues.

       Great. I'm glad you work at one. What are you, a teacher? You have fucking computers there. The rich, upper-middle class high school I went to didn't have any. We had to buy our own.

       Still not. They still have homes they are subsidized in. They still have foodstamps. They still eat and live. It's shitty quality, but it's still better than lots of European (I use europe because it's the closest thing) where social welfare isn't even a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody starves if you put a tiny bit of effort forward. The American social welfare net is AMAZING. It's just unfortunate that the needy are sometimes too lazy or too depressed to go fill out paperwork. My mom is a department head for social services, this information comes straight from the source.

       You completely ignored my human development argument and went straight for a non-argument. Education rankings are horse shit because the majority of 1st power nations are liars. Human Development is a lot harder to hide.

       First of all, the only people who could use computers were the ones who bought them. They didn't even have a computer lab at my school and I graduated in '04. They still don't. My brother just finished there. And this is the highest rated high school in the city. It's got Blue Ribbon awards and all that shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a lab. That works. Grow up. Oh so you tried 1 thing and it didn't work. Man you are quite the genius. I'm a network engineer, don't start getting into a debate about computer shit with me. You're in over your head there. Making requests is the equivalent of upvoting. It means shit all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of the funding cuts and whatever else, we still sit prettier than the rest of the world. Things I don't know about? Holy fuck you, asshole. My family is 1st generation into this fucking amazing country. My dad lived alone in a hut outside of the major city by himself at the age of 6 with a bunch of other 6 year olds so he could go to the 1 school that allowed them to attend. They lived, unsupervised, by themselves with barely enough food to go around so they could take turns using the only book, pencil and paper they owned to go to the only school within 100 miles. And this is one of your "equality" is higher than US countries you mentioned. Fuck you and your privileged life.

       Can't argue with someone who dismisses inequality.  Odds are the nation your father came from sucks is thanks to US imperialism.  Can't argue with a neoliberal who discounts equality as something fleeting.  You attack me on assumptions backed up with tired neoliberal bullshit.  I'm done.  Go ahead get your last word in....

       You avoid all of my points, you don't answer direct questions and now you quit? What a fucking coward. Are these the lessons you're teaching?

      <p>
       You simplify all your data into one hilariously misunderstood litany so you can just go around bitching and moaning about it. And no, the nation he's from doesn't suck thanks to US imperialism, it's never had any involvement with the US, actually. So fuck you very much. You keep saying all these things, it sounds like you're really unhappy with your job. If you are, then stop being such a fucking coward and do something about it.

       You have no idea dude. Basically, since Ferdinand de Saussure, if your state is sufficiently developed, anything you say into a telephone (wired first (the wiretap laws are disctractions), now wireless) is analyzed by a computer. If you are connected to a non-linux operating system, everything you do is analyzed. if you have a traceable ip address it can all be analyzed.

       "OPV, the polio vaccine used in most of the developing world, is safe, effective, easy to administer, and inexpensive. But OPV consists of live, weakened viruses, which in very rare cases—1 in every 2.7 million first doses of the vaccine—can cause paralysis. In settings with very low OPV coverage, OPV vaccine viruses can also mutate and begin to circulate in the population, just like wild polioviruses.
      </p>
      <p>
       We support the development of new OPV formulations that are not associated with the risk of mutation as well as vaccine alternatives to OPV. One of the most promising alternatives is inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is routinely used in most developed countries but has not been broadly used elsewhere because of its higher cost and the need to have a trained provider administer it by injection. We support efforts to lower the cost of IPV and put in place the training, supply, delivery, and communications infrastructure to expand its use. We also support efforts to develop antiviral drugs to respond to a future accidental or intentional reintroduction of poliovirus in the post-eradication era."

       Sure there's information on the Gates Foundation website about how the vaccine can be harmful for 1 in 2.7 million people. That makes it sound pretty unlikely for the majority, right? But then if someone posts an article where it shows that the vaccine is causing lots of deaths (on order of magnitude more than 1 in 2.7 million, and those posts are getting downvoted into oblivion, then that's a conspiracy to silence information. If the Gates Foundation is funding mass production and distribution of the old vaccine and not the new IPV one, then this is an important distinction in the story. In essence they would be causing those deaths by paying for the inferior vaccine. Should they just be paying for the better vaccine? Or have they done some kind of numbers analysis and decided it's ok if a few children die for the greater good of the many?

       which was linked somewhere in the thread. I'm guessing it doesn't have hard numbers about how many have been vaccinated, and how many have been left paralyzed and how many have died after being administered the vaccine. These are the things which warrant an investigation and need hard facts.

      <p>
       Unlike OPV, IPV confers very little immunity in the intestinal tract. When a person immunized with IPV is infected with wild poliovirus or a cVDPV, virus can still multiply inside the intestines and be shed in the stool, risking continued circulation. For this reason, OPV is the vaccine of choice wherever a polio outbreak needs to be stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in areas with poor hygiene/sanitation (which is even more expensive to provide well), OPV has an advantage in preventing outbreaks...

       I think they're taking an extreme tunnel vision view of the problem by just focussing on Polio eradication. That effectively solves nothing because the kids will eventually still die of starvation or some other disease due to bad water or poor hygiene/sanitation. I'd rather they focussed on providing clean water, proper hygiene/sanitation, then giving them the ability to grow food or become self sufficient. These are the main issues, then they can issue the IPV vaccine. I think the strategy of what World Vision or Tear Fund do is much better than the Gates Foundation approach of only focussing on vaccines.

       It should be possible to eradicate polio with a $50 billion fund, and help from the governments of the world. It would not be possible to provide water and sanitation to the world with even a $5 trillion fund.

       Conspiracies are rarely about denying information but about minimising its impact by burying it and marginalising it. These sorts of conspiracies happen without anyone necessarily organising anything. If you work in an organisation you instinctively protect that organisation, if you work in the media you instinctively know the stories that no one wants to touch. In this case the Gates Foundation is a good news story - no one wants to do a proper investigation into their Monsanto investments or the potential for problems with large scale vaccination programs.

       Of course they've got the wrong target. They've been mislead to see population control as a threat rather than a simple evolution of society and culture and they associate liberal targets with that paranoid conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny because, in all logic, any elite group would want the exact opposite. They'd want uncontrolled population growth. Makes the lower classes more cagey and gets them to fight amongst themselves.

       Not normally. I don't perceive a threat from gun regulation, I don't think vaccines are a problem, and I think the christian religion is just about on the same level as the greek one before it so I'm not especially inclined to be persuaded by "SATANIC FORCES CONTROLLING THE WORLD FROM THE SHADOWS" type crap.

       I do, however, acknowledge that humans are mostly liars and cheats and they lie and cheat even harder to get what they want and there are those who are in a position to achieve a lot with their lying and plotting.

       While there is no doubt that there are many in positions of power globally who are dishonest, or outright dangerous and evil, I'm just not convinced this applies to the Gates Foundation.  The reasons are that it's a pretty simple agenda - the guy was the richest man in the world, and he wants to leave a legacy.  Plus he employs many smart, dedicated and passionate people - these are not people looking to make more money, they want to make things better.  I've no reason to think he intends to cut corners in making that happen, but even $50 billion goes so far when you're trying to eradicate global diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the reason you detected irony in population "control" is because it is seen as a threat only because of the local damages it causes to people themselves - look at desertification, the war in Rwanda etc.  All caused by environmental destruction and overpopulation.  However I seriously doubt such control is being done by malicious introduction of diseases by the Gates Foundation (although if you want a real conspiracy theory, how about the one that Henry Kissinger started AIDS?).

       Yeah, that's pretty much the irony. That and everything else that makes uncontrolled population growth so much more of a threat and a detriment to quality of life. Not to mention that population growth is the key to inflating currencies and keeping economic growth moving (and allowing for further fleecing by economic alphas).
      </p>

       I agree about Gates. I really don't see anything malicious in what he does. Maybe not 100% perfect but everything has bugs in the system and takes time to perfect.

       Well some people would argue it isn't. I think though its still a conspiracy because it is both deliberate and unconscious. That might seem to be contradictory but it isn't when you think about it. The world is driven out of survival people instinctively acting on perceived self-interest. If you are in a duopoly position you don't compete with the other player because both of you would lose you don't need to actively conspire it is implicit in the situation nevertheless it is still deliberate. Power is always in the business of making choices that perpetuate power - which is both obvious, often unconscious and a conspiracy against the weak. Often when self-interest is at stake we choose not to think too hard. A colleague at work gives you advance notice of an opportunity at work neglecting to tell other people who could benefit this is all that is at the heart of a conspiracy. Control of power whether it is in the media, law, business happens through the subtle and not so subtle stacking of odds, tweaking of information, favouring of individuals. Not cartoon villains rubbing their hands at their nefarious plot. The main point about conspiracy is we are all at this game. Just some have more chips to protect than others

       i said hundreds to tens of thousands. we have 534 readers currently active in this subreddit and 125,835 readers subscribed. my modest estimate was that ten, twenty thousand of those 125k + people might notice + care that the subreddit disappeared if such a thing happened.

       Hahaha haha. It wouldn't make a difference to silence one person. That is a huge huge amount of resources to put in to stop one other person who uses the Internet. There is an entire sub that makes the front page every one in a while. If you people gave a shit then pool all the users and get your message to the front page.

       8 downvotes, no surprise. this subreddit is pretty lame, i wish we had a real conspiracy community. i dont understand why people post here who dont like conspiracies? ya, this subreddit exists. does that mean its necessarily pure and unmonitored/uncensored? of course not. mods delete shit constantly from various subreddits and often dont explain. there are way more popular and legit conspiracy websites than this subreddit.. and guess what, those are corrupted too. theres better info there than here, but you would be rather dim to think any site of that magnitude is not monitored (godlike, ats). bring on some more downvotes, maybe that will motivate me to stop wasting time here.

       I think that people come here in search of conspiracies that are logically sound. When they find things that are illogical or untrue, they downvote. Case in point, the idea that the bill gates is controlling reddit to cover up a fact that his foundation is admitting on their website.

       So this vaccine thing is such a big issue that it's mind-boggling, thanks for bringing attention to this subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been watching my posts (and the posts of others) get censored on reddit for years now, but
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       have I seen a stronger reaction than when I post links or comments that question, even
       <em>
        conservatively
       </em>
       question, the vaccine dogma.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've come to the conclusion that the vaccination program is one of the single most important control mechanisms being forced upon the population today. As a result, anyone that begins to even question the safety and efficacy of the
       <em>
        numerous
       </em>
       and ever-increasing vaccines is immediately vilified and lumped in the same category as Holocaust deniers and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason that the USA leads the Western world (by numerous times) in the amount of vaccines they give infants and children...and this number has exploded in the last 10 to 15 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cognitive dissonance people experience when it comes to this subject is stunning. Even in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       there has been little room for those that question these programs of mass vaccination, I've watched vaccination posts get buried again and again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hundreds of thousands of individuals
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contaminated_haemophilia_blood_products">
        were given contaminated hemophilia blood products
       </a>
       in the US and abroad. The kicker: Bayer and Baxter
       <em>
        knew
       </em>
       the product was contaminated, and they dumped it on the unsuspecting population, and untold thousands became infected with hepatitis C and HIV.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are those that attribute this to neglect and corporate greed, but some have suggested that a fuckup on such a monumental scale has to at least have
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       sinister component.

        The history of the polio vaccine is one of the most terrifying things you will ever read.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The contents of that book, The Virus and the Vaccine, will blow away even the most hardened skeptic. For
       <em>
        decades
       </em>
       millions of people in the US and the rest of the world were given polio vaccines contaminated with numerous monkey viruses, including
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV-40">
        SV-40
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This book tells the story of how this happened and how it was hushed up.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a nutshell, the virtual
       <em>
        explosion
       </em>
       of soft tissue cancers in the last several decades can be directly linked to this contamination of SV-40 in the polio vaccine. This is literally one of the worst mistakes Western medicine has
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       made, if not
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       worst, and the vast majority of people are completely ignorant about it.

        Here's a thread I made on the subject
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       For those that want a more broad overview of the history of the development of every vaccine used today, I highly recommend this book:
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Concerned-Families-Practitioners-Edition/dp/188121737X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1365969075&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+parent+vaccine+safety">
        Vaccine Safety Manual for Concerned Families and Health Practitioners
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This book goes into detail about why the default position for vaccine apologists, namely "herd immunity", is mostly a myth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to stress that this isn't about
       <em>
        individual
       </em>
       vaccines being inherently harmful nor how the vaccine program is under the sole control of eugenicists. In a perfect world, vaccines
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be safe and properly regulated and tested.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a perfect world, and vaccines are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       safe and properly regulated and tested. Corporate greed rules the day, and our children are being dosed with
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       too many vaccines with little or no research about the possible ramifications of combining numerous vaccines and administering them all in the same visit.

       Totally valid question. This was the rationale at the time...the long term effects of SV-40 were "officially" unknown at the time, although numerous scientists were trying desperately to sound the alarm.
      </p>
      <p>
       They felt that it was better to stop the scourge that was polio than to risk jeopardizing the public's faith in the vaccine program with concerns that the polio vaccine might cause a cancer epidemic decades in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public's confidence had already been severely shaken in 1955 with the infamous
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutter_incident#The_Cutter_incident">
        Cutter incident
       </a>
       . Jonas Salk's experimental new "inactivated" polio vaccine was pushed on the market with little scrutiny and oversight, and as a result as many as 70,000 children were infected with polio, including several fatalities. Numerous scientists, including Dr. Bernice Eddy and
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Stewart_%28cancer_researcher%29">
        Dr. Sarah Stewart
       </a>
       , tried to sound the alarm before it was released but they were ignored--so eager was the medical establishment to solve the polio problem once and for all.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the Jonas Salk debacle, Albert Sabin's new "live" virus vaccine hit the market.
       <em>
        Both
       </em>
       Salk and Sabin's vaccines were heavily contaminated with the SV-40 virus, the direct result of using the kidneys of rhesus monkeys. Although Europe and Russia halted the production of Sabin's rhesus kidney polio vaccine by the 1970's, the US
       <em>
        continued
       </em>
       using this method until 2000!
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that American children have been exposed to a cancer causing monkey virus for half a century.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40_Cancer_Foundation">
        The SV40 Cancer Foundation
       </a>
       was started by parents who lost their son to brain cancer that was proven, in a court of law, to have come from SV-40 contaminated polio vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now to the essence of your question...did the polio vaccine
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       eliminate polio in the US?
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, in case you don't know that much about polio, 95% of people exposed to the natural polio virus won't exhibit symptoms, even in an epidemic. Muscular paralysis occurs only in 1 in every 1,000 people. Everybody else is likely immune to the virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, poor diet, poor hygiene, and poor education have
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       more to do with polio outbreaks than anything else. Eating too many sweets in the summer also increases the risk by many times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, numerous studies have shown that injections actually
       <em>
        increase
       </em>
       susceptibility to polio. When diphtheria and pertussis vaccines became widespread in the 40's, paralytic polio skyrocketed.
      </p>
      <p>
       To quote the Vaccine Safety Manual:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A 1992 study, published in the
        <em>
         Journal of Infectious Diseases
        </em>
        , validated earlier findings. Children who received DPT injections were significantly more likely than controls to suffer paralytics poliomyelitis within the next 30 days. According to the authors, "this study confirms that injections are an important cause of provocative poliomyelitis."
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1995, the
        <em>
         New England Journal of Medicine
        </em>
        published a study showing that children who received a single injection within one month after receiving a polio vaccine were 8 times more likely to contract polio than children who received no injections. The risk jumped 27-fold when children received up to nine injections within one months after receiving the polio vaccine. And with ten or more injections, the likelihood of developing polio was 182 times greater than expected.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It gets even more damning:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When national immunization campaigns were initiated in the 1950s, the number of reported cases of polio following mass inoculations with the killed-virus vaccine was significantly greater than before mass inoculations, and may have more than doubled in the U.S. as a whole. For example, Vermont reported 15 cases of polio during the on-year report period ending August 30, 1954 (before mass inoculations), compared to 55 cases of polio during the one-year period ending August 30, 1955 (after mass inoculations)--a 266% increase. Rhode Island reported 22 cases during the before inoculations period as compared to 122 cases during the after inoculations period--a 454% increase. In New Hampshire the figures increased from 38 to 129; in Connecticut they rose from 144 to 276; and in Massachusetts they swelled from 273 to 2027--a whopping 642% increase.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1976, Dr. Jonas Salk, creator of the killed-virus vaccine used in the 1950s, testified that the live-virus vaccine (used almost exclusively in the U.S. from the early 1960s to 2000) was the "principal if not sole cause" of all reported polio cases in the US. since 1961.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Essentially, polio was already on the decline
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       the vaccine was introduced. In fact, from 1923 to 1953, before Salk's vaccine was introduced, the polio death rate in the U.S. and England declined
       <em>
        on its own
       </em>
       by 47% and 55% respectively.

       Things got worse
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the vaccine was introduced. In fact, numerous European countries questioned the polio vaccine and didn't mass inoculate...polio epidemics also ended in those countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although many claim that polio was "eliminated" by the vaccine, there is actually
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       credible evidence that the polio vaccine caused the disease to disappear...
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_S._Mendelsohn">
        Dr. Robert Mendelsohn
       </a>
       is one of many pediatricians who believed this passionately (he also opposed water fluoridation).
      </p>
      <p>
       And here's a whole
       <em>
        new
       </em>
       can o' worms...there may be a link to AIDS outbreaks in Africa and the polio vaccine!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        From 1957 to 1960, after years of tinkering with monkey kidneys and polio germs, Dr. Hilary Koprowski tested his own experimental polio vaccine on 325,000 equatorial Africans, including 75,000 citizens of Leopoldville, Belgian Congo. 98% of the vaccine recipients were infants and toddlers. The youngest children received 15 times the adult dosage. Though Koprowski claimed he had the backing of the World Health Organization, WHO denied sanctioning the large-scale trials.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1959, Dr. Albert Sabin reported in the
        <em>
         British Medical Journal
        </em>
        that Koprowski's polio vaccine used in the African trials contained an "unidentified" cell-killing virus. It was never identified. However, in 1986 the earliest known blood cample containing antibodies against HIV was traced back to 1959. The serum came from a patient visiting a clinic in Leopoldville.
       </p>
       <p>
        Koprowski's vaccine was not approved for human use, so it was discontinued in 1960 following the AFrican trials. Thus, it was only administered to inhabitants of the Belgian Congo, Rwanda and Burundi--the precise area where high levels of HIV infection were identified by researched 30 years later. Furthermore, the AIDS virus is known to infect mucous cells, prevalent in the mouth. The African vaccines were squirted into people's mouths.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There are even links between the polio vaccine and Mad Cow disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recently asked a pediatrician if there was one virus he would recommend that parents
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       give their children if the parent asked...he replied quickly and succinctly: the polio vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: the polio vaccine not only isn't safe, but it may be linked to global cancer epidemics and AIDS outbreaks, and it also may have made polio outbreaks
       <em>
        worse
       </em>
       than better.

       I completely respect where you are coming from.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do hope you realize that some of the very authors of the studies you cited that supposedly
       <em>
        disprove
       </em>
       the connection between SV-40 and human cancer are themselves among the primary proponents of the fact that SV-40
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       cause cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       In particular, Michael Carbone is one of the leading researchers that has shown,
       <em>
        again and again
       </em>
       , that SV-40 is directly linked to soft-tissue cancer in humans! He was one of the authors in the very first study you cited.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also like to point out that you only linked to mesothelioma studies and epidemiological studies. The link between mesothelioma and SV-40 is just one issue of many when it comes to the simian virus and cancer. Exposure to SV-40 has been linked to
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       soft tissue cancers.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the epidemiological studies, a great deal of the world's leading polio researchers have concluded they are fundamentally flawed. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       From Wikipedia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The hypothesis that SV40 might cause cancer in humans has been a particularly controversial area of research. Several different methods have been used to detect SV40 in a variety of human cancers, although how reliable these detection methods are, and whether SV40 has any role in causing these tumors, remains unclear. As a result of these uncertainties, academic opinion remains divided, with some arguing that this hypothesis is not supported by the data, and others arguing that some cancers may involve SV40. However, the United States National Cancer Institute announced in 2004 that although SV40 does cause cancer in some animal models, "substantial epidemiological evidence has accumulated to indicate that SV40 likely does not cause cancer in humans".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Those who support the findings of the epidemiological studies are those who are toeing the line of the status quo...those who maintain complete faith in the Western medical system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most notable critics of these "epidemiological" studies are the scientists themselves...the ones who are repeatedly finding in their labs that SV-40 is extremely virulent and is showing up in many different types of cancers (in humans!).
      </p>
      <p>
       While at first I was relieved to read about these epidemiological studies, what the Wikipedia article doesn't mention is that these studies have increasingly come under fire because they are literally based on guesswork, and poor guesswork at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that there is no way we can know exactly which batches of Salk and Sabin polio vaccines were contaminated, though undoubtedly many of them were.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since there's no way to know which batches were contaminated, those carrying out the epidemiological studies had to literally guess which parts of the population received more of the contaminated lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their methods have come under intense scrutiny and criticism...ultimately using epidemiological studies to "prove" SV-40 doesn't relate to increased cancer rates is a faulty premise at best and deliberate obfuscation at worst.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is not as cut and dry as you claim. Even Wikipedia admits that the experts are heavily divided on this subject. To claim that there absolutely is
       <em>
        no connection whatsoever
       </em>
       between SV-40 and cancer in humans is disingenuous.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is scientific
       <em>
        fact
       </em>
       that SV-40 causes cancer in animals. What is up for debate is how it affects humans.
      </p>

       <p>
        Why the interest in blocking an expanded awareness of vaccine issues?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because I'm a medical student, and preventing the spread of devastating diseases is absolutely in my interest. If that makes me a 'shill' because I'm part of the medical industry or whatever, you can believe what you want, but I have no problem with blocking awareness of vaccine issues, and neither does the medical profession as a whole. What I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       take issue with is spreading a wholly false rumor about an important vaccine, destabilizing confidence in one of the most important revolutions in modern medicine, leading to increased prevalence of conditions that could have been done away with long ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       I linked to seven studies that all showed either no connection between cancers and SV-40, or demonstrated that earlier studies showing such a connection were methodologically flawed. You've refuted none of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no conspiracy surrounding SV-40. Its presence in the polio vaccine has been noted and studied for decades. We know about it. It's taught to us in school. We don't trumpet it as a medical apocalypse to the news because all the work we've done has shown nothing of note. It's a completely mundane issue.

       If you and thebellmaster1x actually do some research on SV-40 you'll find that it remains
       <em>
        unknown
       </em>
       whether or not it causes cancer in humans. Some research shows it does, some research shows it doesn't (though these negative results may be inherently flawed as I explained above).
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, to say that the SV-40 contamination scandal is a "completely mundane issue" is simply not true. It was a serious cause for concern in the 1960's and it remains a cause for concern today, that is until definitive proof about its true toxicity is forthcoming.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really, really recommend

       Losing credibility eh? You do realize I wrote three extremely detailed and well-sourced comments in this thread right? I did not receive a
       <em>
        single
       </em>
       valid rebuttal to any of the information I brought up, except for one med school student who only cited epidemiological studies which are inherently flawed (I explain why in another comment.)
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the "magical" studies, there are
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       100 peer-reviewed studies that show a correlation between SV-40 and human tumors and cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you bothered to even follow the SV-40 Wikipedia page link I provided, you would have seen several of these studies in the references, but since you appear to want me to do all the work for you, here you go:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17483871">

      </p>
      <p>
       FTA: "This review presents the different mechanisms by which the polyomavirus proteins can induce transformation and discusses which mechanisms may be operational in polyomavirus-positive cancers."

       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15015494">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I keep "pushing" the book The Virus and the Vaccine is because you will find a comprehensive list of all of the studies, at the time of the book's publishing, that show a direct correlation between SV-40 and human tumors/cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The book also goes into great detail about why the government's infamous epidemiological studies are inherently flawed.

       Both links you provided do not confirm or give strength to your entire claims against SV-40. All it did is give you language to make a suspicious set of statements.

       It seems like you are basing everything you hold dear on just speculation. You haven't really got anything that says what you're implying.

      <p>
       Your posts are just verbose to distract. You seem to be confusing everything that you learned as fact to the horrors you concocted about SV-40 or heard about, which actual verified proof that it does anything you say it does.

       Were the companies involved sued?

       BTW, it's clear that corporate greed in the medical area isn't restricted to vaccinations. Hitting them in the money pocket is necessary.

       Just look at the Depuy hip replacement recall scandal.  They KNEW the hips were untested and caused heavy-metal poisoning (which causes immediate longterm damage, including cancer) but allowed them to be installed in thousands.  Hence why the most recent payout was over $8million in California.

       What really started to concern me about all this was when public schools began making more vaccines mandatory, because then it became something very personal and very real. I'm so glad that the obvious extortion of the masses through means of vaccination was brought up, as it's something that we should talk about but have been silenced for doing so.

       It really is the most viable solution. But who knows, I wouldn't doubt it if they started enforcing these laws on a wider basis. And who would say anything? The public has already been set up to believe that those who oppose are just crackpot conspiracy theorists.

       I'd hope so. At the very least, it would instill some doubt.

        In particular, the relative benefits of OPV to the U.S. population have diminished because of the elimination of wild-virus-associated poliomyelitis in the Western Hemisphere and the reduced threat of poliovirus importation into the United States.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       However, that isn't the case in areas with very poor hygiene and sanitation.  There, the opposite is true, and so a different strategy is preferable.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to
       <a href="http://www.polioeradication.org/Research/Frequentlyaskedquestions.aspx:">
        http://www.polioeradication.org/Research/Frequentlyaskedquestions.aspx:
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike OPV, IPV confers very little immunity in the intestinal tract. When a person immunized with IPV is infected with wild poliovirus or a cVDPV, virus can still multiply inside the intestines and be shed in the stool, risking continued circulation. For this reason, OPV is the vaccine of choice wherever a polio outbreak needs to be stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is still the risk of the vaccine mutating before immunity develops (as you pointed out), which is why the optimal strategy is to vaccinate everyone in the high-risk area as quickly as possible.

       Oh, what a monster! He can see that poor countries are having more kids than they can sustain and is helping their situation by vaccinating them. My problem with this conspiracy is que bono.  What purpose would it serve Bill Gates to make sure that one in 2.7million kids becomes paralyzed? It would be a very expensive way to torture a few people, who you can't even predetermine. If he was really the crazy eugenicist everyone wants him to be, wouldn't he just be killing them with poison instead?

       I understand and agree with that. However, when I google search this I expect some type of credible information to come up, when the OP doesn't post a source at all, and the only information I can find with a quick search is from infowars, guess what, I'm inclined not to believe this. The only credible arguments have been from people in the comments. So I am inclined to believe OP is trying to gain views by claiming a conspiracy on Reddit against him.

       Oh right I see what you mean. Better way of putting that point than how I did. Agree with you, if its only on infowars it is probably horseshit.

       I don't blame you for thinking this.  I hardly believe it myself.  I thought it may have been my friend fucking with me, since he's the one who pointed out the TIL to me... but I don't see how he could have obtained my password.  Do you also think I am CorruptEagle, or that it is just a coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why it was deleted… I think perhaps because it encouraged people to look into my history, which I actually kept very clean for when I cite it to the friends I tell about
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  The whole thing was a laundry list of all my top submissions.  I am genuinely sad it's gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, one my posts in the vaccine thread was a video of Bill Gates saying his father was the 'head of Planned Parenthood'.  Yet the Wikipedia article for his father doesn't even mention this.

       Secondly, whilst I don't think your account should have been deleted, I must air my opinions on this matter. If parents do not vaccinate their kids, they are not fit to be parents. Every single person I know is vaccinated, and any of those who have autism, had it before they were vaccinated.

       Which of your comment is simply your  opinion?  I am a father of five unvaccinated children.  Am I unfit to be a parent? Or, is it your opinion that I am unfit?  Your comment appears to state that as a "fact", regardless of your "disclaimer".
       <br/>
       What proof have you that vaccinations are responsible for an apparent decrease in illness/disease?  Correlation is not causation. 
     Possibly more to the point, do you believe every statistic a "government" puts out?  Of course you don't.  So, pray tell, what has you so convinced, apparently, that ALL vaccinations (and, I suspect,all FDA approved drugs and so-called food) are "good" for humans?

       Vaccinations against measles, mumps, TB, polio, cervical cancer if it is a girl. Diseases along these lines. Basically if your doctor says your child should have it, your child should have it. These guys don't lie, they are here to help you and your kids, they aren't government shills trying to control the population through biological warfare like Mr Jones may put across.

       The idea that there is a tiny chance of getting another illness/condition is like saying "oh there is a small chance of my kids getting a carpet burn fron a seabelt, better not let them wear one".

       Not to attack you like the others.  What medical facts did you read that led you to believe that vaccines are bad for children?  I'm honestly curious.  I've gone back and forth on the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest turning point for me was the people who started the whole "vaccines cause autism" have actually come out and said they were liars.  If Joseph Smith would've came out and told all the Mormons that he lied and made it all up, and the Mormons still followed their religion, wouldn't we call them stupid?

       Not fit to be parents....Really??????? Wow do some reading on vaccines and then tell me it's bad parenting. Doctors push vaccines as much as useless prescriptions. Unfortunately a lot of vaccines are mandatory for your child to go to school, however, my sister was checking up on her youngest child's records ( as he is starting school next fall ) and the doctor told her she needed a certain vaccine, luckily she's not a mindless follower and looked into it, in fact it wasn't mandatory but like I said, they push vaccines!!

       They push vaccines because it's better to be safe than risk your kid catching a life threatening disease. NOt to mention, if we all group together, all vaccinate our kids and ourselves, these diseases will be a thing of the past. Remember Smallpox? Most likely deadly if caught, closely related to other poxes, but far worse? Yer, vaccinations killed it off completely, no recorded cases in years. How could that possibly be a bad thing?

       They push vaccines because they are, without question, the greatest public health development of the last thousand years.  To say they have saved only millions of lives would be immense understatement.

       Do you realize the people who did the studies and said that vaccines cause autism, as an example, have been proven wrong, and even admitted that they were wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines can go wrong, yes.  But the risk is far greater if you are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       vaccinated, correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I told you that your child has a 10% chance of being paralyzed if he gets the vaccine, but 50% chance of getting a life threatening disease if he doesn't, which would you choose?

       I've never laughed so hard at op in my life. Posts a bunch of completely unverified, though somewhat interesting, claims, and when people down-vote it like it should have been(unverified, unproven fear mongering), claims it's a conspiracy on r/conspiracy, act outraged. R/conspiracy crowd jumps in head first, claims reddit is compromised. Rofl, this is amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm about 99% sure op deleted his own post and account. No-one is scared of a random reddit post, op just deleted it because he was ashamed of the downvotes. "The men" deleting a reddit account to stop information dissemination about something YEARS old? Op, seriously, you want me to believe that???? Brute forced? You are amazing op. You deleted your own account, no-one cares about you that much to brute force you.

       If you're referring to the Tuskagee experiment, they
       <em>
        already had
       </em>
       syphilis. They weren't told they had it and weren't treated for it. Still appallingly wrong, but not what you're claiming.

       It was easy to find your old account because you told me exactly what you had been posting about.  Plus you commented with your new account on your old account's posts.

       Also as a mod I can see the ban list and you aren't on there.

       See if you can find OP's account while you're at it. I have a hunch he's fabricating this story of his posts and account be deleted in order to fabricate a conspiracy when in reality, he most likely just deletes his posts because of all the downvotes due to lack of proper sources for his arguments..

       According to a source of mine, if you take this link
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/xxxxxxxx/about.json">
        http://www.reddit.com/user/xxxxxxxx/about.json
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And replace the xxxxxxxx with a username, it will read error 404 if the account was deleted, or it will list a bunch of stats if the account is still active (or banned by admins).
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks like it was deleted and not banned.
I hope this helps you.

       Condé Nast Digital no longer runs reddit as a "kinda profitable" service. Advance Publications reorganized reddit.com into a service provided by Reddit, Inc. about a year ago.  Since then every popular or influential subreddit has had their moderation team infiltrated or completely replaced with "professional" moderators who have the mentality of a six year old when it comes to fairness and an understanding of authority.  They do whatever they want and literally respond with "well, as long as we don't break Reddit, Inc's rules then we can literally do anything we want in our subreddits".
      </p>
      <p>
       They play dirty tricks.  They will collude to keep a post critical of them at 0 until it fails to exit the /new queue, and then they mock you for how poorly your submission did.  They derail and then threaten to ban you for derailing.  They use rationale not even supported by the stated rules of the subreddit to ban and remove content and when you point it out they just come up with a more vague and generic reason you were banned.  When you point out the impropriety of one moderator another pops up quickly to defend their friend's abuses.  When one moderator's moniker becomes too disliked they delete their account and continue moderating under another username.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit.com is not our reddit anymore.  It became profitable to Advance Publications and now it is
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       website.  We provide the content for free and receive no benefit from the profit generated.  Any attempt to draw attention to this mechanism is met with coordinated efforts to control and redirect the conversation to an echo-chamber (or "circlejerk") where like-minded people can argue about minutiae instead of a diverse group of people discussing the totality of the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have killed the places where our communities overlap (*cough*
       <a href="/r/reddit.com">
        /r/reddit.com
       </a>
       *cough*) and have implemented rules to remove (take control) and redirect the conversations to subreddits where that sort of conversation would either be impossible, or would be so routine that nobody would care to participate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is not "democratic" in any way other than the fact that we all vote for the status quo by continuing to participate here.  We all voted for this authoritarian environment with the only vote we have, our free will to walk away.

       I can see how this may have happened unknowingly by everyone involved. You post something inflammatory and all the misinformed whiteknights and whatnot come out of the woodwork bitching. Before you know it there is a grassroots unorganized response that eclipses your original point.

       Top admin Eric Martin recently noted during the Morgan Freeman controversy that he frequently has contact with public relations people for celebrities. My gut feeling is he often does things to make them and some political and corporate entities happy. I've personally been on the losing side of this. I won't be surprised if he bans me for saying this.

       I can't believe this post got up voted here.  I feel like my anti-gates rants get down voted to hell every time.  He did state that his vaccine agenda was DEPOPULATION in a ted talk.  Though you think he misspoke, he did not correct himself...didn't even flinch.

       So vaccinations lead to decreased rate of births, as stated by Bill Gates.  I can agree with that statement, doesn't make vaccinations a good thing.

       Reducing the rate of births thru vaccinations have nothing to do w/ preventing disease.  This is not an argument against vaccinations (though we can have one if you'd like), it an argument on what Gates said and what he meant in the Ted talk.

       Welcome to Reddit, where truth and honesty are met with mass downvotes. Might as well join the collective circle jerk of kissing ass and blowing dick, because it's the only way to achieve recognition on this site. Going against popular opinion? Challenging the status quo?

       Compromised? This site is essentially nothing more than a social engineering/culture shaping tool. Propaganda and ego boosting for the masses who are bored at work or on a break between classes. Bill Gates is held in high regard here as an example of "good without God". Bill Gates is not good. A site of brainwashed pop culture atheists may think he's great but that means nothing. It's an illusion. His legacy of benevolence is an illusion. History won't speak well of him or his family. He is one of the ultimate "hidden in plain sight" wicked personalities of our time. Most posters here are so wrapped up in the reddit antitheist mentality, totally suckered into the polarized "science vs. spirituality" nonsense, that giving examples or attempting to truly illuminate people here is pointless. Bill Gates is evil. Don't ask for sources. Go read and find out why. It's right in your face and beyond easy to see if you do a minimal amount of detective work.

       I see it as we are getting to them. I dont think we should give up with spreading information, but to learn new avenues of informing and
       <em>
        ORGANIZING
       </em>
       . Organization is the last thing they want. Its easy to pick off individual cells, but a group tightly held together poses problems. So if tomorow i get thrown into a black van (seriously) and u other redditors witness this, stand up for me. I will always stand up for all of you.

       So I was going to write about how he is filling a spot "someone has to fill", and he's doing good things with his money.  But then while doing research I realized a couple things:
      </p>
      <p>
       A) Every guy that is that rich, gives away a lot of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       B)
       <em>
        Most
       </em>
       decent human beings would be perfectly fine with giving away over half of their money during their lifetime, if they were worth 65Billion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I concede.  No one needs to be that rich, unless they've earned in honestly...even then though.  That's a buttload, literally, of money.

       The Gates Foundation openly acknowledges that there is a low risk (1 in 2.7 million) of paralisis, which, compared to the risk of actual polio, is arguably minimal.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Polio">
        http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Polio
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "OPV, the polio vaccine used in most of the developing world, is safe, effective, easy to administer, and inexpensive. But OPV consists of live, weakened viruses, which in very rare cases—1 in every 2.7 million first doses of the vaccine—can cause paralysis. In settings with very low OPV coverage, OPV vaccine viruses can also mutate and begin to circulate in the population, just like wild polioviruses.
      </p>
      <p>
       We support the development of new OPV formulations that are not associated with the risk of mutation as well as vaccine alternatives to OPV. One of the most promising alternatives is inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is routinely used in most developed countries but has not been broadly used elsewhere because of its higher cost and the need to have a trained provider administer it by injection. We support efforts to lower the cost of IPV and put in place the training, supply, delivery, and communications infrastructure to expand its use. We also support efforts to develop antiviral drugs to respond to a future accidental or intentional reintroduction of poliovirus in the post-eradication era."
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's hardly conspiracy worthy material.

       Population control? I fucking hope so! You think you're entitled to have kids when there is 7 billion humans turning this planet into an overcrowded trash dump? I mean go right ahead, have kids. Their just going to starve to death sometime in the coming decades. Overpopulation+climate change+peak oil=massive die off. Population control will happen whether you like it or not. Might as well do it ourselves as opposed to letting nature take it's course, because it's not going to be pretty that way.

       Really my only gripe is that they are not targeting first-world suburbia first.  They could trigger the first round with a simple letter that contains the following:  Do you live in a neighborhood with a homeowners association by choice?  If so please stand outside your house on Date/Time to collect your homeowners association fee rebate.  Van drives by with a sonic sterilizer and .... scene.   Entitled and Stupid are hit in the first wave.  Not that they aren't spending humongous sums of money at fertility clinics anyway (nothing like a clear sign that nature is trying to find a way).

       It's not about facts and free speech. It's that people know that vaccines are not perfect, but pointing that really obvious fact out doesn't do anything to discredit the incredible amount of positive work that they do.

       Really my only gripe is that they are not targeting first-world suburbia first.  They could trigger the first round with a simple letter that contains the following:  Do you live in a neighborhood with a homeowners association by choice?  If so please stand outside your house on Date/Time to collect your homeowners association fee rebate.  Van drives by with a sonic sterilizer and .... scene.   Entitled and Stupid are hit in the first wave.  Not that they aren't spending humongous sums of money at fertility clinics anyway (nothing like a clear sign that nature is trying to find a way).

       Facts are more and more unpopular here on Reddit every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bailed on Digg earlier than most. The Hive Mind Echo Chamber grew to an untenable roar. Now its happening/happened here. I'm beginning to think that
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       news aggregation site will become the victim of its own success this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how fucking DARE you post
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       that disputes the cartoon version of American History taught in schools.

       Same with politics. You could title something positive about a political figure the exact same words, and trade out Obama for Marco Rubio. And get drastically different results.

       Yeah it's called America. Vaccines aren't 100% effective because people are allergic to things. It happens. Even with r/conspiracy's love for "natural" medication. I'll die with any homeopathic medication that involves any kind of stone fruit.

      <p>
       And your overall point is still moot, because this post in this thread in this forum has well over 700 upvotes and
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       makes it to the front page very frequently. There's no controlling of information if that is happening. Sorry dude.
