        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why is this term supposed to be insulting? Aren&#39;t we all &quot;truthers&quot;? Is it only meant to apply to 9/11? &quot;Conspiracy Theorists&quot; is another term I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s used as an insult. Pretty much every plot involving one or more people is considered a conspiracy. The Government&#39;s Official 9/11 Story is their Conspiracy Theory for what happened on 9/11. So far, they have yet to prove it in a court of law so until they do, it&#39;s still considered a Conspiracy Theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truther was their (your?) term to combat what had become the derogatory &quot;birther&quot; term, it developed into a term of ridicule because the underlying theme was still ridiculed regardless of the movements rebranding effort.

    <div class="md"><p>What? No, the birther movement is where it really picked up traction in the mainstream because of Donald Trump&#39;s dog and pony show. The word &quot;truther&quot; originated in popular use from the 9/11 Truth Movement, and pundits started turning it against them and turning it into a doublespeak. It&#39;s been around before Obama was even on the national scene: <a href="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/2681">http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/2681</a></p>

<p>And on that note, I&#39;ve heard it floating around for years in conspiracy communities even before 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Infowars is a good example of a mixed bag. Alex Jones is clearly a con artist, sales man pushing his videos, gold and doomsday prep kits. He believes he is a thorn in the Government&#39;s side and they&#39;re following him where ever he goes, waiting for their opportunity to suicide him. If the Government wanted him dead, he&#39;s be dead.</p>

<p>But there have been a few stories you could say he&#39;s broke. FEMA Camps and DHS Ammo Purchases. Both stories were initially ridiculed but eventually reported on Mainstream News.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a divisive figure. He clearly has an audience so someone is buying what he&#39;a selling but it seems to me, Reddit feels that he&#39;s a Government Shill, an Agent of Israel or both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is such a bullshit, insulting argument. As if I&#39;m frightened of the implications of any of these conspiracies being true. There are way more frightening things in the world, and I&#39;m always open to adjusting my opinions when new evidence is introduced, but I also don&#39;t go around looking for conspiracies like you guys do.

<p>These lunatics are making it hard to find good discussions. If you, and others, are going to try and brainstorm how about you do it with some rational thought. </p>

<p>Also, seems that most people &quot;brainstorming&quot; on these threads do take it seriously. Just look at the comments before making blanket statements like that. Time to be downvoted for pointing out your illogical behavior.</p>

<p>Edit: Once again, the only sane comment is being downvoted. You never fail to disappoint people. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re all so offended that I find most of your claims to be pure insanity. </p>

<p>I wonder if anyone is going to claim again that I work for the Government. Conspiritards like believing that someone is out to get them for their &quot;truths&quot; rather than sit down and think about why somebody would call them crazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But they are the <em>tolerant</em> ones.    </p>

<p>What they don&#39;t get is, you can&#39;t <em>tolerate</em> someone unless you disagree with them. This is critical. You don&#39;t &quot;tolerate&quot; people who share your views. They&#39;re already on your side. There&#39;s nothing to put up with. Tolerance is reserved for those you think are wrong.    </p>

<p>However, instead of hearing, &quot;I respect your view,&quot; when someone disagrees with your ideas, thoughts, beliefs, etc. you are told you are bigoted, narrow-minded, and intolerant and then they start throwing around the &quot;birther&quot;, &quot;truther&quot;, &quot;extremist&quot;, etc. insults.  It&#39;s very telling when questioning the rhetoric and telling the truth makes you a bigot.</p>

<p>Sorry, I don&#39;t buy this self-indulgent logic. Tolerance it something you have for someone&#39;s <em>right</em> to an idea, not the idea itself. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have to respect your view, I have to respect your right and your freedom to hold that view. I don&#39;t think that anyone&#39;s view should be censored, nor anyone&#39;s right to think what they want should be taken away, but it&#39;s a big leap to go from &#39;Respect your right to your view&#39; to &#39;Respect your view&#39;.</p>

<p>Quite simply, with 99% of conspiracy theories, I don&#39;t respect your view. I think the&#39;re baseless, idiotic and mastabatory and that the people who cling to them are not sceptics but simply contrarian for the sake of wanting to feel like intellectually superior persecuted outsiders. </p>

<p>I, of course, defend your right to hold them and would never want those views censored, but to say that tolerance means that I have to respect absurd views is delusional. I have to respect your right to hold them, nothing more.</p>

<p>I too think a lot (maybe not 99%, but far over 75%) of the things posted here are baseless, but it&#39;s the ultimate segment of society to monitor for censorship policy. If society tries to censor that which they disagree with, that&#39;s not really a society. That&#39;s just the some getting to choose what the others are permitted to say or think for the sake of it, much like the rest of our history.. </p>

<p>And I should clarify a little, there&#39;s a difference between being closed to the ideas here, and being closed to <em>here</em> as a place of discussion. </p>

But it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re <em>tolerant</em> by allowing me my own rights.  Being tolerant would be allowing me to say what I think and if I ask you for your opinion, you respectfully share it with me.

    <div class="md"><p>Many people would call such a distinction as being quibbling over semantics but I absolutely disagree. I think that the difference between respecting your right to a view and respecting the view itself it a major one, and the fact that we&#39;ve lost sight of this distinction that we find ourselves in such a mess when it comes to openly and honestly debating anything. Also, before I go on, let me make clear that when I say &#39;Your view&#39;, I mean a hypothetical &#39;your argument&#39;, not you personally as I have no idea what your views are.</p>

<p>We seem to live in a culture that treats everyone and their opinions like tiny fragile delicate little flowers that should be immune to open and frank discussion. As though, when someone presents a viewpoint, particularly a fringe one, then we should put on the mittens of tolerance lest we offend them. It&#39;s for this reason that offensively stupid ideas like creationism and anti-vaccination movements are allowed to take hold and grow; because no one wants to be seen as being mean or intolerant or offending anyone, and where challenging anyone&#39;s opinion is seen as taboo.
Again, the distinction is definite, and important. I am absolutely, fundamentally bound (and support) to your right to hold any view or opinion you wish. Absolutely, I think everybody should have the freedom to say and think whatever they want, and do not let anything I say indicate otherwise. Freedom of speech is one of the most fundamentally important things in any free society and I absolutely support it.</p>

<p>However, just because I support your freedom to say things does not mean that the views themselves automatically get some kind of immunity to criticism under the guise of misplaced &#39;tolerance&#39;. No view should be immune from criticism, nor any view-holder.
You said it perfectly yourself; &quot;You can&#39;t tolerate someone unless you disagree with them&quot;. And if I disagree with you (again, hypothetically), and find your arguments unconvincing, your evidence lacking, your reasoning specious and your justifications baseless then I do not see how I could end the discussion with a statement like &#39;I respect your view&#39; if I am to have a shred of intellectual honesty. I don&#39;t respect your view, I think your view is absurd. But I maintain respect for your right to hold it, and would never try to silence it.</p>

<p>As Voltaire said; &#39;I despise what you say but would defend to the death your right to say it&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh.  They actually <em>are</em> teaching stuff that&#39;s not too far off from that in school right now.  Kids who are elementary age and younger are going to be hopelessly stupid by the time they graduate unless parents step in and stop this madness.  But that&#39;s beside the point.    </p>

<p>Tolerate=someone says something you don&#39;t agree with.    </p>

<p>You <strong>respectfully</strong> disagree, end of story.  <em>Instead of</em> spewing off a string of hateful, name-calling, degrading comments and dismissing that persons opinion and even going as far as attempting to silence them by labeling them inflammatory names like &quot;homophobe, racist, bigot, etc&quot;, all because they refuse to agree with something <strong>you</strong> believe in.       </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a really dumb example:<br/>
My <strong>extremely</strong> &quot;liberal&quot; friend went on a rampage about how intolerant I was because I saw a woman at the pool with a penis-like protrusion sticking out of her stomach and she was wearing a bikini.  I said I thought it looked gross.  She told me that I have no right to tell someone what to wear, that women should be able to dress how they want, etc.  She&#39;s right, I don&#39;t have a right to tell a woman what to wear (and I certainly didn&#39;t, our convo happened via chat hours later).  But I <strong>do</strong> have a right to my <em>opinion</em>.  I then sent her a pic of another friend and I at the pool.  Another rant about how what my friend was wearing was inappropriate, shouldn&#39;t be allowed, etc.  My friend <em>chooses</em> to dress this way just like bikini-penis <em>chose</em> to wear what she wore.  No-one forces her, she lives in the U.S. and can dress how she pleases.  </p>

<p>Personally, I think I&#39;d rather see <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3PdWhzS">this</a> than <a href="http://i.imgur.com/UN9xn15">this</a>     </p>

<p>That&#39;s my opinion.  Being tolerant is allowing me to have one, even if you don&#39;t agree.  Being intolerant is telling me I&#39;m wrong, calling me names, trying to force your views onto me, degrading my belief system, life choices, etc.</p>

<p>Once, it was witchcraft and heretics. Then it was <em>pinko commies</em> and <em>dirty hippies</em>. Now it is truthers and conspiracy theorists and internet dwellers. Marginalizing the fringe opinions (as in, not mainstream) in a veil of ridicule ensures minimal dissidence and easy discrediting of the people. Even THINKING of or TRYING to approach people with a fringe view of the world can suddenly induce a feeling of anxiety and fear... I am personally a witness of that phenomenon and you are, too. Exactly everyone is aware of that but most people don&#39;t even know that they know. That, IMHO, is EVIDENCE OF MIND CONTROL. Beware of the super secret super CIA super technology or the whole a big government conspiracy angle. These are all red herring designed to misguide you away from the truth. Investigating these avenues will lead you nowhere and will easily make you look like a mentally ill person who sees things and hear voices.        </p>

<p>As a tangent, in a world where we are supposed to have free will, freedom of speech, and all that good stuff, I find the spectrum of the public discourses and opinions to be strangely homogenous. I surmise it is evidence of MIND CONTROL. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are exactly 100% correct and it&#39;s the same tactic they use to get Americans to vote against their own self Interests as we saw with ObamaCare. The fact that they can get people to vote for War in a country most people couldn&#39;t find on a map and against healthcare that would benefit them or their family or friends shows how effective they are at dividing Americans. Cutting Social Security and Medicare and labeling it as a welfare. It&#39;s amazing to me that people can hear that Obama has death panels and wants to kill Gramma so we got to stop that and then they are for cutting Social Security and Medicare, which gramma depends on to live. These two programs are directly responsible for extending American Life Spans.</p>

<p>They&#39;re especially good at using Patriotism to quell dissension. Questioning the Government&#39;s Military Actions is not supporting the troops. Most Americans show very little support for the troops. If it involves more than sticking a yellow ribbon on their car or sharing a &quot;God Bless the Troops&quot; post on Facebook, they won&#39;t bother. They&#39;ll act all indignant on Forums when they suspect someone is not behind killing muslims and tell you to get the fuck out of the country but they won&#39;t vote for politicians that take care of our veterans, end wars instead of start them, and decrease defense spending (which goes towards weapons, not troops) they won&#39;t visit wounded veterans in the hospital or write them a letter or send them a package. They don&#39;t insist Congress and the Military step up Mental Health to try and prevent soldiers from committing suicide, which kills more soldiers than the Taliban or Al Queda. They don&#39;t hold Congress accountable when they allow female troops to be raped and their rapists to be acquitted. They&#39;re against gays serving in the Military. But they support the troops god dammit.</p>

<p>There is evidence of it&#39;s presence throughout our history. In historical records, ancient stone carvings, personal accounts, and religious scriptures.

LOVE YOUR FELLOW MAN. And there it is. The veil of secrecy that the evil influence requires to prosper cannot exist anymore.</p>

<p>Psychology is exactly 0% scientific. It&#39;s diagnosis amounts to nothing more than an opinion based on incomplete and inaccurate informations. It&#39;s a guy that make you lie down, ask you about how you &quot;feel&quot; then go like HA! HA! It&#39;s schizophrenia! Here is your prescription. Swallow these pills... It&#39;s a solution looking for a problem.</p>

<p>Please, go to your local psychiatrist and ask about schizophrenia and <strong>what</strong> it <strong>is</strong> exactly. He will probably start to babble things he heard about or show you a paper with big words on it and assume that&#39;s enough. Don&#39;t swallow his snake oil. Ask specifics. If it&#39;s a real thing then gene sequences can be produced. -or- MRI scans comparisons between a known healthy brain, a schizophrenic under treatment, and a non-medicated schizophrenic in order to prove that it exist, against a proper &quot;control&quot; and that it is <em>here</em>. That It can be seen? He&#39;s gonna give you either that befuddled face much like the proverbial devil bathed in holy waters or he&#39;ll start babbling big words and show you some more papers with big scary words on them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the term is mainly used to refer to Sept 11th theorists.</p>

<p>I would argue it is not a term given to people who are seeking truth but to those who already think they know the truth, their search is over. </p>

<p>Also the term is self-owned by the Sept 11th truth movement they use it to describe themselves and as an accusation to those that disagree. They say you are believing a lie and only we know the Truth. </p>

<p>Most people of course want to know the truth about things. Sept 11th for instance most people believe the truth that it was a terrorist act, however some people try to co-opt that by calling fringe theories the truth without evidence. This means what they are calling true is not quantitatively true and it waters down the power of that word. They use Truth to describe something that cannot be proven in many cases. That is why it is often derogatorily referred to as the ‘troof’ or ‘troofer’.</p>

<p>Yes. It&#39;s a self-imposed term that is used by the alleged &quot;truthers&quot; themselves. And if your theories are perceived as ridiculous, do you really think people will not mock your self-proclaimed status as a &quot;truther&quot;?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like the term has an essential meaning. Calling yourself a &quot;truther&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you search for truth, it simply means you call yourself a truther. The same way calling yourself a democrat doesn&#39;t mean that you <em>are</em> a democrat. The meaning of a word is its use in the language.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your definition of whacko conspiracy is another man&#39;s quest for the truth. What exactly falls into the definition of whacko conspiracy? 9/11? JFK? RFK? Pearl Harbor? Gulf of Tonkin? Northwoods? UFOs? Crop Circles? Bigfoot? The Moon Landing?</p>

<p>Today&#39;s whacko conspiracy could turn out to be tomorrow&#39;s truth. Every day it seems like more and more truth comes out about famous/infamous historical events. How many years after the Gulf of Tonkin before we found out the truth? The Government actively suppresses the truth and the media vilifies any who dare question it. </p>

<p>People that question the JFK Assassination are still shunned by the media and most people agree that Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy and there was a second gun man. They may argue the semantics about whether it was someone on the grassy knoll, the driver of the limousine or someone else but they&#39;re in agreement that the Warren Commission was full of shit and our Government lied to us (again).</p>

<p>Even Bigfoot seems to be gaining some traction. Recent DNA tests on hair samples found in the Pacific Northwest seem to indicate that there is a creature hiding in the woods that is part neanderthal and part human. It&#39;s only a matter of time until someone catches or kills one. Bigfoot is always thrown into the conversation by talking heads on the MSM when they want to portray a guest as a lunatic conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>Since 9/11, the Government straight up tells you that they won&#39;t tolerate &quot;Conspiracy Theorists&quot;. Bush said it right after 9/11 and most recently, the Sheriff in Sandy Hook said the same thing, even going so far as to say that they will arrest you. What they&#39;re really saying is, &quot;Do not question what we tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>And the media plays along by labeling you a &quot;Truther&quot; or a &quot;Birther&quot; or a &quot;Conspiracy Nut&quot;. They invite guests onto the show with the explicit purpose of ambushing and discrediting. News shows don&#39;t just state the facts and let the viewers decide. They all have an agenda.</p>

<p>And their methods are effective because the viewers then turn around and do the same thing on Reddit and elsewhere. Not interested in the truth. Their mind&#39;s been made up and they aren&#39;t willing to take in any new information that contradicts their view. Combine those people with the paid shills and you have an environment that fosters suppression. The truth is shouted down and ridiculed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When conspiracy communities stop supporting those who aren&#39;t actually after the truth, then things will improve.</p>

<p>The problem is, the vocal, boisterous, illiterate conspiracy theorists are the ones who gain all the attention. Those actually seeking the truth from an event are usually quiet... trying to find information.</p>

<p>The term conspiracy theorist should define someone who is objective, who critically thinks, who shelves their confirmation bias in an ultimate search of what really happened. And if all evidence points to something that disagrees with their belief system, then they still accept that as what happened.</p>

<p>Being a conspiracy theorist doesn&#39;t mean you believe every single event that ever happens is a conspiracy and that you will ignore any evidence/research that suggests anything other than a conspiracy. </p>

<p>It&#39;s generally applied to people ranting about &quot;the truth&quot; of 9/11, but I guess some people use it for people ranting about other things as well.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not meaning people who search for the truth, rather it&#39;s meaning people who think they&#39;ve <em>found</em> the truth, but can&#39;t seem to get it out in any structured, meanginful way, leaving them ranting about it over and over again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Conspiracy Theorists&quot; is another term I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s used as an insult. Pretty much every plot involving one or more people is considered a conspiracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not all coincidences are plots. If you document an actual conspiracy, you&#39;re not a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;. If you manage to turn every major event into a secret conspiracy, whether it really is or not, you&#39;re a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sheeple, Shill</p>

<p>Aren&#39;t these words used by <em>you</em> people? Anytime I disagree with someone here, someone calls me a &quot;sheep&quot; or &quot;shill&quot;, as if that&#39;s enough to win the argument.</p>

<p>This subreddit, again, is a prime example. Someone posted a &quot;hateful rant&quot;, which was mostly just a criticism of the people who don&#39;t stop to mourn the lives lost or hurt in Bostom, before they start screaming about &quot;false flag&quot; attacks and whatnot, and I asked which parts of the text were actually hateful or in any way inaccurate. The response? &quot;9/11! 9/11! 9/11!&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, but as pointless as such a comment is, it goes both ways. &quot;Skeptics&quot; around here use that language too, <em>much</em> too often, and it has almost become the mother tongue of some subscribers.</p>

It&#39;s just accepted as a sad reality. The scary part is when their lies lead to dead Americans.

    <div class="md"><p>Truth is becoming a rare commodity on corporate media these days. Many of the proles are psychologically burying their heads in the sand. The human psyche is very vulnerable to manipulation, which manifests as cognitive dissonance. Go tell a patriotic military member they have blood on their hands, or go tell a bible thumping &quot;believer&quot; that religion flies planes into buildings. I have done both and you will get snarled at for offering to unlock their cage.</p>

<p>Author and de-programmer Fritz Springmeier says that most people have built in &quot;slides&quot; that short circuit the mind&#39;s critical examination process when it comes to certain sensitive topics. &quot;Slides&quot;, Springmeier reports, is a CIA term for a conditioned type of response which dead ends a person&#39;s thinking and terminates debate or examination of the topic at hand. For example, the mention of the word &quot;conspiracy&quot; often solicits a slide response with many people.</p>

<p>What most people believe to be &quot;Public Opinion&quot; is in reality carefully crafted and scripted propaganda designed to elicit a desired behavioral response from the public. Public opinion polls are really taken with the intent of gauging the public&#39;s acceptance of the New World Order&#39;s planned programs. A strong showing in the polls tells them that the programming is &quot;taking&quot;, while a poor showing tells the NWO manipulators that they have to recast or &quot;tweak&quot; the programming until the desired response is achieved. - <a href="http://www.threeworldwars.com/new-world-order.htm">http://www.threeworldwars.com/new-world-order.htm</a></p>

<p>I believe the majority of people of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and most critical thinkers have broken past this conditioned &quot;slider&quot; effect.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;ve gotten into discussions with people on here that are clearly only interested in pissing me off. They refuse to engage in a straight up debate.
