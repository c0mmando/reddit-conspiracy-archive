    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. I think it also has to do with the frequency of gang related crimes. I mean, I&#39;d like to say I get upset every time a ganster kills someone, or commits another (usually violent) crime, but I don&#39;t. I guess I&#39;ve just been desensitized to it.</p>

<p>When I was a little kid, this girl who was in high school burned an old man alive on the street because when she robbed him earlier (that day?) she only found five dollars in his wallet, and I guess she got made fun of for it. He sold elotes and rode around on one of those adult-sized tricycles. I don&#39;t remember if he died or not. Don&#39;t know why I shared that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fair point, and something I&#39;ve thought about myself, but, I think it&#39;s far more realistic and practical, to err in that direction rather than in the random crazy person direction.</p>

<p>I wonder why someone with your mindset is so skeptical of suggestions that the government, which has obvious motives for doing so, and has factually done so in the past, wouldn&#39;t at the very least, allow, these sort of events to occur, at least some of the time.</p>

<p>Would you suggest it&#39;s more likely the government never uses false flag events? They suddenly gave it up in the 1990&#39;s never to take that tactic off the shelf again?</p>

<p>When there are no barbarians at the gates, people begin to wonder why there are still gates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, I am not quite sure what would constitute convincing evidence. From my perspective, I&#39;ve yet to see convincing evidence for the official stories in many of these cases. It usually comes down to everyone agreeing to agree to whatever the official investigators found.</p>

<p>I used the word practical in my earlier post because accepting the official story in these cases doesn&#39;t provide any particular function. When conspiracy theorists scrutinize these events, they are at least providing some level of oversight. While, clearly, the efficiency and effectiveness of that oversight is certainly lacking, it&#39;s better than nothing. Someone needs to watch the watchers.</p>

<p>It would please me, if, when a news story broke, the first reaction the general public had was to question the narrative and possible motivations of all the actors. For the most part people don&#39;t, they assume the authorities have their best interests at heart, that&#39;s very dangerous. It&#39;s an unguarded flank easily open to attack at all times. </p>

<p>I think one can use Occam&#39;s razor to cut in many directions, in other words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a poor understanding of Occam&#39;s Razor. It is not, as you and many people seem to believe, &quot;the <em>simplest answer</em> is most likely the correct one. It is better stated as; given multiple explanations, the one that makes the fewest assumptions is most likely to be true. </p>

<p>In this scenario, the two options are either;</p>

<p>The Tsarnaev(sp?) Brothers acted alone of their own volition to detonate explosive devices at the boston marathon and proceeded to stay in the area and engage in a wild shoot out with a massive paramilitary police presence that resulted in one of their deaths and the other being severely injured.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>the government either was involved with the brother&#39;s actions in some way, or entirely orchestrated the events without the brother&#39;s cooperation, or had some involvement in between these two extremes.</p>

<p>We know that the FBI has been in contact with the Tsarnaev family for at least 5 years, so that eliminates one assumption. There was some government involvement in the Tsarnaev&#39;s life which may or may not have influenced their behavior. We also know that there is well documented proof of false flag attacks perpetrated by the US Government in the past. We also know that the government displayed an entirely unprecedented use of force to hunt down these two, and finally only one suspect. Never before in the history of this country has martial law been put in to practice over an entire city with full citizen lock down, warrant-less house to house searches, and a with  paramilitary police force assembled from such a large number of surrounding jurisdictions, let alone that it was done to catch a single 19 year old boy, so we also have a fairly good idea that this was done for more than just catching Djokar.</p>

<p>What we don&#39;t have a clear understanding of is the motives of these two boys, and their mental states before, during, and after the explosions. You are making the automatic assumption that they are/were crazy because there isn&#39;t really any other good explanation for why they would commit to these irrational acts. Unfortunately this also assumes that &#39;crazy&#39; people are known for doing these sorts of things, which evidence does not support. Mentally unstable people are often known to commit acts of aggression, but they are usually spontaneous and unplanned, and aren&#39;t on a scale that makes national news.</p>

<p>It seems to be that the idea that these boys blew up homemade explosives at the boston marathon simply because they were crazy makes many more assumptions than the idea that the government played <em>some</em> role in these events beyond what they are stating publicly, and therefore Occam&#39;s razor would suggest that this second premise is the more likely one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Columbine. </p>

<p>ELF (Environmental Liberation Force) </p>

<p>Various groups during the 1950&#39;s and 60&#39;s. It was a very chaotic era, one that was really due to the increase in freedoms. You&#39;d think crime and violence would go down, but instead many people began to walk up to the fact their country was doing horrible things.</p>

<p>That generation was demonized and written off as a bunch of acid junkie hippies. But really they stood again the war and the empire, until the empire gave them jobs and money and they accepted it. </p>

<p>A better question is which conspiracies have proven to be true and directly caused by the US:</p>

<p>Gulf of Tonkin</p>

<p>Sinking of the Lusitania</p>

<p>Iranian Contras</p>

<p>Iranian Revolution  </p>

<p>The September 11th, 1973 Military Coupe in Chile (11,000 civilians dead)</p>

<p>The School of the Americas (Terrorist training came for South Americas in George, US)</p>

<p>MK ULTRA</p>

<p>... and there are so many more. These are all true, declassified by the US government under various administrations. These are fact. </p>

<p>People on this subreddit are considered crazy for having a default stance of assuming the US government caused the situation and that&#39;s attributed to wearing a Tin Foil Hat, but given the history of the empire, shouldn&#39;t the more logical default to assume the US caused and action and is lying about it. It happens more often that you&#39;d think. </p>

<p>If a Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front</p>

<p>It&#39;s kinda sad. A lot of the people left ELF and turned their lives around. The FBI then got their former leader to rat them all out. He was a heroin addict and ratted out people who had families; one even had a job with a non-profit. They all went to jail for 5 ~ 7 years and addict-boy did zero time. </p>

Does the thought of only orchestrated, government-backed tragedy remove your anxiety about the fact that the world is a chaotic place?

    <div class="md"><p>Most events you are referring to end with questions left unanswered, some of which are quite serious and could possibly imply gov&#39;t involvement.  The implication is of such a degree of wrongdoing that if we do not at least commit some part of ourselves to answering those questions, we are doing a disservice to our peers and country.  For example, the question: &quot;why did no investigation report that there was nano-thermite in the WTC on 9/11?&quot; is one that must be answered if one is to have any critical or logical opinion on the attacks.  The underlying message of most conspiracy theories is that there is not enough information one way or the other, so someone must be lying or obscuring the facts.</p>

<p>The thing is, your nano-thermite question has been answered <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/thermite.htm">multiple</a> times and people have gone to great lengths to answer it.

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, I am not quite sure what would constitute convincing evidence. From my perspective, I&#39;ve yet to see convincing evidence for the official stories in many of these cases. It usually comes down to everyone agreeing to agree to whatever the official investigators found.</p>

<p>I used the word practical in my earlier post because accepting the official story in these cases doesn&#39;t provide any particular function. When conspiracy theorists scrutinize these events, they are at least providing some level of oversight. While, clearly, the efficiency and effectiveness of that oversight is certainly lacking, it&#39;s better than nothing. Someone needs to watch the watchers.</p>

<p>It would please me, if, when a news story broke, the first reaction the general public had was to question the narrative and possible motivations of all the actors. For the most part people don&#39;t, they assume the authorities have their best interests at heart, that&#39;s very dangerous. It&#39;s an unguarded flank easily open to attack at all times. </p>

<p>I think one can use Occam&#39;s razor to cut in many directions, in other words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a poor understanding of Occam&#39;s Razor. It is not, as you and many people seem to believe, &quot;the <em>simplest answer</em> is most likely the correct one. It is better stated as; given multiple explanations, the one that makes the fewest assumptions is most likely to be true. </p>

<p>In this scenario, the two options are either;</p>

<p>The Tsarnaev(sp?) Brothers acted alone of their own volition to detonate explosive devices at the boston marathon and proceeded to stay in the area and engage in a wild shoot out with a massive paramilitary police presence that resulted in one of their deaths and the other being severely injured.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>the government either was involved with the brother&#39;s actions in some way, or entirely orchestrated the events without the brother&#39;s cooperation, or had some involvement in between these two extremes.</p>

<p>We know that the FBI has been in contact with the Tsarnaev family for at least 5 years, so that eliminates one assumption. There was some government involvement in the Tsarnaev&#39;s life which may or may not have influenced their behavior. We also know that there is well documented proof of false flag attacks perpetrated by the US Government in the past. We also know that the government displayed an entirely unprecedented use of force to hunt down these two, and finally only one suspect. Never before in the history of this country has martial law been put in to practice over an entire city with full citizen lock down, warrant-less house to house searches, and a with  paramilitary police force assembled from such a large number of surrounding jurisdictions, let alone that it was done to catch a single 19 year old boy, so we also have a fairly good idea that this was done for more than just catching Djokar.</p>

<p>What we don&#39;t have a clear understanding of is the motives of these two boys, and their mental states before, during, and after the explosions. You are making the automatic assumption that they are/were crazy because there isn&#39;t really any other good explanation for why they would commit to these irrational acts. Unfortunately this also assumes that &#39;crazy&#39; people are known for doing these sorts of things, which evidence does not support. Mentally unstable people are often known to commit acts of aggression, but they are usually spontaneous and unplanned, and aren&#39;t on a scale that makes national news.</p>

<p>It seems to be that the idea that these boys blew up homemade explosives at the boston marathon simply because they were crazy makes many more assumptions than the idea that the government played <em>some</em> role in these events beyond what they are stating publicly, and therefore Occam&#39;s razor would suggest that this second premise is the more likely one.</p>
