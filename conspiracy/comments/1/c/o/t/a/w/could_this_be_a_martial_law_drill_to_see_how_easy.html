       It looks like it's been incredibly easy for them to execute.  They've locked down the entire city to find one guy.   I think this might be a drill just to test how willing people are to let the police/military/fbi take over a city and lock everything down.

       I am legitimately afraid as well. Looking at empty streets with a militarized police force pushing through people's yards, taking complete control of the infrastructure? I'm getting flashbacks of Modern Warfare 2.

       The scariest part to me is that people beg for this kind of action to get some semblance of "safety" in their minds. Although the bombing was a tragic event, does it really justify shutting down a major US city to find a TEENAGER? This whole situation just STINKS.

       Furthermore, if the "state" asked you to stay in your houses for any other reason than your own safety do you really think freedom loving Americans wouldn't step up and say fuck that shit. This was the most transparent manhunt in the history of the world and all of the residents gladly stayed inside (and consequently went outside and helped end it) because it was suggested for their safety. With the Internet and cell phone cameras everywhere the police and military can not fuck innocent people for no reason. They can ask for our help and receive it if we don't believe they are all our enemy.

       Actually, a good portion of the morning people ignored them. It wasn't until they realized the cops were going shop to shop shutting everything down that everyone gave in and went home.
      </p>
      <p>
       This wasn't for all of our safety, it was so the cops could get a cop killing terrorist as fast as possible, no matter what.

       So what exactly justifies shutting down a city? This man put a lot of lives at risk. Civilians voluntarily cooperating to return their city to a state of peace and safety is a lot different than the picture you are painting, in my opinion. Imagine living in Watertown and knowing that this disgruntled/heavily armed "teenager" who just lost his closest relative was at large in your backyard. Police are people too, risking THEIR lives for your own. I would do anything to get him into custody and out of the streets as quickly as possible.

       A reasonable request like, "please stay in your home so you are not caught in any cross fire." Think back to the Dorner situation- so many civilians were hurt in the process of that manhunt. How many were hurt this time? I am against martial law as well, so I don't really appreciate you just parroting back my hyperbolic statement at me, apologies for thinking logically and wanting to keep myself safe.

       your idea of safety is the SWAT/GUARD barging into your house (under threat of jail/force/who knows) and marauding the streets...?

       could you see how this could be used as an excellent training for martial law, perhaps in the near future?

       The city was on a VOLUNTARY lockdown. There were no reports of SWAT BARGING in or destroying anyone's homes. I am just as distrusting of the law enforcement and government agencies as the next conspiracy theorists- but in a situation such as this- I personally am willing to allow officers to search my home for the investigation. In my opinion you are downplaying the severity of tonight's events and over looking how differently things could have gone and how much longer it would have taken to get this guy- ALIVE- without the cooperation of the townspeople.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: also, begging for safety and being beaten into submission? A bit dramatic, considering all they did was stay in their homes...safe....away from any danger.......

       It isn't just about the bombing. They were shooting and throwing explosive devices in a RESIDENTIAL area. I saw pictures of a guys house with bullet holes because of the gun fight. It was likely that he could of started to kill people because he knew he was going to get caught. The reacted correctly. But now did they let it happen for a political agenda? Did they let him get away?

       My only harp with your comment is that the US has ALWAYS been able to restrict rights in the face of a legitimate important reason. This includes your bill of rights, the 14th Amendment, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       My point being is, these rules have always been in place and yet our country is fine. Do we have issues? Of course. But to say these incidents "take away our rights" is a bit disingenuous.

       Like what? There is no bill in the bill of rights that is absolved from being regulated. The Constitution itself allos for such flexibility on behalf of Congress and the President. Regulating your rights is not taking away your rights.

       "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
      </p>
      <p>
       What this means is that congress can't make a law abridging the freedom of speech.  There's the letter of the law, which states that only
       <em>
        congress
       </em>
       can't make laws abridging them, there's nothing to say that an executive order, or a committee, or a city council can't make a law abridging free speech. Do you need me to post instances of when that's effectively happened, or are we going to assume you haven't been under a rock for the last 10 years?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT- that may have sounded like an attack, but it really wasn't.  It's just tiring to hear somebody expecting the law to be
       <em>
        followed
       </em>
       when it very clearly isn't being followed by the government.

       An executive order falls within the Presidential Powers in Article II I believe, so the President is given discretion. If he oversteps his powers, Congress and the judicial branch should be there to challenge it. A committee is usually set up by Congress, and this falls within the broad interpretation of the Constitution where Congress is effectively allowing the committees to do such actions. Again, they still have to adhere to case law and precedent.

       True, true, fair enough. But a time of martial law is one thing. Declaring such a state and then never returning those suspended rights is entirely different.

       I would say simply be open to
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       things that you might have otherwise scoffed or rolled your eyes at.  It doesn't necessarily mean believe everything hook, line, and sinker.  Of course not.  There's definitely a lot of hoodwinkery going on and a lot of disinformation agents, etc.  However, at least be open for the fact that a lot of these things that might otherwise be looked upon incredulously by many DO come from a certain core of truth that is indeed hidden from the majority of the public.

       The second bullet point above may or may not be literally true in and of itself.  It does, however, coincide with the existence of various states of events on this planet, so it may be closer to the truth than some might suppose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, just be critical but
       <em>
        open
       </em>
       to information that you might have otherwise scoffed at because we live in a world that is VERY different than the one we were raised to believe we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also, as I said in my OP here, don't be afraid.  It's easier said than done, but we are all each of us tiny sparks released from an eternal, universal, cosmic fire.  That great fire releases these little sparks of Itself so that It can experience the world from a different perspective is all.  Some of these sparks are big, some small, some "good", some "bad".  They all come from IT, however, and That Great Fire does not
       <em>
        go out
       </em>
       .  It does not extinguish.  As big as the cosmos is, That Great Fire is bigger still...and you, me, and all of us are an integral part of It.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not "religious mumbo jumbo".  This is scientific truth.  It's already been confirmed.  Everything is one.
      </p>
      <p>
       WE are The Great Fire.  It's just that TGF has manifested itself as YOU and ME and all of us
       <em>
        individually
       </em>
       .  Once that romp through "individuality" is done, that tiny spark of individuality collects itself back into and
       <em>
        as
       </em>
       The Great Fire - as The Greater Self that it always was from the beginning anyway and all along.  We all go back to it and each other, so there's really nothing to fear.  What is there to fear? the ending of the current dream that we're having?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, when the dream ends - and it
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       end - then what happens?
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing that happens when the dreams you have at night end.

      <p>

       I'm sure that's what that guy who the police ordered to strip naked on the street, who got thrown into the back of the cop car, later released because he DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG!

      <p>
       I'd say that's a pretty strong recommendation.

       If he wanted to he could probably get $20,000+attorneys fees as a settlement from them 4 years from now when they're done dragging it through the court system to see if he gives up pursuing a remedy for the violation of his rights.

       I think you might be confused about something.  An innocent person was ordered at gun point to strip naked in public.  This person was released without being charged for anything.  I'm not talking about the suspects here.  If you think that's ok because the ends justify the means, well you can go fuck yourself.

       you think they do it for fun or because they were searching for 2 people who bombed civilians and possibly other suspects who had shot and killed a police officer. yes of course the ends justify the means and you have serious mental issues if you cant understand that.
      </p>
      <p>
       i mean, its so fucking blatantly obvious that this falls into dishonest, willful ignorance and thats why youre way of thinking is dangerous. they didnt strip him for fun, he was ordered to strip because the suspects were carrying bombs &lt;------- read that again, then read it again. now think how you would bitch and moan and cry if they didnt take these precautions and a relative of yours was subsequently killed. your way of thinking is nothing but SELFISH and delusional.

       There was gunfire and explosions in a residential neighborhood so they tell everyone to stay inside. Does that seriously sound unreasonable?

      <p>
       Really, you people must have some sort of deep-seated problem with authority of ANY kind if you'd rather go outside with a madman on the loose than stay safe inside simply because you were told not to. No one in their right mind would want to go outside with that going on, but because the police request it while they are trying to find an extremely dangerous individual it means fucking Martial Law is being instituted.

       You're consciously ignoring the obvious evidence of actual martial law.  A police request is not an institution of martial law.  When theyre canvassing entire neighborhoods, stripping people in the streets, patrolling with military helicopters and armored vehicles its an entirely different scenario.

       are you really that much in denial? same height, similar build, similar haircut, similar face, similar skin colour........in the vicinity of a manhunt looking for someone who just shot a cop and killed 3 other people....and youre worried his "rights" were violated? you really think the police thought they would just do this for a laugh? not because they were genuinely concerned he might be one of the suspects? that is your HONEST opinion?

      <p>
       To answer your next questions...no, I don't think they did it because they thought he was the suspect.  I'll bet they did it because they were afraid.  Because they didn't really know what they were looking for.  Police are people (just barely, amirite?), and they get scared too.  Its why you see unreasonable use of force so often, and why they always claim people are approaching them threateningly.  But their fear doesn't justify stripping some random of his rights.  Just like my fear doesn't justify governmental stripping of your rights, and vice versa.

       Is it so unheard of that people and thus police departments might make a mistake? The guy has already been released, they didn't take an innocent guy and lock him up for months. They made a mistake (admittedly a large one for him) and then remedied it immediately.

       Yes and they are also telling peopel to turn off their cameras.  This is all a set up.  This is an exercise.  you will see more surveillance cameras and you will be expected to let the cops in your home.  If not your neighbors will turn on you, the public will turn on you, you will be considered the terrorist.

       No. Simply no. This is not a set up, they are actively chasing a terrorist around Boston. And you're already expected to let cops in your home: it's called probable cause. According to you theorists, martial law has been coming for forty years. If they wanted it, they'd have a press conference and declare martial law. Hasn't happened yet, after 911, after this...grow up.

       u/nefertooty has the key to that theory. It's not that they are doing that
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       that's the issue. The conspiracy is that more events like this will happen, and more and more searches/huge police presence will serve to desensitize the public to having such procedures followed. They said it themselves (they meaning CNN) earlier today..."this is the future of counterterrorism" (analyst speaking of waiting until later to release photos &amp; lockdowns as needed). Everyone is already on edge and it's not a far stretch to imagine this happening again in any other major city across the US (and the world, for that matter). The more this happens, the more people will get used to it/expect it until martial law won't hardly be noticed. It's like the slow boiling of a frog...the more gradual you turn up the heat, the less the frog will notice anything is wrong until he's cooked.

       Probable cause would require a specific belief based on reasonable judgement and evidence that the "terrorist" was hiding in that specific house or at most maybe a couple of houses.  Probable cause doesn't work the way you think it does.

       one man who was "wandering about" was tackled to the ground and they brought in back up from a tac to deal with him before releasing him to go back inside. that's a very forceful "recommendation"

       The recommendation is for a large area. Not a martial law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police ordering people inside is in the vicinity of police operations. Not a martial law either; it's actually been a common practice for ages when armed suspect is around.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case it's not a conspiracy. Just police being cautious. To prevent collateral damage in case there is shooting. Remember the LA manhunt where ooutsiders got shot? That's not good either.

       Let's say they to go out, and then get blown up and or shot - who's fault is this? The governments for not protecting them or the people for being curious? If the government does to much, it's wrong and if they do to little, it's wrong. What exactly do you want them to do?

       Also in New York when that guy was stabbed in the face on the subway the policeman basically watching it go down was not under no legal obligation to endanger himself and to protect the guy as it was happening.  In effect most police will likely get involved most of the time but they have zero legal requirement to do so.

       What sucks is, if this country actually had good honest people (hypothetical here) then I would be ok with what they are doing. I can be realistic. If I was a cop I would yell at those fuckers too! Last thing they need is distractions.

       Exactly,  I don't need cameras in my face while I'm holding an assault rifle trying to find a suspect. It also makes me think how many people here would go outside and get a gun and put their lives in the line for people they don't know.

       You can never be too critical of a man with a badge. Having the badge puts them in some of the most powerful positions of authority, and having seen cops abuse this authority firsthand, I trust no cop. Better safe than sorry.

       Amazing that in all the crap, this post is getting voted down. Just because they don't have a legal obligation to protect the public doesn't mean there's no way that's their justification.

       People on here must really not think these people hurt or killed any innocent Americans I guess. Letting people roam free in the streets not only highly endangers them, but completely compromises the search if they have to find him in a crowd again.

       Well, based on that definition, anytime someone is murdered the government can lock down an entire city until they find the murderer.
      </p>
      <p>
       "An emergency situation requiring swift action to prevent imminent danger to life or serious damage to property, or to forestall the imminent escape of a suspect, or destruction of evidence."
      </p>
      <p>
       More worrisome...
      </p>
      <p>
       "There is no absolute test for determining if exigent circumstances exist".
      </p>
      <p>
       This does not give the government carte blanche to shut down an entire city.  Even without the need of a warrent, they still need probable cause to enter a building.

       Maybe so, but a near complete lockdown, thousands of police and troops and heavy equipment, dozens of choppers for ONE GUY?

       I have a feeling this is more about conditioning than a serious desire to "keep the public safe".  This is more like a Martial Law drill (IMHO).

       This guy was a suspect.  Now, he's a terrorist.  No Video, photos, no proof, but somehow you just know it's him, and that he's setting up bombs, and is armed with guns and explosives?  You were there?  You have the footage?   Please, show it to us all.

       Hey, someone murdered someone in my town, and is armed and dangerous, he could kill more people (hey, he might even have a bomb) and it just happened.  I guess my state should declare Martial Law, shut down the state, tell everyone to stay inside, and go door to door until they find him.

       But it wasn't just one guy...it was arguably, an invasion of our country by terrorism. No facts were known about the suspects except for their foreign affiliations, so after such a big attack and the possibility of a home attack, I think you'd be hard to argue this wasn't an exigent circumstance.

       No one is saying he wasn't dangerous (I wasn't there, so I have no Idea), but to suggest he was so dangerous that they had to a complete lockdown, thousand of police, troops, heavy equipment, and a bunch of choppers is, well...overkill to say the least, and a complete and full blown Martial Law exercise at best.

       What else are they to do when they have no idea where he is? If they just use local cops, there's a pretty massive chance he gets away. There are people who said no to the random search, and the cops just didn't search. It may have been a shit load of police, troops, and chaos, but to say "full blown Martial Law" anywhere is not accurate and is strictly hyperbole.

       Using the word exercise doesn't take out the fact that you said full blown. I can put the word exercise in the quote, and what you said is still hyperbolic. Unless you're using exercise in the most vague way imaginable, or you don't understand it, just because you use that word doesn't change the pretense. If you simply said "Martial Law exercise" - then maybe, and only maybe, would that have been accurate. But when you say full blown, you're ignoring what actually happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       A state of emergency would have been a much more accurate term to describe what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've seen Martial Law happen in the U.S. and that simply wasn't it.

       Please enlighten me as to what I said that was hyperbole? If you want to be

       guy, I quoted you entirely accurate, the same way people are quoted every day. I just only quoted the relevant thing you said, because saying exercise doesn't change the context of what you said. They didn't actually declare Martial Law (which I'm assuming is the key to your point,) but that "exercise" (which really was just a state of emergency) was not Martial Law.

       I think leaving the word "exercise" out of my quote is very misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a big difference between "full blown Martial Law exercise" and "full blown Martial Law".  One is an exercise, and one is not.  One is factual (although descriptive to convey the seriousness of the event) and the other is simply inaccurate. They conjure up very different meanings.  I think the images we've all scene back up my "full blown ML exercise" quite nicely.  I don't think
       <a href="http://www.infowars.com/battlefield-usa-de-facto-state-of-martial-law-declared-in-boston-pics-from-the-war-zone/">
        these pictures
       </a>
       are out of line with my description of the events.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry if you see it differently, so we'll have to agree to disagree and let the readers decide for themselves.  This is my opinion after viewing the images, and hearing the live testimony from the people that experienced it.

       The exercise just means you're doing the motions without declaring it. It simply wasn't Martial Law by definition. It was a
       <strong>
        very
       </strong>
       strict definition of a state of emergency, but Martial Law means something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nearly everyone I know in America is from Boston and was affected by this event, and no one described it such as Martial Law.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this much more accurately describes the situation:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But then again, (no offense if you're from the country) but many Americans think Martial Law/Police State rather quickly when it isn't necessarily the situation they're actually in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it is misleading, an exercise would still be going through the same procedures, just without declaring it to be official.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think Martial Law describes it as well as a State of Emergency does, and those two things are very different.

       Sorry, I thought we could actually have a discussion instead of you purposely not responding to parts of my post and only other parts and then just saying we can't possibly come to an agreement.

       The readers don't decide for themselves, it doesn't matter in any way. We're in a conspiracy sub, where the same exact thing may get down voted that just got up voted. The goal should be healthy discussion, not caring what outside people think.

       I was hoping for that too, but since you won't even acknowledge that you misquoted me, it seems we've reach an impasse.  Rather than sinking down into insults, accusations, or ad hominem attacks, I rather politely say "I'll agree to disagree" and leave the conversation somewhat harmoniously.

       In what way am I attacking you though? Because I said Martial Law is hyperbole? I didn't misquote you, I quoted what I thought was important. I already explained that I don't think using the word "exercise" drastically changes the notion you're making. If you'd like, I can go back and add exercise to my original post in quotes and not change anything else. Or are you saying that the only way for you to continue is to sink to that level?
      </p>
      <p>
       I already did acknowledge that I didn't put exercise in quotes, in an entire post dedicated to just that. As I've stated, I don't think the word exercise means that the sentiment is completely different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the word exercise how you did, it would still mean that it was
       <em>
        essentially
       </em>
       Martial Law, without the declaration. You are still just agitated that I just didn't put exercise in quotes, but even if I did, I don't think that's accurate (which I've stated.) I think it's much more accurate to use the term State of Emergency than "Full blown Martial Law exercise."
      </p>
      <p>
       Because that's not what it was, it wasn't a test of doing full blown martial law without actually declaring it, it would only by Martial Law even be the broadest definition, which wouldn't be a full blown exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were truly interested in healthy discussion, you'd be interested in the points I make, not being hung up on me
       <em>
        purposely
       </em>
       excluding the word exercise, which I've already explained as to why I did numerous times. If I put the word exercise in the quotes in my original post, it still wouldn't change any other part of any of my subsequent posts, and it would be the only change in that post. The word exercise being there doesn't change it significantly enough to change my point in any way.

       I don't expect everyone to agree with me. But in this sub of all places, I at least expect the decency of someone to actually have a discussion with me if they're going to engage, instead of pick certain parts of my post to reply to and ignore the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a conspiracy theorist, I disagree with infinitely more people than I agree with, but I'm not frustrated by any means, just surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if you realize this, but we agree in nearly every way,
       <strong>
        except
       </strong>
       that I think it was a state of emergency, and not Martial Law. So I don't know what you're trying to change my mind about, if not just the definitions of terms. I don't think what happened is Martial Law, even the "exercise" of it ;)

       Like what, agreeing on everything but apparently the definition of the word exercise, and which term of the police shutting down a city should be used? Yikes, it's like we're polar opposites!

       If you really want to play that game, we can use alternate definitions on nearly every word we use.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry that you're such a masochist that you chose that definition, but I very clearly stated which definition I was using, (I even posted it in a reply) so as much as you want to play the victim, thats not the way I used the word.
      </p>
      <p>
       But by all means, only hear it the way you want, woe is you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't that huge of an insult, unless you take the definition that you want. For all you know, I was just calling you an angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not concise either, but that's not a huge insult, most people aren't.

       There's no reason to play the victim every time you post. Being immature doesn't enhance your non-existent point (bc you're not too concise.)

       No because a true martial law would be the military taking over for real law enforcement and suspending all standing laws. That kind of action would automatically draw protest in the US. A real "drill" would need some sort of resisting force to truly test the procedure. This is just law enforcement agencies trying to conduct a large area search/dragnet while keeping bystanders out of the way and safe. As far as I can tell there has been no signs of forced compliance, just people listening to requests because they'd really not like to be blow'd up.

       What a lot of people here are trying to say to people like you, is that it wouldn't draw protest if protesters were provided some false reason to
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       martial law.  Such as a desire for safety in the face of a rogue terrorist copkilling muslim communist bomber.

       Thats where r/conspiracy comes in.  What if this evil russian sonofabitch is just a tool to create circumstances where government lockdown would be welcomed!?  Rather than having to take people's freedom by force, people will give it up and thank the government for it.

       yeah I get what they are trying to say. What most conspiracy theorists don't get is that they aren't some how more intelligent than the general populace. The general populace isn't going to willing to be inconvienced by giving up there freedoms for long. Look at the widespread public backlash against the TSA and how its grown over the last few years.

       I dunno man.  I was in 8th grade on 9/11 and I was all for killing the SHIT outta some muslims.  Patriot act is for our protection and all that jazz.  Luckily I was fairly young so I can shrug off some of the shame by blaming my age, but there are plenty of people who were full adults that shared my sentiments, and still do.

       I'll be talking to people at work about this sort of stuff (r/conspiracy stuff) and they'll down with it to a point, but sooner or later they'll say "Wait is this all more of your conspiracy stuff?  You gotta warn me when you're going into this." (Actual quote from a couple days ago) After that everything I say is just more crazy tinfoil hattery.

       As far as widespread backlash against the TSA, I haven't seen much more than facebook activism and angry tweets.  Didn't do much to Kony and it won't do much against the TSA.

       Retaliation is way different than willingly accepting subjugation. Being that you were younger, I'm not sure how much you remember the amount of protest over the invasion of Iraq. Even 9/11 didn't give the government carte blanche when it came to invading countries and suspending freedom. The resistance to the Patriot Act and the TSA isn't new at all. These topics were a pretty large rallying point against Bush in 2004.

       True but the downtown in my city becomes a ghost town when advanced warning of DUI check points is leaked out.  Its not worth the hassle for people.  Add a bomb to that situation and you have the beginnings of a police state.  I think that the American form of tyranny will look a bit different than how people think that it will.  People won't want to run a guantlet and risk getting something as trivial as a traffic ticket just to buy some milk later in the evening.

       The thing I think you completely overlook is how long people are really willy to be inconvenienced for stuff like this. Americans are self entitled people that aren't really willing to put up with stuff for long. Look at OWS that was a bunch of people that weren't even really wronged and they organized and resisted. Americans might play along with "martial law" for a few days (even a week) but eventually they are going to get pissed and start acting out. At that point it comes down to numbers, the vast majority of the armed forces are conservatives and would be more than willing to turn on a tyrannical government if they needed to.

       I don't believe that a "martial law" in America will look anything like sustained tanks in the street.  Also why use the military to police when you can simply militarize the police and people are much more accepting of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that there is a much more subtle element to what will happen in the US.  The people will have much less money to spend it out on the town.  A large number of people will simply stay home.  Then it is called a "bad economy".
      </p>
      <p>
       There also will not necessarily be a permanent lock down everywhere but I think that it will become more and more frequent and people will become used to living in a soft police state for a few weeks at a time.  There will be many visceral distractions while trillions more are stolen.  When the people have been looted you can call it whatever you want to call it.

       As soon as I saw the news about the boston bombing, and the media labeling it as an act of terrorism I knew two things. 1. People would start criminilazing muslims again. 2. A law will be passed in the senate that would have a great impact on people and their privacy, I dont live in the USA so I dont know much of what is going on there, but I was right. these people are getting more and more predictable(sorry for my bad english)

        At least one bomb and possibly both were built using pressure cookers as the superstructure, black powder or gunpowder as the explosive and ball bearings as additional shrapnel, according to current and former counterterrorism officials briefed on the matter.

       I see this as a martial law drill for the upcoming confiscation of guns. This whole situation is backwards. according to the
       <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm">
        Center for Disease Control &amp; Prevention
       </a>
       , Americans are mainly dying from Heart disease and Cancer. Now this is in the hundred thousands per year. 'Terrorism' has caused a few thousand deaths all together. real Terrorism is Obama's drone policies that have killed hundreds if not thousands of innocent families. Now declaring a state of emergency in a major city over a very few individuals is a huge collectivist move. Now, keep in mind... due to the massive mainstream media exposure of this incident, laws and regulations will be put in place to further limit individual 'freedom'. I'm assuming there will be more Homeland security, body scanners, drones, etc. present at major events and people will slowly be conditioned to accept this. Same exact thing happen at the airports with the TSA after 9/11. They have an excuse to expand operations due to this event. I would say its a major PsyOp.

       I've been saying from the start "dead men tell no tales".  These guys are dead, and everything will be pinned on them.  TPTB can say anything they like, plant any amount of evidence they want, and the MSM will repeat, repeat, repeat until the fiction become fact.

       0.00001% chance of that. They had an active fire fight around 1am; over 200 rounds of spent cases recovered, explosive ordinance was used on the police. One suspect killed, the other fled 4-5 blocks in stolen SUV and fled on foot from there.

       Look, as much as I like my rights and would fight to protect them -- there was a guy on the run who was:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) armed
2) desperate
3) looking for a place to hide
4) might have explosives
5) Had already killed a cop and exchanged fire and thrown explosives at police.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only was the situation extremely dangerous for people in that area, they also had a chance to capture a person they had strong reasons to believe had something to do with the Boston Marathon bombings.
      </p>
      <p>
       While you may not agree with the methods they used, you can't argue they didn't have strong justification for what they did.

       The thing is, it isn't just 'one guy'. As far as they knew, he was extremely dangerous, armed, possibly strapped with a explosive vest in a residential area. He could be working with others as well. But maybe he didn't just get away, they're him to do this drill you speak of. It's also highly possible that they knew they were going to bomb and let it happen so they can pass various laws and do that Martial law 'drill'. I think the government prefers to LET tragic things happen to take advantage of it, then to stage events.

       One thing I found odd was how they decided to send the police helicopter away in the middle of the night.  They could have had it out all night to help identify where the man is.  Yet, they decide to go get a blackhawk instead.

       A blackhawk?  Do police departments own those?  Because if they are bringing out military equipment, that means the military is involved.  If the military is always out patrolling the streets and flying their helicopters around or driving MRAPS, wouldn't this be representative of a standing army?

       Doesn't this kind of thing happen all the time in New York City anyway? When I visited in November 2010, there was military personnel at Penn Station carrying assault rifles. Not sure about the Blackhawks, though. Perhaps they didn't have enough time to land the police chopper, refuel it, then take off and resume the search during a delicate time, so they asked the National Guard (or another branch of the military) for support or something.

       They were saying at the beginning of, and during the race that this was a drill.  Maybe it was the beginning of a much larger drill.

       Maybe the whole citywide shutdown and capture was the culmination of the drill.  It appeared to be successful if that was the case.

       An email I just sent a friend before seeing this post:
      </p>
      <p>
       What's insane to me is how people can just accept what the news tells them after we have such access to compelling information regarding coverups, planned operations and Government planned events to hide what's going on at Capitol Hill. Here's the laws that were pushed forward and/or passed while the media was given the Boston bombing as a diversion:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        CISPA passed by House:
        <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22213379">
         http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22213379
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        Congress exempt from insider trading law one week before all financial records were to be disclosed:

        </a>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       My thoughts - this was a drill. Not just the bombing itself. Not just the "coincidence" that there was a safety drill:
       <a href="http://www.infowars.com/confirmed-by-eyewitness-bomb-squad-drill-was-under-way-at-boston-maratho/">
        http://www.infowars.com/confirmed-by-eyewitness-bomb-squad-drill-was-under-way-at-boston-maratho/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Not just the "coincidence" that SpecialOps teams were present and formed immediately after the bombing. Not the "coincidence" that the same cops were in Sandy Hook and at the Boston marathon.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a full week long drill. From the safety training that happened days before in the area, through today. THey have more than likely recorded all of the response times, how quickly the public will fall under marshall law in a metropolitan &amp; suburban setting. Think about it, the only reason they probably chose Boston over Chicago is because Chicago is landlocked. This whole week was a military drill at the expense of the public tax dollars and lives to measure casualty rate, response time, public reaction and cooperation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems the only issue they repeatedly have is that the media can't get their story straight from one minute to the next. Even this could be a tactic to create confusion and fear. It's much easier to control the masses with fear than with truth.

      <p>
       Nothing at this level of intelligence is a mistake...or a coincidence. There were apparently bomb sniffing dogs and 500 National Guardsmen on duty at the marathon. These things don't just happen with that level of security.

       Maybe so, but a near complete lockdown, thousands of police and troops and heavy equipment, dozens of choppers for ONE GUY?

       I have a feeling this is more about conditioning than a serious desire to "keep the public safe".  This is more like a Martial Law drill (IMHO).

       There was gunfire and explosions in a residential neighborhood so they tell everyone to stay inside. Does that seriously sound unreasonable?
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, you people must have some sort of deep-seated problem with authority of ANY kind if you'd rather go outside with a madman on the loose than stay safe inside simply because you were told not to. No one in their right mind would want to go outside with that going on, but because the police request it while they are trying to find an extremely dangerous individual it means fucking Martial Law is being instituted.

       And if anyone disagree with you they are a dumb blind sheep. Right.

       So what exactly justifies shutting down a city? This man put a lot of lives at risk. Civilians voluntarily cooperating to return their city to a state of peace and safety is a lot different than the picture you are painting, in my opinion. Imagine living in Watertown and knowing that this disgruntled/heavily armed "teenager" who just lost his closest relative was at large in your backyard. Police are people too, risking THEIR lives for your own. I would do anything to get him into custody and out of the streets as quickly as possible.

       It isn't just about the bombing. They were shooting and throwing explosive devices in a RESIDENTIAL area. I saw pictures of a guys house with bullet holes because of the gun fight. It was likely that he could of started to kill people because he knew he was going to get caught. The reacted correctly. But now did they let it happen for a political agenda? Did they let him get away?
