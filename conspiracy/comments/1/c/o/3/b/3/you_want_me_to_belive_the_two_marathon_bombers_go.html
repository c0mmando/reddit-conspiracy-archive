Perhaps they went to the 7/11 to get some food and the clerk recognized them. They noticed this, got hostile...somebody else saw this so it was described as a robbery?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One way or another, everyone in this country pays taxes because it is mandated, not because they want to.  It is very unfortunate that some of our tax dollars take innocent lives, but the way our government spends that money is basically out of our hands, which is a completely different problem.  The people who are responsible for the Boston attack thought it out and planned what they would do.  I agree with the original comment that anyone who can place a bomb at the feet of an innocent child does not have the ability to function properly on an emotional level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you live in a country, breathe its air, consume its food, take advantage of its roads and sidewalks, use its medical facilities and anything else it has to offer for the betterment of your life there may come a day when that country does something that goes against your moral code.  When that time comes your country comes first, it may mean you have to stand shoulder to shoulder with your fellow countrymen and fight for something you don&#39;t believe in, but fight you must, and if that means shooting paki kids then you shoot them.  If you are not prepared to die for your country then you shouldn&#39;t live in it.  You should move to Pakistan now and give everything you have to someone more deserving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you explain a fertilizer bomb in the back of a truck parked on the side of the street taking out half of a 10 story building? Also, McVeigh had his psyche destroyed by psychological testing by the government before he went crazy (hence all the material available on him). None of us really know what happened with these things; we shouldn&#39;t use propaganda to justify more propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t mean to imply that I have any idea what happened in the McVeigh case; I&#39;m not an expert and I have no idea what transpired in his &quot;interview.&quot; I simply meant to point out that admitting guilt, especially in very serious crimes such as rape and murder, doesn&#39;t <em>necessarily</em> make the case open and shut. In some places, and with some people, law enforcement is less about solving actual crimes and more about keeping the status quo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All that means is that you&#39;ve never studied into psychological programming. You can convince people of all sorts of things about themselves with the right facilities and chemicals available to you. These types of programs have been well documented to the public for decades now; it should not be a surprise that they exist. To act as if a crazy person like McVeigh should be trusted on that one count but dismissed on all the others is not consistent; if you want to believe that he admitted to it (which I also believe he did), you should also have a little listen on what he had to say about the CIA and military as well. Just sayin&#39; - my deal is &quot;the only thing I know is that I do not know&quot;. You know just as little as me; we should both be less sure.</p>

<p>Also, way to side step my original point: how does a Uhaul full of fertilizer blow up half a 10 story building from 50 feet away?</p>

<p>&#39;Move along people... nothing to see here...&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree we should both be less sure. And I am fully opening to saying it wasn&#39;t him and that I was wrong. It&#39;s just looking at all of the evidence in my mind I concluded it was him. You had him Nichols and Nichols brother all say yes it was them. I just think that sometimes fucked up people do fucked up things and that was one of those cases. I just think that a lot of people are stubborn on their own thoughts. There will never ever be enough evidence for people to believe that it was him. We have him and everyone saying it was him all the evidence points to him and yet people still do not believe it, I&#39;m just not sure what we need to see in order for people to believe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if it&#39;s a 3rd answer tho? &quot;He did it, but he didn&#39;t do it alone?&quot; What if he was like a domino that was put into place, and his action put into action all the other pieces as well? When you go back and say &quot;where did this all start?&quot;,  you would point at that original domino, but you probably wouldn&#39;t implicate the person who set up the rest of them to fall as they did. With McVeigh, I think he drove the truck, I think there was a bomb on the truck, and I think he exploded that bomb, but I also think there was additional explosives within the building set to detonate at the same time. Much like WTC7. But, as you mentioned, ultimately I don&#39;t know. I just don&#39;t like people speaking in absolutes about things that we or they just cannot know, especially when the government/CIA is involved in some way. False flag attacks are written into history as a tactic our military leadership is not afraid to use (check out Operation Northwoods from the Cuba crisis in &#39;62); we should not automatically assume that such tactics are out of bounds. The problem with &#39;evidence&#39; is that it comes from the source that is usually implicated so it&#39;s hard to take at face value. Again, &#39;official&#39; stories are only useful if the &#39;officials&#39; aren&#39;t in question or danger. That is not always the truth in these cases...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People who commit crimes like this generally don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be caught.  They are by the every nature irrational thinkers because most people do get caught.  So trying to put it in context of someone who was using cost benefit analysis is wrong.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not signaling you out specifically for thinking this way.  It is a huge problem in our criminal justice system.  If you want a real &quot;conspiracy&quot; it is that our laws are written to dissuade people who are acting rationally when most crimes are by their very nature are irrational. </p>

<p>A 130 pound kid has been evading an entire police force, SWAT teams &amp; FBI for hours now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s my issue with it. If they had been responsible for the bombings, I&#39;m sure it would have been well planned prior to the attack. A plan would include a place to hide out if they got away. Probably not just right around the block. And I&#39;d assume they wouldn&#39;t be going to a college, where security is already tight... and then hijacking cars... It all seems a little too attention grabbing for a couple guys who just committed an act of terror and need to get away.</p>

I mean I don&#39;t know if they have video but that&#39;s damn convincing that those are the right guys.</p>

<p>I mean.. The guy whose legs were blown off could be - to play devils advy - was drugged up heavily. They could have been showing him photos non stop and his memory I mean how much do you trust it when something super traumatic happens like that. Most ppl tend to forget and black out completely those moments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no problem.  im sure we are gonna get more information as we go on. the guy said the bomber looked right in his eyes before he set the bag down and two minutes later it exploded. but your right, eye witness accounts are not accurate 100% of the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The backpack that was exploded and they had found was not the same one as the picture of the white hat kid who placed it down - they haven&#39;t shown THAT exploded backpack - and that&#39;s the same guy they show the pic of who&#39;s on the left of the evidence photos without his pack.</p>

<p>They should be able to maybe also show that grey backpack right? But also it could be totally disintegrated.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked people right in the eyes too. If that person turned around and was exploded I&#39;m sure he would indicate me as well - but was he watching the backpack explode in real time?</p>

<p>I was suggesting that sometimes ppl take their backpacks off because they get heavy. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m not saying they are wrong about this guy, they would have to go super far to be pulling one on the public but taking care of them by murder is a nice easy way to tie up those ends.</p>

<p>Its strange that they have those army type guys everyone id&#39;d and also two other dudes that could be suspected, who people also claimed to see without backpacks -- its easy to say they never said anything about suspects until doing their homework, but also they could have done very thorough background checks before choosing how and who to take the fall.</p>

<p>If there were for sure photos/vid of them fighting back I would be 100% convinced. I&#39;m only 99.9% convinced without it.</p>

<p>The backpack that was exploded and they had found was not the same one as the picture of the white hat kid who placed it down - they haven&#39;t shown THAT exploded backpack - and that&#39;s the same guy they show the pic of who&#39;s on the left of the evidence photos without his pack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>correct. and yea idk why they haven&#39;t showed the other bag.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;ve looked people right in the eyes too. If that person turned around and was exploded I&#39;m sure he would indicate me as well - but was he watching the backpack explode in real time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>idk. he did say he saw him place the bag down and leave though.</p>

<p>yea i don&#39;t really doubt these are not the guys but i really want them to get him alive. although if he has a bomb on him like his brother idk how realistic that is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its strange that they have those army type guys everyone id&#39;d and also two other dudes that could be suspected, who people also claimed to see without backpacks </p>
</blockquote>

<p>i dont really understand this part.</p>

<p>im in the same boat with you i think for the  most part.  I would definitely enjoy more evidence. </p>

<p>bc the picture where the bag is and the picture of that bombsite matches. do you think they saw two brothers told them to go put their bags down in different spots and then shot a rocket at it or something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats what I keep telling people. There is no &quot;hard&quot; evidence that these guys did it other than some grainy photos. It doesn&#39;t make sense that they would go do something as stupid as rob a 711. Im not saying it wasn&#39;t them, but the Boston PD and FBI are frantic trying to get the bombers and this fits well. Yes these guys are terrorists in their own right because of what they did......but that doesn&#39;t mean they are related to the bombing.

    <div class="md"><p>Why does everyone insist on trying to put this in terms of what a rational person would do?  Someone who would commit a crime like this is by the very nature irrational.</p>

<p>Ironically you are buying into the government&#39;s system.  They tell us criminals make cost benefit analysis before committing crimes and if we make the penalties bad enough it&#39;ll stop them.   The truth is most criminals who commit crimes don&#39;t really think about the consequences or think some how they are magically not going to get caught.</p>

Its real funny though that most of these things end with some extremely stupid move on the &#39;suspects&#39; side as if someone who plans a bombing can&#39;t think more than a step ahead, or they plan up to the bombing and then just wing it afterwards. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t personally believe a &quot;false flag&quot; attack would have no planned finale.  If there is enough work to go into designing and creating an attack- there is absolutely zero possibility that there was no thorough thought put into a conclusion.</p>

<p>It does matter how these things end if they are &quot;false flag&quot; because it is about more than the attack itself.  Leaving huge loose ends with little regard is sloppy and if there was effort to design an attack like this- surely there was an end result created.</p>

<p>While I personally don&#39;t believe this to be any kind of &quot;false flag&quot;- I also don&#39;t think it makes sense to imagine that there is so much planning and conspiring to execute an attack against citizens and then zero forethought on what happens next.  That seems like it is a grave underestimating of the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why this is a textbook Conspiracy theory. This is why I come here. It is a perfect demonstration of the psychological underpinnings of how people believe in stuff like this. The government is all powerful, they have the ability to create these large false flag events that trick and manipulate the public to achieve their own dark means. The evidence for this? It&#39;s poorly pulled off. The very smart and organized government does they&#39;re acts in a poor manner. Now if these two had built a helicopter and flown out of the country, well, it&#39;s OBVIOUS only a big well organized government could pull that off. The way most people work is that they only take in info that reinforces they&#39;re predisposed beliefs. People who believe in conspiracies take in ALL information, and manipulate it to reinforce they&#39;re beliefs. Again, absolutely textbook.</p>
