<p>*NEW INTERVIEW WITH AUNT.</p>

<ul>
<li>*shes asking for proof it was them who did it.</li>
<li>*she claimed they are being set up, and theyre only using them.</li>
<li>*she was the first person to call FBI tip line and they FBI still hasnt contacted her.</li>
</ul>

<p>She was cut off, her name was Maret Tsarnaev <em>thanks grunkalunk</em>. She just claimed.</p>

<ul>
<li>the interviews saying to tell them to turn them selfs in and  everything will be taken care of by their father isnt something he would say.</li>
<li>&quot;I know my brother and he wouldnt be able to open his mouth if he knew what was going on&quot;</li>
<li>She had visited Dzhokhar&#39;s twitter and Youtube and when she looked at his videos she felt that the voice she heard was a nasty angry voice and wasnt sure if it was his.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just a weird interview that went down thought you guys should know.</p>

Something along the lines of the &#39;bombers being mentally unstable and the aunt not even noticing&#39;?

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s highly possible the &quot;voice&quot; she&#39;s talking about was a fake, can&#39;t find link now but I recall it being tested on a senator where his own voice was altered to say something incriminating &amp; played back for him to hear. This is a real technology and not a rumor. I wondered about those &quot;phone calls&quot; from the doomed 9/11 planes as well. For those of you who don&#39;t already know, look up who owns Amdocs- the company that handles almost the entire country&#39;s telephone service. </p>
