      <ul>
       <li>
        *shes asking for proof it was them who did it.
       </li>
       <li>
        *she claimed they are being set up, and theyre only using them.
       </li>
       <li>
        *she was the first person to call FBI tip line and they FBI still hasnt contacted her.
       </li>

      <p>
       She was cut off, her name was Maret Tsarnaev

      <ul>
       <li>
        the interviews saying to tell them to turn them selfs in and  everything will be taken care of by their father isnt something he would say.
       </li>
       <li>
        "I know my brother and he wouldnt be able to open his mouth if he knew what was going on"
       </li>
       <li>
        She had visited Dzhokhar's twitter and Youtube and when she looked at his videos she felt that the voice she heard was a nasty angry voice and wasnt sure if it was his.

      </ul>

       Just a weird interview that went down thought you guys should know.

       That video still doesn't show the end of the press conference.  They still cut her off in that video.

       Does anybody think that the government may use the Aunts statement AGAINST the suspected bombers? Something along the lines of the 'bombers being mentally unstable and the aunt not even noticing'? I just have a feeling that her interview could be manipulated against her, and her nephews in a way that would negatively spin society's view on this whole situation..

       Yes definitely, even as she speaks the headlines change from different things she says and almost give her words a negative tone. So yeah they're doing that already

       Damn. I've been reading through alot of posts about the bombs, this idea really clicked after hearing her interview. This event is just the spark the fuel has been waiting for.

       Shades of Flight 93 and the fake phone calls "passengers" made before it "crashed." Vocal manipulation technology has come a long way since then, too.

       It's highly possible the "voice" she's talking about was a fake, can't find link now but I recall it being tested on a senator where his own voice was altered to say something incriminating &amp; played back for him to hear. This is a real technology and not a rumor. I wondered about those "phone calls" from the doomed 9/11 planes as well. For those of you who don't already know, look up who owns Amdocs- the company that handles almost the entire country's telephone service.
