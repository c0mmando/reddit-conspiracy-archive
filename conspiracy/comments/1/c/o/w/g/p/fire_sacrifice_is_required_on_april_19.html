       April 19 - May 1
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Blood Sacrifice To The Beast, a most critical 13-day period. Fire sacrifice is required on April 19.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       April 19 is the first day of the 13-day Satanic ritual day relating to fire - the fire god, Baal, or Molech/Nimrod (the Sun God), also known as the Roman god, Saturn (Satan/Devil). This day is a major human sacrifice day, demanding fire sacrifice with an emphasis on children. This day is one of the most important human sacrifice days, and as such, has had some very important historic events occur on this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, the Illuminati considers war to be a most propitious way to sacrifice, for it kills both children and adults.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the very important historic dates that were staged according to this blood sacrifice day are:
      </p>
      <pre><code>(1). April 19, 1775 - Battle of Lexington &amp; Concord, which made the Masonic-led Revolutionary War inevitable

(2). April 19, 1943 - After trapping the last Jewish Resistance Fighters in a storm drain in Warsaw, and holding them for several days, Nazi Storm Troopers began to pour fire into each end of the storm drain, using flame-throwers. They continued pouring the fire into the drain until all fighters were dead. Blood sacrifice brought about by a fiery conflagration.

(3) April 19, 1993 - 50 years later, to the day, government troops, tanks, and other military equipment stormed the compound of David Koresh and his followers at Waco, Texas. Certainly, this operation fulfilled the basic requirements for a human sacrifice: trauma, fire, and young sacrificial victims.

(4) April 19, 1995 - Oklahoma City bombing - Once again, many young children were killed this day
</code></pre>
      <p>
       April 19 of any year in the 20th Century is a day of fearful contemplation, for it seems that, as we head into the final stretch of time, Satan is becoming more and more bold, and is using April 19 more often.

       Haha thanks for the suggestion; my web domain is gov't subsidized - I was told by my stepmom (cheaper to live at home than dorm or apartment) that if I visit a number of kinds of websites our IP address becomes permanently blacklisted. It's terrible; I was really active in the IN division of NORML back in Bloomington but I'm afraid to go on their website :/
      </p>
      <p>
       I know a few people around but they're paranoid to open up new customers, especially since they don't know me very well. It's especially unfortunate that tomorrow will be the first 4/20 spent sober in 5 years.

       I think a bill was introduced to legalize medicinal marijuana on my end of the map, but it's undoubtedly going to fail.

       The reason for the increases boldness is one of desperation. Think of how long things were the same all the way back before Christ and now things have been changing. This past year especially has seen enormous change. The earth is cleansing itself and the lower astral realms of the demons who have for so long propagated anger and violence and greed and hate. The days of peace are within our reach. Sorry but your post got me goin and I've recently been abused by the shills quite a bit. Peace dude

       The general populace doesn't really think about Syria and the horrors that country goes through every minute of everyday.

       In one of my writing courses, the students weren't even aware of French military activity in Mali which has been going on for well over a year.

       My worst fear is that they may find out about Syria very soon (or find out that it was a "lynchpin" for things far greater in scope and scale, much, much after-the-fact).  Mali, yes, that too is below nearly everyone's radar.  Likely more-so, as I infer.  The French interactions in the Middle East as of late are very important pieces in the big picture as well.

       of OP's submission, I surmised that with today's events, and recent event's trends, the idea of a movement to engineer Revelation to be not entirely without merits. As in, an influence working at creating the right societal conditions and state of mind of the people for induce the End Times. huh. My mind is fumbling.

       The young man has been taken into custody; I, personally, still believe in innocence until guilt even if the rest of the country doesn't; I've been praying for him... and I just realized that because he didn't die, he will be subject to interrogation by the CIA, FBI, and HS.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started to cry. No matter what you believe, this boy has not been convicted of any crime (and I don't think he was responsible) so keep him in your thoughts - he's in for a terrible future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, because of the emotions carried by this event, he will undoubtedly be found guilty and he will be killed. I hope this isn't the case.

       <em>
        some

       kind of fire around the world on almost any day in history. And this type of thinking just allows you to validate your beliefs by Google-searching the term 'fire' on the day it "should" occur and latching on to whatever random event fits best. Use a wide enough net and you're going to catch
       <em>
        some

       fish -- congratulations! This type of thinking is self-validating and you're only going to drive yourself insane by continuing to follow along with it. Don't be stupid.

       There is more than one perspective on the nature of truth; I, personally, believe that truth can be attained through subjective experience. What makes sense for one person may not for another. 
Because I am a theist, this inherently affects my perspective of reality. I believe in a Creator; I think there are forces in the world beyond the control of people - I also believe that there is evil and that evil has control over the actions of some, or many.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, at any rate, it's not like me to belittle others with different perspectives than my own. Every perspective is a congruent shadow that cascades from one truth - who am I to judge?

       I don't do any drugs. I used to smoke cannabis (haven't in four months). I drink about once every 6-12 months, no speed, no barbiturates. I did one hit [each] of acid on two separate a couple of years ago, didn't like it and won't do it again. Psilocybin mushrooms once about 3 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       From your past posts I can surmise that you're an atheist - how the hell will you come to any conclusion on any idea of a theist other than being completely wrong? To you, the idea of an organized universe contradicts everything you're conditioned to believe (I was an atheist for years). I decided to believe in a Creator - I decided to believe that there is evil, as well as good.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read the stories of the Taurat, the Bible and the Qur'an and interpret them as allegory; some as explanation of natural phenomena, others as idealized lives, euhemerism, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       And who cares if my ideas are completely wrong? I certainly don't; I'm a fallible human being with a relatively short life-span - I'm not hurting anyone by showing my perspective. If someone wants to believe in something other than the emptiness of space and death, why does it bother you so much?
