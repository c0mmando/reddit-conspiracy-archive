<p>Nope. You would probably not even be stopped, unless you&#39;re right in the middle of the action. People are <em>asked</em> to stay at home, not ordered, and the order that hasn&#39;t actually been given isn&#39;t being enforced by police either.</p>

<p>Update: they just lifted the... &quot;asking&quot; that people stay at home. People are still free to go anywhere and do anything. Yes, sounds like a regular police state to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, first of all... infowars? Really?</p>

<p>Second of all, the video. No context. Did the police get an explicit tip that he might have been inside that house?</p>

<p>They knocked on the door, and waited for someone to open. They then asked the person to keep their hands up and move down to the street. &quot;Shocking&quot; indeed. Truly shocking that the police protect themselves and ask that people comply as they&#39;re searching for a very violent and dangerous terrorist. Again, at the time not only had #2 already shot and killed a cop, but had also thrown <em>bombs</em> at the police and there was no reason to suspect he didn&#39;t have more of them. That&#39;s a pretty damn sensitive situation, and asking people to step out with their hands up as they search the house (it&#39;s also impossible to hear if they asked whether or not they could search the house. They could have done so.) isn&#39;t at all way outside the lines.</p>

<p><em>Any</em> SWAT-equipped cop with a weapon in their hands is going to look intimidating, whether they point their weapons at you or not... Which they didn&#39;t really. They were, as far as I can see, quite relaxed and, at most, vigilant. They were not breaking down doors, and didn&#39;t at any point treat the residents as hostiles or even suspects.</p>

<p>They were going by protocol, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the photos. Just a bunch of random photos of police with the words &quot;police state&quot; and &quot;martial law&quot; thrown about. Hardly a serious and unbiased look at what went on.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t decide on what you want to believe happened, and the proceed to find and interpret only the evidence that matches that belief. Look at that video objectively. Consider the complete lack of any context. Then tell me honestly that you can draw any clear conclusions from it.</p>

<p>Now we&#39;re moving the goal post... Let&#39;s clear things up: people were <em>free</em> to go out <em>if they wanted to</em>, but there was still a general recommendation that people stay indoors. There were also tons of police, armed with automatic weapons outside on the streets. I don&#39;t know about you, but even if I were <em>allowed</em> to go out in a situation like that, I most likely wouldn&#39;t. Just like most people didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>There was no official curfew, no official martial law, no police state, no fascist dictatorship. What it was was a massive police action spanning tens of blocks looking for a violent terrorist.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, it didn&#39;t provide any context, did it? It was just a video showing police performing a search. No idea exactly why, no idea at what precise point in the search, no idea what the orders at the time were, etc etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a video of police entering a house, and neither of us actually knows precisely why, other than the general fact that they were searching for #2. That&#39;s it. Anything else is conjecture, and if we&#39;re going to speculate, I would prefer it to be based on actual facts, as opposed to a necessarily conspiracy-based narrative.</p>

<p>You, on the other hand, saw a couple of pictures on 4chan and reddit and think you have it all figured out. That is hardly the truth you speak of. The truth is you don&#39;t know shit, I don&#39;t know shit, nobody knows shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ill be very brief.  Basically the Illuminati is behind most of these false flags.  BUT behind the Illuminati is a great evil and that is Satan.  It is not a coincidence that most if not all secret societies of top rank including free masons practice satanic rituals.<br/>
The whole point of these false flags is to pass Marshall law.  With Marshall law they have control over the people and are allowed to do what they want with them.  This includes giving them the &quot;Mark of the Beast&quot;.  This tribulation has been prophesized in the bible centuries ago and it is all coming to fruition.  As you can see many media outlets are already questioning the religious views of the suspect that supposedly made the bombing.  This is to focus on religion.  Where are slowly but surely are starting to go against any source of religion and this is going to shift to Christianity to the point where Christians will be persecuted because they will be seen as threats for having some kind of &quot;extremist&quot; religious view.  We are going to get to a point where we will all be very scared and paranoid that the government will want us to take vaccines, chips, and other stuff to make us &quot;safe&quot; but in reality it is just to keep us as puppets.  I predict that we are going to have some big health epidemic and government is going say that a major quarantine is needed and we will be forced to comply and take their &quot;meds&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for reading and not bashing me.  It is just my take on this and I can be wrong in some aspects but I do stand very firm on the fact that most people of higher rank (illuminati) have ties with the devil.  I don&#39;t know the time frame but our laws are changing faster than ever so that should indicate something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure, everyone has their own take on all this, and everyone has the right to show it. I def think there is something fishy going on up top, but haven&#39;t looked in to it enough to make an opinion. I want to know what happened with the Saudi Official Obama met with. I know the 20 year old saudi was cleared and then thought to be deported, but Steve Emerson mixed that up. However there is a saudi man that is being deported next tuesday, just not the same Saudi thought to be a person of interest. Who was this other guy being deported and what went on between Kerry, Obama and the Saudi officials. That is still fishy to me.</p>

<p>Just saying, everyone is innocent until proven guilty in court. It&#39;s one of the rights of many countries. If you want your rights, you (the general &quot;you&quot;) should accept that EVERYONE has that right, whether they pocketed a Snickers bar at a gas station or blew up a populated area and were in a gunfight with the police.</p>

This source I assume is the guy who took the pictures, and talked w/ multiple media outlets last night.  Also the video from the hospital the doctor not once mentions anything about him being ran over.  I think that would have been something important for the media to know..  Considering he told them about the gunshots and how the shrapnel in his chest.  Maybe he was just hit, and not actually ran over?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand what being ignorant means. Ignorance means ignoring facts and &quot;believing&quot;. </p>

<p>Acquiring evidence and facts to base an opinion on is the exact opposite of being ignorant.</p>

<p>So in light of this fact, by definition, you are ignorant because you choose to &quot;believe&quot; what has no evidence and I am not ignorant because i base my opinion on facts.</p>

<p>I will always need to see evidence because assuming and speculating without a shred of evidence is ridiculous and you will never be taken seriously when you spout such utter shite which you have no clue about except for fabricating a fantasy in your brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Each state has their own National Guard. They follow the directions of not only the President, but the Governor of their respected state. A lot of the overweight soldier pictures from Iraq and Afghanistan were Guardsmen. That is not to say that there aren&#39;t Guardsmen who work to stay in the fittest shape. They are Reservists so that means a weekend out of each month they get together for drills, pt, and work. If I am not mistaken, they are usually sent out more for disasters. Hurricanes, Earthquakes, Tornados, and all of that instead of war zones. But they do get sent out into war zones</p>

<p>They were formed essentially as the militia men from the revolutionary war. So in essence they are the militia.</p>

<p>No more life&#39;s need to be lost or ruined if its possible to stop the chances.  Plus they aren&#39;t aware how deep this plot is, there may be more involved. Christ let the investigators take care of it, stop wanting a negative story behind all this involving false flags!

<p>I think your concern is fair, but the FBI, ATF, State Police, City Police, MIT Police are also on the scene. So, it seems like they&#39;re putting all resources in. There&#39;s a finite number of police and they&#39;re still getting other calls for other things so they still need to keep some officers elsewhere in the city. I doubt they&#39;re busting college kids for smoking plant leaves when they could be much more useful at this time.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s overkill, I have no idea what they need. But, it may not even be the people they want... it may be equipment -- the national guard likely has more armored vehicles and equipment for finding and disarming bombs.</p>

Let&#39;s clear things up: people were <em>free</em> to go out <em>if they wanted to</em>, but there was still a general recommendation that people stay indoors. There were also tons of police, armed with automatic weapons outside on the streets. I don&#39;t know about you, but even if I were <em>allowed</em> to go out in a situation like that, I most likely wouldn&#39;t. Just like most people didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>There was no official curfew, no official martial law, no police state, no fascist dictatorship. What it was was a massive police action spanning tens of blocks looking for a violent terrorist.</p>

<p>Context, I did not use the &quot;site&quot; but only video to show CONTEXT on the issue of if you were asked or DEMANDED to stay inside.</p>

<p>Well, it didn&#39;t provide any context, did it? It was just a video showing police performing a search. No idea exactly why, no idea at what precise point in the search, no idea what the orders at the time were, etc etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a video of police entering a house, and neither of us actually knows precisely why, other than the general fact that they were searching for #2. That&#39;s it. Anything else is conjecture, and if we&#39;re going to speculate, I would prefer it to be based on actual facts, as opposed to a necessarily conspiracy-based narrative.</p>
