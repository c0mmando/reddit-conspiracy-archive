<p>It&#39;s a choice bad guys often make that is often called &quot;suicide by cop&quot;.</p>

<p>If they had exited the vehicle and laid on the ground with their arms outstretched, they could have been taken into custody and then properly tortured for information, then hopefully tortured to death, slowly and painfully, and finally had their bodies disposed of in the most heinous way imaginable to their particular religion.</p>
