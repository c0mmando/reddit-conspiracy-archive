       Foremost the fact that two people died Monday is horrible and tragic and whoever did this should be tried in a court and punished.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to declare a whole town "can't leave their homes" and to allow police to go door to door and interview you?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, fuck you, I have work and get off my families property.  This is a violation of civilian liberties.  This is to test the population to how they will behave in an official martial law scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lived in NY and there were murders every week.  And no you can not bring a tank in my fucking neighborhood and come in my house and inspect it.  If more citizens in bean town has guns to wouldn't need 900 cops getting overtime to march around boston with wannabe van tanks.

       Yeah, sorry, this guy is right. Everybody is cooperating because they don't WANT to be outside right now, not because they have been ordered to by police. I'm sure that

       Lol you serious? It's not speculation. Police did not "order" people to stay inside, they did not "declare martial law." Fact. Yet, from the pictures of ghost-town boston all over the internet today, it's obvious most have stayed inside. The only logical conclusion is that they are staying inside because they WANT to. Sure it is probably heavily influenced by the "advice" given to them by the police, but it's still a
       <em>
        choice
       </em>
       they are making.

       Police cannot order you to allow them to search your car for drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you let them, then it must be because you WANT to.  Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not for fear of repercussions.  Certainly not that.  I mean, who would expect police to behave irrationally when their requests, such as to remain inside, are denied?

       If you have drugs in your car and don't let cops search, they will call in a dog to sniff. Unless you are a skilled smuggler, the dog will catch a sent and they will have probable cause anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know that there have been plenty of people who have stood their grounds in these situations, right? They got wrongfully pulled over for whatever bullshit reason and refused a search because they are innocent. You know what happens in these cases? The cops get their dogs to come out, the dogs don't pick up a scent, and after wasting two hours of that person's life, they let him go because they have to.
      </p>
      <p>
       So most people who do get into this situation make a CHOICE to let the cops search their car. Not for fear of repercussions, but rather because they don't want to wait an hour or two for the next available dog to show up. Sure, they probably don't WANT to let them search their car, but it's still a choice they are making.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your complaint here is extremely pedantic. My original statement wasn't so much that they
       <em>
        desire
       </em>
       to stay inside today, but rather that they are
       <em>
        making a choice
       </em>
       to stay inside, rather than being forced to with the threat of certain consequences. I thought that was, and it should have been, obvious.

       Well the drugs thing was just the first thing to pop into my head.  But you're aware that its not unheard of, or even uncommon, for dogs to "smell drugs" where drugs are not present, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       My point was, that even though police "ask" you to do something, there will be consequences if you deny their "requests."
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess having heavily armed paramilitary forces in your doorway has no influence on your "choice" to stay inside then?

       Of course it has an influence, but we're talking about the theoretical question of whether or not these people
       <em>
        made a choice
       </em>
       to stay inside, or were
       <em>
        forced against their will
       </em>
       to stay inside.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far there is no credible evidence of anybody being forced against their will, just a bunch of hearsay.

       I'm not fine with the massive display of military force, or the intrusion into private homes in the name of "safety."

       Also not cool with the suggestion that people's decisions to stay inside is unrelated to the armored vehicles in their streets and armed police forces in their neighborhoods.

       Okay well, the massive display of military force in this situation is pretty warranted. There's a terrorist on the loose who's only apparent motivation is to harm other people with explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       By your logic, since there are many police and tanks outside, any instance of them "asking" you to do something is really just intimidation tactics and omfg martial law. So no, you actually are NOT "fine" with the police asking/advising people to stay inside. By your logic, you are only "fine" with them asking people to stay inside if there is not a corresponding massive display of military force.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what you seem to want here is for the police to ask people to stay inside, but to not actually have any officers or vehicles out on the streets, because otherwise they are not really asking they are ordering/intimidating you to stay inside. Do you not see the catch-22 here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, sorry to burst your bubble, but it's impossible for them to do their job in boston right now - catch this guy and protect innocent people from harm - without a lot of officers and vehicles on the street. If simply their presence is going to, in your mind, change "asking" into "ordering," then I truly cannot fathom what you think should be happening right now. It sounds to me like what you would like to see is no police presence at all, and that is really hilariously stupid.

       You're right man.  This is the only possible solution.

      <p>
       Flooding the streets with armored vehicles and invading peoples homes is the
       <em>
        ONLY
       </em>
       way to stop the terrorists.
      </p>

       I don't think house to house searching is the best solution, nor do I think it will accomplish anything.  How you can think thats a good idea is beyond me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think its a good idea in any situation to lose our shit and let the government do whatever it wants for any reason.  It hasn't helped anything in the past.  It wont help anything now.  I don't know about you, but if armored men were knocking on my door asking to search my shit, I wouldn't feel safer.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah.  I am only fine with a police request if it comes without a corresponding display of military force, because I'm not okay with police displays of military force.  I'm not sure if that was supposed to be some sort of sarcastic jab at me, but its dead on.

       False quotes are cute.  You say things like "look at my comments I never said that" and then make shit up to "quote?"  Seriously guy?
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said, and I'm not of the opinion, that any police presence is a display of military force.  The fact that you have to reduce the argument to the extremes of complete absence of police vs total military lockdown shows how unable you are to actually defend your stance.

       But what can you expect on a day when r/conspiracy suddenly makes a 180degree ideological shift overnight.  Definitely not shills though.  Everybody just suddenly saw the light and no longer believes in false flags or government setups.

       The only people who are ever going to see this deep are you and I, we both know that you didn't say those second two things as I quoted them. I wasn't trying to hide that. I was paraphrasing, angrily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it's really hard to understand you're actual stance. What exact display of force, between absolutely 0 and what we are actually seeing, would be the threshold here? At which point does the police's "asking" turn into "forcing."
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, it is a question of whether or not people actually face consequences for stepping outside, or refusing a search, in this whole ordeal. You guys are saying yes absolutely, but we have no real evidence. Somewhere here there's a twitter chick who makes it seem like she was asked
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       she wanted her home searched. I just don't trust any sources and I think it's terrible to jump to the conclusion that this is basically martial law and people are being forced to submit to searches (invaded, as you've said.) The vast majority of unnofficial sources I am seeing today lead me to believe that people are not being forced to do anything or threatened here. I really think that somebody would get this kind of thing on video and especially if it was happening widespread and in the open, we'd be seeing tons and tons of hard evidence of it. When I see the evidence I will agree with you.

       About this subreddit changing overnight I cannot say, I am new here. But look at my posts (if you want), I am a member of
       <a href="/r/libertarian">
        /r/libertarian
       </a>
       and that's about the extent of political discussion on reddit so far. I'll try to take it as a compliment you implying I'm a shill, but yeah... I fucking hate our government and the untouchable corporate/banking elite that own them.

       Yes it is speculation, I know because our media is showing evidence that you're wrong. People are being threatened, live on tv, to get back indoors. 
Hence it is not "everybody cooperating". Not a choice.

       I'm in the uk, it was BBC and Sky news. The police were forcing people out of as we'll as into their homes, so they could be searched without a warrant.

       Rofl, I've already given more info than you have elsewhere in this thread, but I'll copy it for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main source giving me the impression that they are not ordering/forcing people to stay inside is the
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Boston_Police">
        BPD Twitter Feed
       </a>
       . The announcements there clearly indicate they are
       <em>
        advising
       </em>
       people to stay inside and are asking for the community's
       <em>
        consent
       </em>
       with searches.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your main source is "I saw it on the news."
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen I'll put it pretty simply. If there were police caught on camera
       <em>
        forcing
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        ordering
       </em>
       people into their homes, the clip would already be on youtube and trending all over social media. It's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       You give me a youtube clip of such a thing and I will admit that I am completely wrong and that you were right all along. I am patient; I will be following this for quite some time. If it exists, that clip
       <strong>
        will
       </strong>
       find its way to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit - as for "everybody is cooperating" you can't be complaining about the literal interpretation of "everybody", right?

       The point is that you and the OP of the "theory" have picked something which is completely unverifiable (since we can't go back on the live stream), lacks any other sources confirming said "news" (which I would bet there would be many), and from an organization that, throughout this whole ordeal, has been shown repeatedly to be the last place for quality information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is no one reporting this in the one of many threads relating to the incident?  The instructions to "threaten" people would go over the scanners, why has no one picked that detail up?  It doesn't appear on the CNNLive twitter feed, nor in any CNN articles... wouldn't news like that be worthy of an article (if not a headline) and a tweet?

       So yeah, gtfo please, eye guy. Unless you give me a youtube link to this "threatening" thing on CNN you saw. If police where on camera threatning innocent people just for being outside and not wanting to stay inside, it would be on youtube right now and already trending. It's not.

       Thanks.

      <p>
       They "ordered" businesses to close, but only "told" residents to stay inside. The author of this article is paraphrasing, and his use of the world "told" is ambiguous. He used the word "ordered" for businesses, but "told" for residents. I'm assuming here it is totally acceptable in this situation to ask business to stay closed, but I am no lawyer that is admittedly an assumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways... if they were both "orders", why didn't he use "ordered" in both parts of this sentence? This article is easily consistent with the official story right now which is that the BPD
       <em>
        asked
       </em>
       people to stay inside.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could definitely be wrong, I hope not, but sure, I could be wrong here. Probably not going to know for sure either way until videos surface. If there really was a live incident that you saw on CNN showing officers
       <em>
        threatening
       </em>
       innocent civilians just for being outside, then it
       <strong>
        will
       </strong>
       end up on youtube and I'll see it. Until then I am waiting for more information.

       Pathetic, really!? Wow, dude. You just called hundreds of thousands of people pathetic for being afraid of explosions and gunfights going on. Nice.

      <p>
       Fear is a natural instinct that (almost) all humans have to deal with. It is
       <em>
        instinctual
       </em>
       to be afraid in situations like this. One can argue that, objectively and with statistics in mind, you're probably technically safer driving to work in boston today than usual simply because nobody else is driving - less chance of a fatal car crash. Using this logic one can argue it is
       <em>
        irational
       </em>
       to be afraid in situations like this, but it is simply
       <em>
        instinctual.
       </em>
       To call people pathetic for that is just abhorrent.

       I actually agree with you. We should try to not be afraid in situations like these. Living in fear of terrorism is irrational when you look at the numbers objectively, and is exactly what "they" wanted with 9/11 and other attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I take issue with here is some douchebag calling people who have such fears "pathetic." We're talking about normal people here, being afraid because an explosion went off in their city. It is extremely mean to call such people "pathetic" for not being able to override their instincts with logical analysis. Read a few articles about overcoming our animalistic instincts, like fear, it's actually pretty hard. If it comes to you naturally and you can honestly say you wouldn't be afraid, at all, if you were in boston right now, then you are the gifted minority.

       Yes it is pathetic for millions of people to lock themselves down because of a small bomb.  This is demonstrating just how trivial it will be for martial law to be imposed across large areas of the US.  These people are just waiting to be enslaved and the government must be extremely happy with the psych readouts that they are getting now.  Regardless of who did this one this is demonstrating without a doubt that it will be trivial for government to lock cities down in the future.

       , that's just mean. It's pretty difficult to overcome instinctual fears with logical analysis. Most people have trouble doing this, if you don't then you are part of a gifted, and lucky, minority.

       Its pathetic because I pity them for what they will become.  They are setting themselves up to be fucked over much harder than what some small bomb could ever do.  Trouble, mean or not they will need to rise to the occasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       [edit] I probably originally said it in anger because I think that a transition to a hard police state is very terrible.

       We are already being fucked over much harder than what some small bomb could ever do. The TSA. The Patriot Act. NDAA 2012. You think this is new or something?

       It's not

       that people are afraid. It's instinctual. Evolution literally taught us to be afraid in all situations like this, in order to increase our chance of survival. It takes a considerably strong mind to overcome such instincts with pure logic.

       We will rise to the occasion when we have to. If the police state really gets as bad as I think you are worried it will (where, for example, let's suppose this kind of shit is happening in response to OWS-style-protesting, rather than actual terrorist acts), we will fight. There will be another civil war.

       If that is our strength then they will not meet us on that battlefield.  I think that the government will go with sustained acts of terror.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also lets say that bombs are going off once in a while.  Do you think that people will want to assemble?  Do you believe that enough people would blame the government?  I believe that the lines will be very blurred and that the majority of people will walk right into massive control because they won't understand the basic nature of what it means.  Food and logistics completley aside, I'm not very optimistic about any of the large cities.  The people will do 99.9% of the work for the police state by staying home much more and then the stranglers on the streets will be easier to mess with.  A pushy police force on the streets  is a small part of martial law.  The larger by a few magnitudes much more important part is people huddling in their homes in fear of open spaces.  That part can be achieved incredibly easily because of the limitations of the people.  Then people will see the police and they will project onto the police/soldiers everything negative about the situation.  Then bombs and open shootings will occur as needed until the people begin to slowly forget about their previous way of life.  The memory of it will gently slip away as if it was simply a previously lower gas price.  This will be occurring in stages as the economy breaks down and people will simply not have enough money to be spending it at bars and sandwhich shops.  I've lived in a city in Northern California that actually had a police lock down for 2-3 years and they transformed the city to a dull husk of what it used to be.  They police deliberately transformed the city through intimidation and they changed it.  Then they reduced the police force back to normal and it stuck.  Also I've lived in Ukraine where people stay inside a fair amount and they talk a lot and drink tea and alcohol at home to save money.  In this martial law that is coming it will be not that easy to put a hard finger on it.  You will still be able to get around fairly easily but there will be many more random stops like DUI check points and basic car searches.  People will internalize this hassle and with their lack of money they will choose to do the easy thing and to stay home.  This government is not likely to call a spade a spade.  If we have problems with the military policing then they will militarize the police, etc on and on.  Americans are brimming over with illusion and so a hard police state that snipes people after curfew is completely out of the question and is also not at all useful in our case.

       Surprisingly, I think you and I might actually agree on a lot of things if we were to have an extended discussion. I worry about what this country is forming into as well, and you've just outlined some of my very real concerns. Perhaps they will find a way to get where they want without pushing Americans past the tipping point to the point where we actually, truly, fight back. That's definitely a possibility that concerns me as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a few good friends in the U.S. military. I've talked with all of them about this issue, and have asked them if they are worried about america turning into a truly oppresive, tyrannical police-state. Some are, some aren't. But what they have ALL told me is that if the really scary stuff were to start happening, like let's just say throwing libertarians or any other "political dissenters" into FEMA concentration camps, to quote the very extreme, is that they wouldn't be able to get the soldiers to do it. The military itself would faction and (hopefully) the majority would overthrow whoever tried to do such a thing. Each of these men tells me that they work for me, and other citizens, and to uphold the consistitution, not blindly for Obama. And that if the current administration started asking them to do large-scale, truly tyrannical shit, the soldiers wouldn't carry it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on for too long here and shouldn't at this time. Let me just finish by saying again I think you and I might actually agree on a lot, I just strongly disagree with you calling these people "pathetic" for being afraid. It's really mean.

       I think that the system is advanced enough to not do the sorts of things that we are preparing to fight against.  My main point in all of this is the steps to actually arrive at a police state can be very subtle.  At this point I do trust the military soldiers much more than I do the beat cops.  So I don't think that it is coming that way.  Personally I think that the average America is so spineless that nothing even close to hard force is necessary to get them in line.  I'm not a big believer that FEMA camps will be used anything like it is feared, although they do exist.  They exist as a contigency option and I think that illusion, fear, intimidation and television are much more up the governments main focus areas.  I think that the government is in touch with the population enough to know just about how many people they could slurp up to put in a few camps without there being much revolt on the matter.
      </p>

       If you read
       <em>
        The Shock Doctrine
       </em>
       you'll see how much more efficient and delicate the techniques became for transforming a society.  In the beginning they would kill and torture a whole bunch of people.  Several countries later they would just remove and isolate some very small numbers of people and just like in 1984 they knew better than to make martyrs out of them.  After the societal transformation had occurred say over 1-2 years they would release the people from confinement.  Then the people would be so incredibly weary from massive disruption that they would cement the new order.  Theese sciences are much more advanced than what people in America can handle.  Americans do not understand the sublety of the techniques and they are very prone to fleeting rationilizations and so I think that there is a better than not chance that the society will be transformed.  Meanwhile some people will have piles of ammunition and I think that they will be mostly missing some relevant strategy even though they know that its all fucked up and totally wrong.

       Do you live in the city? I don't believe you do. Friends of mine went out earlier to smoke a cigarette and were forced back inside by law officials. They were told that if they did not oblige, they would be taken into custody. That's a demand, not advice.

       I find flaw in the technique of people asking for sources. Then when sources are provided people immediately disregard those sources. Instead deciding to trust people who say something that they say their friend told them that the police told them.

       Boston City Police are not in Boston? Damn, their response times must be completely shit...
      </p>
      <p>
       Boston.com, a news site about Boston, is most likely written by someone living there, as well. On this I could very well be wrong, but it's a safe assumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       National post article written with someone from AP... ok, maybe they aren't IN Boston, but that's 1/3 sources. If you know how to use Google, you'll see there are MANY news sources. I'm sure many of them are IN Boston, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: As for what I'd take precidence over believeing... first person accounts and raw video are what I believe over anything else. Telling me what your friend told you the police told you... is far from the original source. Ever play "telephone" as a kid?

       A first person account would be you or me watching it unfold in person. If I go on reddit and say "hey guys, this just happened," that's not first person.  "My friend told me that they did this" is even further.

       Really? So you'd find it better for LEOs to just let everyone go about their daily lives, filling public areas like malls and sporting grounds, while earlier the alleged suspect(s) blew up a marathon and led officers on a pursuit, which allegedly included gunfire and grenades?

      <p>
       On second though... you're right... It IS bullshit that they want as many people taking shelter indoors as possible. How DARE they!

       I don't "buy in" to much of anything, to be honest. I'm proud to be one of the rare people who is capable of forming his/her own opinions. If my opinion on a subject happens to fall in line with what the shills push, so be it, but it was reached of my own accord .

       As for the glossing over, I think I'm just used to name-calling and shill-accusing (is that even a term?) that I just jumped to the conclusion that you were doing the same.  Aren't assumptions fun? o.O

       Like assuming you are being called a shill because you are the "voice of reason" and not because your views align with those that shills push, even of your own accord, like you admit?

       Sure it matters. Gun holstered on hip/rifle slung on back and asking/telling/whichever label you want to stick on it is not forceful.

      <p>
       Aiming gun at a person and yelling at them, demanding they do said action... that's forceful.

       Simply having a weapon does not indicate use of force. The key word there is USE.

       It's the top comment because it has the highest upvote vs downvote score.

       As for CNN... do you have a link to this video of officers yelling at civilians? Not that I won't take CNN heavily salted, but still, I'd love a source

       Perception is reality. If you come around a corner to a LEO beating a civvie, he's out of control, violating his authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what if I was already around that corner, and saw that civvie take a run at the officer, who quickly overpowered and subdued him?

       Two very different "truths," wouldn't you say? Truth is a very easily bent concept. Many years ago the "truth" was that the earth was flat.

       I don't know about you, but when I'm looking for someone or something, I don't want people in my way. If the exact words were "let back into their homes," there is zero suggestion of force or "strong encouragement there.

       I'm watching what's happening in Boston from the UK and it looks like martial law to me:
 - people told they are not allowed into their homes until "tactical teams" (look like soldiers to me) have searched them
 - groups of soldiers marching down the street
 - stop and searches in the middle of the streets
 - road blocks

       And honestly if I were the cop in that case I'd do the same and just take the punishment. I'm not risking dying to treat someone who's killed so many people already. Sometimes this subreddit is a little too nice to lawbreakers.

       its not like they were doing this to every mother fucker. they legitimately thought this was the same person who just threw grenades at them, shot and killed a police officer, ran over his brother with a car, and said brother had a bomb strapped to him

       My point exactly. And the first thing they teach you in any public servant job. (I lifeguarded.) Was to protect the life and wellbeing of yourself and your colleagues first. Because if you go down, so does everyone else you would have saved. Its too easy to be critical of someone in their position.

       Look, yes, the reaction might be a bit much, but honestly, this is really one of those "rather safe than sorry" situations. These guys are
       <em>
        obviously

        blow up

       You're the one who replied nothing but "hearsay", as if that is even really an argument and not just a poor excuse.

       No, I probably honestly don't care a whole lot about what you think, because I don't expect you to think anything based on actual facts or reason. You dismissed several days worth of bloody violence as "hearsay". That's about as stupid and ignorant as it gets.

       I live in Boston.  There was an ice cream truck in my neighborhood yesterday, and children lined up for it.  Neighbors were gardening.  I was on the phone all day with co-workers who were in the office, and who had gone in after the shelter-in-place went into effect.  It was in no way an order to stay inside.

       There is simply too much debt and there are more people who think that they own things than there are things.  This will result in any level of tyranny that can be imagined.  There is no hard floor for something like this.  I'm watching the Cyprus events and the gold smackdown and its awful.  Then a few little pressure cookers go off in a city and its like night and day.  People are just primed for lock down.

       3 people died due to the actions on Monday, and over 160 were injured. Two people died last night/this morning in a related investigation. While you may have "important" stuff to do, they are trying to prevent more people from getting hurt and simplifying the investigation.

       This is such an incredibly ignorant and childish thing to say, to be perfectly honest. Unless you think every single person in the entire local police department is part of some secret, evil government agenda, this doesn't even make any fucking sense. These people searching those homes are, themselves, neighbors and citizens of Boston,

       faceless, nameless government agents in unmarked black vans.

       Closest thing I've seen to it in my lifetime.  Going door-to-door and basically shutting down the city is crazy...all for two deaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       When's the last time you saw a major city shut down for any reason?  Not just individuals but businesses.  Didn't happen in OKC, Waco or NYC ('93 or 2001).  Not even in 1978 when Jonestown and the Milk/Moscone murders hit San Francisco within a week of each other.  The death toll for those two incidents was around 920.

       These guys injured 170 people, caused 2 deaths and 17 in CC. They murdered an MIT cop and threw grenades at cops. People are legit scared. Most people are in their homes because they don't want to be killed by the bomber.

       While I agree that the door to door stuff is ridiculous (if true, there's varying reports), as well as the seemingly true martial law, I think it's more on the people who don't want to go out.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Because they are afraid.  This isn't a guy who just has a gun and is running around.  For all they know, they could walk by a bomb he set and get killed when they never even saw him.  The fear thing is interesting though, since the media is definitely hyping it, I think it'd be more beneficial to have people on high alert and out, where they could help look for the guy (debatable since he's armed and has already killed the security guard at MIT).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         With the heightened tensions, there are some people who are very pissed off at the situation.  So the cops are on edge about everyone who is remotely suspicious.  The last thing an innocent person wants to do is get into a situation where the FBI/SWAT/BPD surrounds them guns drawn (think back to the Dorner shootings).  It could be something as simple as carrying a briefcase and failing to follow an order to submit to a search, dressing the wrong way, or driving down the wrong street.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       As far the conditioning and test about how people react, I'm with you on that one.  It's like the TSA and people's willingness to listen to and submit to orders fromm people with "authority."

       The only part that I am going to say that I do agree with is their demands to stay off the street.  If that many militarized police (who in these scenarios are almost always trigger happy) are on the street, I am staying my ass inside just so I don't get shot.

       What is happening in Watertown is NOT Martial Law.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shenanigans that are going on right now are a prime example of an exigent circumstance. Any house searches going on right now in the perimeter are not illegal by any means.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not mentioning this to be a jackass, just please be specific. Look up the cases in other countries where actual martial law was imposed, the difference should be quite clear. Martial Law imposition is a lot scarier than this.

       I live in Boston and was just outside in the common surrounded by military, Police officer, and national guard. I was playing frisbee with my friends. Not a single officer approached me or the multiple other people in the common. There must have been at least 20 officer and 10-15 military officials there. If you dont live here, dont assume stupid things like this. Using this tragedy to try and convince people of your bullshit political views.

       Europe here. I'm quite scared watching these pictures. It doesn't make sense, it doesn't seem appropriate, it doesn't seem justified.
      </p>
      <p>
       What frightens me the most is how do you actually distinguish the difference between what is happening here and a legit "martial law". I'd like to give some thoughts:
      </p>
      <p>
       First off martial law seems to be when a city is in ruins and the government cannot control it anymore the military gets called in. However as our times have advanced we have government law enforcement that has special riot teams or otherwise teams that are equipped pretty much like a military team would be. So for the sake of this discussion I'm not making the difference between technically part of the military branch or the law enforcement branch, I'm putting them in the same group and that's how I will be using the term "martial law" in the upcoming segment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say this is not martial law. People aren't actively being combatted. However the presence of the miltary equipped units is there. A difference here is that rather than martial law being a response to a city in complete chaos (riots, fires, violent citizen mobs and so on) it is used pro-actively. The city is not in complete chaos in the sense discribed above, yet they still took to the streets. To me this is point one of why I think it's an incredibly wierd and seemingly illigitimate move.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say this is martial law. People are actively being combatted. Note here that this is only applies when people are being active and not passive. For example, people take to the streets and blow up cars and stores, they are gonna get combatted by the martial law teams. Another example, people take to the streets to walk their dog, they are gonna get combatted by martial law teams. The point I'm making here is that unless people take a stance, you cannot actually determine if it is "martial law". With nobody doing anything to provoke a response, a response will be absent, and it's that response that is critical to determing what is actually going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       My final point is one of fear. At what point do we seperate intimidation from pre-mediation. Depending on the context, If I pull a gun on you do I actually want to shoot you? If I show you I have a gun do I actually want to pull it on you? The mere presence of certain elements like aggression or hostility don't need to evoked for them to take effect. I think this is an interesting point with many perspectives. The one I would take is that this is similar to showing you I have a gun. Let's say we are having a drink and get into an argument over who can use the toilet first. If in that argument I show you I have a gun will that alter the way you act? Will you be more inclinded to let me use the toilet first, or maybe you don't even want to use the toilet anymore?
If I were to pull of that move (show of force) it would be very manipulative. In the same way I think taking to the streets with such military presence is also manipulative. It does affect a number of people's actions, dare I say the majority. Even if you are suddenly scared to go out not because of their presence but because of what them being there represent, it's all the same. It can be calculated and it's manipulative.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you actually read all this, thanks for your time hope you found it somewhat interesting. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my way of getting some thoughts out of my head so I can focus on other things again.

       which is exactly why we can't be quiet about this. even if the 2 are the bombers and 100% did it on their own, the government needs to know that the public will not support or tolerate martial law over 2 individuals with magyver knowledge of how to use kitchen utensils.

       This is ridiculous, there's not a lock down for absolutely no reason other than to terrorize the population. There's an EXTREMELY dangerous individual loose and in order to do their jobs and keep more people from getting killed, police need to keep them indoors until it's over. Unfortunately, most people are fucking idiots and asking isn't sufficient to keep their dumb asses safe so they have to be TOLD. Who gives a shit? As long as they're safe. If the police keep this up after he's caught or killed I'll be the first to say fuck that, but it's good policy right now and it's keeping people safe so r/conspiracy needs to chill the fuck out

It leads to things the founding fathers have been trying to prevent. Read about Nazi Germany, I am not saying we are at the level but hell I don't even want to have my country be anywhere CLOSE to that level.

       Seeing as Military is strictly forbidden to operate on domestic soil as laid out in the Constitution, no we're not kidding you. 
That situation in Boston is EXACTLY the kind of thing a 'Well regulated Militia' of armed citizens was envisioned for. NOT NOT repeat NOT a standing army of militarized police or Military forces.

        On the night of February 27-28, 1933, a mentally disabled Dutch citizen set fire to the German parliament building (the Reichstag). Hitler and his propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, presented the incident as the prelude to an armed Communist uprising and persuaded the aging President Paul von Hindenburg to establish what became a permanent state of emergency. This decree, known as the Reichstag Fire Decree, suspended the provisions of the German constitution that protected basic individual rights, including freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of assembly.
        <strong>
         The decree also permitted increased state and police intervention into private life, allowing officials to censor mail, listen in on phone conversations, and search private homes without a warrant or need to show reasonable cause. Under the state of emergency established by the decree, the Nazi regime could arrest and detain people without cause and without limits on the length of incarceration.

       I understand that the whole resonance of the attack and the fact these guys had managed to evade detention until last night means they have the will and preparation that makes them quite dangerous. I can see that, while quite overwhelming, this police and military response is obvious in order to show the population they are doing something.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that light, this sweep is justified. The guy (let's continue entertaining the theory these were the right guys) has proven they don't give a shit over killing innocents. So, yes, if there are tanks on my street to catch him, well, so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT if later this citywide sweep comes up to have inflicted illegal searches and detentions for unrelated causes, citizens get detained for trivial reasons and treated as suspects if they failed to comply instantly to whatever order they were issued by authorities, and this kind of occupation becomes routine in every event and we are told to get used to checkpoints and warrantless searches and detainment, now THAT is worrying.

       Nah, it's much more likely that these 2 guys were at the marathon finish line, dropped backpacks just before the blasts and at the exact site of the blasts, then murdered a police officer and led police on a chase while discharging the exact same type of bombs that were used at the marathon, but it's all just a misunderstanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is definitely a major possibility...in your insane mind.

       My point exactly. And the first thing they teach you in any public servant job. (I lifeguarded.) Was to protect the life and wellbeing of yourself and your colleagues first.
