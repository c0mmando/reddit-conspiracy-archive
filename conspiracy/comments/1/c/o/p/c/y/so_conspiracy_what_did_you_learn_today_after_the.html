       I'm not trying to be an asshole but I, and others, have been attempting to inform most of you that those submissions, speculating on who the bomber was, were ridiculous. People here would reply to me saying brainstorming isn't harmful and that people were doing good by trying to identify the suspects. I'd have to completely disagree by stating it is harmful and counterproductive to this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I, and others, tried to point out the flaws in the blind speculation we'd be downvoted. That's not right, you shouldn't try to drown out those who are objective or hesitant to make very serious claims based on little to no evidence. The main problem with those submission were that they became a huge circle-jerk where anybody who disagreed would be chastised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you, after finding out that all of you and all of Reddit were dead wrong, have any remorse or hindsight? Was anything learned from this? Have those of you who participated realized the seriousness of blindly claiming innocents to be a mad bomber?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think it was all harmless and necessary, there's no doubt most of you will and downvote me for pointing your lapse in logic, then
       <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/04/19/the_internets_shameful_false_id/">
        check out this article.

      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for your time, sorry if I offended any of you. I just think this subreddit should strive to be rational in such events rather than jumping on Reddit's make-believe detective bandwagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Please don't do this people... I can see that most of you are completely ignoring what I've said and countering it with more ludicrous claims. This online detective stuff was harmful to innocent people and you all had it completely wrong. There's real solid evidence for all of my claims yet most of you don't have a shred of proof to back up anything. It'd be sad for this submission to be downvoted into obscurity, doing so just shows an incredible amount of denial on this subreddits part. Just man up and own your mistakes, that's how we human beings learn. Hell, Reddit has already admitted their guilt by upvoting a post saying they were wrong to play detective; you're usual smarter than most of Reddit, Conspiracy, so continue showing it by admitting mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems that a lot of you are missing the point. No offence intended. I'm getting a lot of personal attacks, I appreciate that; it's always easier to defend your position by trying to discredit me, rather than what I've said. Keeping it classy I see. It's too bad really, I was hoping for an intelligent discussion with supported arguments instead of these petty attacks/accusations. I'm sorry but a lot of you are acting childish, can't we just act like adults?

       Goddamn, this disturbing. Private speculation by conspiracy theorists has always had a harmless (mostly) niche in society, but the internet has given them a platform that allows them to communicate easily with each other, which is fine too;
       <strong>
        however
       </strong>
       an unforseen consequence of that communication is that it is easily read ("overheard") by a entity composed of people with the collective intelligence, self-restraint, and common sense of an angry,
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       powerful, four year old. While the theorists online might be smart enough to know their theories should never be immediately or rashly acted on, there is an invisible angry frustrated toddler "in the room" with them who is looking for a target to take out its anger on.

       do you honestly believe everything thats been told to you though?  Its like you're trying to say "hey reddit! hows it feel to be wrong? When I and other people called out the real culprits you were sitting here blaming Craft!"  Honestly give me one set of information that isn't from ABC, NBC, MSN, CNN that you know IS DEAD FACT.  This case on the bombing was so shrewdly put together its almost ridiculous how irresponsible its being controlled.  that being (a small marshall law "Drill")  If you want to believe go ahead be a sheep, otherwise don't call out the whole

       One of the suspects got into a shootout with police, that's some damning evidence right there. There's more, go look it up on some websites. The police aren't actively tracking the other suspect, after shooting the first, based on no evidence. Say what you will, being as this is conspiracy, but I don't think the police are setting them up. If you really believe so could you give me evidence? The evidence claiming that people were suspects was based on hats and backpacks which is some very loose evidence; if you can call that evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, of course the father is going to claim his children are innocent. He may not know about their intentions but even if he had it's still likely he wouldn't tell the truth. Their father is hardly a credible source of information on a setup.

       Yes it is evidence of a shootout with police, not evidence of bombing the race.  You're doing what you are claiming reddit did.  Seriously, your pompous post sounds like reddit in general was wrong and you solved the case.  Reddit entertained all ideas, not just the ones you thought of.

       Where is this evidence? I haven't seen anything indicating the police are telling the truth. Do we really know for a fact they got into a shoot out? Also who was the guy they were putting into a cop car last night naked? He looked a lot like the dead guy. Just asking.

       Watch other interviews of shooting/bombing suspects. It's always the same story; never expecting it, out of character. Of course a planned attack is going to be out of character and a shock to people. That's not something suspects go around sharing or showing signs of.
      </p>

       Go ahead and say I'm wrong, but I'm not. That's what's always said by interviewees.

       And what evidence do we have that what information they are giving us is true?
If thats your argument then we pretty much are going by the words of the victims of the blast? NOT GOOD ENOUGH!
We need solid evidence these are actually the guys!
Stop speculating until theres solid proof who did it

       Usually that's why there are investigations after events like the Boston bombing. Trouble is they take a bit longer than looking at pictures found on the internet.

       What if they said he was closed off and troubled? as if they could have seen this coming if they tried hard enough? Would you then consider him to be a plant? What kind of' 'character' would he have to be before you DIDN'T suspect anything fishy about the guy.

       As I've said, I don't believe everything out Government says. There is however a time to believe the Feds and that would be now, instead of continuously doing everything you can to prevent being wrong... The people here are finding everything they possibly can to try and prove the suspect's innocence and it seems they are because they don't want to admit the detective work that went on earlier was completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       What reasons do the Feds have to cause this bombing? Or shoot innocent people? Why would the suspect get into a firefight with police if he weren't involved? This seems to be homegrown terrorism and the Feds have every reason to publicly it and make a display out of these people. We should be more worried about the cops not killing the second suspect, as they usually do.

       You and many others are making straw man arguments. Stop putting words into my mouth. I know what our Government can do and I disagree with them entirely. Thing is, unlike others here it seems, I refuse to call absolutely everything a conspiracy. The Government didn't bomb Boston and they didn't set up two innocent individuals. There's evidence supporting the suspects guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you ever think about what's more likely? Two homegrown terrorists bombing a marathon or the Government bombing the marathon, setting up to civilians in highschool and then getting into a shootout with one and a manhunt with the other? Which does the evidence support? Oh, right, the homegrown terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       My submission is about all the claims people were making about the bombers and the harm it has done. That, and the speculation which was all wrong and had no supporting evidence.

       Maybe the government didn't bomb Boston, but it sure as hell seems as if they knew of these kids prior to the bombings (based off of the parents saying the FBI had been talking to them for 3-5 years, knew they were in to some sort of terrorist group, tracked by the FBI, ran drills at the race for bombs, had BlackWater or Navy Seals personnel on site, and without a doubt in my mind let this happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       There might be a lot of evidence that these kids did it. It's almost certain they did, but the hand that feeds them is homegrown.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a known thing.  Governments have always used red flags to pass bills, start wars, or reach their agenda.

       There are SO many questions unanswered, and yet to be asked!  On top of that, they are planning to deliberately destroy all the evidence in the suspects house.

       how do you know they were wrong? The "correct" suspects could just be 2 scapegoats that were picked out ahead of time. Just because the FBI released the "real" suspects" doesn't make them the ones who actually did it. I thought this was

       How do you know they aren't the correct suspects? What's your proof, other than the children's father who wouldn't give them up even if he had known of their intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI has a lot more knowledge on the suspects than you do. They could be scapegoats, but even if they are they're likely still guilty of the crime. As I have said to others, if you are going to claim they're innocent or scapegoats please show some proof.

       The fbi had wrong suspects for 9/11 some are still alive yet they have never changed the hijackers they listed.  The fact the feds said they are the suspects doesn't mean anything other than that's who its going to be pinned on. Maybe they were but I still have seen no proof other than conjecture so for now I'll just see what unfolds.

       I don't believe everything I hear or see when it's coming from the Feds. This however is different, I don't believe they have much to gain from lying and shooting innocent people. I don't think they caused the bombing and I'm positive they want to make a big display out of them catching, and probably killing, those involved.

       There is absolutely nothing wrong with questioning our Government but it's a problem when the questioning is without any evidence, and when there's tons of proof countering the claims people are making. That, and people don't seem willing to admit when they've made a mistake. The lie keeps on growing. It's disinformation, distorting what had actually happened.

       yeah i'm blind for not trusting our extremely corrupt government. If someone lied to you on a daily basis, and tried to hide shit from you all the time, would you trust that person? No, no you fucking wouldn't.

       If they are scapegoats, the FBI or CIA or whoever is really responsible likely made sure they were involved on a level deep enough to be criminal.  That is typically how it goes for the fall guy.

       That doesn't really meet the definition of scape goat
      </p>
      <p>
       "Later in the ceremonies of the day, the High Priest confessed the sins of the Israelites to Yahweh placing them figuratively on the head of the other goat, the Azazel scapegoat, who "took them away" never to be seen again. The sin of the nation was thus "atoned for" (paid for) by the "The Lord's Goat" and "The Azazel Goat"."

       I very much so disagree with my Government. There's a lot of their bullshit that I don't believe. This however is a black and white kind of event. Everytime something happens like this
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       immediately blames the Government. Every single time. Sometimes there's evidence, which I like, and sometimes like this case there is nothing to support the argument.

       Suspicion, yes. I do believe that the Government is going to use this event for their benefit. Maybe reintroduce the gun bill and limit the sales of ammunition. Our Government never wastes a good disastor and they've caused a few as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't fully believe they made this bombing happen. I do believe they received warning and let it occur so they could gain more leverage. That's not beyond them.
      </p>
      <p>
       People also seem to be missing my main point here. It's that everybody was speculating on the suspects when they had no real proof. They named a load of people and still got it wrong. They even hurt the reputation of an innocent bystander.

       As I've said, I don't believe everything out Government says. There is however a time to believe the Feds and that would be now, instead of continuously doing everything you can to prevent being wrong... The people here are finding everything they possibly can to try and prove the suspect's innocence and it seems they are because they don't want to admit the detective work that went on earlier was completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       What reasons do the Feds have to cause this bombing? Or shoot innocent people? Why would the suspect get into a firefight with police if he weren't involved? This seems to be homegrown terrorism and the Feds have every reason to publicly it and make a display out of these people. We should be more worried about the cops not killing the second suspect, as they usually do.

       Yes it is evidence of a shootout with police, not evidence of bombing the race.  You're doing what you are claiming reddit did.  Seriously, your pompous post sounds like reddit in general was wrong and you solved the case.  Reddit entertained all ideas, not just the ones you thought of.

       Where is this evidence? I haven't seen anything indicating the police are telling the truth. Do we really know for a fact they got into a shoot out? Also who was the guy they were putting into a cop car last night naked? He looked a lot like the dead guy. Just asking.
