       How many paid content contributors do you think Conde Nast have at their disposal?  Now, how hard do you think it is for the owners of Reddit to insert full-time paid position mods on any subreddit that falls under their interests?
      </p>
      <p>
       What we are witnessing is the concerted efforts of a media publication to gather intelligence on consumers, promote their media interests, and re-design the machine to drive traffic to the sites where they make the most ad revenue.  SHOCKER!!
      </p>
      <p>
       The "system" isn't being gamed - THIS IS THE SYSTEM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it petty?  Yes.  Are there some dickhead mods?  Without a doubt - though far more get a metric shit tonne of beef from pissed off, misguided morons than deserve it - of that I am well certain.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is Reddit.  It is not fair.  It is not nice.  It is the mob, being shepherded by media manipulators, to line pockets. (oh, and control the minds of it users and crush political dissent - shout out to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       - a good sub that has been OBLITERATED by manipulation.)  It also happens to be the only game in town at the moment, just like Digg once was [Ehem.]
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that this story has legs and it is probably true that davidweisseisadickcheese is a paid content provider and traffic herder.  If so, he is one of hundreds if not thousands, on the payroll.
      </p>
      <p>
       Welcome to Reddit.  Keep your wits about you and some good information will come your way.  Just steer clear of the trolls, shills, and paid contributors with an agenda.  There are more companies than Conde Nast that have paid mods on this site.

       Condé Nast Digital no longer operates reddit.com.  The website, reddit.com, is a service of a New York state corporation, REDDIT, INC. which is wholly owned by Advance Publications, also a New York state corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been investigating this for some time (more than a year) and I would have to say it is more likely multiple PR firms have infiltrated the moderator ranks of the site and Advance Publications does not care where the ad impressions come from, just that there is lots of traffic and Reddit, Inc. and Advance Publications don't get too much negative publicity from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm wholly open to other explanations, but the "Advance Publications hires mods" hypothesis does not have much solid evidence to it.  It hasn't been disproved though either.

       EDIT:  Advance Publications is the parent company of Conde Nast!  The Newhouse family media empire.  So, in other words - ownership never changed - just the shuffling of corporate entities' assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as solid evidence - I don't see much forthcoming.  Unless someone decides to start hacking and doxing away at these people, there won't be much in the way of an electronic paper trail.  I don't condone this course of action.  I think we should take it on faith that corruption finds a way, and not be so naive to think that manipulation of Reddit's information stream isn't a daily occurrence by major governments, major corporations, quite a few independent content workers, religious organizations, and anyone else with an axe to grind and sufficient resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is wide open and open for business. I'd say not every media consultant/operator is as dumb as the one who sent Woody Harrelson in here to promote Rampart.

       This is true. I think it became apparent that reddit had politically incorrect baggage that might either threaten reddit's way of doing thing, or Conde Nast.

       A gold account gives you more features and less restrictions when using reddit. Having a paid account is a standard method for sites to make enough money to sustain themselves. However, Reddit realised that Gold is a bit like a 'super upvote'. So they allow redditors to reward each other with Gold. Thus, instead of buying Gold for yourself, you buy it for someone else.

       How obvious was it when Bush with his grandkid were on the front page. Few years ago that would have been blasted with downvotes because it had anything to do with Bush and here we are giving him tons of positive publicity and wildly downvoting anything pointing out how he is a war criminal or his political past. It was just, "Aww...but he's so cute now! Forgive and forget!"

       Sorry, I don't see some grand conspiracy - that shout out to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       was an allusion to how far it's fallen.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I certainly think that you SEVERELY UNDERESTIMATE the amount that political campaigns and corporations will go to influence public opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see a grand conspiracy when BP sends shills on this board in the middle of the Deepwater Horizon spill to water down public outrage.  They're just harnessing the power of social media with fake accounts to skew the truth in an effort to protect the bottom line.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is nefarious and much of it is political, but it's not a "conspiracy" - it's everyday business.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to your rather weak assertion that it's all about the bottom line with no other agenda than $$$ - I don't think Israelis would agree.  Or fundamentalist Christians.  Or pharmaceutical companies.  Or the North Koreans.  To some its about spreading ideas.  And yes, some of those groups put together social media action teams to do things like derail legislation, end political careers, convert religious types, and on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again - I'm not the "Big Conspiracy" guy at all.  But it would be insanely naive of me to pretend that other factors besides money can't and don't influence users, power users, and politically or ideologically connected groups here on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and as to your dig at Digg.com  - you are mistaken.  Digg was for a time, an amazing community of people discussing ideas and trading information for no other reason than to open up public discussion.  Sounds a bit like the Reddit of Yesteryear...
      </p>
      <p>
       The time of rabble and political viciousness you are referring to was actually the first large scale attempt by political operatives to influence public opinion through social media.  And it worked - they destroyed all political discussion, shut down dialogue, and closed down a good public source of information perceived to be a threat to their political interests - i.e., an informed populace.

       Correct. It's extremely easy to see how money is almost a non-issue when we get over it. Some domesticated monkeys still try to stockpile bananas as their only goal in life, as a finality, but that's not all there is to it. Ideas and beliefs are at the base of it all. TBH just trying to spread my vision can make me paranoid at times, on the simple fact it doesn't work towards strengthening the existing power structures.

       Sorry that was your experience - you came late to the party apparently.

      <p>
       I joined Digg v.1 in Jan 2005.  It was nothing like you describe. Tight community and some great dialogues, ESPECIALLY in politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Digg devolve into what you describe?  Sadly, yes.  v.3 and then v.4 put the nails in the coffin when the Tea Party sent in their minions and the Digg died choking on the Spam links they themselves laced into the feed.  Shit business decisions by desperate developers looking for black ink on the balance sheet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, kid, you must have missed the glory - it was short-lived.  Some old timers will say the same thing about Reddit.  I like to think Reddit is more flexible and more interesting.  But political dialogue even here is entering a familiar fractiousness.

       Personally, I'm ready for the new competition to appear on the horizon.

       This is all a Jewish Zionist scheme for world domination. Reddit is part of it.

       edit: And of course, Reddit is owned by Jews, and Reiss is a Jewish name.

       Not all Jews are bad, but most do indeed support Zionism, and are perfectly willing to do unscrupulous, even evil, things to force their global totalitarian regime on us.

       of course,
       <a href="/r/mensrights">
        /r/mensrights
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/new_right">

       ,
       <a href="/r/conservative">
        /r/conservative
       </a>
       , and related sub-reddits. Perhaps I shouldn't have said COINTELPRO, I was using the term rather loosely. I suspect most of the moderators are paid, but some may be doing it simply because it helps their interests. Most are Jews. The Zionist nature of sub-reddits like
       <a href="/r/new_right">
        /r/new_right
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/conservative">
        /r/conservative
       </a>
       is obvious based on the censorship of any such discussions, and the cognitive dissonance present therein. The heavy censorship at
       <a href="/r/conservative">
        /r/conservative
       </a>
       is also indicative of an agenda - any site that heavily censors discussion is not an ally of truth. Then there's the fact that both sub-reddits express support of Israel and Zionism directly in their sidebars, yet do not include links to pro-white sub-reddits you would expect from sub-reddits that are supposed to reflect the interests of (majority white) conservatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       When one knows what Judaized behavior looks like, it is rather easy to spot frauds. I've become rather perceptive at spotting such behavior, and these people are not necessarily all Jewish, but they do behave in a Jewish manner - lies, deceit, misinformation, and censorship of politically incorrect, potentially damaging truths are the name of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       connection is obvious. The
       <a href="/r/new_right">
        /r/new_right
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/mensrights">
        /r/mensrights
       </a>
       connections I only realized after having a strong presence there and ending up conflicting with the moderators who clearly have an agenda. ignatiusloyola himself is most likely a Jew, especially considering he takes his name from Ignatius De Loyola, a historical crypto-Jew. mayonesa certainly is a Jew, and this is readily apparent from his fascination with bodily fluids (mayonesa stands for mayonnaise and also semen) and also feces (ANUS.org, groin.com, penetrate.blogspot.com, these are all associated with the moderators at
       <a href="/r/new_right">
        /r/new_right
       </a>
       , and such fascination and perversion is typically Jewish). Jews are known to participate heavily in controlled opposition fronts like these "new right" phonies. The goal is to keep people distracted chasing ghosts, and never realizing the true enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I draw the
       <a href="/r/conservative">
        /r/conservative
       </a>
       connection from the way the sub-reddit is setup, where true open discussion is not allowed, and distracting articles that assume the mainstream conservative media is not full of shit are promoted. Further, the key is the participation of mayonesa on the moderator team, and the collusion with
       <a href="/r/new_right">
        /r/new_right
       </a>
       and and Zionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The proof is in the pudding. If you try to talk about Jews, Zionists, the Mossad, that Israel did 9/11, any criticism of Israel, in
       <a href="/r/conservative">
        /r/conservative
       </a>
       , I think you will find that you are not welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also find it likely that, especially in the bigger sub-reddits, these people are being paid. In
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       it is certain. In
       <a href="/r/conservative">
        /r/conservative
       </a>
       I think it is extremely likely. At
       <a href="/r/new_right">
        /r/new_right
       </a>
       , most likely mayonesa is being paid (and to troll the rest of Reddit also) judging by how much time he spends doing so. At
       <a href="/r/mensrights">
        /r/mensrights
       </a>
       , I suspect ignatiusloyola is being paid, and probably a few of the others, judging by the changes that have been made there since the previous moderation left, to turn the sub-reddit into a liberal cesspool where no discussion of root causes is allowed. But I doubt the mods there are being paid very much for their efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I should have said they are controlled opposition, not COINTELPRO, though in the larger sense, all of Reddit is an intelligence-gathering operation, as well as a way to control our thinking and keep us distracted from the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still have my doubts about whether the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       sub-reddit is also controlled. Most of the sub-reddits with quality popular names were created shortly after Reddit itself was created, and since then have been controlled by people with an agenda, mostly Jews. If they somehow failed to register
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       then I'd say that was quite the misstep. I do think that if more people here begin to see through the lies and become Jew-wise (not that I'm condemning all Jews, but if you read Kevin MacDonald's Culture of Critique you'll see what I mean) and note that Israel, Mossad, and international Zionists are deeply involved in all that is transpiring, I think more direct action will be taken here, in various forms, to stifle the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact it is quite certain that the Reddit admins will implement even more changes that make it harder for people to spread the truth. We will see more and more control about how we are allowed to post, and more and more power given to the moderators to allow them to do what they are supposed to do to keep free speech checked. That is why we have recently seen so many crypto-bannings on Reddit, where the user doesn't even realize he is banned from all of Reddit. It is also why small changes have been made to give moderators the ability to remain anonymous, using the lie that they're trying to protect themselves from being outed like violentacrez. For example, moderators can ban users from their sub-reddits now without ever having their name associated with the ban, as far as the banned user is concerned. It is very frustrating for users who are banned to not even know who has banned them, but Judaized moderators love that sort of passive-aggressive power. Reddit yielding to deleting harmless pictures of young, pubescent teens also shows the sort of control they want over us. Child porn is one thing; that is not what
       <a href="/r/jailbait">
        /r/jailbait
       </a>
       was however.
      </p>
      <p>
       As time goes on we will see false flag style operations here, much as occurred with any supposed "child porn" posted at
       <a href="/r/jailbait">
        /r/jailbait
       </a>
       . The
       <a href="/r/whiterights">
        /r/whiterights
       </a>
       sub-reddit will be taken down through such an event. There will be a campaign against "racism" and "gun nuts", and moderators who do not fall in line will be forced out through pressure of doxxing or simply be removed by the admins.
      </p>
      <p>
       A final note on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . If this sub-reddit were run by moderators who really wanted a free arena for truth, they would add rules that discourage posts that do not add to the discussion. They would ban shills who routinely attack users for posting, and clearly have an agenda, who engage in logical fallacies rather than reasoned arguments. Currently this sub-reddit is heavily controlled by shills, and the problem would not be so bad if moderators would just ban the obvious ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe it or not, they are not really very hard to spot.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: Oh look, someone was banned from Reddit for spreading the truth. I'm so surprised. :P

       edit2: And there are quite a few submissions censored here that never should have been. Why are moderators spending time censoring contributions, while allowing shills to run rampant?

       You should probably learn something about a topic, such as the Jews, before you blather on about it. You end up looking quite stupid. There is no denying the relationship between perversion, pedophilia, homosexuality, and Jews. You can look up the statistics.

       Most of the powerful moderators are Jewish Zionists. Don't expect any true help from a Jew. They will either censor you outright or try to control you, keep you distracted, while the noose is quietly slipped 'round your Gentile neck. There are a few good Jews, but I must stress the word few. Learn to rally around your own kind, they are the only ones you have even a hope of being able to trust. Note also that they aren't actually Jews by blood. Ashkenazis are the descendants of Mongol-Turks.

       Well then I hope you don't support the activities of your Zionist brethren. Aaron Swartz was a good Jew. He was murdered for it. He was brave to go against the lies and evil that define most of the Jewish community these days. If you are really Jewish, then I commend you for having a sense of honor and a desire for truth that most do not. If you doubt what I have said, I suggest you check out Kevin MacDonald's Culture of Critique as a stepping stone toward further truth. You can also research Israel, Mossad, and their connection to false flag attacks, their murder of Palestinians, their constant aggression toward Iran, their control of the US government, of the legal system, of the media, of Hollywood, of education. Just as they censor people here on Reddit, they censor ideas through the media, they silence men like Swartz through the legal system, and they are now pushing (Feinstein et. al.) to take away even more of our rights. You might also research AIPAC's grasp on politics, and note the percentage of political donations that come from the Jewish community and what they advocate for. It's true not all Jews are guilty, but Jews tend toward a heavy ethnocentrism and they have been working to tear down non-Jewish societies for quite a long time. Good luck.

       I sometimes wonder if anti-semitism is like a sort of controlled demolition.  Who really believes that racist/prejudice crap any more? No one. That's why it always surprises me when they crawl out of the woodwork at the right time, and in effect stain and tarnish any legitimize discourse.

       I live in Toronto, and many of my closest friends are or have been Jewish.  I live a few blocks away from a Jewish community centre that is one of the nicest parts of this already great neighbourhood.  In that building is, in my opinion, the best shwarma place in the area, owned and operated by Lebanese Canadians.  All stereotypes get broken when you live alongside people from anywhere and everywhere.

       Well, I agree with u/CENSOREDMATERIAL that there are
       <del>
        some
       </del>
       many good Jews. I've been to two Passover Seder dinners in my life. Both were great, enjoyable experiences that allowed me to learn more about Jewish culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I believe that the existence of Israel itself is totally illegal and should never have been founded in the first place. Unfortunately, there are also plenty of Christians who are anxious to have all Jews return to Israel so Armageddon may begin, and considering how many Americans are Christian, I think we need to worry more about Zionist activities of non-Jews, as well as some (NOT all) Jews, than we need to worry about anti-semitism.

       The proper way to discourage discussion of the truth regarding Jews is to refer to it as "anti-semitic" or "anti-Semitic". If you're going to spew cliches, please try to spell them correctly.

       By the way, passive-aggressive behavior and prideful ignorance are not virtues. Change your ways if you care about your future and that of your family. I have provided more than enough information to get you started, and you really can't afford to ignore it if you care about your children (or future children).

       Perception management is a term originated by the US Military. The US Department of Defense (DOD) gives this definition:Actions to convey and/or deny selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, and objective reasoning as well as to intelligence systems and leaders at all to influence official estimates, ultimately resulting in foreign behaviors and official actions favorable to the originator's objectives. In various ways, perception management combines truth projection, operations security, cover and deception, and psychological operations. Influencing how the masses think is big business.

       It was also inaccurate.  About a year ago when reddit users started talking about buying reddit.com from Condé Nast Digital and running it as a cooperative, user-owned service they quickly created Reddit, Inc.  For a few weeks over a year there has been a corporation directly owned by Advance Publications responsible for providing the reddit.com web service.

       I didn't know that. If I had known this website was controlled by profiteers, I would've never taken anything here seriously. I thought Swartz owned Reddit untill he died.. But since 2006? Maybe I'm just ignorant.

       It's this type of stuff that really frustrates me about Reddit.  I've seen several posts on this guy, but nothing is done.  Evidence is there, etc and he's still active posting his shitty articles and spam reports.

       This is why you go to PRIVATE forums to discuss this shit, where people cannot get an account just for registering, but must know someone IRL to be approved.  Do shills get through?  Yes, sometimes, but it keeps them to a manageable amount and the corporate whores are left at the door.

       Significant time must have been invested in it even if it was mainly a bot slinging the posts. I think this should be an article on an alternative website. And judging by Sonmi_452's post, even infowars might be a step in the right direction.

       It was a trophy. Used to be a spam reddit, We (
       <a href="/r/reportthespammers">
        /r/reportthespammers
       </a>
       ) got the owners banned when they started spamming outside in normal reddits and I requested it and a few others, made them private and deleted all the submissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are quite a few other subreddits like that and they don't even show on that list.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to ask reddit Admin.
      </p>
      <p>
       And FWIW that statit list is out of date.

       Are you uncomfortable with your government? Then effing react and change pattern.

       Either way, it said Reddit has been owned by Conde Nast since 2006. About how most mods are being paid to direct people. And wiesisadickcheese is responsible for 'herding' people on reddit, also.

       i am no mod. I'm not really a blogger. never been on 4chan or anything like that, just came to Reddit one day. You still have to act civil with the mods, whether you are angry or not.

       Most of the powerful moderators are Jewish Zionists. Don't expect any true help from a Jew. They will either censor you outright or try to control you, keep you distracted, while the noose is quietly slipped 'round your Gentile neck. There are a few good Jews, but I must stress the word few. Learn to rally around your own kind, they are the only ones you have even a hope of being able to trust. Note also that they aren't actually Jews by blood. Ashkenazis are the descendants of Mongol-Turks.

       I joined Digg v.1 in Jan 2005.  It was nothing like you describe. Tight community and some great dialogues, ESPECIALLY in politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Digg devolve into what you describe?  Sadly, yes.  v.3 and then v.4 put the nails in the coffin when the Tea Party sent in their minions and the Digg died choking on the Spam links they themselves laced into the feed.  Shit business decisions by desperate developers looking for black ink on the balance sheet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, kid, you must have missed the glory - it was short-lived.  Some old timers will say the same thing about Reddit.  I like to think Reddit is more flexible and more interesting.  But political dialogue even here is entering a familiar fractiousness.
      </p>

       Personally, I'm ready for the new competition to appear on the horizon.
