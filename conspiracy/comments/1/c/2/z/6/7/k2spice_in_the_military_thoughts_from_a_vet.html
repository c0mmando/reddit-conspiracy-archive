        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So first let me just say that this is pure speculation, but since I just made a reddit account, I figured I would make this my first post (I have spent a lot of time considering what im about to say).</p>

<p>I spent 5 years in the U.S. Navy from 2007 to 2012.  I wont go into where I served because I will always be subject to the UCMJ for my actions during 2007 to 2012.  My fourth year in the navy I was on shore duty in Norfolk Va.  I was a year away from getting out and I honestly was &quot;skating&quot; by with my remaining time.  My friend introduced me to a brand of Spice called &quot;puff&quot;.  He assured me it wouldnt show up on urinalysis so I was curious.  We smoked it and I got high and it was really enjoyable, it felt like weed and mainly we just laughed and had a good time.  Well as time went by we continued to use.  Something funny started happening to the blends.  Supposedly the DEA was always a step behind the manufacturers so in order to keep the blends &quot;legal&quot; they altered the chemical make up everytime they felt TPTB on their trail.  Well in my experience the blends became stronger and stronger and stronger, to the point where one tiny baby hit would make you higher than you have ever been in your life.  This trend infected the ENTIRE military.  When I say that everyone smoked it, i literally mean about 80 percent of all branches smoked it.  I worked with joint forces and had many friends in different branches, and trust me....EVERYONE was getting high off of this shit.  The thing is that the trend really didnt become a problem until the military started briefing its personnel on the drug.  They told us there was no way they could test us for it, and then they posted a list in every shop that had locations where it was sold.  This list was deemed places &quot;off limits&quot;, but once this started happening the majority of the military was introduced to this.  Do you really think junior servicemen and women (18-21) are not going to be intrigued when they are told there is a drug they cant be tested for, and then provided multiple locations of where it was sold?  Needless to say addiction became bad for many of me and my colleagues (from E-1 to E-6).  My addiction lasted 2 years until i was finally able to get out and ween myself off with Marijuana.  I smoked probably 3 grams a day, as did most other people who did it (the reason is because the high only lasts 20 min or so).  Im wondering if anyone else in the military had similar experiences or could attest to how bad the problem was (possibly still is, i dont know for sure).  I have no proof for this, but Im wondering if this was a test on the effects of cannabinoids on a military force.  They literally told us where to get it, and it just doesnt make since that someone spraying a chemical on herbs can stay one step ahead of the DEA and DOD&#39;s massive budget.  any thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a VICE doc where 20somethings from Asia (I believe it was S Korea?

    <div class="md"><p>To my fellow shipmate:</p>

<p>I was out of the service well before this ever came around, so i can not attest to the military personal use of this, but I can attest to the civilian use of this. I smoke the K2 stuff at first, as it was cheaper than regular weed and a whole lot easier to get ahold of. Than the DEA did what you said they did, cracked down on it, forcing manufacturers to change the makeup of it, and it got you higher and higher and higher. I remember when I really noticed this.</p>

<p>I was home alone and got some new stuff called 100% Pure Evil, and it was. I took one hit, and I could not move for 3 hours, it was not enjoyable at all. I had to crawl around my house just to go to the bathroom, as I barely trusted myself to move. After that, I threw it out and have never touched it again. </p>

<p>As far as your idea is concerned, I see no reason why the Military or Government would not attempt that. They have been known to do some pretty fucked up (i.e. evil) shit to the service men as well as enemies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey there. While I&#39;m not in the military, I can personally relate to your addiction. I live in MN. And would also like to start by saying, that I was a marijuana smoker before my struggle with spice. 
 I first found out about it through an advertisement for a smoke shop, in a local paper/magazine. So being curious..the next day I went out and picked up a few different 1 gram bags, and headed home. Your description of the high is pretty spot on. I also agree with your assessment to the draw of the drug. No problems with drug tests ..no problem getting it..gets you high as shit. All good things. 
 Then, like you also described, things started getting weird. The blends became way to strong. The other thing I noticed was how they would change the names..like instead of K2, it was K2 EXTREME. And with the extreme, came the price increases. Before I knew it..I stopped smoking weed altogether...and started jonsing for this shit. Blew through so much money...destroyed my lungs for quite a while. Almost like a 95 yr old smoker cough. Just nasty..almost lost my girl too. 
Anyway. Just wanted to say I totally get what you went through. And I also weened myself off using marijuana. 
Thanks for sharing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol. MJ is addictive (in my experience) but harmless.  When I say addictive I mean if you arent careful you can find yourself getting stoned every day for long periods of time.  It took me a while to come to terms with what addiction really is.  In my case it was not a physical or chemical dependance, but purely psychological.  A lot of the hype around MJ right now portrays it as a substance that requires zero responsibility from its users, and I believe this is not a good message to send out. If you get drunk everyday you will find yourself in a place that does  not benefit you.  If you get high everyday eventually you will find yourself in this same place.  Every stoner knows this, and until they can admit it to themselves then they will not be getting the most out of the substance.  In order to keep moderation I will stop smoking for a few days when I am in these cycles of constant use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used dextro for a long time (military). When I was a private, I was given a cup of nyquil mixed with Jager. Funny thing was they sold it in Iraq by the 1000ml bottle. Most E-1&#39;s - E-4&#39;s on deployment were using it, sometimes on shift. No one ever got hit for it, During my time using once a weekend or so, I became a better soldier, numb, started getting religious to. It wouldn&#39;t be there if we weren&#39;t supposed to use it.  </p>

He said when he was in vietnam (drafted) the army was handing out black packets without saying what they were.  He said they all knew it was speed, helped them hump.

<p>Dextromethorphan in large doses is a pretty powerful  dissociative hallucinogen... are you suggesting the military was supplying it with the intent of usage in large doses?  Speed I could understand but Ive had large dxm doses and it is fucking creepy. I cringe at the thought of a soldier on deployment under the influence. Actually sounds like a bad movie in which people get hurt for strange reasons.</p>

High tolerance build-up, can completely flip your kill switch on all emotions, you might even function better on a subconscious level during an attack , not over confident or risky, just aware, efficient and not afraid, and only the soldier who would be most likely in need of these buffs, are attracted to abuse.

    <div class="md"><p>spice is more dangerous than marijuana, mj is tried and true. i dont see what the fuss about it is, as long as people arent smoking in middle of a firefight i dont see what is wrong with having a bowl at home/base. can drink alcohol, but no mj has always been a silly issue to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems similar to the DARE thing in schools. If you want to get kids hooked on drugs, you have to tell them about the drugs and how much fun they are. So, you have to tell them what the drugs look like and where you can get them (the bad sections of the city). It sounds like the K2 campaign is just an ad campaign to tell the soldiers why they should smoke spice and where they can get it, so the generals who make it and sell it can get rich.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldnt jump to the conclusion that it is the &quot;generals&quot; making it and selling it, this is highly un-likely.  I will say that SOMEONE is getting rich.  When I was smoking a bag a day (3 grams), it cost about 30-40 dollars a bag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. Maybe not generals, although history shows that they are often in on the game. But the drug cartels have to put their money somewhere, so it goes into the &quot;real economy&quot; into the stock market. So, I guess that the people behind it would be Goldman and company.</p>
