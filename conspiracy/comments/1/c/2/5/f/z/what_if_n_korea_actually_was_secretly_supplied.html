<p>China/Russia have everything to gain and KJU is too egotistical to let the world know it the DPRK didn&#39;t self-supply the arms. </p>

<p>Also, that could explain why China has been breaching our information infrastructure lately (ie. hacking govt data). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who said anything about China?</p>

<p>You&#39;re talking about the third time ever that nukes have been used on another country, and all three times, it will have been the US. The arms race is in large part because the rest of the world recognizes that the US doesn&#39;t attack countries with nukes. The spectre of nuclear war is most often invoked by the US as a political and military wedge to get what it wants. </p>

<p>If you think a nuclear retaliation for the US nuking ANYONE is impossible, think again. China isn&#39;t the only one with nukes, and the international community might ONLY be able to form a concensus on a mad-dog imperial America that broke nukes over a threat as small as NK, just because it was &#39;easier&#39;. </p>

<p>Finally, ICBM&#39;s with warheads aren&#39;t the only way to set off a nuke. &#39;Dirty nukes&#39; can go off at or past our poorly guarded ports, and it doesn&#39;t even have to be a foreign government doing it for Americans to believe they are under attack. Or worse, die a slow horrible death to send a message to the rest of us. </p>

<p>Christ, I&#39;m glad people like you are in charge of the most destructive arsenal known to man. /s</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. You seem to think the U.S. and North Korea are morally equivalent, but plainly that&#39;s false.

    <div class="md"><p>might as well go out on a conspiracy theory limb here... what if, since we are fighting shadow battles already (syria, anyone?) china/russia is doing the same with nk? they wouldnt necessarily back nk (maybe until the last possible minute)  but by giving them nukes and saying &quot;go crazy&quot;, wed be contained bc the usa is weak right now and by having a black swan event like this it prevents us from having a severe impact in the middle east, with the whole war against iran/syria ramping up nicely. nk gets to do what it always said it would, the us would have a tremendous problem on their hands at the worst possible time (economic collapse and the need for a new middle eastern war), and china/russia enter fresh after a further downward spiral of our empire. a not very complicated and impressively timed event surely is within the reach of 2 huge powers... but then again kim could just be a blathering idiot. id say its 50/50</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree, but stranger things have happened than secrets being shared or traded between countries. it could be a huge risk theyre taking but maybe put extra effort into hiding? who knows. its very convenient timing and now would be the best time to strike, i think. i wonder if iran would be put on the backburner if nukes went off in korea. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>that could explain why China has been breaching our information infrastructure lately</p>

<p>Not really.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s pretty clear why China is hacking our servers.  Because every major country now does this to every other country - Israel, the U.S., Russia, China, France, Germany, etc., now have huge divisions of hackers in their clandestine services, hacking away at allies and enemies alike.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think China is perfectly happy with the buffer of North Korea between itself and South Korea.  That way they have this bleak little hobbit of a country to which none of its citizens can compare favorably with life in China.  They aren&#39;t going to see how far a neighbor country can come back in 60 years after being about trashed (twice..once going, and once coming) by the Chinese army and the Russian air force.  Big secret back then, Russian pilots flew many of those Mig 15&#39;s because the NK pilots weren&#39;t up to the job, and were  making the gift of the planes useless while they were just target practice for US Sabre jets. Personally, I think there will be a few missiles shot, and surely an attempt to shoot them down rather than let them go over Japan.  But Isaac Newton said &#39;nature abhors a vacuum&#39;, and I believe in this case that NK is the vacuum, and they have a Justin Bieber kind of leader who must make some kind of place for himself before the generals decide he fell into a cuisinart while sleepwalking. If you look at one of those satellite night shots that take in the area, NK is the dark place between the V. bright SK, and the blotchy China. It seems far fetched that either Russia or China would open the &#39;let&#39;s you &amp; him fight&#39; can with a piece of hardware that would be found and identified unless it fell into the Marianas Trench.  By the US Navy.</p>
