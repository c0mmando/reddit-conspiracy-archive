<li>TL:DR - What are a few hard-hitting points to make that don&#39;t waste a listeners time, and have maximum effect of getting the point across?</li>
</ul>

<p>Last week, my father in law asked me, &quot;If you could bet everything you own and love on 9/11 being a bunch of lies, would you risk everything?&quot; I said &quot;Yep, That&#39;s how sure I am.&quot; </p>

<p>The next obvious question coming from somebody new to the conspiracy is.. &quot;WHY/HOW?&quot; And I realized I didn&#39;t have a good way to explain without babbling.. or talking about some gray areas that can be interpreted as coincidence or irrelevant. </p>

<p>To try and convince somebody in less than 5 minutes, without talking too much, what would you say? Here are a few of mine, please elaborate:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) Building 7 just completely fell.. and it was never hit by a plane and only had a tiny fire. </li>
<li>2) The pictures of the damage at the Pentagon show no damage to the building from wings or engines, no damage to the lawn, and of course all security tapes were confiscated. Furthermore, there were windows intact where the wings would have hit. The damage to the inner walls was more to the outer, which means secondary explosion. All these points come together to say: missle, not airplane.</li>
<li>3) The towers fell in a free fall, meaning they had no resistance. If one floor hitting the other happened all the way down, you&#39;d have a big delay.<br/></li>
<li>4) In video, you can see charges go off before the buildings fall. </li>
<li>5) Jet fuel doesn&#39;t burn at a temperature hot enough to melt the metal used at WTC. There is evidence of thermite, which is used to demolish buildings.<br/></li>
<li>6) The towers both fell in a perfectly straight line down... which is the same structurally as hitting 2 trees with an axe, and having said trees fall into a neat pile straight down instead of tipping over and falling to a horizontal position. Even if the jet fuel weakened the structure, it would have done so favoring the side of the building where the fire was, not evenly.</li>
</ul>

<p>What are some good, quick points for newcomers? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On September 10 they announced around 2.3 trillion dollars was missing from the budget.</p>

<p>The office in charge of tracking down that money was in the wing of the pentagon that was destroyed the next day on september 11. The only offsite backup of those files on those accounts was in building 7 which collapsed suspiciously and without getting hit by a plane the same day.</p>

<p>The pentagon wing that was hit had just been renovated by one of the companies that handled the cleanup of the WTC buildings destruction (AMEC). </p>

<p>Other renovations by Turner construction (other company in charge of ground zero cleanup alongside AMEC) had been made on the WTC buildings on certain floors for &quot;fireproofing upgrades&quot;. Those floors line up almost exactly with where the planes hit. </p>

<p>WTC 7 had 15 million dollars worth of renovations done before the attacks at the office of emergency management for mayor Giuliani.</p>

<p>Both construction companies had offices in the world trade center buildings.</p>

<p>Maximum terrorist insurance was taken out months before the attack by the owners of the building. Over 2 billion was payed out to Larry Silverstein.</p>

<p>There were war game scenarios going on the same day as the attacks dealing with the exact same scenario. The jets that NORAD usually scramble in 15 minutes took 45 that day because of the confusion between not knowing if it was a real world problem or a military scenario. </p>

<p>No plane wreckage was found at the Pentagon. Explanation was that the jet fuel burned so intensely. Yet a passport of a hijacker floated down to the streets of NY in tact completely through flames that took down the WTC buildings.</p>

<p>Towers were built to withstand a Boeing jet(s). “I designed it for a 707 to hit it”, Leslie Robertson, WTC structural engineer. “Could probably sustain multiple impacts of jetliners”, “like a pencil puncturing screen netting” Frank De Martini, deceased Manager of WTC Construction &amp; Project Management. “As far as a plane knocking a building over, that would not happen.” Charlie Thornton, Structural Engineer.</p>

<p>Buildings fell at nearly free fall speed.</p>

<p>84/85 pentagon security camera footage were confiscated, however a video from the pentagon released in the moussaoui trial never shows a Boeing plane hitting the building.</p>

<p>15 billion dollars was made off of stock options that were against the airlines involved in 9/11. 2.5 million of them unclaimed. No investigation results whatsoever. </p>

<p>Marvin Bush was a principal (director) in the company that provided security for WTC towers, that&#39;s G.W.&#39;s cousin.</p>

<p>GW put off the 9/11 commission for way too long. 6 out of the 10 commissioners believe it was &quot;setup to fail&quot; and was a &quot;whitehouse coverup&quot;.</p>

<p>Nano thermite was found at ground zero in different places, it&#39;s the same material used in controlled demolition</p>

<p>The theory that the buildings collapsed from fire doesn&#39;t seem consistent with the history of other steel buildings collapsing from fire because there has never been another. Ever. The only steel buildings in history to collapse from fire were the north and south tower. WTC 7 didn&#39;t even get hit by a plane and fell.</p>

<p>One of the largest gold depositories in the world lay under the WTC buildings. Gold from WTC 4 was found under WTC 5 in an abandoned truck that was stuck. 160 billion dollars of gold bars, 200 million was found.</p>

<p>And just for fun, the Anthrax sent in the mail to officials and politicians from &quot;terrorists&quot; tied to 9/11 was a strain that was proven to only have come from America.</p>

<p>Post 9/11 America...patriot act, Afghanistan and Iraq. We still haven&#39;t left. Saddam never had anything to do with it and we conveniently dumped Bin Ladens body in the ocean before anyone could see.</p>

<p>Seriously.  We still need to convince people?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright excuse me, they found some plane debris at the pentagon it looks like. You don&#39;t have to call me a liar, it was an error. The debris they did find around the pentagon have been speculated to have been planted. But no concrete proof. It still doesn&#39;t explain how the supposed pilot who was extremely inept made that corkscrew turn with such skill, doesn&#39;t explain absence of a video showing a plane hitting the pentagon, the size of the hole not matching up with a 747. Some of the debris found had no shearing or abrasion marks and looked to be cleanly torn. The wheel hub might not even match up with a 747 but I can&#39;t say for sure, it&#39;s all speculation and I am no expert.</p>

<li>WTC 7 was hit by falling debris from the towers.</li>
<li>And yet there were identifiable airplane fragments littering the area. <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/757_wreckage.html">[1]</a></li>
<li>Have you never seen a picture of it? This is the easiest thing to disprove. They didn&#39;t fall at free fall. You can see debris falling faster than the main structure. <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/freefall.html">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/freefall.htm">[3]</a></li>
<li>Where is this video you speak of? <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/overp.htm">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/wtc7_squibs.html">[5]</a></li>
<li>No metal need have melted to weaken it enough to collapse. Metal becomes malleable with heat long before it liquefies, especially with the weight of a skyscraper resting on it. My searching doesn&#39;t seem to indicate that thermite is used very often at all for demolition, if ever. For one thing, it&#39;s nearly impossible for it to cut sideways. The &quot;traces of thermite&quot; are also questionable. The chemicals found would have been there anyway, regardless of any thermite. <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/thermite.htm">[6]</a> <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/traces_of_thermate_at_the_wtc.html">[7]</a></li>
<li>Are you blind? Have you ever even seen any picture at all of the South Tower collapse? Here: <a href="http://cmsimg.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=BL&amp;amp;Date=20110911&amp;amp;Category=NEWS&amp;amp;ArtNo=109110345&amp;amp;Ref=AR&amp;amp;MaxW=300&amp;amp;Border=0&amp;amp;Memories-enough-Del-survivors">[8]</a> <a href="http://img.pixtale.net/imager/w_990/h_/5efdd6c975c86024dfa188f5abc409b3.jpg">[9]</a> <a href="http://www.sealane.org/books/WTCExp/jpegs/187.jpg">[10]</a> <a href="http://www.septclues.com/PICTURES%20sept%20clues%20research/TILT%20ANGLE%20WTC2%20_5.3%20degrees%20SMALL.jpg">[11]</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=south+tower+collapse&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=NJxlUdvhCZCyigKkr4DQAQ&amp;amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&amp;amp;biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=574">[12]</a>. I even made a quick diagram explaining it: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SoFt7fe.png">[13]</a>. Buildings aren&#39;t trees. Trees are very solid masses of material that don&#39;t break up under the stresses of being chopped down. Buildings are not built that way. They are not designed to stay together under the extreme stresses of falling over like that, because that&#39;s never supposed to happen. They&#39;re designed to prevent that, but only to a certain point. The tree analogy, which I have seen used several times, is frankly idiotic.</li>
