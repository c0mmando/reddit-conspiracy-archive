<p>QUESTION: has anyone bothered to look for footage of the man in the wheelchair who &quot;lost both his legs&quot; before the explosion?</p>

<p>because i havent seen any of him walking around. if we can figure out who did it by looking at footage, we should be able to find him (not walking)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I&#39;ve been here, don&#39;t worry. I was simply asking for clarification. I wanted to know whether or not I could call you a fucking moron for perpetrating this nonsense, or if you were simply ignorant. </p>

<p>The guys legs were clearly blown off in the blast. Many people had limbs that were blown off. Do you think this guy was walking around on stilts for hours before the blast, only to rip them off last minute, squirt on some fake blood, and start rolling around on the ground?</p>

<p>Were the cowboy and the woman pushing him in on it too?</p>

<p>Pull your head out of your ass. This was a real event, and it will have real implications. Pay attention to the things that matter in this case, like our government&#39;s RESPONSE to it, and stop giving breath to disinformation that is meant to make subs like this, as you say, look crazy, foolish, and off topic.</p>

<p>instead of discrediting the already existing theory and announcing it as false, you have perpetuated something else that could be (and most likely is) false.  This is why it is dirty work.  You chose to spread the bullshit instead of clean it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, you can&#39;t just say &quot;guise it&#39;s a conspiracy subreddit lolz finds the proof!&quot;</p>

<p>just because this is a place for discussion of potential conspiracy doesn&#39;t mean you can dump the burden of proof on it.  I understand your point though, perhaps you were expecting someone to have insights that you did not and for that i can&#39;t fault you.  However, i feel like presentation is key.  Don&#39;t take it to heart, you have at least provided an impetus for serious discussion of the subject.</p>

<p>Were you ever able to find what you were looking for?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you on about? </p>

<p>He asks if anyone has seen the guy walking before. We should be able to find this right? And then it&#39;s confirmed.</p>

<p>You tell him he&#39;s wrong because stuff like the method he uses (which he doesn&#39;t) or disrespecting the victim (which isn&#39;t for you to judge) etc.</p>

<p>He asks you to back up your claim that he is wrong and that the man was walking before. Realize here that you make a claim here and it is then that the burden of proof argument applies. It doesn&#39;t apply when asking a question, only when making a statement/claim. Hence you pretty much &quot;suckered&quot; yourself into having having the burden of proof on you.</p>

<p>And then he can and does simply repeat that he is asking a question, to which you sort of implied you have the answer, yet you proceed not to provide this answer, tell him the burden of proof is on him when it&#39;s actually on you since you are making a claim and thus have to back this up, and call him out for &quot;shifting&quot; the burden of proof when you are actually doing that yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m under the impression themandotcom said UMK is wrong (about his speculation). Aka themandotcom is making a claim.</p>

<p>UMK then resorts to pretty much only asking for a backup of said claim.</p>

<p>To me this seems in line with the way the burden of proof works.</p>

<p>You just repeated what you already said btw. I understand how it works once it is determined who made a claim. The issue here is that I&#39;m under the impression UMK never made a claim and themandotcom did make a claim in his reponse. Hence my reasoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Themandotcom is making no claims except for &quot;You&#39;re JAQing off&quot; and if you want proof of that then just look at this whole thread.</p>

<p>UMK is making claims under the pretence of &quot;Just asking questions&quot;. It&#39;s a cowardly way of trying to share your opinion because the moment people start arguing the other point they can just go &quot;Hey, I&#39;m just asking questions&quot; when clearly you aren&#39;t. The burden of proof is on him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. I have mistaken themandotcom for another user UMK was argueing with. </p>

<p>In that another user does claim to have facebook pictures and then it makes sense. </p>

<p>In the particular response thread with themandotcom responding that hasn&#39;t actually happened. It looked like it did but it didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Anyway I was wrong since themandotcom never made such a claim, I was mistaken , my bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>because i havent seen any of him walking around. if we can figure out who did it by looking at footage, we should be able to find him (not walking)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are making several claims here:</p>

<p>1) That we can figure out who did this by looking at footage. Footage can give the authorities leads but that does not mean there is 100% certainty. For all we know, there is no footage of the true culprits. We are just hoping that there is.</p>

<p>2) That there is footage of the man in the wheelchair from before the explosions. There were many people running that marathon and the area effected by the explosion covers hundreds of square meters, not to mention the marathon route itself. To assume that he MUST be in a photo is very presumptuous.
And finally
3) That any footage of him must be of him not walking. You state it right there. You insinuate, in your elaboration of the question, that he won&#39;t be walking.</p>

<p>Those are three claims you made and claims must have evidence. And since you asked the question that contains them, you must provide the evidence.</p>

<p>The reason I say mostly done is because it could be pics from a year ago where he lost his legs in a car accident the past year hence not making it very strong. Being able to find him in footage or pics from the day itself make the strongest case and will still be relevant.</p>

<li>You aren&#39;t supposed to post Facebook links here.</li>
<li>Are you really suggesting that I save some stranger&#39;s personal photos to my computer, then upload them, then share the link, just because you refuse to click the link I have already provided that will lead you to the pics?</li>
</ol>

<p>These are two different men, that much is clear. If you think that this guy lost his legs somehow recently and was then recruited to take part in an attack to give the press some gross photos, then by all means...YOU can ask his friends if he lost his legs prior to this week. I&#39;m not making that stalkerish leap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jeff Bauman is a guitarist. I guess he grew a beard at some point.</p>

<p>There is a picture posted on his facebook posted on December 26 that shows his full body standing next to some sort of elevated tree house. Of course, he is not naked in the photo...so the evidence you are looking for (a full body shot showing skin) is still lacking.</p>

<p>Again...use Occam&#39;s razor here. If none of his friends ar saying that he was a double amputee, and the photos seem to suggest that he was not a double amputee, and he appears to have been a Costco employee paying off student debt...then maybe...just maybe...he was not an undercover operative whose top secret job was to be positioned at a bombing to take a fake photo that could have been easily shown to be fake by anyone who knows him. Imagine the risk if just one of his friends went to the media...and then think about how he is just one of many injured people, so his presence there wasn&#39;t needed to advance a plot.</p>

<p>As for this more general idea which I don&#39;t think is all that relevant to the question proposed in the OP because it&#39;s subject to time. (a picture with his legs 5 years ago is not conclusive that he arrived at the event with his legs functioning)</p>

<p>But for that argument a picture of him standing self supported in full frame, not terrible quality and somewhat recent (which would still be subject to something like prosthetic legs) but for the most part would convince me just fine thank you very much.</p>

<p>Just try and think about this for a second instead of assuming even the vaguest little anomaly is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Why would they do that? For what possible reason would the bombers get an amputee to pose as a fake victim of the bombing, when there are plenty of real ones to go around? And obviously the guy&#39;s friends, family, co-workers and all associates have to be in on it as well, not to mention the EMTs and doctors that treated him.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I&#39;ve been here, don&#39;t worry. I was simply asking for clarification. I wanted to know whether or not I could call you a fucking moron for perpetrating this nonsense, or if you were simply ignorant. </p>

<p>The guys legs were clearly blown off in the blast. Many people had limbs that were blown off. Do you think this guy was walking around on stilts for hours before the blast, only to rip them off last minute, squirt on some fake blood, and start rolling around on the ground?</p>

<p>Were the cowboy and the woman pushing him in on it too?</p>

<p>Pull your head out of your ass. This was a real event, and it will have real implications. Pay attention to the things that matter in this case, like our government&#39;s RESPONSE to it, and stop giving breath to disinformation that is meant to make subs like this, as you say, look crazy, foolish, and off topic.</p>

<p>If he is not found in any of the photos, that is not proof of anything that you are implying.</p>

<p>Panties un-wadded. You are perpetuating disinformation and are distracting from other very real things. When someone finds him walking before the blast, I will hold back my told-ya-so&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m under the impression themandotcom said UMK is wrong (about his speculation). Aka themandotcom is making a claim.</p>

<p>UMK then resorts to pretty much only asking for a backup of said claim.</p>

<p>To me this seems in line with the way the burden of proof works.</p>

<p>You just repeated what you already said btw. I understand how it works once it is determined who made a claim. The issue here is that I&#39;m under the impression UMK never made a claim and themandotcom did make a claim in his reponse. Hence my reasoning.</p>
