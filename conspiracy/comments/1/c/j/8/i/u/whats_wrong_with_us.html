       I've always been on the internet reading about conspiracy theories and such, but I always brushed it off. I was 14 (19 now) when I regularly browsed 4chan and all of these threads listing American evil and deciet were rampant.
       <br/>
       I thought to myself, "eh, whatever it's 4chan. None of that stuff is real."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I am older, I pay attention to the details. How could we allow for these things to happen? Where money and big banks control our lives, where we fight for oil instead of freedom. When we let innocent lives be claimed in other countries but is enabled by ours.
       <br/>
       How can we live in a society where cloak and dagger tactics plague our mind but our leaders are the one who instilled it?
       <br/>
       We are probed; our privacy is continuously thinned. We are told what to think, what to feel, what to believe, what to see in front of us. We are bullied into being fearful of the world when the ones who are committing these fearful acts are extensions of ourselves - the leaders we have elected.
       <br/>
       What can we do? What do we believe in anymore? How do we fight? How do we stand? What is really the truth? How do we know what we believe in is really the truth? Why do we live lives such as these?
       <br/>
       The society we live in is a concerning place, my friends.

       It's a long war between the truth tellers and the liars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many aboriginal cultures do not even have a word for liars, they call them "half-truths". The intent to do harm is exclusive to an individual and an individual is the product of experiences. Try not to hate those who speak without thought or believe what is fed to them, they are victims of another's will.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a morality struggle, and morality is where the war will be won. Talk, discuss, communicate, do not fear conflict, embrace it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you truly love those who have been lied to and misled, than have the courage to tell them. The only thing that allows evil to triumph is the indifference of good men.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fear is the illusion. Hang in there, you are not alone.

       Well on 4chan there are different boards for different topics... much like how we have subreddits on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
       4chan.org/pol/ is the political board, which does talk a lot about politics and also did have threads about the suspects. 4chan.org/b/ is the board for random topics and that's the board that is taking a special interest in finding these suspects right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though /pol/ is for politics, there is a lot of forum sliding i.e. people posting rubbish topics to keep others from discussing real matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to go into a thread, hit the reply link next to it and it should open up to the thread. New topics and threads with new post get bumped to the front... the others slowly go to the last page and are automatically deleted once it reaches the last page.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would try and link some of the threads here... but they might get deleted and go 404 before you check them.

       The collapse will only affect the general population, not the mega-rich.  During the Great Depressions and our most recent "Great Recession", the rich were fine, and still profitting.  When the collapse happens, there's a good chance we are all fucked.

       I know exactly what you mean. You are lucky you are actually realizing this at such a young age. I am 28 and have had a huge slap to the face realization on our world since December. I look into it constantly late at night. Trust me, the rabbit hole goes deep deep deep my friend. Evil is everywhere, especially in the media. Governments. Scary stuff.

       It will go on as long as we sit on the sidelines and watch. It will only stop when you yourself decide to do something. You cannot expect a hero to swoop in. It is not the evil men who destroy the world, it is the good men who allow them to get away with it.

       It's really a battle that take its roots in our own mind. Think of the fact that kings and leaders where at first made and driven by the religious powers of the time. It shows that our relationship with the divine/universe/ourselves is the top of the power tree. See that people often try to relate with reality trough a construct of their mind, derived from hear-say (history). Don't outsource your relationship with reality to anyone, be it scientists or religious figures, or people on this forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine that you stumbled on the real solution, the world would still be driven by its old course. That course/curse would inevitably try to transform your solution into a tool to further a given agenda, it's a psychological reality. Almost nobody's able to stop their mind from its course, and it's infected with lies. We lost control of our own primary intention. The world has become a huge placebo constantly telling us that we can't get over it. Put this to the test. And of course(haha) don't believe me.

       Cute, but no. Are you insinuating that all the Jews had to do was hug the Nazis and shit would have been fine? Love, or community if that's what you mean, is great, but the whole point behind peaceful resistance is to garner enough support and expose the opposition so much that the majority is willing to stop the tyranny at a certain point, and at that point, violence and use of force is always an option.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those in charge eventually concede because they are severely outnumbered, and can't impose their will anymore. Our culture today though, is so deeply saturated with propaganda that using this tactic just won't work. When Republicans and Democrats base their support of issues primarily JUST to contrast one another, the people who "belong to" those parties just fall in line and perpetuate the division.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that peaceful resistance doesn't completely exclude violence as a response, it just reserves violence as a very last resort, when all other tactics have been exhausted.
      </p>

       TL; DR- Pacifism is just a PR stunt to gain enough support to outnumber the opposition, using violence if necessary. It won't work though because we all hate each other.

       Upvote for the "Century of the Self" recommendation--one of the best films out there. WORTH the four-plus hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also worth watching is "Defamation" by Jewish Israeli filmmaker Yoav Shamir. Besides for being a brilliant artist, he puts the truth right in your face. It's funny at the beginning when his Israeli taxi driver had NO IDEA what the term "antisemitism" meant--neither did his Jewish grandmother who lived in Israel. The film is watching for her scene alone! ; ')
      </p>
      <p>
       He also did "Checkpoint: Israel" which is one of the best films on sheer Israeli day-in-and-day-out brutality. Check them out.

       The problem is the media, mainly the tv.  People are indoctrinated to believe that tv can't and won't lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are presented with two sides---left v right---and we choose our personal programming accordingly.  Whatever our newsman says, whether its a Bill O or a Piers M, is our "truth".
      </p>
      <p>
       And we are told that believing other than what god-box tells us is blasphemous.  Many people (most?) have a hard time getting a handle on the fact that reality shows are scripted.  Presenting them with WTC7 is like setting off a DEW in their brains.
      </p>
      <p>
       After years of submission to the device, to find out we've been lied to---by a trusted talking head sporting a suit and tie, with a haircut you can set your watch to, and a red, white, and blue backdrop---can be painful.

       It is called brainwashing. Over time and over generations. These are our ways now. Wars, and the "rough evil world". I refuse to believe it. I wake up happy and I take it with me wherever I go. I try and brighten everyone who is down, and I try and share as much as I am certain in.

       Watch the movie Apocalypto. Those were the beginnings.

       Check out the book "Neither Wolf nor Dog: On Forgotten Roads with an Indian Elder". Old indian man tells the story of his people and their ways, and their life now after the brothers on ships came.

       • And a Man sat alone, drenched deep in sadness. And all the animals drew near to him and said, "We do not like to see you so sad. Ask us for whatever you wish and you shall have it." The Man said, "I want to have good sight." The vulture replied, "You shall have mine." The Man said, "I want to be strong." The jaguar said, "You shall be strong like me." Then the Man said, "I long to know the secrets of the earth." The serpent replied, "I will show them to you." And so it went with all the animals. And when the Man had all the gifts that they could give, he left. Then the owl said to the other animals, "Now the Man knows much, he'll be able to do many things. Suddenly I am afraid." The deer said, "The Man has all that he needs. Now his sadness will stop." But the owl replied, "No. I saw a hole in the Man, deep like a hunger he will never fill. It is what makes him sad and what makes him want. He will go on taking and taking, until one day the World will say, 'I am no more and I have nothing left to give.'"

       The only thing that you can do is to try to educate yourself and your friends/family. The basic fact is that humans are animals who will do anything to eat. We need to try to understand the situation that we live in and fight back to the best of our abilities.

       We simply did not allow for these things to just happen.  This country was founded by the rich, for the rich, and the rich only (for now).  We can fight, but will we?
      </p>
      <p>
       Slavery still exists today, why do you think we have such high prison populations (other than to benefit the corporations that control them)?  College debt has surpassed a trillion dollars; credit card debt is nearly as high; wages are at their lowest point while corporate profits are at their highest; our justice system is multi-tiered, usually more generous to the rich and/or powerful.

       The police are becoming increasingly militarized to prevent the small uprisings and strikes that occurred throughout our history.  Our government is becoming more secretive as we speak.  The first thing you must do, as we should all do if we haven't already, is realize that our government does not care for us, and while we allow them to keep showing it, they will continue to do so.

       We were created with a brain capable of finding the Truth. Sadly, fluoride has greatly diminished that capability. The Creator can still speak to you, but it isn't as easy to open our "third eye" as it used to. This world is a test. Follow the Golden Rule and you'll pass. We'll be out of these flesh sacks sooner than it seems, so touch as many lives as you can while you can.

       Just be your authentic self bro. Others will take note and maybe even follow suite. Rebel in thought and deed. Show kindness and compassion where it will be least expected. The outer world is fucked and will provide no real kind of answers to your questions. Cultivate your inner world. Go within.

       The simple fact of the matter is this. If every single American knew every single detail of the horrible things that the American Government and American corporations had done, they would be completely outraged. For a while. Because they worked very hard to ignore the opression and the explotation that allows them to live as well as they do. And then after a while, they would find a way to once again think that this situation was acceptable, because hey, they deserve things, because they're American dammit. Citizens of the greatest nation in the history of the world! USA! USA! USA!
