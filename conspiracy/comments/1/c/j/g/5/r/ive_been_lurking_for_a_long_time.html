       First allow me to say that there are a few posters here who clearly do research and try to back their claims up. Wether they're right or wrong, some of their posts are eye opening or at the very least a good read. Over the past while, though, I've been getting more and more frustrated with this sub and I'm not biting my tongue anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub has mostly deteriorated to massively far-fetched assumptions (homeland security "taking control" over Seattle) and individual witch hunts whenever something happens (the MANY Boston "suspect" posts are a recent example).
      </p>
      <p>
       And, of course, it inevitably boils down to gun control or gov't takeovers. Listen, 'Murica, your government is not out to get you. Do you know why? You, as an individual, do not fucking matter. The resources that would require is astronomical. That drone is not following you. Recently here real estate agents are using drones to take aerial photos of large properties. We are not up in arms, demanding the drones cease to be used. If "they" wanted to watch you that badly there are other, better ways to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the sake of argument, though, lets say you ARE being watched and somehow it's been decided you're a threat. Do you really think those assault rifles you board will help you against superior tactical knowledge, superior numbers, and superior tech (including shit we don't even know about)? No, it won't. You'll be so overwhelmed it won't even matter what you've stockpiled.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second amendment was written over TWO HUNDRED years ago, as a means to allow the civilian population to defend and assist in case of war. It was not written to allow you to stockpile assault weapons. I know a lot of 'Muricans point at Canada as an example of why you should fight gun control. Why? Ok, so I can't go buy a fully automatic weapon, but so what? I go get my PAL (possession and acquisition license), which is a lengthy process involving background checks and enough time to discourage impulse buyers, then I can buy whatever I please, within reason. Pistol? A little more red tape with local police as they're easily concealed, but that's all. High calibre bolt action rifle? Sure, enjoy your big game hunt. Semi-auto rifle? No problem, so long as it has a small magazine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, criminals and terrorists, a very loose term now, will get whatever they want. That's an inescapable fact. Gun control is to prevent someone catching their wife cheating, going to buy a gun, and killing the two. It's to prevent a bullied student from coming to class with an assault rifle and spraying bullets. Tragedies will always happen, it's a sad truth of the world we live in, and law enforcement officers can not be everywhere at every time. Sometimes a backpack will go unnoticed. Sometimes that supposed hunter stopping at the mall for supplies is actually about to start sniping from across the parking lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government IS corrupt, yes, they all are to some extent. They are not coming to get you. The problem is not with the government, but with yourselves. I sit back and watch the news and all I see is a country beginning to implode. Wake up, people, YOU are the problem with your country.

       The American government is the biggest criminal syndicate the world has ever seen, with a business model based on theft and murder. Try not paying your slavery fees for a year and we'll see how free you really are.

       This dude actually believes the crap about freedom he learned in school. Now he has started to learn some about what is going w/the internet, so he's trying to rationalize his faith in government with the problems he has seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's trying to do this by rationalizing that the government isn't comparatively that bad, and that all conspiracy theorists are well, a little crazy.

       Fair enough. But I think you should acknowledge there is room for a lot of conspiracy theory without falling into "the government is personally out to kill me camp."

       Our government has done a lot of shady shit that has been proven. You don't need to verge off into the crazy to realize there are real conspiracies.

       Read the fucking description of the sub! "This subreddit is a thinking ground, above all else we respect everyone's opinions...". You may not always agree with what some of the people post on here, I certainly don't, but they have the right to discuss their ideas and opinions. Just don't read or comment on the posts that you feel are too far fetched. Hell downvote them if they piss you off that bad. But don't post a rant demonizing people for having an opinion on something. After all, you yourself are doing the exact same thing as those people that piss you off by posting your personal opinion.

       Not ironic at all. I'm not pissed off about your opinion, I'm pissed off at the fact that you choose to demonize those with opinions that differ from your own. Not once in my post did I disagree with your opinion nor did I agree with it. All I said was that there were other actions you can take if you disagree with the material posted and that you shouldn't post a rant demonizing other people on this sub for having an opinion or idea.

       Demonizing? That's rather over-the-top, buddy. Everyone can believe what they choose, whether that's "9/11 was an inside job," "tinfoil hats will save you," or anything in between.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, if a persons opinion grates on someone else, that someone else has every right to voice THEIR opinion as well. That is how free speech works, is it not? I'm not telling anybody to STFU, merely putting my thoughts out there.

       There's nothing useful about what you said either. I, and probably most of the other people in this subreddit are hardworking Americans who day in and out are trying to keep this country going and arrest the decay.

      <p>
       And yet you have the nerve to tell us that we are the source of the problem because we have lost faith in the government?

       There are plenty of legit proven reasons to have lost faith in this government my friend, and you don't even need to venture into conspiracy theory to find them.

       While you may not find my opinion useful to your daily life, it is still my opinion. My entire opinion, if you were to take the time to read the entire post rather than simply the last sentence, is not "it's all your fault." I did, in fact, state that the government is indeed corrupt. Does that not suggest I know full well that your government is fucking up? So is mine. As is the governments of nearly EVERY country.

       I would like to see a demographic of everyone in this sub to back up your claims as to what nationality everyone here is.

       Just corrupt? That is the tip of the iceberg that sunk the titanic. I think you should do some research rather than attempt to label everyone in this sub as a crazy conspiracy theorist who thinks the "government is out to get them."

       Yep. You can't argue with me, so you would rather just downvote and call me a troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stopping making your relativist argument, it is really terrible. Some governments by definition ARE better than others, that is the story of nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the demographic part, as reddit is heavily American dominated, I would assume the same would hold true for this sub. Could be wrong. Whatever. You're still slandering an entire group of people just because you puny worldview is challenged.

       I don't disagree with most of what you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you have the 2nd amendment all wrong.  It wasn't established to allow citizens to assist the government in a time of war.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was affirming that the right to bear arms in an inalienable right that every man possesses and not a privilege doled out by government.  Government has historically been used to oppress a great number of men for the convenience of a few.  Our right to keep and bear arms is just as much a necessity to keep the government of the US from being used as mentioned above as it is to assist our government if being acted upon by outside forces.
