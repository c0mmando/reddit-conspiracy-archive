        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First allow me to say that there are a few posters here who clearly do research and try to back their claims up. Wether they&#39;re right or wrong, some of their posts are eye opening or at the very least a good read. Over the past while, though, I&#39;ve been getting more and more frustrated with this sub and I&#39;m not biting my tongue anymore. </p>

<p>This sub has mostly deteriorated to massively far-fetched assumptions (homeland security &quot;taking control&quot; over Seattle) and individual witch hunts whenever something happens (the MANY Boston &quot;suspect&quot; posts are a recent example).</p>

<p>And, of course, it inevitably boils down to gun control or gov&#39;t takeovers. Listen, &#39;Murica, your government is not out to get you. Do you know why? You, as an individual, do not fucking matter. The resources that would require is astronomical. That drone is not following you. Recently here real estate agents are using drones to take aerial photos of large properties. We are not up in arms, demanding the drones cease to be used. If &quot;they&quot; wanted to watch you that badly there are other, better ways to do so. </p>

<p>For the sake of argument, though, lets say you ARE being watched and somehow it&#39;s been decided you&#39;re a threat. Do you really think those assault rifles you board will help you against superior tactical knowledge, superior numbers, and superior tech (including shit we don&#39;t even know about)? No, it won&#39;t. You&#39;ll be so overwhelmed it won&#39;t even matter what you&#39;ve stockpiled. </p>

<p>The second amendment was written over TWO HUNDRED years ago, as a means to allow the civilian population to defend and assist in case of war. It was not written to allow you to stockpile assault weapons. I know a lot of &#39;Muricans point at Canada as an example of why you should fight gun control. Why? Ok, so I can&#39;t go buy a fully automatic weapon, but so what? I go get my PAL (possession and acquisition license), which is a lengthy process involving background checks and enough time to discourage impulse buyers, then I can buy whatever I please, within reason. Pistol? A little more red tape with local police as they&#39;re easily concealed, but that&#39;s all. High calibre bolt action rifle? Sure, enjoy your big game hunt. Semi-auto rifle? No problem, so long as it has a small magazine. </p>

<p>Yes, criminals and terrorists, a very loose term now, will get whatever they want. That&#39;s an inescapable fact. Gun control is to prevent someone catching their wife cheating, going to buy a gun, and killing the two. It&#39;s to prevent a bullied student from coming to class with an assault rifle and spraying bullets. Tragedies will always happen, it&#39;s a sad truth of the world we live in, and law enforcement officers can not be everywhere at every time. Sometimes a backpack will go unnoticed. Sometimes that supposed hunter stopping at the mall for supplies is actually about to start sniping from across the parking lot. </p>

<p>The government IS corrupt, yes, they all are to some extent. They are not coming to get you. The problem is not with the government, but with yourselves. I sit back and watch the news and all I see is a country beginning to implode. Wake up, people, YOU are the problem with your country. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The current version uses 368 five-megapixel sensors, for a total of 1.8 gigapixels. But unlike other gigapixel camera systems, this one doesn&#39;t record still images — it produces video. That means that from four miles up, it can watch a roughly circular area up to six miles wide, tracking every car and person in real time.</p>

<p>With its capabilities, the system can detail areas within a very broad context, with enough zoom power to see people waving their arms and walking around in parking lots. This is a 1.8-gigapixel video surveillance platform that can resolve details as small as six inches from an altitude of 17,500 feet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree with most of what you said.</p>

<p>But you have the 2nd amendment all wrong.  It wasn&#39;t established to allow citizens to assist the government in a time of war.</p>

<p>It was affirming that the right to bear arms in an inalienable right that every man possesses and not a privilege doled out by government.  Government has historically been used to oppress a great number of men for the convenience of a few.  Our right to keep and bear arms is just as much a necessity to keep the government of the US from being used as mentioned above as it is to assist our government if being acted upon by outside forces.</p>
