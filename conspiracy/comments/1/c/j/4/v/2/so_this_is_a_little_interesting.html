        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Obviously there&#39;s a ton of threads, speculation and all kinds of stuff floating around about the events in Boston.</p>

<p>I noticed this just now - <a href="http://i.imgur.com/K0x5LzP.png">photo</a></p>

<p>So, the first photo and two dudes pictured keep popping up as suspicious people. Fair enough. The second photo I saw in a thread and the OP was talking how he/she thinks it could be the backpack that contained the cooker and was pretty much right where the blast happened - then I noticed the water/juice bottle in the first photo and the little green speck that looks more or less attached to the bag in the second.</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<p>• <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RdUh9PNh.jpg">Two suspicious dudes who people keep pointing out</a></p>

<p>• <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Jn82qarh.jpg">Then the bag the guy in black was carrying seems to be gone</a></p>

<p>• <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cf5wp/2013_boston_marathon_attacks_please_upload_any/c9g6fv1">This person thinks the bag is more or less close to the site of the bomb</a></p>

<p>• <a href="http://i.imgur.com/K0x5LzP.png">Both bags in question seem to have a green... thing (bottle, whatever) attached to them</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look how stretched out the bag is... think about if there was a pressure cooker in there it would probably barely fit in that orientation. Very possible here. I also agree with others that there is no straps in this picture, but blowing the image up like this really helps to bring the details out.</p>

<p>You can see some stuff in the side pocket as well. A square pink think and a larger green and white object. Any guesses on what those are?</p>

<p>I make no effort to hide my generally disdainful attitude to the topic of conspiracy theories, but it is really nice to see posts like this where you just point out interesting observations without making any jumps to conclusions. It&#39;s posts like this that keep me interested in this subreddit. Cheers :-)</p>

<p>Then may I ask why you&#39;re here?  I&#39;m not trying to be snarky, I&#39;m really curious as to why you&#39;d be in a subreddit for conspiracy theories if you didn&#39;t like them?  I tend to avoid things I don&#39;t like..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, I get the spirit of your question :-)</p>

<p>A couple of reasons. Curiosity is quite a big one. The main one I suppose is that the thought of having a debate with someone who holds a completely different opinion on something I generally take to be true through habit is appealing.</p>

<p>I find a lot of people who are into this sort of thing are antagonistic and make wild assumptions based of speculative evidence, good ol&#39; confirmation bias and all that, hence my generally negative attitude. By saying that I have this attitude however I&#39;d like to show that I&#39;m aware of it, and I suppose it&#39;s meant quasi-apologetically too. I&#39;m aware there are people on this subreddit who enjoy disseminating evidence and pondering whether there is more than meets the eye to it all, and it&#39;s them that keep me coming back. As it is those people I&#39;m interested in interacting with I&#39;d rather let them know from the off that I&#39;m generally a skeptic but by the very nature of posting on here I&#39;m willing to partake in debate.</p>

<p>That was a bit rambly, sorry. Hope it answered your question satisfactorily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really have much in the way of an opinion on the two you mention initially, I don&#39;t really know anything about them beyond a quick scan of Wikipedia now and that&#39;s not really enough to reach a solid conclusion. </p>

<p>That&#39;s kinda the reason I&#39;m here, I&#39;m curious. I feel it&#39;s pretty unfair of me to be derisory of the general populace of conspiracy theorists until I spend some time regularly reading through the subreddit. Conclusion so far is that there are a fair number of people who just enjoy milling over data and proposing suggestions for alternate explanations.....however your general reputation is tarnished by the people who generally state &quot;WAKE UP SHEEPLE&quot; and then use rhetoric, insults and excitable language in response to any attempt at debate.</p>

<p>Pick a theory, and throw me some of your favorite evidence for it and why it strongly disagrees with official reports and I&#39;d love to have a pore over it :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, the torture report was interesting, moderately unsurprising though.</p>

<p>I agree that these things will undoubtably receive lessened coverage by what happened at Boston, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean Boston was staged with the intent to bury these things. Besides, the report was released to the public so all that would happen is a slower awareness spread rather than a nullified one. If it was something the white house really wanted to cover it would surely have been easier to throw it on a friday release and then stage something for the weekend.</p>

<p>I have to ask at this point, what is your wider picture view? Do you believe in a larger, more insidious conspiracy like many people here ( be it NWO, illuminati, anything of that ilk) or are you more of the opinion that sometimes a government will have to do something distasteful which they will try to move the public attention away from?</p>

<p>From the limited time I&#39;ve had to read about the WTC bombings all I can see is a fuck up. I could easily believe that the FBI knew enough to know something could happen but not enough to prevent it, just as I could believe that they were trying to outsmart the terrorists and screwed the pooch royally in it. If you think you can provide any interesting or illuminating sources on this feel free, I would enjoy reading them.</p>

<p>My job is the exact opposite unfortunately, it is incredibly intellectually demanding. By the time I&#39;m settling down to an evenings faffing on the internet I tend to be exhausted, but sometimes it&#39;s nice to have an intellectual excercise thats purely done out of interest. I&#39;d also like to think that it gives me a fair chance to better analyse things without letting personal feelings bias me too much. </p>

<p>As for the main attention of the US being centred on the middle east, I would (potentially naively I admit) have just assumed that was out of self interest. Attempting to improve the stability of the middle east directly benefits America through ease of access to oil and the petroleum industry. There isn&#39;t much of an investment in Burma, and they aren&#39;t likely to cause much of a ruckus that will necessitate the involvement of the US to protect their interests unlike a war in the middle east would.</p>

<p>Again with North Korea, if there is a chance that they have the weapons they claim to have then it COULD threaten US interests. More to the point it re-affirms the ties with South Korea, and could even lead to improved relations with China. Having China come over to our side on the DPRK issue, one the have historically been kinda supportive of, it could lead to improved communication between the governments. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be the first to admit I have only an armchair understanding of foreign politics. Please feel free to contradict/correct me on any matters you think I&#39;ve got the wrong end of the stick on :-)</p>

They wait until he throws the bottle away and then they retrieve the bottle after he leaves, being careful not to erase his prints or put theirs on it. Put the bottle with the bag and after the FBI puts it back together,, they grab the guy and they have a false lead. Either the guy has a alibi or the torture him into confessing.</p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting is the duct tape. It&#39;s either a duct taped side pocket, or the bottle is taped to the backpack. And why would an empty bottle be taped to the backpack? Some kind of makeshift module for the pressure cooker bomb, maybe.</p>
