<p>Good thing the &quot;terrorists&quot; aren&#39;t determined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I come from Ireland, we had 25 years of terrorism and bombs, someone who is determined enough cannot be stopped.</p>

<p>Salameh, Rudolph, Kazcinsky, McVeigh all had their own reasons, but they managed to make it through and inflict their damage.</p>

<p>Also, virtually every week in Iraq, terrorists are slipping through the net and killing dozens, hundreds of people. Is that all a plot by the Iraqi government to instill fear into the populace?</p>

<p>How about NW Pakistan? are the Pashtun militias who are beheading villagers in Waziristan imaginary or something?</p>

<p>Where there&#39;s is a will there&#39;s a way. Open your eyes to proper information, not agenda pushed nonsense from Alex Jones and Fox news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So is the Kris Kyle death a conspiracy?  I would imagine TPTB wouldn&#39;t want a guy like that being the general of a small militia.  Pretty powerful guy given his reputation.  By powerful, I mean leader material.  Someone who could really influence a group of people to do his bidding...  Rhetorical question though.  I&#39;ll look it up!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a conspiracy at all but after reading the circumstances just now it kinda feels like it is. I remember reading a report somewhere(If I find it I&#39;ll definately make a new post with a link) that before 9/11 there were 30 small domestic groups on the watchlist and after it&#39;s jumped to well over 300 medium to large groups. A worry was that all it would take is one man to have the leadership material to get them all rallied together and they would be a scary militia group rebelling against the gov here in america that would give the gov serious problems. Chris Kyle sounds like the type of guy that could have done that.  I&#39;m not saying for sure I believe there was anything funky happening, but I can say from personal experience a lot of the military is wary of the govt and if a civil war broke out quite a few troops wouldn&#39;t be on the govt&#39;s side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never quoted his book, I don&#39;t know where you got I did. Also since he is the founder of craft IF he did say they do private security in his book then yes that one line from that book is more than enough evidence. I&#39;ll see if I can find info on it online. I can say there are companies that do things like Craft and don&#39;t advertise their private security. They only strictly recruit people they want and all clientele comes from word of mouth. I know this from having been in the military and had friends recruited for other firms. If I find something online from it I&#39;ll post it in another message to you. Also if it turns out those guys aren&#39;t from Craft then yes it is more than likely they trained at Craft. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in as well and have seen numerous buddies get selected for the private sector,  but the thing is if they were doing security work and they don&#39;t really advertise that they do, then why would the guy in the hat wear a craft hat advertising what they do. Another thing, I didn&#39;t mean to word the comment as if you already quoted it, I meant it as I&#39;ve already heard there was a quote, but could not find it, from another redditor.

    <div class="md"><p>Ah gotcha, I see what you meant now about the book quote. Just because a company doesn&#39;t actually market themselves with advertising doesn&#39;t mean they would also try to hide themselves. Say this bomb didn&#39;t happen and the security detail was there from Craft. Just because they don&#39;t blatantly advertise that they do private security doesn&#39;t mean they also try to hide it. The two aren&#39;t mutually exclusive. Now you can go and buy the hats from the website and it&#39;s completely possible that these guys are with another company, I&#39;m not trying to state what I said as it&#39;s 100% fact that they were Craft, and if it came out that way then I apologize. </p>

<p>The two guys that have been pointed to as suspects on 4chan can be seen near the bottom middle, and the one without the hat is not wearing the backpack he was seen with in all of the other pictures.  Also, I&#39;m not sure what the link was but I saw on here earlier that the punisher symbol on the one fellow&#39;s hat is indicative of Seal Team Five and is often also used by Blackwater operatives.  Eek.</p>

<p>Edit: read, not scan, other comments.  Got the Craft thing.  Still, the dude doesn&#39;t have the backpack anymore...</p>

So confirming its used by blackwater is complete bogus because I guarantee that at least one squad per battalion uses this as their patch.</p>

There website <a href="http://www.craftintl.com">www.craftintl.com</a> tells you all tbe info you need to know.

Go to there website, look at the hat. It doesn&#39;t have anything on the left side of the skull logo, but in the picture it does.

    <div class="md"><p>Right because working internationally on security measures means its a PMC. You know these training groups also do security penetration testing at international and national sites. Thats not a PMC. Although it could be considered a security firm. I hqvent read the book but now that you mention it, I probably should. If you can, I wouldn&#39;t mind a link stating that craft is a PMC or has those capabilities. Btw I think these uniforms are closer to DHS than anything else that&#39;s been spouted off here</p>
