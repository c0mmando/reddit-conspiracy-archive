    <div class="md"><p>NY Post is reporting that there is a Saudi suspect in custody... but now Boston police are denying it...</p>

<p>I was just talking with a Muslim friend of mine... she said she thinks they are going to blame it on the Muslims, but I think they are going to blame it on constitutionalists, conspiracy theorists, theists, conservatives, gun owners, gold-bugs, preppers etc... they will blame it on one person who is all of these things (or maybe a group, but there will be one who will be the &#39;leader&#39;), and he will have a really catchy name... and it will be our nickname from now on because whenever you talk about the constitution, or gun rights, or conspiracy theories, or gold, or prepping - you will be called &quot;insert terrorist&#39;s name here&quot; and thus everyone will think you are crazy.</p>

<p>They are going to throw us to the lions.</p>

<p>This is my prediction... I hope I&#39;m wrong... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s so ridiculous. I&#39;ve been watching CNN and Fox News just to see what they are saying and the speculation has been from right wing nuts, to the Araian Brotherhood, to Muslim extremists . The main thing they all have in common is they are TERRORIST. They love to get that point across. Some other talking head was saying we need more police and should be moving toward a Police State. It could possibly be a terrorist attack but the fact that the Boston Globe tweeted 2 hours before the bomb going off that they were running drills is a little sketchy </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, but wait. it is a terrorist act no matter whether it is a false flag or independent parties. it is an attack on civilians with obstensibly political motives, whatever those may be. so if it was a terrorist attack then it was terrorists who did it. whether those terrorists are fbi/cia mossad/idf or tea-partyin muslims from jersey doesn&#39;t matter. it is accurate to say it is a terrorist attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to understand something. Because it might be a false flag, you assume that it is. Despite the fact that there is almost no information whatsoever about anything, just the mere assumption that it will be &#39;blamed&#39; on someone is enough to be convincing? I come at this willing to entertain the possibility that it is a false flag, but equally willing to believe that it is a person or persons with political motives acting of their own accord. Please do not get too offended, though I can already smell the huffiness. I am just trying to understand this approach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve been hearing a lot of talk lately about how terrorists are likely building homemade bombs because of information available on the internet.  I think it’s a mistake to solely blame the internet for people figuring this out.  When I was a kid me and many other kids figured out how to make homemade explosives on our own without books, instructions, adult help of any kind, and we did all this more than a decade before the internet existed.</p>

<p>I’m not going to give you step-by-step instructions on how to build a bomb, but I will explain progressively how we figured it out, and if we can figure it out, literally anyone can.  </p>

<p>When you’re screwing around with fireworks of any kind you get idea of how they work is they’re filled with a solid substance that burns very quickly inside a container.  If you take a fast burning substance, like black powder, and just put it in a pile and set on fire, all that happens is it burns very quickly.  If you put in inside a hard cardboard tube it causes hot escaping gas to come out the open end very quickly, creating a primitive rocket.  If you seal it up completely the gas pressure builds up until the container bursts open, creating an explosion.  That is the basic principle of a bomb.  Take anything that burns very rapidly, seal it inside a container, stick a fuse in to light and it goes pow.  Children figure this out on their own without help from strangers.  </p>

<p>When I was a kid we put M-80 firecrackers inside garbage cans and put the lid on to watch the lid blow off.  Then we sealed one inside various plastic containers just to watch them get blown apart.  We noticed the stronger the container, the bigger the pop you get in return.  But that had a limit, if the container was too strong it would smother the firecracker.  So you would use more firecrackers and stuff them inside the stronger container to get a bigger pop.</p>

<p>When I lived in a Canadian town Abbotsford on the west coast there were plenty of kids stuffing Chinese firecrackers inside PVC pipes just to make the whole thing blow up at once.  There isn’t much shrapnel from those things but I promise you the noise is as loud as any bomb you’ve ever heard.  This literally happened all the time and it has been going on forever, long before the internet was around.   </p>

<p>This bomb container that was detonated at Boston was a pot.  The builder used a pressure cooker because it’s a pot with huge clamps that seals the lid.  And it’s big so you could fill it with a considerable amount of black powder and shrapnel.  This could literally be slapped together in the time it takes to describe it.  I hate to say this but with the same amount of black powder that bomb maker will likely figure out how to make a much more powerful bomb by simply using something sturdier than a pot.  </p>
