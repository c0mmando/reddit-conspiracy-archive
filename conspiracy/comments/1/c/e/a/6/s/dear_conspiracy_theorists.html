<p>I have a simple question. Why do you have such a distrust of the government/establishment? I have never understood why you CT&#39;s are so anti-establishment. Do you see everything as a government plot? And how do you respond when proven wrong? Also, what do you think of people laughing at you (like I do) at <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>?</p>

<p>The government/establishment has not done anything to earn my trust.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you see everything as a government plot?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Government is run by humans and humans always have an agenda, including myself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And how do you respond when proven wrong?</p>

<p>Pick up and move on.  </p>

<p>If I wanted to be popular, I would think like the majority.  Your laughter makes me only pity the people, like yourself, who lost their imagination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me flip the question.  What has the government or the big corporations that run the government ever done to earn your trust?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s niave to assume that <em>all</em> conspiracy theories have the same validity.  Most people here probably get a good chuckle from posts like &quot;George bush is a lizard person&quot;.  Just because it&#39;s posted to this sub doesn&#39;t mean everybody believes it.  </p>

<p>To blindly dismiss all conspiracy theories is just as bad as blindly believing all conspiracies.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>invoking Occam&#39;s Razor here achieves next to nothing.  it&#39;s possible that it achieves the opposite.  the complexities of working government almost suggest that it&#39;s <em>more</em> likely for conspiracies to arise, just like they did in ancient Rome, or Victorian England, or... any other place with government.  so by Occam&#39;s Razor, the simplest explanation is that, historically, government breeds conspiracy by its own nature, hence the conspiracies.  The trouble is that the only thing that reveals them is time.  We don&#39;t know what the current conspiracies are.  Hence all the theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems to be what anyone that doesn&#39;t have an imagination throws down as a defense against a conspiracy theory. Making the fewest assumptions possible right? You assume the government is inherently good. I assume they are inherently bad. There is one assumption made on both accounts. Show me an argument that is worth debating instead of proposing another theory of believing in things.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU48jWXYyeA">Loose Change</a> I really started to question everything. My boyfriend recommended it, he lived in NY during 9/11 and he thinks it was a black operation, but doesn&#39;t believe most other conspiracies. I do not trust the government at all. I don&#39;t support anything they do, and I hate that they take so much money out of my paychecks. I don&#39;t really care when people laugh at me, but I personally like looking deeper into stories than what&#39;s reported on the mainstream media. It&#39;s empowering to see the world in a different way than the herd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but you&#39;d might be surprised about the amount of people who get their thoughts from major media sources. Take the Trayvon Martin case for example. Right away, the media put up pictures of him when he was 12 years old. This, and the phone call sparked anger. The media was quick to jump the gun. They told the story of this innocent black &quot;child&quot; who did nothing wrong. We still don&#39;t know the whole story. If that&#39;s not enough, the media usually doesn&#39;t follow upon these stories. I have seen very little about the case. This shows that they (Jewish Media) wants to instill anger amongst the blacks towards the whites. You may ask &quot;why&quot; and you&#39;ll probably write me off as a lunatic, which is fine, but they control 96% of the media. It is also believed that they have a major say in  politics. Some people think that the Jews are mad. Mad because throughout history, they have been oppressed. Now, they want to get back at the whites who kept them down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just have to ask- do you honestly not notice it when the commentators (O&#39;Reilly et al.) start talking about the leftist agenda? Every time Obama tries to get something done, they say it&#39;s the first step towards Communism or Marxism. Democrats have a global agenda, liberals have a global agenda, NAACP and GLAAD have hidden agendas, atheists are trying to kill religion, scientists are all part of a big scam, environmentalists are just trying to take money. &quot;First Step Discourse&quot; - the belief that seemingly innocuous events are actually leading towards sinister ends.</p>

<p>Do you not hear it, do you look past it or do you just not care? And I ask again: are you just here to bully us because we are easy targets?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty well established now (esp. with docs now coming out from FOIA requests and declassified CIA docs) that the US government is willing to experiment on its people. If one studies people in swarms, what they buy when, and what they feel and think when, the people can be controlled. When controlled, the people controlling gain.  Government agencies have access to any and all of your communications at this point.  Still.  I don&#39;t distrust the government completely.  I have roads and water and heat.  Police, firemen.  I know some of these people.  They aren&#39;t brainwashed, they&#39;re just doing their jobs.   I&#39;m not a maniac about it because the government is made up of people, and people are generally pretty wonky when it comes to handling situations, therefore government is going to be a little wonky- it wont always get things right.</p>

<p>What really freaks me out is people with money.  Lots and lots of money.  To me that is far more dangerous than Yog Sothoth living in the Pentagon communicating with interstellar lizards from the crystal dimension. *edit for clarity: when I say people with money I do not mean any specific race or culture, blood or creed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the etymology link. Being a conspiracy theorist means believing that groups of people are working together to attain secretive goals. Anyone who has ever talked about the liberal/conservative agenda, the Liberal/Conservative agenda, the gay/straight agenda, the atheist/religious agenda, the military agenda, the environmental agenda, etc. IS a conspiracy theorist. But you choose to pick on one specific group of people who have gathered on an open forum.</p>
