        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As many of you know Venezuela had it&#39;s presidential election yesterday. The party sitting in goverment right now won by only a very slim margin and as I have heard and seen via amateur videos, there were many attempts by the goverment sympathizers to sabotage the elections. The results were delayed for 2 hours for reasons unknown and even the opposition candidate Capriles Radonski, generally a very cheery and peaceful person who ACKNOWLEGED defeat last time is outraged. Right now  I only have a couple of pictures but I&#39;m trying to gather as much proof as possible. All this to show that even if the goverment DID have a real majority, they&#39;re not playing as clean as they say and everybody thinks</p>

<p>Here are the pictures</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not familiar with the procedures that are part of the protocol that is followed regarding when ballot boxes are transported/collected, so cannot tell you why.</p>

<p>You have the right to ask why this was done. However one of the comments says that the video was filmed on the 15th not the 14th. Another comment concurs with it mentioning the sound of people protesting (might have happened on the 14th but it&#39;s more likely to be of the 15th protests). Would it be not normal to transport the ballot boxes to safer places, especially if the security of the voting place is not guaranteed (or they actually need the voting place to return to its previous use as schools and so on)? As I told you, I&#39;m not familiar with the protocol, just advancing reasonable explanations for what is being seen.</p>

<p>Pictures &amp; videos without context and investigation are just what whoever posts them want it to be. Omission, misguidance or blatant lies are ways of provoking negative reactions. Do you not concur that at least yesterday morning &amp; afternoon (when this video seemed to have been uploaded) it would have been fairly easy to slip pictures of previous elections when referring to military taking the ballot boxes, but also having faked pictures of people caught with ballot boxes in their cars?</p>

<p>How difficult it is to fake one of those boxes? What hard evidence exists that leads anyone to conclude that those are legitimate boxes and pictures? Back in 2011 they faked a whole protest supposed to be taking place in Tripoli, Libya (<a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-libya-media-hoax-fabricated-scenes-of-jubilation-and-euphoria-on-green-square/26155">http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-libya-media-hoax-fabricated-scenes-of-jubilation-and-euphoria-on-green-square/26155</a> &amp; <a href="http://libyasos.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/fake-scenery-of-tripoli.html">http://libyasos.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/fake-scenery-of-tripoli.html</a> ) and we know that US institutions are backing Capriles, so how far fetched is that all this isn&#39;t being yet another fabrication to seed doubt and create chaos? It&#39;s their modus operandi.</p>

<p>This is why you should ask, certainly, but you should not take as truth everything that is shown to you without any hard evidence. No court will take into account those pictures by themselves nor should you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capriles is not centre-left. He can say what he wants, but NO ONE supported by several US institutions is centre-left. Especially after reading the Wikileaks Cables on Venezuela.</p>

<p>Just have a look at the coalition that supports him, have a look a its history, but not the one they write themselves in their site...</p>

<p>Also, apart from crime (which is highest in Capriles state actually), most social indicators have been rising in Venezuela, a lot faster than before (even throughout previous oil booms). Also this Government made it so that companies would pay the fair royalties for oil (just check the royalties foreign oil companies were paying to the State before and after Chavez and compare to those paid in countries like US &amp; Canada - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy_of_Venezuela#Development_of_energy_policies">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy_of_Venezuela#Development_of_energy_policies</a>) and just like Norway, made sure that a State owned company would explore oil and revert its profits towards social programmes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying anything done by this goverment has been bad, quite the contrary. But I lived there for 18 years and believe me, not everything looks and works as smooth as your fancy wikipedia charts show. In fact, let&#39;s start out that almost every single person working for the goverment is crooked as hell, they always blabber about how glorious there work has been while no one talks about all property and loads of money they are robbing. The economy has been left in a fragile state because of their policies which include giving our oil for free in exchange despite no being bad, are NOT a fair trade. We are running out not only of prime matter but also of basic domestic items of any kind because of state companies ineffectiveness to produce...you&#39;d be surprised how many items we have to import despite being able to produce them just because of that. Arms of the state that should be impartial, like the legal system and the army have been partialized which paves the way for a huge impunity. Apart of that the only reason crime is a lot higher in the state Where Capriles was governor is because the capital lies there, and it&#39;s a city of 8 million people aproximately. Also, the only reason this coalition exisits to support him is because the opposition realized they had to put differences aside and unite if they wanted to stand ANY chance to stand against the PSUV. Sure I won&#39;t deny you that some of them caused a lot of shit left some sectors of the population aside, in fact it&#39;s something that bothers me because part of this is their fault, but they also did some good things in their early years which helped to make this country one with the best conditions to live. This goverment might not be doing some things with bad intentions, but they are doing it wrong, and are bunch of liars</p>

<p>And yeah that video was from the 15th...because right after the results were given (Which were delayed, and given without proper protocol (the president just said then and walked away without showing the charts or the votes of the other cnadidates) one of the directors of the organ that manages the election requested each vote to be counted again manually, as far as i&#39;m concerned this CANNOT be done anywhere else where they were originally cast. But hey...what the hell they ended up not doing it anyways despite the people having a right to it, and proclaimed the president 4 days before it was scheduled for no apparent reason</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;almost every single person working for the goverment is crooked as hell&quot;</p>

<p>Right...</p>

<p>By the way, you are NOT running out of oil. Your current estimated reserves are actually above Saudi Arabia, which used to occupy the top stop until Venezuela took it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_proven_oil_reserves">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_proven_oil_reserves</a></p>

<p>Also the help Venezuela is giving to poorer countries is essential for the stability of the region and to stamp out old ghosts from the northern part of America. It&#39;s not a fair trade? Helping others never is and if they didn&#39;t do that and just traded oil in the markets, the price would go down, so that decision is not without advantages to Venezuela (economically, socially but also geo-politically)</p>

<p>Regarding crime, why doesn&#39;t Capriles accept the Policía Nacional Bolivariana and put a stop, like it happened in other states, to a police force which is largely seen as corrupt (with a lot of cases where they committed the crimes) and initiate a new way of social interaction based on trust and local policing? Police reform seems like an obvious thing to do in Venezuela given the current mess that having several police forces is and it shouldn&#39;t be up to the state Governors to accept it as they wish.</p>

<p>Corrupt people exist everywhere, but everything I&#39;ve read and watched leads me to believe that Capriles Presidency would be a return to a past where corruption was the heart, not a tumour, of the Government &amp; State.</p>

<p>Regarding to the elections, please provide links to the articles in the law that rule these events. It&#39;s not what we think that makes sense that is the law, the law is written and only that will tell you that they committed a crime or not. If the law doesn&#39;t contemplate these cases or leaves it to the criteria of someone, then fight for a more precise and better law. You&#39;ll have all my support on that.</p>

<p>P.S.: Enjoying this discussion, thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I know helping others is not really a way profiting in the end, but on the other hand, we are just giving away our resources for nothing and creating a huge debt that will take a long time to repay, even though the goverment likes to brague about how they paid our external debt. I never said we were running out of oil, but it is not the only thing we have. I am talking about other kinds of things, food for example, the goverment sells it at a cheap price, I&#39;m ok with that, but we have to import it which costs us money, we also subsides it, which also costs a lot. All this creates a huge debt that nobody knows how we are supposed to pay. </p>

<p>The policia nacional is pretty much everywhere know, still that hasn&#39;t really improved anything, police officers get paid really bad, even now, it is also a very dangerous job since a regular officer can&#39;t stand a chance against the weaponry of criminals. All this makes it more likely to put them in a position where they have to bend their oaths and duties just to stay alive.</p>

<p>Regarding corruption, it&#39;s not as easy as it you think, people learn from their mistakes and have in mind that times are different, so seeing Capriles in presindency as a return to the corruption of the old days is kind of erratic. That man has had great career and alway tried to make things as best as he could. He, in fact is pretty much the first leader of the opposition that has tried to send a message of unity among the population, basing his campaign on how good things can get if we change our direction and work all united for the best, and not only on how bad the goverment has been to some</p>

<p>I currently don&#39;t have any links in english that specify the laws, but, I know that one of the Chiefs of the CNE, the arm that is in charge of the election requested each vote to be counted manually. By doing this he is sticking to the laws, he knows when it is possible to do something like this and when not. And even so, what is the goverment putting at stake if they really legally won the elections ? They can accept a recount and prove their victory, but instead they are avoiding it without a decent excuse.</p>

<p>I also, seriously don&#39;t think Maduro is fit to be a president. I won&#39;t use his background as a bus driver as an argument because Lula Da Silva used to be a construction worker and fuck, he did a decent job with Brazil. But it&#39;s a whole different scenario. A person that manages a country and represents it internationally, shouldn&#39;t just call the opposition &#39;&#39;a bunch of faggots&#39;&#39; and say he will found a school for &#39;&#39;retarded&#39;&#39; children on national television. The other thing I cannot accept is the glorification of the state and it&#39;s figures up to the point that it becomes a cult of personality. People are not seeing Chavez as a President anymore, but more like some sort of hero or demigod and Maduro as his messiah .History has told us that doesn&#39;t lead anywhere good. </p>

<p>P.S. Same thing, it&#39;s nice to discuss with someone that has arguments to prove his/her point. Some people just label you without knowing why you think in a certain way.</p>

<p>I guess we have different experiences and different contexts. I also talk with people from Venezuela which do not work for the government but still support PSUV. You are right that people change, but I just can&#39;t see a genuine change (from his past views) in Capriles, sorry.</p>

<p>Hopefully everything will turn for the best for everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect that, I don&#39;t think that he will be able to do a lot of changes if he ends up winning, because honestly 6 years is a very short time to do so. But he insists in keeping all of the social programs and aids this goverment has given, which is great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there was corruption and vote rigging on both sides. One won out over the other. That&#39;s how elections go. You can&#39;t play the game then complain when you thought it was rigged the whole time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is actually the first time in many years I believe something was rigged in elections. There&#39;s little if any chance the opposition might have done that because of the lack of influence they have on each of the state&#39;s arms, including you guessed it, the electoral one. And even one party did win without fraud...why bother doing this ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know but if you rig an election it wouldn&#39;t have been that close unless both were doing it. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s like any other election in Latin America where death threats were made, and I&#39;m sure there were genuine votes. Everyone knows that yet continues to play by the same rules in the same system. If you choose to run for president in Latin America you either have the US helping or the state which the US hates manipulating it.</p>
