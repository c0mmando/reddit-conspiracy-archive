       Closing down these areas was irresponsible, and ineffective.  They pointed guns at civilians, arrested innocent people to aid in their investigation, and searched homes by exhibiting a threat of force.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of it did anything but serve to continue the erosion of civil rights in this country.  A citizen, not the police, found the suspect.   A citizen, being able to exit his home freely, outside of the lockdown found the suspect, and nothing bad happened to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: For everyone in this thread stating that no one was forced to exit their home at gunpoint here's some sad truth for you:

       I, too, found this humorous. Hundreds of friendly neighborhood police officers, armed for battle, scrambling around a quaint little Massachusetts town yelling "hut-hut-hut!" looking for a 19-year-old boy, and some dude peeks in a fishing boat: "Hey, guys. I found him." Goddamn, America.

       And then the high fives for extracting him.  Good job.  Bombing stopped?  No.  MIT officer saved? No.  Suspect in custody unharmed? No.  Suspect doesn't elude police? No.  High Five!  Job well done.  Boston strong.

       Please enlighten me as to how the bombing was supposed to be stopped. I find it funny how people are saying the US is a police state, no privacy, all that shit. When the only way this could have been prevented is if the US actually WAS a police state with no privacy. Had that been the case, the suspects two backpacks would have been searched, and the bombing prevented.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please, internet expert on all things terrorism and crime prevention, tell me. How do you stop two people from putting home made bombs in backpacks and blowing them up in a crowd of people? I'll be here waiting for your answer.

       What a load of bull. Here in Britain, we have a history of bomb attacks and it has never been like the over the top display in Boston. I can tell you how else you could have stopped the attack: By educating people to be vigilant about unattended luggage, to call someone when they see a lone bag sitting there. Trust people to look after themselves and not treat them like small kids in need of armed soldiers holding their hands. Go to London; no military like Police display but plenty of awareness by the people. Just try and leave a bag somewhere in London, try and see what will happen! After that I will tell you that this is the way and not tanks and rifles...

       To be fair, being blanketed with CCTV cameras minimizes the need for boots on the ground. If it helps you sleep at night to think that it's vigilance and not big brother watching your back then more power to you.

       His referring most likely to the IRA threat in the past, they didn't have many CCTV back then. The policy was "see an unattended package, report it to a police officer or X official". This still didn't prevent the bombings, but as the previous poster said there has never been such a GI Joe response like I've seen over in the USA.

       Also, what in the fuck is with police wearing camo? They're fucking police not soldiers! Also the "I've got a big gun" hanging off a jeep/Humvee? Some sort of big play club or some shit.

       In urban areas more so, but there's no federal national campaign to link them all and cover 100% of streets. Most are local city/towns getting into it for one reason or another. Or just shop owners who are sick of XYZ in front of their shop and cameras help protect their investments, especially for things like crimes in the middle of the night to prove to insurance companies what actually happened. At least that's why most of the businesses downtown have cameras, and for most they can't just email a link to the FBI and then they have everything. Most records are kept on tape, not always on tape players FBI agents carry in their trunks.

       I am not scoring childish points, I am merely comparing. Of course we are being watched too much here in the UK and I don't like that one bit. I only said that we never had tanks rolling through the street because of a couple of bombs. I know because we lived right in top of a shopping center when two went off in the 1990s [huge bombs they were, destroyed almost all store fronts and injured many people. We were not allowed downstairs until they had made sure it was safe and then it was back to normal. I even suffered from shell shock later that day. But talking about cameras, they are obsolete in a society that is alert and knows what is going on. I am saying this because mainly cameras will NOT deter any crimes, it will merely record the crime. Living, thinking, alert humans who care is all that is needed.

       Last I was in London, I did see military style police who carried MP5's. I was also constantly aware that everything I did while I was in the city was recorded by CCTV. There was no recent attack, that's just what London is like. We have a saying in the states about sacrificing liberty for safety and how well that goes. We sometimes forget the faces of our fathers, but at least we have the saying.

       Yes, despite everything I said above, the UK is also turning into a Police state. It's just that bombs are handled differently here. After 7/7 everyone went back to work the next day.

       They're not dressed in military gear, they're the TSG, territorial support group. They are  in use for government buildings and diplomatic security. You will only see them in London, around Westminster. They drive red vehicles and are based in Charing Cross police station.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally don't like them, they're always walking around with a swagger and think they're the dog bollocks. I always shake my head at them when they walk past in the street. I personally believe if the police want/need guns, it should not be displayed when walking to or from the location, i personally find it disturbing. They even go into the fucking supermarket with them on. I know that will sound odd to people who are surrounded by armed police as a norm, but to me it's creepy!

       I don't think the bags were left unattended for any great length of time.  It sounded to me like t was a drop em, get away and detonate situation to me.  Even if someone had called the authorities immediately, it is doubtful they would have arrived before detonation.

       Again, if I assume someone noticed the bag immediately, was able to find/notify an official immediately, and the official was nearby and started evacuating the area immediately, I still think it is doubtful they would have gotten people away on time.  I think the only way of preventing this one was a 100% bag check for anyone in the area which I think this forum would argue is an invasion of privacy/violation of rights.

       So any time someone sets a bag or backpack on the ground, you're supposed to alert the authorities? I am supposed to stop watching the Boston Marathon and pay attention to the 10,000 people in the crowd and if any one of them puts their bag down, even for a second, I am supposed to run over to a security guard/police officer and tell them to check it out. And if security was so perfect and awesome in Britain, you wouldn't have "a history of bomb attacks", would you?

       Are you deliberately not understanding? Use common sense and all will be fine. Of course you shouldn't call the police if someone puts their bag down. But if someone in front of you puts a bag down and leggs it...its up to you!

       Well as has been revealed the FBI already had records on these two guys and previously investigated one of them. Therefore they most certainly could have stopped this but they didn't. It also wouldn't have required a police state or an erosion of privacy to do so.

       How could they have stopped it? They were investigating them. That's it. Is the FBI supposed to follow these guys around, tap their phones, and track everything they buy, in hopes that they see receipts from the hardware store with a suspicious number of pressure cookers on them? Now THAT would be a violation of civil rights and privacy right there. They had done nothing wrong before the bombings, and were treated as such by the FBI and local law enforcement. There is a thread on the top of this subreddit about how despite the entire Watertown area being shut down, it was a citizen who found Suspect #2, not the police. So I guess it's ok to mock the police and FBI when they can't find someone hiding in a boat, but it's perfectly fine to turn around and suggest they could have stopped the bombing by pre-emptively arresting two innocent men who they had only investigated?

       Well for one if they had their name on file they could have released their names and saved the police officer from being killed and 2 completely unrelated people as initially being confirmed as the suspects on the run.  Not everyone may know them by the blurry pictures but I'm sure the people at dartmouth mass would have been able to identify one of their students by name (especially considering there are reports that he returned their after the bombing and was even working out in the gym)

       Isn't that what the Patriot Act and all the post-911 bullshit they have passed through the government was supposed to do?  Protect us from the bad guys?  Give us access to intel that would find people who may be thinking about doing something?  Yeah, didn't work out so well, did it.  But that was one hell of a martial law drill!

       Well, the FBI was already there and I've seen unexplained pictures of mercenaries in the crowd as well, along with the Boston PD and the Mass State Police all got together for a large public event outside. If it were me, I'd've brought bomb sniffing dogs.

       Well apparently the yard where the suspect was hiding was right outside of the "zone" where the search was taking place.  Of course that could be bullshit, but I thought I'd let you know since many from r/conspiracy missed or ignored that part of the debriefing.

       Even so, the authorities are the ones who designated the "zone." I'm sure they followed standard procedure and did everything within the scope of their training to execute the search efficiently, which just proves that there's way too much room for human error in these situations. No matter how much brute force and taxpayer money you funnel into the effort to maintain order, chaos will always bite you in the ass. Always.

       Yeah you're right.  We're only human, and it's known we do make mistakes.  Aside from actually finding him, they did do the rest of the work apprehending him.  I was afraid that he would end up dead, and we would never hear his side of the story.

       At the end of the day, it was a private citizen who found the suspect, not one of the 9,000 law enforcement personnel. I'm not a fan of trading freedom for security, whether I have something to hide or not.

       No, I'm not saying that's lawful or Constitutional. I'm saying

       Constitutional rights are are only protected when it's stuff like assuring the Westboro Baptist's their religious right to cause a public nuisance, stalk and harass gay people, and to muster up after a tragedy and gloat for the sole purpose of causing distress in emotionally vulnerable people and provoking others into a fight,
       <em>
        supersedes everyone else's right
       </em>
       to go about their business in public without being subjected to religious nuisance, stalking, harassment, bigotry, goading and gratuitous antagonism.

       No, constitutional rights should always be protected. It's just hard to stand up for your rights as a citizen when you have 10 men screaming to come in dressed in urban jungle camo with assault weapons pointed at your face.

       Are you implying that they would ever actually say that? Are you implying that one of us implied that? Your entire post, even considering is fallacious beyond measure, is so retarded and blindly submissive that quite frankly, it truly is sad. Not in a default-insult sort of way, I mean it's tragic that you are so void of nobility, constitutional principles, and general intellect.

       Newbies like to make strawman arguments.

       First, ascribe some poorly worded argument to your "opponents". Then easily show that the made-up statement is false. It helps this process to include words like "always" or "nothing".

       Can you read?, if they weren't in the streets looking for the kid, spotted  and shot him the night before, he wouldn't hide in a boat all day incapacitated. If they weren't all over that area, he could have left. They put him in the boat with nowhere else to go. If the extra force wasn't already in Watertown, the arrest could have been more dangerous or the suspect could have been killed. The FBI and BPD did all the detective legwork that chased him into the boat and all of the legal proceedings will be done by them. All of the justice in this scenario is being dolled out by the police, FBI, federal courts etc.

       and then he shot himself, through the throat while hiding in the boat.  and then preceded to climb out of the boat after attempting suicide.  All of this after alluding thousands of armed officers and trained dogs/helicopters AFTER a shootout, where he stole a police vehicle and ran his brother over...etc.  This child is obviously the antichrist, or the incredible hulk and should be immediately put to death.

       Don't poke holes in the logic of the narrative- people don't like it when they have to face cognitive dissonance. Nothing about the "boat adventure" makes any sense at all and yet so few are asking questions. All those cops must be really lousy shots. I want to see the gun (or battleship) he was supposedly using against them that warranted such an extensive shootout where the only injury was the one he supposedly inflicted on himself. Throw me some crumbs and show me some bullet holes in the boat.....idiots, all of you.

       Were all the searches illegal? Even the ones whose owners gave consent? Was anyone's home searched
       <em>
        against the owners' express wishes
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I see a lot of ranting about "rights" and "illegal searches", and very little in the shape of evidence to support this claim. You can't go from "police enter home" to immediately concluding that it was an
       <em>
        illegal search
       </em>
       that violated someone's
       <em>
        rights
       </em>
       . That just doesn't follow. Not unless you have decided before the facts that that's the case, and evidence one way or another simply doesn't matter...

       So, you are trying to say that, if anyone in the neighborhood said, "No," to the armed police going into their house, they would have politely complied with the house owners wishes?  Highly doubtful.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a case of, "since a few people started letting you in,  I assume that I have no choice
       <em>
        but
       </em>
       to let you in." Some people were fine and others were terrified. If you remember the police scanner, every single house in the closed off area was completely searched. "We have two houses left of the sweep," rings loud and clear into my ears.

       That's what people who were actually there told others, yes. The police knocked on the door and asked to search the premises. If the owners denied them access, they didn't do the search.
      </p>
      <p>
       There really wasn't any chance that people were actively
       <em>
        hiding
       </em>
       this guy, so there was no reason to go breaking down doors. It was more a case of "he might be hiding in your house without you knowing, like in a cellar or something, will you let us check?" rather than "we're going to search your home for the fugitive we think you're harboring".

       No, it really isn't. That's the confirmation bias conspiracy theory version, not what actually happened.

       I honestly didn't listen much to the scanners, but so what? Does what you quoted somehow prove that they didn't respect people's rights? It could just as easily mean "two houses we haven't checked at all", where "checked" means either searched through or asked but was denied access.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides all this, as has been pointed out several times now, the police
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       have some rights to search homes whether you gave them access or not, and it wouldn't be neither illegal nor disrespecting anyone's rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply put, your home is not a sovereign nation. You do have rights, but not endless, infinite rights. As far as I can tell, no one -
       <em>
        no one
       </em>
       - has been able to substantiate a single instance of the police explicitly searching a person's who
       <em>
        against their wishes
       </em>
       and without good cause. In other words, what would
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       be considered an illegal search.

       "The more intelligent"? Are you counting yourself among those? Because an intelligent person would not reply to a series of arguments with "you're patently wrong, lol" and act like that meant something.

       This.

       This is what I pointed out too. Someone said to me, "The cops finally found him," and I said "No. They did not. They missed him completely. The search failed actually." (The search that violated lots of people's rights, no less.)

       Hiding in a boat a quarter mile from where he was spotted initially. Which, apparently, was outside of their perimeter. Man things are strange about this ending game. Especially the fact that he "has a throat injury" and can't talk...

       He tried to kill himself by firing a gun into his mouth. A not at all uncommon thing to do for a person like him, and also not uncommon at all, his suicide attempt failed.

       Yes, I think the official FBI report reads "he just hopped out of the boat and skipped across the yard, singing "la-di-da" over and over again. At that point, a police office caught up to him, and shot him in the throat".

Hmmm...yesterday the Daily Mail reported a source as saying "The suspect waved his arms and officers made him lift up his shirt and lower his trousers to show he had no explosives strapped to his body."

       From the article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Yesterday, one police officer, who declined to be named, told me: ‘It looks like the guy had suffered wounds the night before. Tonight he fired first and officers on the scene returned fire.
        <strong>
         I heard on the radio that he’s been hit in the neck and leg.’
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Maybe there's just some confusion (in fact, I would expect there to be for a least a few days after). However, this is the Daily Mail, not the most reputable of sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose time will tell. My only point was that a suicide attempt is not at all unlikely and very probable to end up just that way, wounding him in the neck rather than killing him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, nowhere near enough evidence to suspect a "conspiracy".

       . Police don't like to release their video and audio recordings, particularly if they contradict official statements already made. Unidentified sources (like the ones used in the DailyMail article) are always a problem too. Also, as you say, confused reporting among the media in the early stages is typical. Everyone wants an exclusive, witnesses make misstatements. For example, I don't find the statement "heard it on the radio" very reassuring.

       I don't get it.  So you're the suspect, and you realize the gig is up.  Your brother is dead, the entire city is looking for you.  Caught alive, you are going to face your friends, relatives and everyone for killing children.  Then sent to death penalty or Maximum Security Rape Prison.  So you shoot yourself and oops, you freaking miss.  Why would you then turn yourself in instead of just taking another shot?  (And he supposedly had bullets left because he supposedly shot at the cops from the boat)

       It was the only response needed.  It demonstrates that you're reposting something you think "sounded smart" without having any idea what you're talking about.  There are other factual errors too.   If you followed the events as well as half the people in this subreddit did you would know how ridiculous of a post that is.

       Go on then. one minor error of them robbing a 7/11 which can be attributed simply to confused infomation. tell us what else, don't dodge my question. If they didn't plant the bombs who did, evidence required, if they didn't shoot the cop/attempt to plant bombs in the campus who did, again evidence required, if they didn't have a shoot out with the police who did and how did his brother die, again i know i have to keep saying this but evidence required.

       Why do you require that I provide evidence that they didn't plant the bombs when the police haven't provided evidence that they did?  If you want pictures of people with backpacks and then people without backpacks, I can provide that for you.

       Because they won't release their footage when it is crucial to the case! Why can't you guys understand this?! Always whining "the police won't provide the evidence." It will hinder the case. You aren't more important than the trial. Sorry to burst your ego.

       The media believed it at that point.  The police did not have any such information.  The media misunderstood the police scanner communication and drew conclusions based on an unrelated 7/11 robbery.

       No citizen with a weapon helped stop anything during the several days from the bombing to the apprehension of the remaining terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, people, in their zealous mob mentality, rather managed to tackle and accuse one innocent person right after the bombing, and destroy the life of another by spamming photos of him allegedly being the bomber (naturally, the media shares some of the blame there). Those are just the ones we know about.
      </p>
      <p>
       The citizen who
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       contribute did so safely and responsibly. He did not try to go in, guns blazing, he simply alerted the police who could then proceed to apprehend him without anyone else getting hurt (he shot himself in the mouth, as far as I know no one else fired at him).
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't know what it is you have to make yourself believe to have it be any other way. The police did what they were supposed to, and so did most everyone else. There was no bullying, there was no police state left after he was found (did the police all go back to their respective stations, leaving the neighborhood just as it was before, or did they not?), no one is taking away anyone's rights and no one is telling anyone they are incapable of defending themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, the government is
       <em>
        offering
       </em>
       to defend the people, so that
       <em>
        they won't have to
       </em>
       . People voluntarily join the police, national guard or military
       <em>
        to defend everyone else
       </em>
       . Voluntarily. They offer to stand in the line of fire and risk getting hurt or killed
       <em>
        so you won't have to
       </em>
       . What part of that is hard to understand?

       I'm not going to answer that, just like I'm not going to answer what my education background is. It doesn't matter. I asked you questions, you're the one refusing to answer them. I'm not driving any agenda, I'm not making statements. If I'm a corporate/government shill/spy/whatever, who would I be working for? What's my agenda? What would even be the point?

       I'm not going to answer any of your questions until you answer some of mine. Simple as that.

       I am only refusing to answer questions that have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the topic of discussion. That includes who I am, where I went to school, and who I work for. It's not relevant. Asking me those questions and pointing out that I won't answer them
       <em>
        is not
       </em>
       itself an answer to the questions I asked you before, several comments up.

       Scroll up. I'm not going to do your work for you. If you've avoided the questions for so long you can no longer remember what they are, that's on you, not me.

       And I already told you, that has nothing to do with anything. My answer wouldn't in any way impact the questions I've asked so far, nor the arguments I've made. Don't try to deflect by pretending I'm somehow more important or interesting than your answers.

       None of those questions have a significant impact on the discourse at hand. If I am going to debate someone, I want to know aforehand they are arguing in good faith - which means that they approach the debate openly and honestly and give consideration to opposing arguments and are maybe willing to learn something they didn't know before.

       How can you say you want to argue "openly" when you flat out stated that the opposing argument was wrong. We must have different definitions of open.

       Don't know, maybe he climbed. the tarp was ripped and there was blood on the tarp and boat. So obviously he was wounded from the first shootout where his brother was killed, because the owner of the boat reported seeing blood on the boat when he called the police. I guess he was scared enough and wounded he used everything he had left to get in that boat.

       I saw and heard it on the news the same night they arrested him. I had the news on the entire day and night. I remember them saying he went outside after the residents were permitted to go outside, he said the police had been there earlier to search, but after going outside when permitted he noticed things looked different, and he saw blood, so that's when he called the police back.

       Not only did the "authorities" not find the suspect, I am not even sure they were really trying. The whole thing from the release of the photos, to the "lockdown", to the "ending the lockdown" (though nothing had changed), to the flag-waving "patriots" at the end, seemed like nothing more than pure theater for the American sheeple.

       What kind os sick logic is this? If there wasn't a lock down do you think he would be in that boat? These guys, so it seems, had a cache of weapons and IED's, prepared to kill more people. If there wasn't a lock down, they could easily get away with it.

       When looking for a needle in a haystack it is nice if the hay can talk. Seriously I want to get 2-3 thousand of you guys together and see how fast you could find one guy under a tarp in a boat within about 100 square miles. Especially without knowing that person is under a tarp in a boat.

       It was because of the lockdown that the suspect went into a boat. So the lockdown was effective. They got the suspect!!!

      <p>
       You have to understand how their small brains and large egos work. EVERYTHING they do is good. EVERYTHING you do and is not according to their wishes is not good. Remember that!!! If you put yourself in that mindset, you will see how they function.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they didnt get the suspect, they would say the lockdown was effective because there was no other explosions or what not. They are kings. Kings are never wrong buddy.

       Yeah, you know WHY the police didn't find ? Because HE WAS A BLOCK OUTSIDE THEIR PERIMETER, YOU BOZO. He probably fled that far before the perimeter was firmly established. He likely stayed there the whole time because had he emerged, someone would have seen him and he would have been immediately apprehended.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, it's ENTIRELY PLAUSIBLE that law enforcement officials had an ULTERIOR MOTIVE when they made the announcement suspending the shelter-at-home order. They likely figured Tsarnaev would try to escape once people were out and about again; he just never had a chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, you people are ridiculous. Not everything is as evil as it looks. I'd bet dollars to donuts if a known suspected terrorist who'd attacked police with homemade explosives and shot an officer sitting in his cruiser was on the loose in your neighborhood, you'd being singing a different tune. You'd be THRILLED law enforcement was out doing their jobs and hunting him down.
      </p>
      <p>
       And hey, Boston law enforcement actually took someone in alive, which is more than the pinheads in California can say after the manhunt for Christopher Dorner. That resulted in two wounded, innocent Asian women and a crispy corpse when they torched the cabin he was in. By comparison, Boston-area law enforcement seem exceedingly competent.

      </p>
      <p>
       People are pissed because cops forced their ways into homes to search. Many people say it was necessary to use such a large force in order to be sure they caught him. They advised everyone to stay inside their homes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everyone had stayed in their homes, the massive 20-block lockdown/illegal search-fest would have failed as HE WASN'T IN AN AREA THEY WERE EVEN CONSIDERING!

       AND...they said more than once they were pretty sure he was inside that perimeter. They obviously had a good reason to set the boundaries of the perimeter the way they did. And the fact they were off by a mere block is a pretty good indicator that they had a grasp on what they were doing.

       I thought this was weird too. If you think about it it's pretty silly, yes, this kid is a terrorist, but why would the whole freaking swat and police be looking for him? I've watched COPS before and I feel like If it was anyone else you'd just see two fat cops and a dog chasing him. That's my two cents worth.

       surely the curfew/lock down was done to protect the populace from the police as opposed to the terrroist, i mean look at what happened when they went after dorner, was that the real reason for it?

       Absolutely.   Not just the money spent on that, but the money spent on securing the actual marathon.  Thousands of police officers, FBI, DHS, bomb sniffing dogs and others, and they were unable to stop people from dying.   But their failure just means they need more money to expand their size so it won't happen next time!

       This comment is fucking insulting. Weren't able to keep people from dying?Every person who made it to a hospital survived. The only people who died  died on the scene. The response was amazingly coordinated and effective.

       Yes, good on the EMTs and fire department.   I don't remember criticizing them. They did their jobs.  The police/FBI/DHS didn't do theirs. Thanks for your input.

       Could this be a test? A test about how people react when their civil liberties get violated by the government claiming to be for a good reason...? Not to bring religion into this, but it's beginning to sound apocalyptic.. Yikes..

       God you people. Look i'm open to conspiracies but this is just silly. THE GUY MAY HAVE HAD EXPLOSIVES AND DEFINITELY HAD A GUN. You want the public out looking for him in this scenario? I really don't understand the logic.

       Thank you for this. Great post! I could not agree more. Think about all the hundreds of thousands of dollars tax payers must pay and money the working class lost due to this ridiculous and ineffective act. So incredibly stupid.

       What is it with this subreddit and changing the subject? What does my education matter? Who cares? Is my argument sound, or is it not? Are you in fact as free to protect yourself today as you were last week, or are you not? None of those questions require knowing my level of education to answer.

       For very good reason though.  There was someone running around their neighborhood who was armed and no issue with killing innocent people.

       I don't get it.  So you're the suspect, and you realize the gig is up.  Your brother is dead, the entire city is looking for you.  Caught alive, you are going to face your friends, relatives and everyone for killing children.  Then sent to death penalty or Maximum Security Rape Prison.  So you shoot yourself and oops, you freaking miss.  Why would you then turn yourself in instead of just taking another shot?  (And he supposedly had bullets left because he supposedly shot at the cops from the boat)
