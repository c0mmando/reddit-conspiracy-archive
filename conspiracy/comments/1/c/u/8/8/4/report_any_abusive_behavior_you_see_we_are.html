       This has been an active battle for quite some time now. The best tool we have for fighting these trolls is the report button. We will see the comment and we can then explore a bit further and see if we are dealing with a habitual troll or just someone having a bad day. You guys have sent us tons of trolls already, but I still find stuff all the time that goes unreported. Please, if you see someone being a dick, report it so we can deal with this troll infestation. Thank you all. You make this place great!

       What do you count as abusive/trolling?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is posting evidence against someone's conspiracy considered trolling? For example, I posted some info in that Denver airport thread the other day that somewhat debunked a few claims.

       The problem is: when is absurd too absurd? I think believing in reptilians who rule the world is equally absurd as believing the Eastern Bunny exists. But I'm pretty sure some of you guys actually believe in reptilians.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say: let the people decide. Upvote/downvote takes care of most problems, right? It's a bit ironic to me that a subreddit that strives to unmask governments and the likes who try to take away personal freedom, actually announces that they'll ban anyone who "is being a dick", aka: doesn't agree with you. Dat freedom of expression.

       I just mean, at that level of credulity and "possibility" you can't distinguish obvious trolls from the very strange beliefs that a lot of people in here sincerely hold. There has to be some other mechanism for dealing with the issue.

       Great point.  I believe reptilians are allegory for powerful Jews though.  The people that think David Icke is actually talking about an alien race, pretending to be human, ruling the world are down right stupid and make us look bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could me saying this be considered trolling, or "having a bad day?".
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, unless someone expresses real racism, spams, or gets caught breaking the rules.  I see no need for a ban.  Id hate to see people getting banned here.

       Why do you think that David Icke is talking about Jews when he talks about reptiles? where is that coming from? you are obviously not that familiar with his work. This might help you understand

       how? let's define crazy:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Crazy, n; A mentally deranged person
       </p>
       <p>
        Deranged: v; To become insane
       </p>
       <p>
        Insane: adj; In a state of mind that prevents normal perception
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How is believing that there might be extraterrestrial life make somebode not sane? How does that make their perception skewed? Because there are a lot of sci-fi shows on this topic, I'm sure there are plenty of average people who believe aliens are real somewhere in the universe. Are they all literally mentally incapable of seeing the world properly?
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget the reptilians as shapeshifters for a minute and just look at your argument. Why does this make David crazy? He is clearly right about a LOT of other things. Let people believe what they want, if it comes to be false they have to deal with it. Not you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry this is not attacking you, it just makes me furious to keep seeing people use the word 'crazy' to describe this.

       it's crazy if you take it out of context... if you listen to his whole talk, it starts to make more sense (see my comment above)... just listen to him before rushing to judgement... I'm sure you are a cool person... but it is not cool to brand someone as a racist without even listening to what they have to say first.

       He is not even talking about aliens... he is talking about inter-dimensional beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quantum physicists have evidence that there are other dimensions... it is mainstream science now... so why would other dimensions not be populated? And do you know that we are not made of solid matter, but vibration (or frequency)... again, this is mainstream science... and it should change the way you look at the world if you give it some serious consideration.

       You've basically called him racist, you called him utterly crazy and you called him culty... remember this thread is about abusive behavior haha... 
seriously though, I think the point is that it is helpful to be objective and argue the points in question rather than just call people names, label them or make accusations.

       He's right about 95% of the time.  The alien thing is so far out there for such a seemingly rational guy.  It's like he is taking a dump in our cereal. Also being anti Zionist isn't the same thing as being a racist.  He is European though.  Don't they have laws over there that say u can't bad talk a jew?  Maybe he is just walking the line.

       I think you're fishing for something because you know the answer to that. This is not and has never been some childish board. You know what trolling/being a dick is.

       The abuse I'm seeing is not so much the name calling and the general foul language debate that arises on hot topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The abuse I'm seeing is the bizarre and  extreme upvoting of pure establishment and pro official story comments here lately. Some of these comments read as if they came from an FBI agent and they recieve upvotes, by the hundreds, almost immediatly. How does a mod deal with that?
      </p>
      <p>
       This presents a false impression on the post. It is also an attempt to make us alternate theory types look silly and our ideas socially unacceptable to the usual conformist mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are the troll posts that definately don't belong. We all know them as the ones that completely defy common sense and look as if they were planted in this sub just to look stupid.

       If you look at these top threads you'll generally see some responses which initially sit at 1-2 votes, then a new response will skyrocket 15-30+ above the others. it generally agreees with the top comment - to make it seem like more people believe with the top comment. since it has so many upvotes, dirveby users just browsing here will read it and shrug everything off. it's a technique which has been going on since I joined, and it is not easy to track or stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       keep a list of saved links for evidence towards accounts you think are dropping comments and gaming votes. save the entire comment threads. I will be doing this over the next 2-4 weeks and hopefully mods will just remove the comments after enough repeats when it continues to happen over and over.

       BTW: Why don't we get rid of those who would rather not debate the topic at hand with facts. Instead try to deviate, and attack those who disagree.

       Yeah, but banning posts where people literally just say:

      <p>
       "You fucking idiot." and nothing else, doesn't change the course of discussion in any way.

       you're telling me you honestly believe that mods will never be tempted to ban someone they disagree with more than someone they agree with? because that alone is enough to assure that people WILL end up being banned for their opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       and that's the problem with censorship- we'll never know exactly why people get silenced. the censors win and we all just accept it.

       You'll notice that a lot of times you see people make a thread about how a mod banned them because "they had a different opinion" it's usually quite a different story once the actual post is shown.

       As I stated before, this is in place to ban trolling/abuse that doesn't exist (it has actually been one of the main rules in this sub in the two years I've lurked here) and is just being mentioned that it's actually being enforced.

       yep, and putting psychopaths in prison camps doesn't make society less pleasant. but the act of building and filling prison camps ALWAYS sucks up innocent people and those who question the status quo.

       I recall reading a thread in which you banned someone from this subreddit before they'd even posted to it. So you having this "up/downvotes don't work" philosophy is unsurprising. People with power always think their possession of it is for the common good. And people with power always want more of it.

       I never understood why some people show up to the conspiracy sub just to call everyone in here crazy. This is a place to debate and display information. Looking forward to the new spring cleaning.

       Wait, so if conspiracy theorists insult non-conspiracy theorists that OK but vice-versa that's a ban.

       Just for clarification:
      </p>
      <p>
       If I repeatedly call a user, or several users, things like "idiot", "retard" or "nutjob", that's considered trolling and/or personal attack, which is unacceptable.

       If I repeatedly call a user, or several users, things like "shill", "disinfo agent" or "sheep", is it considered the same as above?

       Look, I try to be objective and open-minded, and believe that 9/11, Aurora, Sandy Hook, and the Boston Marathon were false flags. But this guy claiming to have befriended someone in the 13 families of the Illuminati is a bit of a stretch for me with very little evidence. It appears to me to be conspiratard rope-a-dope.

       It is basically the Israeli card, but on another level.

       Ie: Whenever something major happens, you have a lot of mouth pieces trying to blame the Israelis or Mossad.

       And, in this case, whenever there is genuine subject to discuss, some idiot will come waltzing along and bring up the ridiculous catchall term "Illuminati" and ruin the conversation.

       What constitutes a worthy conspiracy? For instance if someone posts about lizard people they get flamed, but in turn if you post about Syria or something , it's considered a conspiracy? Is this not a sub for ALL conspiracies , not just political ones?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we need a new sub for activism , or government distrust , so were not all labeled under the "nut job" category by our peers, and we can be taken seriously

       I'm on board with that, there's been a lot more instances, recently, of going from talk to debate to name-calling all within the span of, say, three posts or so. Not asking for everyone to hold hands and be all 'kum-bay-ya' or anything, just a little more civil would be excellent.

       Like you said, Reddit's voting system does not work. And that's for the same reasons democracy does not work. Only a benevolent dictator, a monarch, can do the job right.

        Well, well, well. Aren't you a nazi piece of shit. I'll save you the trouble you faggot fuck, enjoy your fiefdom of pansies and supplicants. People like you are pathetic, life isn't nice, it isn't pleasant. You are seriously one of the worst mods on this entire website, which is saying quite a lot. Die in a fire, cunt.
