       Also. Our first amendment. And the fact the people are questioning federal government. Which was encouraged by our founding fathers. Anyone on this thread "debunking" should go their repested thread for that. I have been following this on msm, and any other source, including this thread. I have been taking notes, with times. I haven't fully found out how to use reddit just yet, but I'm letting 
ANYONE know..I was watching CNN literally before, and as this story broke. I've have a complex amount of research, with notes on EVERY story, every theory, and I'm going to compile all of this, chronologically, with the times, and source. A lot of the different theories and odd occurrences, from every means I've been watching. I notice, a lot of things that are of upmost importance are getting lost. I'm going to make sure none of this is forgotten or lost in the wake of new evidence, and or threads.

       Not a psyop. Average 23 year old citizen, with a peaking interest in world affairs and politics. My hometown, Richmond,va had a marine vet illegally detained for patriotic posts on his fb, his name is Brandon J Raub, look up his story. I'm still, as I write this, compiling the new evidence that is coming in. Particularly the boat information. I have spent the majority of my free time, researching not just this conspiracy but others. Not a shill, not a troll. I do not need to be educated on the nwo, or any others as I've been a truther for close to ten years. I actually called Alex Jones and tipped him off on the guy, standing in the doorway with what appears to be an earpiece. That story was reported on their site, no more than ten minutes after my call. Just because I have not posted, nor commented does not mean I have not been following. I am currently unemployed, and have absolutely nothing to do than to devote efforts to this work.I also apologize for any incorrect grammar, it bugs me, so it must bug you.I would like to provide you with some more information to prove I am not a tool of the fed:

       ok its like this, just play along...me and you, we run the largest scam on the planet, it called money as debt, we have inserted ourselves behind the government and control it by controlling currency creation....the problem is that our scam has a time frame....like a time bomb, we can only run it for so long until a couple of things happen....our scam relies on escalating debt based on the money we create....as it is based in debt the eventual hyper inflation of the currency is bound to happen, as well as this, eventually the suckers we are bilking will start to find out and then worse yet, we've squeezed them so hard they don't have much left to give, see austerity....now we don't have a lot of options....we have placed the decoy and "shield" "government" in front of us, it has military, which we control {for now} but the end game option for "government" beside being the vehicle for borrowing and legitimizing the scam....government is the thing the natives go after when they get restless....we can use government for awhile to buy us some time....but right about now it's best we burn this fucker down so we can escape in the middle of the night, so we can set up shop down the road....if we stick around, the natives will get us....So....we need to get this show on the road....what if we pull a false flag that is a flag within a flag....we do one so obvious that we get caught on purpose, that way the natives will get real pissed and start to "go after government"....and well based on what we've seen, there are some boys with toys who would love to play "medal of honor, streets of america"....this is a false flag that was done poorly in order to be obvious....to get you pissed, to get you to attack....they are daring you to knock the battery of their shoulder
