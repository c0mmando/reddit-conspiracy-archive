       I only just joined this sub, and I'm very surprised by how many users there are here who are "anti-conspiracy". I welcome discussion and opposing views keep things in check, allowing progression based on sense... But I don't understand the amount of time people spend here just to everyone that they are crazy or plain wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely if you're not interested in conspiracies, then this isn't the sub for you...? Isn't the very point of subs that you can pick and choose the stuff you want to see and have an interest in. Seems like a lot of time is spent by users here with the sole purpose of being unwaveringly negative. I don't understand why people would come here and read a load of stuff that they consider complete bullshit. What a waste of time!

       Absolutely agree. There are some conspiracy topics which I don't find persuasive, so I ignore those threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does my head in that some people deliberately involve themselves in a discussion that doesn't interest them, just to shit on everyone. It's unbelievably immature.

       -The “terrorist” was young, had style, drove a nice car, had a great looking girlfriend, liked America… and was doing what he loved. All that he gave up … to kill random Americans… and get his younger brother killed… for WHAT reason?
      </p>
      <p>
       Response .... was "Question: In the echo chamber of your tiny head, does any one of those voices ever say "Maybe you really are the crazy one?"

      <p>
       Listen to that voice."

       JIDF recently made a public post announcing they were going to attack this sub, so maybe that's part of what we are seeing.

       don't worry, I'm a jew and I'll protect you from the evil rothschild zionist...those who love to enslave humanity with their debt based money....I do however use "idiot" and "dumbass" quite a bit....most people have low iq's, and particularly low "crime iq's" ....I find it best to make people feel as stupid as they are in order to use "group think" phychology against them....when dealing with people who don't understand, generally they are cult victims who need to snap out of it....to make fun of them is a good way to do it.....and if they are shills they back into a corner very quickly, basically it is hard to defend debt slavery and the "unfreedom" of others....if we are doctors, we can't have an intelligent conversation with someone who does not know how to use a band-aid
