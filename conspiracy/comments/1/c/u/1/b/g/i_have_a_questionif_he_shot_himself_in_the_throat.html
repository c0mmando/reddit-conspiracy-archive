<p>Did he shoot himself AFTER he surrendered? </p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-boston-bombings-20130421,0,2725026,full.story">Cursing in the Ambulance</a>?</p>

<p>&quot;The neck wound apparently did not initially silence Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, who was swearing profusely in the ambulance ride after his final confrontation with the FBI, according to a source familiar with the case.&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT:  If you&#39;re trying to commit suicide, and shot himself in the throat, why did he stop trying?  Must have ran out of bullets.</p>

<p>FINAL EDIT: I think we have started to uncover some explanations:</p>

<p>A) Even though it was reported that there was indeed a 25 minute negotiation, according to CNN, he did not speak during it. Still looking for a source so this isn&#39;t confirmed yet. Please post it if you find one.</p>

<p>B) It was reported in the L.A. Times (see link in text) that he was &quot;swearing profusely&quot; in the ambulance ride.</p>

<p>C) It&#39;s still possible he was able to speak up until they started working on his neck (because he suffered a wound, self inflicted or otherwise), and he won&#39;t be able to speak until it&#39;s healed up.</p>

<p>Sounds pretty reasonable to me.  Thoughts?</p>

<p>&quot;The neck wound apparently did not initially silence Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, who was swearing profusely in the ambulance ride after his final confrontation with the FBI, according to a source familiar with the case. The Justice Department remained quiet Saturday on whether officials had been able to question Tsarnaev, or whether they would attempt to do so before he consults an attorney.&quot;</p>

Maybe he could still speak at the hospital, but he had some damage, and because of the surgery, he can&#39;t speak..that would be logical.</p>

<p>A) Even though it was reported that there was indeed a 25 minute negotiation, according to CNN, he did not speak during it.  Still looking for a source so this isn&#39;t confirmed yet.</p>

<p>B) It was reported in the L.A. Times (see link in text) that he was &quot;swearing profusely&quot; in the ambulance ride. </p>

<p>C) It&#39;s still possible I suppose that he was able to speak, but indeed had suffered a neck wound (self inflicted or otherwise), but he was still able to talk up until they started working on his neck.  He probably wouldn&#39;t be able to speak while he is recovering.</p>

<p>Does that solve it?  Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yup.  I work in news and our reporters said that he was not responding with requests to give himself up willingly...  I guess that&#39;s the negotiations?   They were just asking him and trying to convince him to surrender.  He never replied.</p>

He supposedly shot himself while he was in the boat...that&#39;s what the MSM is telling us. How does one climb out of a boat like that after sustaining a bullet through the throat with no blood anywhere? And here, <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bomber-down.jpg">http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bomber-down.jpg</a>
you can see that he has blood on his face from what has to be the throat wound. He is also being sedated in this photo. </p>

<p>It&#39;s called fucking it up. </p>

<p>Put your finger in your mouth and pretend it&#39;s a barrel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. Putting a gun in your mouth is a recipe for a failed suicide attempt, especially under high-stress situations. </p>

<p>Although, if he shot himself straight through the back of his mouth, he&#39;d have hit his spine, and he&#39;d have a few more issues than not being able to talk. Obviously there are many other ways in which he could fuck it up, but the bullet going &quot;out the back of your neck&quot; would cause a shit-load of damage (which is a technical term, i assure you).</p>

<p>Edit: It&#39;s also likely he sustained injury from the stun grenade(s?) that went off at such close range in an enclosed space. Maybe they&#39;re just trying to cover up that they may have unintentionally rendered him unable to talk? Not sure, just throwing ideas out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hear is the context:</p>

<p>The neck wound apparently <strong>did not initially silence Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</strong>, 19, who was <strong>swearing profusely</strong> in the ambulance ride after his final confrontation with the FBI, according to a source familiar with the case. The Justice Department remained quiet Saturday on whether officials had been able to question Tsarnaev, or whether they would attempt to do so before he consults an attorney.</p>

<p>Here is the LA Times full article:
<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/21/nation/la-na-boston-bombings-20130421">http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/21/nation/la-na-boston-bombings-20130421</a></p>

<p>According to them, this is no typo, and sweating does not work in this context.</p>
