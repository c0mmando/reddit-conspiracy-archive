       That picture does not show anything that relates them to Craft. The single dude wearing the Craft hat is pictured from a different angle to the other pics, but that's it. It's the same dude.

      <p>
       Would you like to buy the hat? It's available for the low price of $22.

       So who are they then?  The grey haired guy.  If  that link isn't bullshit it should be easy to show who it is?   Otherwise 100% debunked.   It was never even bunked in the first place.

       Why would Craft International be involved in some turboconspiracy to set and detonate these bombs or whatever in an extremely high density camera area, and then have a hat with the company logo on it? Why doesn't a single other person have the logo? Why do they all congregate next to a vehicle that is specifically used by Civil Support Teams? Why are they all wearing standard issue US Army windbreakers?
      </p>
      <p>
       They are National Guardsmen. The picture of the members of the 1st Civil Support Team used in the linked post is over a year old which is more than enough time for new members and/or transfers to join, and since it was at a professional development seminar it is not unreasonable to assume that not all of the members went. Civil Support Teams can have like 20+ dudes.

       A member of the 1st Civil Support Team that either did not attend the conference in which the picture with names about a year ago, or someone who was added to the unit in said time period. There are 16 Guardsmen in the member pic. Support Teams can have at least 22.

       What about my response is not true? I don't know the name of the back of a head of hair.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was the picture used to point out who the Guardsmen were as individuals taken almost one year ago? Yes, I've helpfully posted the article in which it is used for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can Civil Support Teams include more than 16 members, which is the number depicted in the photo used for identification? Yes, I've helpfully provided a source that states they consist of 22 members. For shits and giggles, here is an additional source which is a direct quote from page 10 of the National Guard regulations that says they consist of 22 members:
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lRai7iT.png">

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible that the mysterious gray haired man is one of the 7 members not present in the photo? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was not a member at the time of the photo, is it possible that he transferred and was accepted to the unit in the ~year of time that has passed since the photo was taken? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it plausible and reasonable to assume that the gray haired man meets one of those two qualifiers? Yes.

       If they were CST, then why aren't they wearing their CST jackets?  Why no identification, except a hat with a CRAFT logo?

       Come on.  Think I'm new at this?  There are photos of other guys with identifying CST jackets. sure.. but who is this grey haired guy, and where is his backpack gone that he was carrying shortly before the bomb in the same location?

       Not going to type it out again, but here are related images and articles of other CST scenarios: edit: decided to type it out again anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       They
       <strong>
        are
       </strong>
       wearing their "CST" jackets. They were issued fleece and/or gore-tex or North Face jackets. I wore very similar, if not the same, black pull-over and zip-up jackets all the time when I was in the gulf, or when I was training stateside. They go to events dressed like this all the time. It was just another casual day for them.
       <a href="http://usarmy.vo.llnwd.net/e2/c/images/2013/01/29/280064/original.jpg">
        Why aren't any of these guys labeled with "CST"?
       </a>
       Or, why doesn't
       <a href="http://www.idaho.ang.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/web/110108-F-1439V-029.JPG">
        this guy
       </a>
       have a tac-vest on with big, bold CST letters?
       <a href="http://static.prisonplanet.com/images/210413CST1.jpg">
        Even some of the guys here
       </a>
       still aren't labeled as CST after they put their vests on, and look! Some of them are wearing polos. No, fucking conspiracy; it's just a big mix of what they wear. I boarded vessels all the time without "NAVY" or "USA" blown all over my back, and my outfit was changing constantly depending on the weather, or temperature, or how rough the river was, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what about the National Guard guys in the camo? Why didn't they have National Guard in big white letters written on them? Because they're in a typical military uniform or garb. And the CST guys? Because they are also in typical military uniform or garb.
       <strong>
        YOU
       </strong>
       and many
       <strong>
        others
       </strong>
       here simply do not know what military people dress in outside of camouflage and the more formal stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Craft hat? Yeah, I used to wear a Blackwater hat all the time. I went through a few training programs there (Blackwater) myself. Breacher training was especially fun; I got to cut through metal with quickie saw and shoot down doors with shotguns all day long, but the fact that I was wearing a hat that I bought in the gift shop of said facility, doesn't mean I have any other affiliation with them, other than having the opportunity to train there a few times. You can buy that same hat right now if you wanted to. Online no less. I still wear a Pipehitters Union hat to this day. Doesn't mean I'm a hired security contractor. So, why would one of those CST guys be wearing one? Probably because those CST guys have conducted training at Craft or one of them just happens to be a fan of their apparel. These training facilities provide training for police officers, foreign military, foreign law enforcement, etc. Hell, Oakley supplies all sorts of boots and protective eyewear to the military, but nobody is calling Oakley out on their possible involvement because their apparel was worn by someone supposedly conducting some shady shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       People here are latching onto this Craft business because they hardly know anything about what these private contractors do, outside of the bad shit that's been surrounding them in the media, and they don't know other obvious military clothing when they see it.

       No, I think you completely dismiss anything that doesn't support your ideas, but openly welcome any conjecture regardless of whether it has any useful information associated with it.

       Dismiss?  Like you dismiss the point about the identity of the grey haired man, and what happened to his backpack?  why was he at the scene right before exactly where it would have been placed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't journalists asking these questions?  No mention of these guys at all, but everyone esle with a backpack gets an ID, and in some cases an execution

       Oh, yeah I forgot to address that. We see a grey-haired guy dressed in civilian clothes and hanging out next to the CST guys. What is very likely, to me, is that he's probably one of the higher ranking dudes, like a SSgt. and just wanted to go casual, but really, It's just a dude that was with the CST guys. Doesn't tell us anything. He could be part of the marathon committee, and working with the security.
      </p>
      <p>
       Journalists aren't asking these questions because they probably aren't conducting witch hunts based images on propositions from internet communities. Any investigative journalist could probably get an interview with or at least some info from this particular NG division.
       <a href="http://states.ng.mil/sites/MA/News/PublishingImages/2012/04/120425_CST.jpg">
        Here's a picture
       </a>
       that's shows at least a couple of the guys that were part of the CST team and there.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't know what you mean by "everyone else with a backpack gets an ID," because authorities very specifically labeled only two people since the beginning. It was here, on Reddit, that everyone with a backpack was being singled out.

       Not in the slightest. He's wearing boxing shoes, albeit with his pants bloused (tucked in), regular casual pants that happen to be tan/khaki, a black jacket that doesn't really look like any military issue I've seen, a hoodie under that and a v-neck.

       Nothing about his attire is similar aside from color scheme.

       Well, if he blew up a bomb in a crowd of people, he probably was very militant, and on a mission.

       They looked much like his boxing shoes btw, and that white v-neck was super tactical.

       What about my response is not true? I don't know the name of the back of a head of hair.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was the picture used to point out who the Guardsmen were as individuals taken almost one year ago? Yes, I've helpfully posted the article in which it is used for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can Civil Support Teams include more than 16 members, which is the number depicted in the photo used for identification? Yes, I've helpfully provided a source that states they consist of 22 members. For shits and giggles, here is an additional source which is a direct quote from page 10 of the National Guard regulations that says they consist of 22 members:
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lRai7iT.png">

       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible that the mysterious gray haired man is one of the 7 members not present in the photo? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was not a member at the time of the photo, is it possible that he transferred and was accepted to the unit in the ~year of time that has passed since the photo was taken? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it plausible and reasonable to assume that the gray haired man meets one of those two qualifiers? Yes.
