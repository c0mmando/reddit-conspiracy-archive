       If the rules don't matter when under certain circumstances, why are there rules at all?  And, if these house searches were against the 4th amendment, aren't all these LEO's guilty of breaking their oath to the constitution?

       Apparently not all houses were searched. I don't know how many were.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police are allowed to knock on the door, announce their presence, and ask basic questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       There might still be some individuals who had their rights violated. I don't know. We'll have to wait and see what comes out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wonder about the constitutionality of shutting down a city to find the other suspect. Of course, then the argument comes "well we were worried he was going to keep blowing shit up" Then it goes to questions of evidence that made them think this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess we'll see what information comes out. I'm not holding my breath because society so far seems to have wholy embraced everything the cops did. I'm not saying I agree, that's just my prediction for how it'll play out.

       Sure, and I have no problem with them doing those things (ie knocking, asking questions), but if I didn't want them to come in, I would expect them to respect my wishes unless they could produce a warrant in which case they would be justified under law to come in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter if
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       houses were searched. If even one house was searched without following the explicit set of circumstances that would allow for the 4th amendment to be circumvented, that would be a violation of these LEOs'  oath to the constitution and would technically be an arrest-able offense.

       They didn't have a warrant for however many houses they broke into did they?

       Which is fine, that wouldn't be a violation. But what if someone said no? Or what if they went in there without expressed condition and forcibily took you out,

       I totally agree. I dont know the context either though. If it was just random searching I have a real issue with it. If they were trold we just saw a guy that looks like bomber #2 run in there then I am conflicted.

       I think we should always err on the side of the constitution for sure though. Once we let authority have an inch they will take it to infinity
