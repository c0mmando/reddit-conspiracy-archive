<p>If the rules don&#39;t matter when under certain circumstances, why are there rules at all?  And, if these house searches were against the 4th amendment, aren&#39;t all these LEO&#39;s guilty of breaking their oath to the constitution?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently not all houses were searched. I don&#39;t know how many were.</p>

<p>The police are allowed to knock on the door, announce their presence, and ask basic questions. </p>

<p>There might still be some individuals who had their rights violated. I don&#39;t know. We&#39;ll have to wait and see what comes out.</p>

<p>I also wonder about the constitutionality of shutting down a city to find the other suspect. Of course, then the argument comes &quot;well we were worried he was going to keep blowing shit up&quot; Then it goes to questions of evidence that made them think this. </p>

<p>I guess we&#39;ll see what information comes out. I&#39;m not holding my breath because society so far seems to have wholy embraced everything the cops did. I&#39;m not saying I agree, that&#39;s just my prediction for how it&#39;ll play out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, and I have no problem with them doing those things (ie knocking, asking questions), but if I didn&#39;t want them to come in, I would expect them to respect my wishes unless they could produce a warrant in which case they would be justified under law to come in. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if <em>all</em> houses were searched. If even one house was searched without following the explicit set of circumstances that would allow for the 4th amendment to be circumvented, that would be a violation of these LEOs&#39;  oath to the constitution and would technically be an arrest-able offense. </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t have a warrant for however many houses they broke into did they?</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;m not even sure what you&#39;re trying to say because you just said one word. Are you agreeing or disagreeing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which is fine, that wouldn&#39;t be a violation. But what if someone said no?

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree. I dont know the context either though. If it was just random searching I have a real issue with it. If they were trold we just saw a guy that looks like bomber #2 run in there then I am conflicted.</p>

<p>I think we should always err on the side of the constitution for sure though. Once we let authority have an inch they will take it to infinity</p>
