    <div class="md"><p>Do you find it suspicious that most of reddit (a relatively far left site overall) strongly support ubiquitous guns but the media insists that 90%+ of the public wants more gun control?</p>

<p>I personally estimate 9/11 truthers at around 70% of the population, where polls range from 15%-50% or so.  What do you think the real level of gun control support is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit isn&#39;t just left-leaning, it&#39;s popular with a specific demographic of 16-31 year olds who tend to be economically populist and socially libertarian.  A lot of older Democrats tend to be much more socially authoritarian when it comes to safety and security.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the inconsistency comes from the Democratic shift.  </p>

<p>Like when the Republican party, 25 - 30 odd years ago, started leaning further and further away from what a big chuck of the <em>actual Republican people</em> believed in/supported.  Instead, politicians and journalists told everyone what the &quot;people&quot; overwhelmingly &quot;wanted&quot;, which was generally crap because people are dicks.  Doubly so when they get to do all the yammering.  </p>

<p>A lot of the self-identified Republicans over the age of 30 are side eying their politicians and wondering what happened.  Pundits are, too, judging by all the WTFing after this past election.  Newer ones seem to going balls to the wall retard over the crazy that gave us a serious Presidential candidate who publicly claimed some shitty weather was divine punishment because: gays.</p>

<p>So as the Democratic leans ... well, you could argue a few ways, Democrats themselves are standing back and saying, &quot;Hey now.  Stop that.&quot;  Especially the younger ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you. Personally I would prefer a world without any sort of weapons, but that is an impossibly Utopian dream. Where there is something someone can pick up and throw/swing there will be weapons - and when these weapons favor only the strong, the weak will suffer.</p>

<p>I do not own a gun, will not purchase a gun, and believe that I am safer without one - only because I know how dangerous I (or anyone who cannot be comfortable with guns) am with a gun (I was raised with them and &quot;force taught&quot; to shoot, but never became comfortable personally).</p>

<p>However, no one is proposing that we do something about guns. They are proposing that we do something about a citizen&#39;s right to purchase/own guns. That is not a solution to the gun violence issue. While I think that some of the proposals have been insane (arm teachers, for example) any law that would make the citizenry unable to defend their personal liberty from their government is the wrong law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I feel ya.  After Bush, I was a HUGE cheerleader for Obama, cause I was just so sick and tired of the wars, the police state, the Patriot Act, Gitmo, etc.  I put all my hopes and dreams into &quot;Change&quot; that never came.  Instead I got Drones, Libya, Syria, renewed Patriot Act, NDAA, etc.</p>

<p>Once I found out that Obama&#39;s cabinet was stuffed full of former Goldman Sachs employees, I pretty much gave up on the idea that anything was ever really going to change.</p>

<p>Democrat or Republican, the more that things change, the more they stay the same.  I hate the fact that I either have to play for the Red team or the Blue team, were my beliefs are separated into neat little packages.  If I&#39;m a Democrat, I have to hate gun loving, right-wing, war loving Republicans and ALL their ideals, and If I&#39;m a Republican I have to despise those evil, left-leaning, communist Democrats.</p>

<p>Basically, I have to be against HALF the country.  This divide and conquer mentality finally woke me up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes no sense. People want to get rid of the guns, because they are a danger to society. Yet when a real &quot;danger to society&quot; such as the Boston bomber comes along, we have an army come and search our homes to &quot;keep us safe&quot;. Correct me I&#39;m wrong but if everyone owned a gun wouldn&#39;t that keep us and everyone else safer from these so called threats? And thus no need for outside sources that we are suppose to trust to protect us? Why not take out the middle man? </p>

<p>Oh wait that would make us too empowered as a civilization. I feel like as a group of people we are treated as children. Like &quot;no you can&#39;t play with those guns, you&#39;ll get hurt, just let the adults take care of you&quot;.</p>
