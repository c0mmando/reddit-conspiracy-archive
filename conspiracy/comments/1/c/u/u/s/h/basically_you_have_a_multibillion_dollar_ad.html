       Do you find it suspicious that most of reddit (a relatively far left site overall) strongly support ubiquitous guns but the media insists that 90%+ of the public wants more gun control?
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally estimate 9/11 truthers at around 70% of the population, where polls range from 15%-50% or so.  What do you think the real level of gun control support is?

       I argue that far less than 70% of the population believe anything different than what the media perpetuates regarding 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       To believe that 70% think differently is to believe that 70% of our population is capable of exercising critical thought.

       Reddit isn't just left-leaning, it's popular with a specific demographic of 16-31 year olds who tend to be economically populist and socially libertarian.  A lot of older Democrats tend to be much more socially authoritarian when it comes to safety and security.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also another 35% of that generation that is economically right wing, socially conservative, authoritarian about security issues:  They just don't post here much.

       The general userbase of Reddit is representative of all of America, except when they post in here. Then they're all paid shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       But seriously, estimating the percentage of Americans who believe a certain fringe theory at 70% despite all evidence is a little biased.

       I think the inconsistency comes from the Democratic shift.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like when the Republican party, 25 - 30 odd years ago, started leaning further and further away from what a big chuck of the
       <em>
        actual Republican people
       </em>
       believed in/supported.  Instead, politicians and journalists told everyone what the "people" overwhelmingly "wanted", which was generally crap because people are dicks.  Doubly so when they get to do all the yammering.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the self-identified Republicans over the age of 30 are side eying their politicians and wondering what happened.  Pundits are, too, judging by all the WTFing after this past election.  Newer ones seem to going balls to the wall retard over the crazy that gave us a serious Presidential candidate who publicly claimed some shitty weather was divine punishment because: gays.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as the Democratic leans ... well, you could argue a few ways, Democrats themselves are standing back and saying, "Hey now.  Stop that."  Especially the younger ones.

       “Cowardice is impotence worse than violence. The coward desires revenge but being afraid to die, he looks to others, maybe to the government of the day, to do the work of defense for him. A coward is less than a man. He does not deserve to be a member of a society of men and women.” - Mahatma Gandhi

       You had a large group of people sit through a decade of war without sacrificing anything. I'd feel like a coward if I had not have served in the military.

       I'm with you. Personally I would prefer a world without any sort of weapons, but that is an impossibly Utopian dream. Where there is something someone can pick up and throw/swing there will be weapons - and when these weapons favor only the strong, the weak will suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not own a gun, will not purchase a gun, and believe that I am safer without one - only because I know how dangerous I (or anyone who cannot be comfortable with guns) am with a gun (I was raised with them and "force taught" to shoot, but never became comfortable personally).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, no one is proposing that we do something about guns. They are proposing that we do something about a citizen's right to purchase/own guns. That is not a solution to the gun violence issue. While I think that some of the proposals have been insane (arm teachers, for example) any law that would make the citizenry unable to defend their personal liberty from their government is the wrong law.

       How is arming a teacher insane?  We send our children of all ages to them for six hours every day except for two days a week, that's a pretty damn good expression of trust!

       If we cannot trust a teacher with a gun, we should NEVER trust them with a child.  End of statement.

       Arming teachers, or arming store clerks, or bank teller or fuckin whoever, only seems crazy because of the way guns are looked at in our society. If guns were so prominent that every family had one, that gun education and safety were taught in schools and the idea that they are tools to be used "wisely" was ingrained in everyones brains, the whole guns situation would be
       <em>
        completely
       </em>
       different.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying this is the ideal scenario, I'm just saying that if this were the case, I truly feel guns wouldnt be such an issue.

       That's a sad thing in this case, as essentially that is natural selection in  human society.  If you have a firearm for self-defense and you are not willing to use it in the case of your imminent danger, you lose.

      <p>
       I'm a generally peaceful person, but I would not question the use of deadly force to protect another.  I view any human willing to rob another at gunpoint and/or knifepoint as an animal in that regard.

       But I see where you are coming from, it's regrettable nonetheless.  I wouldn't like to do it, but some things must be done.

       I have some contacts in the military saying the administration is trying to weed out those who wouldn't blindly follow such an order.  I don't know how true it is, but I wouldn't put it past them.  Most soldiers are very moral from my experience, but government will soon try to play politics in it.

       These munitions the government has are all stored at some point, and I have no doubt that if it came to that, soldiers would make the equipment available for use.  You underestimate the human capacity.

       I think there are strong arguments to be made that people who want to take away guns (or subvert rights through so-called "common sense" controls (how many times in history has common sense steared us wrong?)) and people who are deluded into thinking that other people can have their best interests at heart in matters like this are irrational.

       I think maybe you should go independent, and break free from the "Left-Right" paradigm.  Both of these parties are bought and paid for.  They are all furthering a Military and Corporate agenda, just from different directions.  Like the same coin, it has two sides, but it's still just one coin.

       Hey, I feel ya.  After Bush, I was a HUGE cheerleader for Obama, cause I was just so sick and tired of the wars, the police state, the Patriot Act, Gitmo, etc.  I put all my hopes and dreams into "Change" that never came.  Instead I got Drones, Libya, Syria, renewed Patriot Act, NDAA, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once I found out that Obama's cabinet was stuffed full of former Goldman Sachs employees, I pretty much gave up on the idea that anything was ever really going to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrat or Republican, the more that things change, the more they stay the same.  I hate the fact that I either have to play for the Red team or the Blue team, were my beliefs are separated into neat little packages.  If I'm a Democrat, I have to hate gun loving, right-wing, war loving Republicans and ALL their ideals, and If I'm a Republican I have to despise those evil, left-leaning, communist Democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, I have to be against HALF the country.  This divide and conquer mentality finally woke me up.

       I am for the democrats more than republicans but siding with a party doesn't mean you completely agree with what that party says

      <p>
       I am for the second amendment rights. There should be restrictions and background checks but I believe we shouldn't collect them all and burn them. Norway and Sweden both have incredibly high gun ownership and extremely low crime. In 2007, not a single gun was fired from a police officer.

       I'm sorry you voted for Obama at any time.  Regardless of loyalty to Red or Blue they are both out to deceive us and do so very well.  The agents of their paid for American Government are working right now here on Reddit. Rest assured they most definitely are engaged in popular social websites posting, commenting and influencing unaware minds.

       It makes no sense. People want to get rid of the guns, because they are a danger to society. Yet when a real "danger to society" such as the Boston bomber comes along, we have an army come and search our homes to "keep us safe". Correct me I'm wrong but if everyone owned a gun wouldn't that keep us and everyone else safer from these so called threats? And thus no need for outside sources that we are suppose to trust to protect us? Why not take out the middle man?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh wait that would make us too empowered as a civilization. I feel like as a group of people we are treated as children. Like "no you can't play with those guns, you'll get hurt, just let the adults take care of you".

       again what this ultimately comes down to is manipulation, but not how many think....it is manipulating you into thinking, seeing, envisioning "government" as the ones in charge....they are not, everything government does, they do for the central banks that run the show...it is imperative for the central banks that you view government as the ones in charge....from the election system down to military might....when you strip back the bullshit, we all know that MONEY is what is really in charge....your government is not in charge of the money, but "they" sure want you to think it is....when you get mad you will go after "government" not the banks that run the show...it's called a decoy

       "The guys in uniform and no education" was harsh.

       Believe what you will, but don't criticize those who serve on not having an education (many serve so they can afford one). Criticize the leaders all you want, but don't EVER make the mistake of calling troops uneducated.

       Americans are under/un-educated.  Many officers are Americans and fit into this category.  You may be an officer and take personal offense to that comment and for that, on behalf of the author, I would like to extend you an apology.  I also would like to say that educated, evolved and enlightened individuals don't enjoy arresting, harassing and imposing their very minuscule amount of authority on others as American officers seem to enjoy doing.

       I pay taxes, own a vehicle I paid for, have insurance, drive safely and for some reason I get nervous when I notice a cop behind me.  I was pulled over for doing 31 in a 25 and was asked for my license, registration, if I had drugs or weapons in the car, etc.  This is bullshit and completely bogus.  What type of people participate in this system and for what reason?  Surely not highly educated, fair and balanced people?

       Agreed about it being a marketing campaign, but to assume that uniformed personnel are brainless brutes is a bit presumptuous. The entire 'national security' apparatus places the street-level people under the direction of the powers that be, so when they tout themselves as 'doing their jobs', it's just that. They follow orders or they get replaced. Also, to call out their bullshit yet admit in the post that you are a democrat says that you partly believe their narrative. False paradigm is essential for their divide and conquer strategy.

       I know there are a lot of diploma mills pumping out degrees. I know there is a lot of false education. I know that a lot of people have degrees irrelevant to the work they do. The no education part was needed, and no, it did not make me feel better.

       You are aware that just 2 days after the bombing, legislation that would enact common sense gun control measures (Control. Not prohibiton, or banning, or any other word for "dey took err gunz!" you wanna use here) failed, right? So, how exactly are your 2nd amendment rights being intruded on when you can STILL go to a gun show and purchase a firearm that very same day, in a completely legal fashion?

       Lots of people used to think it was common sense that the earth was flat, that the earth is 6000 years old and so on. Your rapid dismissal of me and ad hominem is indicative of...something. Maybe you think  "people WITH actual common sense" only includes those who agree with you?

       Nah, it's pretty much universal common sense to rational, intelligent people that you shouldn't be able to buy a deadly assault weapon without some kind of background check. Why do you think so many other countries have such laws? Seems to work for them, their citizens aren't getting gunned down in the streets at nearly the same rates as ours are. Hey, if America can't be #1 in most categories anymore, we'll always be at the top in needless gun deaths. 'Murica, fuck yeah!

       Do you have to have a background check to buy a fertilizer plant? Who cares what laws other countries have? As far as your assertion on rates, please cite.

       Lots of people used to think it was common sense that the earth was flat, that the earth is 6000 years old and so on. Your rapid dismissal of me and ad hominem is indicative of...something. Maybe you think  "people WITH actual common sense" only includes those who agree with you?

       “Cowardice is impotence worse than violence. The coward desires revenge but being afraid to die, he looks to others, maybe to the government of the day, to do the work of defense for him. A coward is less than a man. He does not deserve to be a member of a society of men and women.” - Mahatma Gandhi

       You had a large group of people sit through a decade of war without sacrificing anything. I'd feel like a coward if I had not have served in the military.
