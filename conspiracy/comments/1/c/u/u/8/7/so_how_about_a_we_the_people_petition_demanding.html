<p>Having videos of placing a bomb and a shootout with police changes the nature of the conversation.</p>

<p>They have to argue their reasoning for committing the crime <em>or</em> they have to prove that the evidence is incorrect.</p>

<p>Correction.  They onus them to demonstrate some iota of guilt due to the fact that they shut down a whole city and stripped people of their 4th Amendment rights at gun point.  This was unprecedented and requires unprecedented levels of proof.</p>

<p>The fact that the majority of people were fine with it does not mean that the minority who were not lost their rights.  However, they used &quot;emergency powers&quot; based on nothing but blind faith.</p>

<p>So...yes, they did indeed have an obligation to justify that claim to power.  And they still have that obligation.</p>

<p>There is no obligation to release evidence to the public.  And a whole city wasn&#39;t stripped of their 4th Amendment rights.  The 4th Amendment says:</p>

<p>None of this was unreasonable.  In fact, I heard from multiple witnesses the police asked to come in, and were granted permission.</p>

<p>Precisely.  And it remains unreasonable until they demonstrate the need for bypassing a warrant (ie chasing a criminal who goes into a house, hearing someone scream for help, etc).  Which, as stated several times, they didn&#39;t.  0 proof has surfaced to justify these steps.  And, no, their word is not sufficient no matter how well dressed they are or what kind of metal decor they wear on their chest.</p>

<p>You are correct that many did invite them in.  That is why I said the majority went along with it.  That is their choice.  However, as I also said, that does <strong>not</strong> strip the minority of their rights.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=2LrbsUVSVl8">I don&#39;t think these people were asked</a>.  And I&#39;ll speculate that there will likely be more stories like this surfacing in the coming weeks</p>

<p>But the fact that this happened even once without a warrant means that they do in fact have an obligation to demonstrate the exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>At trial.</p>

<p>That is where people are found guilty or not guilty.  Not in the public media.  They have ZERO legal obligation to release ANY evidence to the media.</p>

<p>If they go to trial and you don&#39;t think they showed enough evidence after, then fine.  But you can&#39;t go around saying &quot;we demand evidence NOW&quot; when that goes against every legal law in the country.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Sure thing.  But you stated part of it before:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is quite head-scratching that you and so many others believe that casting a net over a whole city and calling that a &quot;hot pursuit&quot; is reasonable.  As of now, they committed clearly unreasonable searches that remain such until proven otherwise.</p>

<p>And if you believe &quot;Oh, they wouldn&#39;t do that.  They have an official title!&quot;, then you clearly haven&#39;t been paying attention to things like warrantless wiretaps and GPS tagging.</p>

<p>But if you&#39;re entirely ok with the precedent that a city can be locked down and have their homes searched without warrant looking one 19 year old kid based on absolutely nothing but faith in people who time and again have demonstrated no respect for limitations, then a seriously have little hope for the future.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but you and everyone else had better have a more valid excuse for stripping rights from people besides &quot;but the guy in fancy suit <em>said</em> he had a good reason...and he was on <em>TV</em>!!&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they&#39;ve demonstrated that they have no limitations on what they can do as long as they <em>promise</em> they have a reason.</p>

<p>I think the fact he was hidden in private property proves that searching private property was reasonable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dzhokhar deserves a fair trial. But he COULD be convicted and it COULD be &quot;fair&quot; (and &quot;in open court&quot;), while FBI involvement in inciting, shepherding, protecting &amp; advancing Dzhokhar will remain hidden.</p>

<p>Be careful what you wish for. It&#39;s FBI involvement with Dzhokhar (or mole factions within the FBI) that enabled &amp; protected his possible involvement that is the problem.</p>

<p>Like 9/11 &amp; other &quot;terrorist&quot; attacks, false flags can be created by getting naive &amp; gullible patsies to make damning &quot;confession tapes&quot; evidence, and even carrying bombs (sometimes given to them by the FBI). The question is how to expose FBI involvement. Watch for Dzhokhar&#39;s mother to be getting a smear campaign soon. She&#39;s the loose-end that leads to further examination of FBI involvement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After the 2012 and 2013 NDAA, they do not need probable cause to do anything they did to either of those brothers. If people are &quot;beligerent&quot; they can be labeled terrorists, stripped of citizenship, and treated as hostile enemy combatants (which means no probable cause, no due process, no miranda rights, no acess to an attorney, or speedy trial by jury). Moreover, the executive branch has actively refused, upon congressional request, to define the term &quot;beligerent&quot; so that the american people can know if they are in danger of infringing upon it. So for all we can know, both boys were being beligerent, and so everything that happened to them was completely legal. The american people have zero recourse against any of this right now. We either had to stop that legislation from passing, or we have to get it repealed, and we failed on the first task. </p>
