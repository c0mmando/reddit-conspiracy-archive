Now that site is not available (which is another question, why?)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zengardner.com/are-you-just-a-believer-or-do-you-think/">Here is the same article on a different website</a></p>

<p>Now, I don&#39;t want to address the words on this article, but want to focus on the pictures, and I have a few questions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why does the man in the grey hood take time to put on his sunglasses? </li>
<li>Who do the black woman and legless man raise their hands towards (no one else in the photos are looking in the same direction)?</li>
<li>Why is it that this one man had his legs blown off while everyone else seems to have no injuries or minor rips in their clothing with no cuts underneath? also, the woman who seems to be a runner with an orange shirt with a rip on her right elbow - why is she missing a shoe?</li>
<li>Why is the black woman taken away on a stretcher while the legless man is taken away on a wheelchair?</li>
<li>why does the black woman have no blood on her white shirt when she is right next to the legless man, but when she is on the stretcher she has blood on her and looks &quot;in shock&quot;?</li>
<li>Why does the man in a grey hood seem so calm in many of the photos?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks in advance for your feedback.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your link triggers RedLink and Styx Exploit messages from AVG AntiVirus - thanks a lot !
Or have I been trolled - I may be in the wrong sub ...</p>

<p>The man in the grey hood takes off his sunglasses, and tries to wrap them round one of the stumps, presumably as a tourniquet - see animated gif or gallery. That is amazingly calm and altruistic as a reaction within 5 seconds of a fatal explosion. He may be a veteran or first responder. PTSD? Even when the black lady in the red top sits up in-between them, he still continues to try. He seems to have moved round her later, but passed out, dropping the specs.</p>

<p>They scream and wave towards the road, where all the yellow-jacket marshals and 3 cops were. (Edit : in UK, crowd-control volunteers are called &#39;marshals&#39; - I guess you in USA might think &#39;sheriff&#39; ? &#39;Stewards&#39; might be a common transatlantic term ?) One marshal and the cowboy-hat guy are climbing the barriers.</p>

<p>Severity of damage is strongly dependant on distance - lightwaves (point-to-point) dim by &#39;inverse square law&#39; because the area of the wave-front is the square of distance. Since air is compressible, a pressure pulse will probably drop as the third-or-fourth power of distance. Clothing will absorb a fair amount. To target knee-ankle only, Jeff was probably only 12&quot; away from the bomb. Vital regions 36&quot; away.</p>

<p>Several people gave their belts as tourniquets - maybe shoes were removed for the laces ?</p>

<p>First aiders are taught that someone who is screaming is conscious and breathing - hence relatively fit - check the quiet/silent ones first. </p>

<p>Jeff was active - cradling his head in his hands. He wasn&#39;t bleeding heavily - burns cauterize the wound, shock constricts circulation and tourniquets were working ! I guess the lady on the trolley had been assessed as &#39;crashing fast&#39; but not yet &#39;no signs of life&#39;. Blood on clothing may have been from medics checking pulse/breath - maybe CPR. Tough call, but they both survived - QED.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s a photo of a blue-gloved medic with her fingers on Krystal&#39;s carotid artery - feeling for a pulse.</p>

<p>I wondered why the two who died (Edit:at bomb 1) were less mutilated. Maybe a reaction-pressure from the barrier with the flags (hitting from both sides) - see the broken wooden slats and wires bent round an upright body. Maybe intervening people jumped away, adding crush-pressure from a solid body rather than a pressure wave ? Being held vertical offers more resistance than falling down.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all very random if you don&#39;t believe in fate. Or in fake. People are very different - I even guess the guy that ran was just doing what he does under stress - or he may have calculated time to passing-out and distance to the medical tent gave him a sporting chance to save himself without tying-up first responders.</p>

<p>Amazing how much bystanders and fellow-victims helped each other in those &#39;Golden minutes&#39;. Even the fire guy showed &#39;masterful inactivity&#39; - sometimes standing back and calling-in resources is the best thing to do.</p>

<p>Please, everybody, seek First Aid training - you never know when it will be useful. I noticed people kneeling behind victims so they could lay back at 45 degrees - another classic position for cardiac problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As with any conspiracy theory... The first question you should really ask yourself is what would be gained by this action? </p>

<p>What would be gained by a man pretending to lose a limb? </p>

<p>Would it have changed what happened, or the response to it? </p>

<p>I am all for questioning things, but even if this part were faked, it would not have made a difference to the event or the response. Why would they plan something that would have absolutely no effect on anything and potentially could be uncovered as fake? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not saying this is proof of conspiracy, I am just very curious about it. For that reason I don&#39;t have responses to 2.5 of your 4 questions.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Seeing this photo creates a very emotional response in viewers. It was shown to incite major responses, and as proof that this was a very serious bomb. It gives the other people who were there (and probably in shock) a traumatic image in their mind of what happened - they start to recreate the event in their mind with blood everywhere and a man with exposed bone <em>in addition</em> to everyone screaming and running and the broken glass and smoke. They give much better interviews after the fact and <em>they believe</em> it was a real bomb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although you&#39;re clearly implying it&#39;s a conspiracy, I&#39;ll bite.</p>

<ol>
<li>A bomb was just detonated, people to weird things while under great stress. </li>
<li>Again, a bomb was just detonated, people do weird things while under a great deal of stress.</li>
<li>Most likely because he was nearest to the bomb (also why he didn&#39;t bleed much, as the heat from the bomb cauterized his wounds.  Flesh burns at about 140, the blast was much hotter).  Also, random chance plays a good role in that.  As for the shoe, that&#39;s an odd thing to fixate on, but it appears to be lying on the ground directly behind her in the Metro West Daily News photo.  Again, bomb detonating and the ensuing chaos can cause one to lose a shoe. </li>
<li>Chaos, lack of coordination and order the stretchers and wheelchairs arrived likely had most to do with who got stretchers and who got wheelchairs.  It seems to have worked out well for everyone.</li>
<li>She does appear to have blood on her shirt, in the same position, on her chest, where she was wounded, on the frames captured from the video.  You can see it best in the last two frames as she rotates her torso towards the camera.  You can see it much more clearly in the Metro West Daily News photo, which I assume was taken a bit after the film frames as the blood spot has grown in size.  Then you see more blood in the same position on the stretcher, as she keeps bleeding.<br/></li>
<li>Again, a bomb was just detonated, people do weird things while under a great duress.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>Also, it is really important to remember, especially in question 5 and 6, but important in all of them, that the first few images on that article are captured frames of video, likely at 24FPS, which means that all those images were taken in a half second window.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my quick and dirty amateur analysis, but it seems reasonable and logical.</p>
