It&#39;s not mere coincidence , reddit made headlines with their following up on the bombings, one can only imagine an increased government presence, disguised as &quot;average posters&quot;</p>

<p>The downvoting to hell ,
The in-fighting,
The sudden growth of r/conspiracy ,
The truth is coming out ,
Stay vigilant friends.</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em> people are taking what I say out of proportion, is every skeptic a shill ? No, but is there a chance some of the are? And when a logical approach at a conspiracy ( especially the Boston one) gets down voted, but comments like &quot;your all idiots, your just looking for evidence that isn&#39;t there , take your tinfoil hats off &quot; gets UPVOTEd we have a problem</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you get down voted, your absolutely correct. The reason you may see it more on reddit, is reddit reaches a much broader audience. Its socially accepted. 4chan regardless of how intelligent and creative it can be, it still makes all the enlightened and euphoric  nervous. Reddit is the site of sites when it comes to government, corporate and interest groups desire to manipulate the internet.</p>

<p>I cant even imagine how much money and resources go into manipulating the hive mind, its almost like every major sub has an agenda.</p>

<p>I remember when i first booked marked reddit years ago, the front page was all science links and shit like that. Its was almost a little too nerdy, now its like  the focal point for everything internet related. </p>

<p>Anyways, the job is done, there will always be enough influence to create doubt.. Even if someone might of stumbled on something, it will get buried, dismissed and forgotten by the hive mind...</p>

<p>Shit sucks man</p>

<p>There are many conspiracy theorists that still think conspiracy even if <strong>all</strong> the evidence points otherwise. A real conspiracy theorist is objective, a critical thinker, and wants to know the truth, not just seeing the whole world through their confirmation bias.</p>

I sub to this subreddit because I think there can be instances where the government lies to us and may not tell us the whole story.

So, I point out the thoughts and posts I think are interesting while debunking  the ridiculous and sometimes insulting crap people think up.

<p>I think it&#39;s because the truth is so terrifying that we collectively don&#39;t want to believe it: that the system- regardless of whom we elect to &#39;fix&#39; it- is corrupt.  The longstanding problems of this country may not be wholly the fault of <em>this</em> congress (who has done nothing to sooth the ills of this country, don&#39;t get me wrong), but the effects are now ingrained into the fabric of the government apparatus.  </p>

<p>The only apparent way (since congress is unwilling and/or unable to do anything resembling work) is to tear down the whole apparatus and begin again.  A clean slate- wherein the day a new government is formed (perhaps even with some of the current players, playing by <em>the people&#39;s</em> rules this time?) is <em>day one</em> of a new Republic, a re-affirmed Constitution, and a healed nation.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s just me, and I am not leading any movements, revolts, uprisings, or what-have-you.  Then again... nobody (even the smart people) seems to have a <em>better</em> idea...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the posts about actual conspiracies and support for them are met with hath resistance , yet BASHING those conspiracies gets up voted . That&#39;s not what this sub is about, if it is an influx of new comers to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, they should leave simply due to the fact this sub is for discussing potential conspiracies. Not people saying &quot; your wrong&quot; , &quot;your paranoid&quot; , &quot;your stupid&quot; , &quot;no way that could be right, the tv said so&quot; .

    <div class="md"><p>The best theories have verifiable claims surrounding them. There are plenty of conspiracies (corporate influence, JFK assassination, JFK vs. CIA) that have honest-to-goodness documents and in-depth research backing their conspiracy. The latest conspiracies ignore death counts and real tragedy in order to call government into question. Why not talk about the conspiratorial in-breeding of politicians to lobbyists? It&#39;s less immediately juicy than saying &quot;Illuminati,&quot; but it&#39;s undoubtedly more pressing. As for why there is an influx of users, it&#39;s because there&#39;s an influx of theorizing, as tends to happen when an attack takes the national stage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy crap. Now you guys are starting a conspiracy that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has been infiltrated by the government to down vote &quot;the truth&quot; in order to keep it buried?? You must see how irrational this sounds. Did you ever think that it really IS just people who, after the bombings, thought &quot;hey lets check out what <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is saying about this&quot; and disagrees with your guys take on the events? You are spiraling out of control <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Stay vigilant with you&#39;re own mental health. And I truly mean that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I don&#39;t think I fall into the tin-foil type but I know I&#39;m not one to just accept what I&#39;m told.<br/>
You can check my comment history to confirm, I don&#39;t delete my buried replies.<br/>
But you have to admit this sub is a little circlejerky.<br/>
For example the picture of those 2 clean-cut military type guys with the ear-pieces and the black bag with the white patch.<br/>
Firstly:  the picture people are circling in red is a cropped out image of a large picture <strong>after</strong> the event.<br/>
Secondly:  The white patch is on the bag&#39;s handle. Where as the shredded bag in the released picture is from somewhere inside the bag or the side, it is hard to tell where from, but it certainly is not on the handle part.<br/>
Now, there have been posts trying to point this out, but people continue to re-post these &quot;real culprits&quot; and they get up-voted by the horde.<br/>
If you want credibility for this sub, you need to start calling out those who perpetuate false info  &quot;dis-info&quot; if you will.<br/>
What I do find interesting and something that does not add up is, the lack of explanation why those military type guys were there in the first place, they seem to be wearing a military contractors clothing and those 2 are not the only ones, why were they there.?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not familiar with how your antagonists act or are known to act towards your sub.
But You have to allow for some discourse and not everyone should be expected to agree with everything the horde deems as true, else you are just as bad as the government you seem to not trust. mainly you need to start shutting down known false information quickly, there are going to be many people joining your ranks and if you do really want them on your side, you need to accommodate for that change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the government is corrupt . Wallstreet and Washington are identical twins and that&#39;s a problem. Corporate interests don&#39;t align with the constitution very well, the political system is rigged . If both democrats and republicans don&#39;t want the deficit to increase... Why does it increase? If both democrats and republicans don&#39;t want rights to be infringed , why are they being infringed ? Why do we pledge aid to Syrian rebels allied with al&#39;queda , whom we fight in Afghanistan? Why does the American Public distest the war by an 80% margin, but congress the opposite ? Why don&#39;t they pay for the war ?why do our sons and daughters get sent to a sandy grave miles away from home to fight in. A war f profits ? How long will we let the corruption continue before we put our foot down man? What sort of world will we be leaving our children, and theirs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re correct, it isn&#39;t mere coincidence.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was linked from Advice animals and SRD not long ago.  Both are large subs which allows for an influx of people seeing this sub.</p>

<p>That is actually normally fine.  The real problem would be the die hards in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  If someone disagrees with them, they must be a shill!  If a fact is made known, they insult them.  Insults are flung here so much yet mods don&#39;t care, even Flytape is helping make matters worse.  Flytape (the mod) says using the words shill to insult people is wrong, but won&#39;t uphold that rule and insteads warns people who disagree with him/her.</p>

<p>If you want to keep the sub from destroying itself, <strong>stop attacking like fucking idiots</strong>.  It isn&#39;t the new people doing that, it is those that can&#39;t handle any questions and that have been here for awhile.</p>

<p>This is probably the 15th (?) now thread made saying you&#39;ve been &#39;infiltrated&#39;, &#39;shills&#39;, &#39;government bullshit&#39;, etc in the last 2-3 days.  Everyone else knows don&#39;t feed the troll, but <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> loves to feed it at an hourly basis.  Insulting people and making these whiny threads.</p>

<p>Get your head out of your ass people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or perhaps this sub is just getting more popular with time, just like <em>a lot</em> of other subs that have the most obvious names in their domain.</p>

<p>I found this sub a couple weeks ago by just typing in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> knowing there probably would be something here.</p>

<p>As to the fighting and trolling... Look at my comments history. I&#39;ve been rude to people and trolled on this very sub simply because over half the people posting here put forward ridiculous and retarded ideas only supported by &quot;facts&quot; that can usually be summed up to shit that isn&#39;t real and makes no sense that solely comes from their own will to believe whatever crap they come up with... (Thinking about a post on here in particular where OP thought the word &quot;harlot&quot; in the media was a secret code for the elite).</p>

<p>I have this stupid habit of arguing with people over the Internet, naively thinking that pointing out to them how retarded they are will impact anyone&#39;s life positively...</p>

<p>So yeah, in order for the government to want to screw with this place, this place would have to present a threat. Seeing the posts that make it to the front page on this sub, this place is about as threatening as a bunch of teenagers smoking weed in the woods at night...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This Boston bombing was a major event for Reddit as a whole. Although it has been on the Government&#39;s radar for a while, never before has a website been able to single handedly compile and report an event in such a revealing and streamlined fashion, basically in real-time. This is a huge threat to the Government, and anyone with investments in media with an interest in reporting things a certain way. Reddit has managed to reveal so many inconsistencies in the story, as well as evidence being swept under the rug, and also weird aspects to the story that just don&#39;t add up. The fact that news outlets are resorting to questioning Reddit&#39;s credibility speaks volumes of how threatened they are by it. The Government has agendas it uses the media to carry out, and when the control of dictation of information is taken out of their hands it becomes a problem for them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are very odd individuals that have been spamming <a href="/r/conspriacy">/r/conspriacy</a> for awhile. The existence of this sub really offends some people&#39;s believes (in their government/leadership) and they cannot operate in any other way. I see some people who just constantly post (maybe 10 or more times each day) comments trying to frame everyone as crazy 9/11 truthers hippies. Yet they never, ever post anything constructive or any of their own ideas. It&#39;s just attack after attack on everyone else, as though we believe the moon is made out of cheese. And so what if we do, how is that hurting anyone?</p>

<p>These people remind me back during my times when I would edit and contribute to the communist articles on Wikipedia... there was this one guy, marine something, who spent hours everyday constantly trying to interject anti-communist information in all of the communist related articles. He was very paranoid, mind you the cold war and communism are well behind our civilization. The guy was really determined, like he was fighting a war. He would get banned several times from Wikipedia for junking everything up with really bad citations and then exploding during discussions with the admins / did not play well with anyone.</p>

<p>So I do not think there is a current top down government operation atm, that may come later now that reddit is getting near if not surpassing twitter. I think the in-fighting is coming from the conspirtard types. The irony is that they spend hours on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> instigating arguments, and the basis of their argument is that everyone here is crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the flack were are getting from none sub users, I think its because they think we are animals and do not care about the victims in this tragic event, that&#39;s a lie. I could not fathom my family or me going thru something as terrible as this. But unfortunately I due believe the govt. was and is behind it. More evidence is coming out about the older brother being connected to a triple homicide now and that this attack was based by religion but he had no contact with terrorist but the brother had links on youtube to terrorist videos. The fbi released a statement from the younger brother that they learned everything from the internet. The mother is saying the fbi had been bothering them, and that the fbi could not identify the older brother yet they have a whole file on him and the family. The way to think about it is to imagine you no nothing about this story then go over the whole story in your head and it sounds like one hell of a movie... just my thoughts on the situation..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who has just subscribed to this subreddit, part of the influx of new subscribers might also be because there is just so much about this Boston bombing affair that does&#39;t add up. I&#39;ve never been a believer in conspiracy theories and I don&#39;t think the US government had any role in 9/11. But, I&#39;m willing to concede that there is just too much evidence in favor of the conspiracy theory when it comes to Boston. Armed Craft mercenaries and bomb detection dogs at the finishing line and they detected nothing? Fishy as hell if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See the problem lies in the same problem we face as a society. Freedom. Anyone can create and account and come here. They can say whatever they want. They can post whatever they want. Of course they must read the rules and abide. But beyond that this is a free and open society. Now one could say that we should enforce more rules. But if you are a person who wants freedom, you would say that we should keep the rules to the minimum. My advice, Use your intuition, Keep alert and trust nothing but what is right to you personally. For those who are really here to expose the conspiracy. I wish you luck in discerning the truth. </p>
