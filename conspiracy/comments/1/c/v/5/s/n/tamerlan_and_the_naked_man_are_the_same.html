<p>First days before the bombing: 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8h5QnczjY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8h5QnczjY</a></p>

<p>Now with THAT in mind, notice who they are only showing us videos and the main image of the fully light body of the NAKED man, but see where the light falls...continue to watch that video and pause at other moments where light will hit him.  You will notice many changes, infact im sure some will end up seeing the &quot;devil&quot; but simply its just a distorted image with the light.<br/>
NOW:<br/>
This is an image I gathered on my own, but sent out to have someone with better skills to get the image online and next to each other.  THIS PROFILE of the NAKED MAN, reveals a lot.  The hair line closest to his ear, the ear, the nose, the brow.  Even watching the video itself you see the top of his head, which matches his exact hair cut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my judgment the naked guy is definitely Tamerlan - the resemblance is overwhelming. Strangely, none of the so-called debunkers in this thread or any other has offered any alternative identity for the naked man, but they &quot;know&quot; it is not Tamerlan.</p>

<p>The best they can do is lamely state that &quot;the police let him go&quot; (zero evidence of that) or that he doesn&#39;t appear to have enough chest hair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So his family members say 100% without a doubt it&#39;s him. All photo evidence points to it being him. The only real discrepancy, the chest hair, is easily debunked because anyone whose done low light shots, knows that body hair doesn&#39;t always show up clearly, especially depending on the lighting. The head shape, hair lines, body type, are a 100% match. So of this guy wasn&#39;t him, why hasn&#39;t he gone public with his story? It just so happens dudes stunt double was in the area, searched, released, hasn&#39;t come forward, and no one knows who he is. Have we ever seen a news story with this many blatant gaping holes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He had a thick mat of hair on his chest, it would have been visible if it were him. Yeah lets immediately trust family members that had not seen him in years on confrimg the very blurry video. Millions of people will have those same characteristics that you describe, so yeah, someone who liked like him was stopped by police, what is so hard to believe about that? Just look at post made by people who look or had friends that look like suspect #2. Why would the guy not come forward, idk embarrassment from being nude all over the internet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the boxing picture. It&#39;s well lit and a close shot. He doesn&#39;t have light chest hair, but hes certainly not a gorilla. Now look at the lighting, the quality of the picture, and tell me for certain that man has no body hair. Or maybe he shaves or trims? How old is that picture? Lets not pretend like chest hair really even could disprove it even if we could confirm there are none. Yeah and lets suppose the aunt, father, and mother are all making up stories about them being contacted and handled by the fbi. That still doesn&#39;t count out all the other character witnesses that say he was a cheerful pothead. That he posted about saving lives as a life guard, or the fact he was an avid pot smoker (hint: islamic extremists don&#39;t smoke pot). Or the fact he was at a party hanging with friends the night before the man hunt.  </p>

<p>say what you want about chest hair..but one picture is pix-elated and one is clear...he doesn&#39;t have a shit ton of chest hair either.. Even his friends are saying it was him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im so glad to be reading people talking about how they see these details and are not being afraid of this topic.  I honestly believe this to be very crucial and if not the MOST IMPORTANT obvious piece of information to prove something more than we are being told happened to Tamerlan.  And people, the younger brother.  Piece together the photos of him.  The ATM, he doesnt look right in that photo.  GETTING OUT OF THE BOAT, same thing, and his face isnt bloodied, yet he is clearly beaten after, and theres talk about the ATF agent putting a tube down his throat.  THEN THE AMBULANCE PHOTO, blood has now begun to flow outside of him and is everwhere in the ambulance...AND FINALLY THE HOSPITAL PHOTO...we only see his left side yes,  but theres no injury as far as we can tell yet on the throat at all.  KEEP pulling in and processing this information, putting belifes and our egos aside.  Thanks again so much for what you all have to say.</p>

<p>I asked people to make a stronger argument that the hair line, nose, forehead and brow were NOTHING like these three photos,  there is plenty of both sides sharing different opinions.  You just saying show proof and making me do it again is just reinforce how serious I am so thank you.  </p>

<p>These are the three again with the CLEARER picture.  I am saying I believe it to be the same man.  </p>

<p>Now, maybe take a look at the two bullet wounds found in his photo dead, and notice how they match up once you put your hands behind your back like they were cuffed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever people, you all hold on to personal beliefes too strongly because it was only in the last 70 years people started to work together and become individuals again, but you all become self, ego driven people with BELIEFES.  So whatever, Yoski33, you could just be like anyone of these people that are here to shut things down for whatever reason.  But you clearly are presenting and ANSWER with no real fact, and nothing more than an opinion or fear of truth, or total misjudgment, or lastly, its just your job to do so.</p>

<p>The ears and hair line, in my OPINION as the person presenting you with photos, and concepts based towards understanding something different than even what we as the PEOPLE aware of lies and evil...Take a second look at that hair line of all three photos, the EARS, NOSE, BROW, HAIRLINE...until someone has a more logical, properly explained reason instead of a answer you OBSORBERED and regurgitated here.</p>

<p>Dont be a people that were already written about in books you never read.</p>

<p>WE ARE 1984 and A BRAVE NEW WORLD, and thats nothing to proud of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the boxing picture. It&#39;s well lit and a close shot. He doesn&#39;t have light chest hair, but hes certainly not a gorilla. Now look at the lighting, the quality of the picture, and tell me for certain that man has no body hair. Or maybe he shaves or trims? How old is that picture? Lets not pretend like chest hair really even could disprove it even if we could confirm there are none. Yeah and lets suppose the aunt, father, and mother are all making up stories about them being contacted and handled by the fbi. That still doesn&#39;t count out all the other character witnesses that say he was a cheerful pothead. That he posted about saving lives as a life guard, or the fact he was an avid pot smoker (hint: islamic extremists don&#39;t smoke pot). Or the fact he was at a party hanging with friends the night before the man hunt.  </p>
