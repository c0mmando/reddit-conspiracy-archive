        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m really into conspiracys because they really make you question things but IMO this is getting ridiculous. I&#39;m not sure where to post this but i figured this subreddit is always good for debates so someone please tell me what I am missing.... or feel free to add evidence to it.</p>

<p>I think our government has done some shady things in the past like the James Holmes Cellmate news report was total bullshit. the supposed cellmate was infact a cop:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjGHl5CbSUU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjGHl5CbSUU</a></p>

<p>Anyways I do not believe there was any conspiracy regarding the 2 suspects in this boston marathon case. I&#39;ve read countless threads on how there is a government agenda to ban gun powder, or how the bombing was faked, and it was staged with actors. I also read how there is no evidence of them placing the bomb down, so both suspects are innocent.</p>

<p>I&#39;m seriously tired of the crazy logic being spewed around here lately. I want to compile a list of evidence on Why they did do it, and hopefully people can read it, and come up with some more logic based conspiracys afterwards.</p>

<p>Reasons why I believe they did it:</p>

<p>Reason #1 Main reason is Jeff Bauman(guy who had his legs blown off), Identified Suspect #1 as the guy who placed a backpack on the ground near him, before the backpack exploded. </p>

<p>there was a more detailed report, but you can google it for yourself. here is one report: <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10005932/Boston-Marathon-victim-Jeff-Bauman-helped-identify-bombers.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10005932/Boston-Marathon-victim-Jeff-Bauman-helped-identify-bombers.html</a></p>

<p>This guy has no reason to lie. Jeff Bauman is a real person, with a real family. the guy was obviously close enough to the bomb considering he suffered one of the more serious injuries, and he said he remembers seeing the suspect leave the backpack there.</p>

<p>Reason #2 Both suspects were scene at both bomb sites. both were photographed with backpacks, and without backpacks afterwards Also considering there is one suspect whos urvived, I&#39;m sure this will eventually go to court, and all other evidence the FBI has will have to come forward. It&#39;s hard to pin something on an innocent person when it took place infront of thousands of people. If it was a conspiracy why risk the opportunity of the suspect being found innocent? they could have easily killed him and had it be over with.</p>

<p>Reason #3 There are pictures of legs/boots/shoes on the ground. windows are broken. This was not staged with a smokebomb like many suggest. thousands of witnesses. No chance during the clouds of smoke people managed to apply makeup, and remove and successfully hide prostethic legs. You can&#39;t even go past a car accident in a non populated city without seeing people out with camear phones. i refuse to believe at an event as big as the boston marathon, during a supposed &quot;terrorist attack&quot; people didn&#39;t get a million photos, and not manage to get a single shot of somebody carrying prosthetic legs. utter bullshit</p>

<p>Reason #4. If they were innocent, why were they shooting at police officers? why did one police officer die? why did one reportedly throw explosives at officers? I can possibly understanding the shooting out of fear, but come on... this was obviously planned. how did they get access to gernades? half the internet was listening to the police scanners. every cop in town was out there... people were photographing it like crazy... seas of news media crews were out everywhere. do you think they were all covering up in some large conspiracy and made up the fact the suspects tossed explosives at them?</p>

<p><a href="http://rt.com/usa/boston-bombing-more-attacks-171/">http://rt.com/usa/boston-bombing-more-attacks-171/</a></p>

<p>If the government framed you and was after you, would you really have yourself armed with explosives within days? its ridiculous to think. there are numerous accounts on the web, even guys who lived near the residence where the shootouts took place witnessed the suspect toss out a bomb at police:</p>

<p><a href="http://video.msnbc.msn.com/msnbc/51592798#51592798">http://video.msnbc.msn.com/msnbc/51592798#51592798</a></p>

<p>I refuse to believe the entire police force and media were in on the conspiracy. even residents in the area of where these suspects ran to hide</p>

<hr/>

<p>Random crap:</p>

<p>I do believe Dzhokhar Tsarnaev seemed normal, and seemed like an unlikely person to commit such an act. I read his tweets, and posts on other sites and he noted saving peoples lives made him feel good. but that doesn&#39;t necssarily mean he is not capable of doing something of this nature. some people do have secret sides to them. I mean the BTK killer was a respected person in his community. the craigslist killer was a doctor who said he wanted to save lives...</p>

<p>an unlikely suspect doesn&#39;t necessarily mean an innocent suspect. I bet you could find a cheater, and ask him on twitter, or somewhere publically what he thinks of staying loyal in a relationship, and he responds with something to the extent of: &quot;Cheating is stupid&quot;.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Although there is no evidence out yet of the brothers PHYSICALLY laying the bombs down, there is evidence to suggest they did.(pictures of them at the bomb sites, with backpacks and without. and eye witnesses who said they saw them put the exploding backpacks down). Just because you don&#39;t have 100% incriminating photos that can&#39;t be disputed, doesn&#39;t mean they are innocent. your argument that there should be one is stupid, because if it wasn&#39;t them, find me a picture of someone else laying a bomb. if you can&#39;t, under your logic it didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<hr/>

<p>the Craft/Kraft crap is BS. they would have been more stealthy, and not dressed in full gear, and baseball caps if they were going to plant bombs. Most likely they were there for security. it was a big event afterall.</p>

<p>Anyways feel free to add anymore reasons on why they might have been framed, or why they were guilty. I&#39;ll try to update this post</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yo are making too much sense and using facts that have been corroborated. That isn&#39;t going to fly around here. Mention that the Illuminati and Government planned this attack and covered it up and you will have upvotes up the ass. I am a skeptic 90% of the time, but having known people who actually lived through this and the insane theories that I have read, IMO there is no chance of a set-up or the government planning this. The FBI has made some mistakes but they don&#39;t have to tell us anything, especially incriminating eveidence, until after the trial. Why would they publish eveidence they will need in court?</p>

<p>Their presumed innocent and the state will have to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they committed the crime.  I&#39;m personally reserving judgement because there isn&#39;t any reliable evidence (besides an eye witness account, which the hivemind of reddit wouldn&#39;t accept under any other circumstance).  </p>

<p>The fact that the FBI has been involved with the majority of the terror plots in the past doesn&#39;t help their credibility in these type of situations.    </p>

<p>No, not really.  I think it&#39;s a possibility that it could be either way.  Maybe the FBI had these two guys go in with fake bombs to run a simulated bomb attack for their drill, and the kids did what they were told, but the fake bombs were real?  Or maybe these kids actually made their own bombs and committed the crime them selves.  We just don&#39;t know because there isn&#39;t any information yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible. I highly doubt it though. I mean the theory is farfatched. I wont discount it because there is always that .00000009% chance of it being truth. but What would the kids motives be? I mean both educated, you would think they&#39;d know better than even attempt to plant fake bombs at such a public event. Also they did shoot at officers, and have explosives they tried to use against officers, and told the person that was carjacked they were heading to new york. and apparently sparred him because he wasn&#39;t american. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh... He&#39;s not alive but for a rather large amount of luck. The three flashbangs next to his head in the boat, then when surrendering and walking out of the boat he supposedly shot himself in the leg and mouth with a gun he did not appear to have.</p>

<p>The neighbors of the shootout that killed #1 reported that he was handcuffed on the ground and ran over by a police SUV, then shot repeatedly.</p>

<p>The only blood from Dzhokhar was on the outside of the boat, not inside. And if shooting someone in the mouth through the back of their throat during an arrest isn&#39;t attempted murder, I&#39;m not sure what is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They may have planted the bombs, one of the bombs, or simply their backpacks at the location bombs were already placed. If placing the bombs they may still not have known what they did. Or both may not have known. Their guilt in executing the attack is by no means any evidence to whether this is a conspiracy or not. In a conspiracy somebody still have to place the bombs, and somebody must be blamed. The latter being a significant part of the planning. So I don&#39;t really get your line of argument. </p>

<p>People enjoy to discuss the simple ideas of the &quot;action&quot;, but what really should be focused on is stuff like this: <a href="http://www.madcowprod.com/2013/04/22/was-boston-bombers-uncle-ruslan-with-the-cia/">http://www.madcowprod.com/2013/04/22/was-boston-bombers-uncle-ruslan-with-the-cia/</a></p>

<p>And that FBI was supposedly alerted by FSB about concern of Tamerlan as late as November 2012 !  (I will try to find the link)</p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>Ok, here is the quote/link: </p>

<p><em>Russian authorities contacted FBI in November [2012] with questions about Tamerlan Tsarnaev, police source said
It came after he was seen meeting with a person involved in militant Islamic underground movement in Dagestan
FBI never responded to the concerns</em>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I enjoyed and upvoted your post. I like logical conspiracys. I did feel like the Uncles rant was pointless. I just felt like he was seperating himself as far as possible from the suspects for his own sake, and his wife/kids sake. but you are absolutely right, that their guilt in executing an attack is unproven.</p>

<p>I do believe there is reasonable evidence to suggest their guilt in the actions resulting in the attack is pretty clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>..Added to post above. </p>

<p>For staging such attack, I don&#39;t think I would want an amateur to carry or place any bomb. That&#39;s adding a series of unnecessary risks. But the patsies would be needed to drop something off at the same location, to make the evidence hold up sufficiently. This would also make it much easier with recruitment, they need not to know much at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know I&#39;m glad you wrote this. I have to say the tenor of conspiracy theories has changed greatly. I remember when I was younger, and the biggest conspiracy theories were aliens, area 51 etc. The government was reverse engineering alien technology to keep their military ahead.</p>

<p>Maybe I was young during these times so I didn&#39;t follow every theory out there. </p>

<p>Then 9/11 happened. Loose Change came out and the era of &quot;committing terrorism against its own people&quot; era began. For many years it was only 9/11 being the inside job. Then it seems like in the past 2-3 years literally every single event that has ever happened has been rushed and labeled as a false flag attack. Every gun massacre, every terror plot has been held up as one of these. It just seems like the boy who cried wolf. I have a friend IRL who is very into all this stuff, my question to her was what major event since 9/11 was real. The only thing she came up with was Columbine, everything else is a government plot/ false flag/ some type of conspiracy.</p>

<p>The other thing I notice, is people say not to trust what you are told. The government the media etc are telling you lies, or inaccuracies, then they tell you to pay attention to them, listen to their theories and believe them. I don&#39;t see why I should trust some random internet person any more or less than media/ governments.</p>

<p>Obviously in history governments have used fake, ambitious or confusing events as pretext to push forward their agendas. </p>

<p>Anyways, as someone who lived in Cambridge the last few years, had a friend running in the marathon, worked at marathon sports at one point in my life. Its tough for me to accept that this was a &quot;plot/false flag&quot; not to mention there is not even 1 official false flag story. Either it was faked with crisis actors who all got into place while the smoke bomb went off, or the Gov&#39;t trained and allowed them to do it (the pro wrestling theory, the plot is staged but the pain is real).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to keep an open mind as far as a conspiracy goes, but my big question is basically this; who benefits from this being a setup?  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard all kinds of answers ranging from &quot;the government wants to increase security&quot; to &quot;police state&quot; to &quot;the government wants to take your weapons away&quot;.  </p>

<p>The &quot;government&quot; that&#39;s 1/2 Republican wants guns to go away?  The &quot;government&quot; wants me to get cavity searched before going into a Red Sox game?  The &quot;government&quot; wants some kind of police state nationwide where cops travel around the streets like we saw in Watertown last week?  </p>

<p>In general, people who are rich and powerful care more about money, blowjobs, and playing golf than they do about this comic book villainy of watching every move you make on a giant wall of TVs.  </p>

<p>HAHA....... you can&#39;t even think of your own argument so you steal ours. Get a grip.</p>

<p>You used some of the 10 arguments you idiots use over and over again. We are blind to the truth, we must believe that no conspiracy theories are true. We are ignorant. Laughable. You can call me what you like...... you&#39;re still wrong. You&#39;re still a fantasist. You&#39;re still a fucking idiot to believe that the government is sick enough to pull this shit EVERY TIME it happens. The government are that sick, but the two brothers who did it COULDN&#39;T have been unstable. Nope, must have been the government. Keep the ridiculous comments coming.

    <div class="md"><p>pretty good points are raised, but i&#39;m going to have to challenge putting faith in eyewitness accounts. Eyewitness accounts are surprisingly less reliable than one would think. Do i have any sources to back this up ? No, you&#39;ll just have to take me at my word; at my university, the ex-police chief came in as a guest speaker. He engaged us in a quick little activity of making one person stand at the front of the class, describe someone, and then about 25 pictures of people who look almost exactly the same were show on the power point; the class was supposed to guess the correct offender/description. We did terribly. This, he explained, is why eyewitnesses should be relied on as far as they can be thrown. We were in a class room, full alert, taking notes, talking to each other. Very far from someone who is unsuspecting, then BAM, thrust into a highly stressful situation, and expected to remember flashing, minute details. I&#39;m sure if you did a quick youtube search, there was a &quot;study&quot; conducted on students in a law classroom, where a perp came in and stole something, i believe. People in the FIRST ROW got the description SO wrong that my entire class laughed. Eyewitnesses <em>generally</em> mean jack shit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my criminal justice class in college we did similiar experiments, and I generally agree with you. but according to news reports, and even a friend of jeffs on reddit.(he has like 2 friends that are redditors that have been updating posts on jeffs condition) said Jeff picked him out of a crowd of people in pictures, and when you combine that with the fact the suspects were found with weapons, other explosives, and were both photographed with/without backpacks it starts to add up.</p>

<p>I generally take eye witness accounts with a grain of salt, but IMO there is just too much that adds up</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, i am not trying to pick apart anything else of your argument, just that (which apparently you agree with) eyewitnesses sometimes aren&#39;t the best. I cannot explain why, and this will mean nothing to you and about 7 B other people in the world, but for some reason I just have a gut feeling that something is very wrong with this event, and the Tsarnaevs. Obviously it&#39;s not something enough to merit going beyond personal skepticism, but something doesn&#39;t sit right and it bothers me. Though it seems to add up, there is also a fair amount of things that seem to <em>not</em> add up. Enough to render #2 completely innocent ? No, but enough to instill doubt in my mind. And though I find conspiracy theories very interesting, I have never had a personal investment in one, ever, before. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do have more witnesses who all claim they saw a two way firefight, and saw bombs being thrown:</p>

<p><a href="http://video.msnbc.msn.com/msnbc/51592798#51592798">http://video.msnbc.msn.com/msnbc/51592798#51592798</a></p>

<p>that is just one of them. and although we shouldn&#39;t put our complete faith in jeffs testiomy you have witnesses of the firefight, you have the suspects with similiar bombs, and you have the story of the carjacker who said he was spared because he was not american. It sort of goes together. it would be a crazy coincidence that they carjacked someone involved in the conspiracy, and that they hid and had a shootout in a residential area where everyone was involved.</p>

<p>and as for the guy who was car jacked:  That&#39;s a real easy one to prove considering they took him to several atms.  I&#39;ll wait to see that one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>..Added to post above. </p>

<p>For staging such attack, I don&#39;t think I would want an amateur to carry or place any bomb. That&#39;s adding a series of unnecessary risks. But the patsies would be needed to drop something off at the same location, to make the evidence hold up sufficiently. This would also make it much easier with recruitment, they need not to know much at all.</p>
