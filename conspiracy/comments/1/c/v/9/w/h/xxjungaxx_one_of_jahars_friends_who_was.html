        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I started following some of Jahar&#39;s friends on Twitter yesterday just to keep track of the story, and one of his main supporters was @xxJungaxx.</p>

<p>About an hour ago, I sent him this tweet:</p>

<p>@xxJunesxx What&#39;s the story with you and Jakar lighting fireworks in mid-march? What kind of fireworks were they?</p>

<p>asking about this incident:</p>

<p>Friend Troy asks Jahar about setting off fireworks with Junes. <a href="http://imgur.com/f18TFDU">http://imgur.com/f18TFDU</a></p>

<p>Those tweets were sent on 3/20, and just days before there were &quot;explosions&quot; in the Hanover, MA area:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wickedlocal.com/hanover/news/x1037527396/Explosives-cause-concern-in-Hanover#axzz2QgVbCfL5">http://www.wickedlocal.com/hanover/news/x1037527396/Explosives-cause-concern-in-Hanover#axzz2QgVbCfL5</a></p>

<p>Now, his account is gone. Not saying they&#39;re related at all... just interesting timing, seeing as yesterday he vowed not to give up until the truth was known.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats why It&#39;s so interesting. If he came up with a similar thought like: &quot;Yeah, we had fun with blowing up some home made explo....WAIT A MINUTE!&quot;, that could be the reason. Or he still believes his friend is innocent which would make one wonder: why Is the profile now closed?</p>

<p>There could also be a number of other reasons.</p>

How much of this is concern for his friend and how much is capitalizing off of it? Reminds me of Nicole Brown Simpson&#39;s friend that used her murder to pose in Playboy and get $.</p>
