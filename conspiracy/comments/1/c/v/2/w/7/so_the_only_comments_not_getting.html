       Just an observation. If a comment has a bunch of upvotes, not just mine, you can be assured that later in the day, it'll be nearly zeroed out, or in the negative. I recommend everyone install Reddit Enhancement Suite and you can see for yourself. Also, there are tons of personal attacks for voicing opinions, rather than addressing the opinion. This isn't
       <a href="/r/psychology">
        /r/psychology
       </a>
       . I too, think the vast majority of conspiracy theories are people spinning their wheels, which they are entitled to do and not feel ridiculed. If you want to contribute, and you disagree, get objective and don't just attack someone for being suspicious. Suspicion itself, isn't a sign of mental health issues. It's a response to an environmental awareness, whether perceived threat is real or not. Everyone is entitled to say aloud what they're thinking. There's a difference between debating and trolling.

       I am really tired of the crap from this sub-reddit ever since this Boston shit started. Everyone suddenly siding with the police and pushing guilt of the two guys just like the rest of the mainstream media.. Makes me sick to see this happening. The cop's didn't do a single good thing during the entire event. From having National Gaurd WMD teams at the event all the way to pulling people out of their homes at gun point. "No one is more full of shit then cop's, except cop's on TV." - the departed - leo

       Last I checked this is r/conspiracy. Refuge and home to the "tinfoil hat" wearing people with ideas that follow suit. If you have a problem with that..go to a different sub. Seriously.

       Exactly. Wear your tinfoil hat for fun or seriousness here, however it doesn't mean there aren't real conspiracies and BS conspiracy theories alike. This is not the place to shit on someone for going out on a limb. This place is a tree with many welcoming limbs.

       This whole thing is a p.r. stunt. After the Dorner incident they needed something to realign the masses. Everyone saw what the lapd did and everyone was pissed. EVERYONE! as JATTYMOANS said...boston wide stockholm syndrome that was passed onto everyone else.

       Maybe they call you crazy and an idiot because you call them authoritarians for daring to disagree with your opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this whole forum is becoming more hostile because the tinfoil hat brigade has become more and more aggressive in defining any dissent as evidence that one is a "shill", an "authoritarian" or "has stockholm syndrome."
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that if I read a comment or post that is poorly thought out, poorly argued and makes entirely irrational claims and then doubles down on the derp by accusing anyone who disagrees of being some kind of fascist, I'm a lot more likely to respond to that person by pointing out that they are a pathetic loser with paranoid delusions.

       Not true either. However, allusions to a conspiracy (I haven't even seen a single theory, really. Both conspiracy and theory seem to be losing meaning.) There are some curious things worth discussing without forming a theory. Why was Craft International there? Why wasn't there a public disclosure of their role there? They've got nothing to hide, and clearly there was a controversy around that? Are you paying attention to the dirt on CISPA, and trusting your government with the same mouth/fingers? $84M in kickbacks to shovel that shit through. I don't care about theories. I care about oddities. I come here out of curiosity, and to stir the shit when I feel I can contribute objectively, but I really haven't come here much at all, until recently.

       Oh, I'm not picking a fight with you, I'm just pointing out that this whole idea of "everyone has a say here" really doesn't seem to apply to the people who aren't trying to support a conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm pretty sure that the Craft International members were actually revealed to be National Guard CST. Craft International also isn't even close to what
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has claimed they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinions on CISPA are only tangentially related to the Boston bombings. Do I trust everything the government has to say? No, not at all. But I also don't thing everything they say is a lie, either, which appears to be why I've received so many downvotes when I try to get real evidence from someone trying to support some absurd theory.

       Well put. Rabbit holes never look like much from the surface, so YES - some questions are going to look odd if they pertain to things that have never been analyzed or questioned in the past. Time might go by, and the rabbit hole turns out to be simply a rabbit hole. Or not.

       I've definitely been on the side of the police in many of my arguments about the Boston Marathon, but I've tried to be as level-headed as possible. My points are based on observable evidence, and I try to limit conjecture, but I'll still be yelled at because I'm not subscribing to the baseless accusations of many on the subreddit.

       I've never received such comments until this Boston Bombing happened. I am guilty for dishing out something similar against the EMT claiming the guy who had his legs blown off should be dead and was an actor. This partially has to do the fact that I can't stand EMTs.

       I know, I shouldn't generalized and make a comment such as this.  I am sure there are wonderful, extraordinary EMTs are there are with many professions.

       But the many I have encountered in my life have all been quite arrogant, unfriendly, and claim to know it all, such as the one who shamelessly claimed that the man who lost both of his legs as simply an actor.

       I've seen that pic with him standing with the 2 "national guard" guys but I never saw the video. Here is a still that shows what looks like a bag strap across his back.

       He had two straps on.  The one remaining you can see that it is attached to something.  The big heavy bag on the other shoulder is gone apparently.  Do you see it differently?

       I did see only the bag and strap on the left. I'm on my phone so it pixelates on pinch to zoom. So yes as you say it is interesting. I can change my thoughts with pieces of evidence I haven't seen. I'm not here to start a war of words. The whole thing stinks. I just get pissed at being called a shill, I just want to see some type of evidence. There were so many photos and I hadn't seen the gray haired guy before so thanks for pointing him out to me.

       With all the constant shilling, sometimes it's hard to see.   Sorry if I offended you and mistook you for the shill shenagians that are overtaking this sub.   This story has them scrambling.  It's really pathetic to watch, AND to know you are paying for it too.

       I think the problem has more to do with how mainstream (for lack of a better term) r/conspiracy has become. That coupled with the fact that r/conspiracy used to be about conspiracies that actually had a backing in reality rather than based on a minor mistake a reporter or cop made. Even worse we seem to be getting a lot of "this Facebook page was made too early" on every single event that takes place anywhere in the world. I'm no corporate shill, but I've been downvoting things that are based on hearsay and/or downright poor reporting. When I see something on here that really speaks to me and has a great theory to back it, I upvote.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Stop proposing such crappy theories and you'll stop getting downvoted. Early Facebook pages are not theories or conspiracies. You're just dumb.

       Which is fine by me..no one said everyone had to agree with my opinions. Personally I have no more fucks to give about what other people think. If you enjoy being pulled out of your home at the point of a gun because two guys are supposedly running around causing trouble then you deserve what comes next..

       Fair enough but you seem to be making out it's a lot worse than it actually is. There was a guy with a gun and bombs on the loose and they were looking for him. It's not like they did it just because they could. They might of been over zealous but I'm sure the people in Boston were fine with it which is all that matters really.

       Im making it out to be worse then it is? no I am making it out to be exactly what it was.. Innocent people were taken out of their homes at gun point for no reason other then to appease the cops and make them feel more safe while they are trying to catch suspects..
      </p>
      <p>
       This was never about the innocent being safe and the new's has even commented on the fact that cop's don't know what they are walking into so they have to go in gun's drawn at the ready.. Like I said before I don't care if the cop's are searching for satan in the flesh in my hometown..
      </p>
      <p>
       if you come into my house with a weapon drawn with no search warrant you are probably getting shot, or I am. That goes for cop's, burglar's, terrorist's, spies, anyone. I don't give a flying fuck if your fucking Zeus coming in on a lightning bolt.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a cop wants to come to my door without a weapon drawn and with a badge and name tag fully displayed then maybe he can ask to come in and do a search with me...maybe...but I will still remain armed in my own home whether he comes in or not.

       No reason? They were looking for people who had already killed people and were armed. In that kind of situation where they are looking for someone who is armed, are you seriously going to shoot a policeman after they knock on your door and ask you step outside for a moment while they search your house?

       The entire internet is a blaze with curious american's(oh and the rest of the world) wanting to know what really went down this last week. As much as lies are being spouted, the truth too is being spread. So again I say it was a great move on their part but there are a lot of people not falling for it...and a lot more people tired of the lies and looking for answers outside of their usual paradigm.

       your comment lacked substance, reason, and logic. I made a statement saying we were fighting the lies with truth and you basically shot it down by saying "your really not..not that many people go on reddit sorry." I would disagree with that sentiment from beginning to end.

       Last I checked, if your ideas don't stand up under scrutiny, and you deny the right for people to scrutinize your ideas, then they are very flimsy ideas in the first place. Are you seriously trying to censor your own subreddit after how crazy about the first amendment you guys are? Some serious cognitive dissonance here.

       I can think of no better way to make yourself stupid than to convince yourself that no one could possibly have an honest disagreement with you, and to count all disagreement as evidence of being a "shill."
      </p>
      <p>
       I've now developed the habit of instantly tagging anyone who uses the word "shill" to refer to people who disagree with them as a "Delusional Fuckwit."

       Guess what you just got tagged as, bro.

       I am not seeing the rage/hate, either. Certainly heated  emotions, but I've been all over this sub for a while and I don't understand comparisons to KKK. There is a subculture, here, that can be anti-jewish. I've seen that. Isn't that always a part of conspiracy culture. I disagree with anti-Semitism, but will tolerate looking at an idiot's post in order to converse with others who are not so hate-filled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story, short. If this sub were filled only with hate, I wouldn't be here. I'd have left for a place of more sensible discussion.

       Put your pissy bitch antics aside. Just because a top rated post may be crazy doesn't mean there won't be good information in the comments that could lead to something. Sometimes it takes a crazy off the wall no way in hell post to offer a side of the truth we might not have thought of so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: stop being ass holes and bitches just because something doesn't jive with you.. Likewise if it perturbs you so much then maybe r/conspiracy isn't the place for you. Every idea should be looked at and examined.. no matter how crazy it might sound.

       If I poke holes in your argument, I'm not "out to get you" and I'm not a "paid shill", I'm merely pointing out the faults of your argument and trying to get you to see them.

       I find it especially funny because in the sidebar are the words: "This subreddit is a thinking ground, above all else we respect everyone's opinions", but there appears to be an unwritten "unless of course your opinion goes against the grain of the subreddit" that follows that.

       Please, find me a theory you believe that actually stands up to even the lightest of inquiries. You're not allowed to use baseless conjecture, and you're not allowed to make scientific/legal claims that have no basis in science/law, either. Those parameters alone seem to chop the legs out from under about 95% of conspiracies that I've seen.

       Most of the official stories actually stand up to scrutiny, though. That's why I don't post about all the "holes" I find in them... because they're not there.

       I'm not either. I'm asking atomic questions that stand alone without a giant conspiracy to tie them together. I'm making observations that stand alone, when the topic of discussion is finding things that seem suspicious or with ulterior motives, or conflicts of interest. It doesn't mean I buy into all of it. EVERYONE is selfish, myself included. We all have agendas, I just choose to be honest about mine. I value honesty.

       With all the big events of the last week, I think a lot of people thought, "I wonder what they think over at
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ." Then they didn't like what they saw and had a big downvote party. "How dare you talk that way about the police and government! They are being so brave out there!" It is like a nation wide Stockholm Syndrome.

       I agree as well and think in another week or so they will get bored and unsubscribe.  I decided to stumble upon here after the bombing to get a different perspective on things, but I'm not one of the people down-voting to hell.

       I came here about a month ago because I am skeptical about the big conspiracy theories (Illuminati and the New World Order and the like) and was looking for a place to find solid arguments against those theories. I didn't come to downvote everyone and talk a bunch of shit though. More looking for discussion. I stick around because I do believe that there are some pretty big conspiracies that should be talked about, and I like to see that here. I think whatever side of it you are on, you should be welcome here, as long as you are being respectful and actually contributing to the conversation. So comments that just bash people for being "sheeple" or for being "conspiracy loonies" should both be downvoted so we can get through the bullshit and discuss some real things.

       IMO, Illuminati and NWO do not matter at this stage. A NWO does not require an Illuminati and trying to learn and decide for yourself whether either exist is like trying to learn calculus before addition and subtraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you would accept; my advice would be to learn as much as you can regarding how money is created as debt, which in turn, allows for the control of the majority of the world's economies.  This is, IMO, the most immediate and perilous issue facing humanity today.

       I posted a
       <a href="http://youtu.be/lu_VqX6J93k">
        video
       </a>
       a couple weeks ago about the creation of the Fed. Big conspiracy, and we deal with it every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also read Aftershock by Robert B. Reich, which tells of the near future bursting of the government debt and inflation bubbles that will send us into a depression never before experienced. Here is a
       <a href="http://youtu.be/f4ZTwPsmpnc">
        video
       </a>
       from him, but I have not watched it yet, only read the book. I will update after finishing with what I thought about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, we are on the same page I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I have made a terrible mistake. In my haste to find the book that I read and a video about it, I provided the wrong one.
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aftershock-Protect-Yourself-Financial-Meltdown/dp/0470918144">
        This
       </a>
       is the actual book. Same name, easy mistake. Didn't remember the authors so I went with the other video. That video, which I am only half way through, is putting off a big Socialist vibe. His solution for recession, as far as I can tell, is to increase government debt and pump money into the economy, creating inflation. So his "solution" is the very problem that the real book I read is about.
       <a href="http://youtu.be/Gj86gskK-_U">

       The fact that you even suspect that it is a government plot to downvote your uninformed, fucktarded pictures with microsoft paint arrows that can be debunked in 30 seconds is part of the reason you're being downvoted. Your theories are bad and you should feel bad.

       Hopefully they don't stick around too long. I can see how everyone was desperate for some kind of answers, so they came here to see what could be offered. They didn't like it, so they can see themselves out.

       Edit: I am really confused how the post has over 100 upvotes, and the top comments are in the 20s, but then pretty much every comment after is negatives. Any theories on why this is?

       This is not the case! These are mostly paid shills! This trend of people trying to downplay that or deny it is most likely coming from them as well. Not saying you sir are, but they are definitely upvoting this comment. They are not stupid, and often use tactics like pretending to agree with conspiracy theories in general but act like said submission is stupid/debunked/outrageous.

       Maybe you underestimate the size of Reddit and the influence it has.
       <br/>
       It is a fact that there are corporations and other groups that actually pay people to alter the perception of the public in regards to their public image. 
It is also interesting to note how US military have developed software that enables one user to control hundreds of fake user profiles in forums and social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not claiming that the US government is deeply involved in manipulating opinions on Reddit! But i think we should be more aware of the possibility that corporations and other groups uses paid "shills" to sway public opinion. It would not be the first time this is done, so why not here?
We should just not underestimate the length some people are willing to go to control information.

       i think it is the other way around, some people are overestimating the size and influence of reddit.  The only thing i actually do believe is that some underpaid interns probably troll around for mentions of the company they work at and then relay the info to community managers and the like so they know what the popular opinion of their product is.

       I appreciate the calm, reasonable response. And I agree that reality is probably somewhere in the middle (as with most most disagreements). It probably happens, but no where near the level that people in r/conspiracy think it does.

       That is what i hope to see in here. We need to be able to discuss things openly and with respect regarding each others viewpoints.

       I agree that it is not as rampant as some might believe, but we need to take extra care when important issues are discussed on Reddit, so we do not get thrown off the trail that day when it might really matter.

       Give me a break. This comment and the fact that the 2 preceding it were downvoted to -4 is proof of the OP's point. This forum is totally saturated with, yes, contracted government and private merc shills, sockpuppets of all kinds and 4chan rejects. Sad.

       I agree as well, but while
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is a great place to talk about potential conspiracies, it is a bit absurd to think literally everything is a conspiracy. Some things that the government tells us are true.

       Absolutely, and people get carried away, but that's not what happened here as much as a bunch of new people rolled in and started shitting on anyone for speculating. On the other end of that, I don't think anyone should EVER act on that speculation.

       You don't. It's OK to question it. Hence the subreddit. Be objective and don't take shit, and things will be OK. Be subjective and deal shit, and people will be negative right back. Funny how that works.

       Look I'm all for a good conspiracy theory discussion.  I'm not for someone just blathering on about what might have happened, despite evidence to the contrary, without sources or any semblance of proof.  Example:  we won't ever see the FBIs proof/evidence because it doesn't exist.  Really? I  was unaware you had access to all the public and confidential evidence in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good conspiracy theory must have a basis in all the facts and evidence. Taking a few photos and telling me a story about what could have happened based on your selected photos despite other evidence which contradicts your story is just instilling confusion and false facts into the discussion and should be down voted.

       And yet you still get downvotes for expressing skepticism. Please,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , learn that skepticism isn't necessarily negative. The difference between pro-establishment people and skeptics is that the former will always express doubt while the latter will only express doubt if they feel there is no evidence to back up claims. This is how science works and why we aren't in the dark ages anymore.

       Yea, I think the downvote brigade thing is ridiculous and silly even though I don't agree with some of the subreddit's content. It's probably just a bunch of kids who think they're 4chan users because they spam and downvote certain subreddits, just because they don't like them or whatever. It's not like this subreddit is known for raiding others, so I don't really mind it.

       Yes, then what ? The interpretation changes. They say there's no smoke without fire, and we see the whole valley covered in smog. I think the many layers of disinformation work as proof there's something fishy.

       Even without the general disinformation/mass media I definitely give weight to the likelihood that any powers that be would have in interest in the fall out of bad things having a positive effect on pushing public opinion toward specific ideas but people with a perception of having no power are prone to lash out, if the outcome benefits those in power, it doesn't negate the intentions of the accused as independent and irrational.

       Nothing that happened in Boston dismisses the facts that American liberty is in decline, but I'd be willing to bet things in Boston were not as much an attack or destruction of liberty, but in fact an example of a far-to-wide grey area, that turned out brighter than expected.

       No one died beyond the immediate bombing victims/gunned down cop &amp; 1 of the accused. That's something that in and of itself I think is fucking amazing. We can debate it's financial and sociological cost forever but through luck, rampaging cops, or magic, law enforcement managed to prevent more deaths. Wouldn't we be debating forever on what more they should have done to secure the area/stop the guys if even a single more bystander was killed, by suspects or by cops?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets never stop questioning people that exercise power beyond our own, but let us be wary that our mindset does not blind us to our achievements. If we approach anything with fanaticism we do yourselves an injustice long before any person or entity can decree one upon us or scare us into submission. It is only with the persistence of rational discussion and positive influence from individuals that we can save eachother from eachother, but we'll see how that goes.

       I'm with you on holding the horses, we're not here to be part of the problem. Deceit and manipulation are rampant in more than the Boston incident, I was reasoning in that general context. As I've already tried to say before, people in so called power aren't above others and are affected by the same vices or virtues we cultivate from the ground up. If people pursue illusions, we'll get ruled by illusions. We have the leaders we deserve in a very real sense.

       The cops shut down an entire city for an entire day and found NOTHING.

      <p>
       The ENTIRE CITY OF BOSTON was told to shelter in place. The cops found NOTHING.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're still waiting to find out how the cops went from requesting images online from the public to being so certain that they needed to do all this, and then still not being effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberty is so precious that even the slightest of concessions need to be highly scrutinized.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: And they don't seem to have been able to get either suspect without killing him. Why? The whole city was shut down and the suspect was completely surrounded yet he's incredibly close to death. It's normal to seek answers. The police chief spoke publicly that the cops brought justice to the case and it is now closed. Obama spoke publicly of the case being closed. Well, we should all be expecting to learn of some pretty damming evidence at some point.

       I agree, and I said that. So debunk with facts instead of character attacks. I finally saw at least ONE brother holding a dark backpack. Before yesterday I'd only seen one of the two with a light grey backpack, and we haven't seen any pictures of that exploded. I'm ready to admit that, given enough evidence, that we're wrong. It's not just the lack of evidence. It's the tone that the mainstream opinion of social media has shifted to. I just saw reddit get blamed for the security guard's death.

       I've seen quite a few instances where facts were used, yet completely disregarded. I have seen a lot of questions asked and then factually answered. I think it's the inability for a lot of the question askers to take fact as a proper answer. Thus the brigade of downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other less justified reasons for downvotes but this is also a huge issue. Questions being answered but not accepted.

       An opinion is an opinion.  If you're going to float a ridiculous theory, support it with nothing other than flimsiest of conjecture, deny any and all credible evidence then you should be called out on that.  That's part of a healthy discussion.  Instead those people are being banned.

       Not at all. Disagree, but disagree respectfully and with facts. That would be helpful, and don't get pissed when the ones who don't care for facts get belligerent. Not everything is a conspiracy, but conspiracies are the topic of discussion.

       I originally joined. That's why I downvote. Spinning your wheels and coming up with neat entertaining ways of looking at things if fine. Condemning something based on opinion and speculation is not fine. Beleive it or not, being against the government is still a minority and it will continue to be a minority until this trend of hating anything you don't understand passes. It's not entertainment anymore. Now you are pressing serious allegations and guess what, that irritates a lot of people.

       I don't know. But I'm not calling wolf. I agree they were awfully young and I do think they should have done more investigation first but the thing is no one really knows what went on there. And I'm not saying its a conspiracy all I'm saying is I don't know. And I like it that way. You can call me a sheep all you want but I want to live my life happy and bringing this negativity into it doesn't make me happy. What makes me happy is knowing that I'm being a good person and that I stick up for the little people when I can. If I would have been in a situation to really talk to the guys I may have a better formed opinion but there's nothing I can say because I honestly don't know. And as much as I want to think the best of those two young men I also want to think the best of the people who captured him. Everyone has a side of a story

       So that's what you are doing here? Saving the future generations?
You seriously think that posting on reddit is the way to save future generations? Especially when you are up against the illuminati, lizardmen and all that stuff?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just admit to yourself that the only reason you are doing this is entertainment. If you would really want to help future generations you could for example try rooting out corruption in politics and getting your ass outside and actually doing something helpful. Not sit at home and come up with speculative "what if..."-s.

       You can't compare the two.
If there was a topic in the jazz subreddit that contained posts by people stating that they had evidence and facts for things then I would ask for those facts and evidence, and I think they would probably provide it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of posts here state something is fact or there is a vast amount of evidence for something, yet fail to back it up. Which is annoying because I wanted to read about it so I could form an opinion, instead of making ill informed opinions based on made up crap.....

       I think you seem to have made up a few things. I never once said everything here is bs, just the bs that people post and don't back up. They claim that it's fact when it's not.

       If you're trying to help open peoples eyes you don't post things as fact and fail to back them up, only to then call them sheep because they don't believe the crap that's been posted with no evidence. . . . .

       No, they're irrelevant because they're irrelevant....
I answered them so I honest don't know what more you want, there's evidence up there that I answered them if that helps, I won't point you to where it is though. You'll have to find that yourself.....

      <p>
       You'll have to do your own research on where I look I'm afraid. (see it doesn't work does it)
Every news site I visit, Twitter, YouTube etc. Although I suspect you won't accept those answers either.

       Again this is irrelevant, all I asked was for people to provide evidence after they had stated their self made facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've so far asked many more questions than I did and now you're asking more questions based on those statements you made up. . . . (which was not the point of this, all I asked was for evidence)
      </p>
      <p>
       I've got no doubt that the second I stop answering these questions you'll call me a shill, troll or proclaim victory over the battle you've imagined in your head.

       So here's my last answer, one of the channels on YouTube I visit is The Alex Jones channel. 
Not that any of that matters because I never once stated that I visited other sources.....

       Just ignore him. He did the same thing to me when I asked for evidence. We got into a multiple-hour long "argument" where he just accused me of being an idiot/not being smart enough to find my own evidence, when all I asked was for the evidence
       <em>
        he
       </em>
       had used to support his argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       He started to get downvoted for his childish approach to the situation, so he deleted his comments, and I assume he'll do the same again here.

       Or get frustrated when the other side of the argument asks for evidence to support your claim. Also, whenever I give my evidence, I get called a "sheeple" or "shill" for believing... well... believing the evidence.

       I was asking for evidence based on something that person said, you're asking me to provide evidence based on things you've either assumed or asked. Completely different.

       Most likely your own bullshit....
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not dodging anything. Like I said I answered you and the questions you're asking are irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't understand why, just ask.
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof is on the person making the claims, not the person asking for evidence. You stated I visited other sites then asked which ones, not me. You've made up all of these points you're arguing, not me. You're arguing against your own statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why I ask for evidence when some one states a "fact", what's so hard to understand about that?

       You're whole argument is that you shouldn't have to provide proof.
Do you know how retarded you sound?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've answered every question you've asked me, you've avoided and ignored every question I've asked you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've told you my intentions many times.
Because you clearly can't comprehend them, I'll write them here again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to form my own opinions on events using all the evidence available.
If some one states that the bombers used c4/black powder/were trained by the FBI I want to read their evidence because it's interesting and would help form my opinion.

       You're doing the same thing with arn1905 that you did with me, Nineteen. You're completely avoiding his request for evidence, and you're instead going about insulting him by trying to flit around the question with no grace whatsoever.

       My response to some one stating some of their "Facts" that they couldn't provide evidence for.
Their response was to me asking for evidence (I was genuinely interested) because a lot of people on here state something is fact, then fail to provide any kind of evidence to support their statement and just leave the comments to get down voted so they don't have to reply.

       I only have this account and would like to see the evidence to these wild accusations so that I can form my own opinions. What's wrong with that? you probably dig at people that you call sheeple, yet you're willing to blindly follow something and state it's fact without any proof. Who are the real sheeple there?

       will claim a

       I'm completely willing to change my opinion if I'm given some evidence that goes against my beliefs. That's why I'm not a Republican or a Southern Baptist anymore. However, I need that evidence to be
       <strong>

       Well, I'm inclined to think that the JFK assassination may have been more than it seemed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe in most "popular conspiracies" because most of them don't have any real evidence to support them. I'm not here to "badger people into my point of view", I'm here to badger them until they give me some information to support their view.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've noticed that any time I try to get some evidence from someone, they decide to take the time to accuse me of some ulterior motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, actually, what does my asking for information have to do with my critical thinking skills?

       Okay, you're obviously not even
       <em>
        trying

       to be level-headed about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry I got your heart rate up. If you get into a debate in real life, you're expected to bring evidence that supports your argument. If you don't, you're not going to be taken seriously. You're also not going to resort to getting angry and calling someone names, because that's not how shit works in the real world.

       Actually yes, I have a theory. Apparently though, my theory is too close to what the news has reported, so I'm not allowed to talk about it. I have photographic and video evidence that seems to actually support my theory, not baseless conjecture like most of the opinions on this subreddit (read: "The Yellow Balloons were a signal used by an FBI agent following the Tsarnaev brothers... despite the fact they were held by a fat woman walking
       <strong>
        in front of
       </strong>
       the brothers" and "Craft International Planted the bombs, just look at these pictures that I'm going to show you in non-chronological order that, with specific captions, appear to support my theory")
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also trying to participate in a debate by supporting my side of the argument. What exactly would you say you're doing?

       If you're afraid of people poking holes in your ridiculous assumptions then, by all means, keep dropping into this ridiculous, overly defensive stance. You're going to have a lot of fun in the real world where you're asked to actually
       <em>
        defend
       </em>
       your opinions, rather than kick and scream on the floor like a child when someone disagrees with you.

       From my experience since this whole thing started, it hasn't been so much downvoting rational thoughts that people disagree with, but downvoting theories that had already been talked about and debated to death over. A few days ago I saw four separate posts
       <em>
        on the front page of this sub
       </em>
       talking about the Craft guys. I agree, it should have been talked about when it was first brought up, but after most of the site, including some of the most ardent theorists on this site, debunked it, these posts still kept showing up. So I started downvoting them. It was happening frequently with other subjects too.

       I don't really mind reposts really because when I've seen it happen, it's often a repost of something that was last posted a few days ago. Long enough ago where it's plausible that OP honestly just didn't know that it was already posted. This, however, is different. Four posts on the main page about the same thing? There's not really a plausible excuse for that.

       2 chicks I sit next to at work were just discussing Boston. These are chicks that only know to talk about what the weather is like, apps on the phones, and what’s for dinner.

       I disagree. If you, like many of the Newtown-tards have done, were to asser that a community participated in a child-murder conspiracy -- with no evidence to prove your assertion (and no, the Newtown-tards have no evidence) -- then being ridiculed is what you should expect.

      <p>
       And why are they calling you names?

      <p>
       Because you think that the people of Newtown are a part of some hey-let's-conspire-with-the-Gubbermint-to-murder-our-children conspiracy. And of course you have ZERO proof of said conspiracy, which means you are just some douche on the internet claiming people were complicit in the murdering of their children.

       So the person pointing out that only a ball sack-less turd would put forth the proof-less notion that a town conspired to murder its children is obviously also the same person who believes said conspiracy?

       Are their people with great power conspiring, behind the scenes, to manipulate the laws, public opinion, and the governing of our country?  Any rational adult with a modicum of history knowledge knows that those things have been happening for nearly a century.  There are so many documented incidents, that anyone following the mainstream news for the last 20-30 years knows this.  Or knew this, at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       I posit that many people see things like Watergate as the isolated actions of a single, disturbed politician - not a pattern of behavior for people in power.  That despite the weekly stories of politicians and CEOs stepping way outside the law to manipulate event to benefit themselves and their friends.
      </p>

       People want to live in a comfort zone.  They also very much want a simple world: one where cops are good guys, anyone arrested is a bad guy, etc.  They want to believe that a "good" candidate for president will come along.  They just block out the complex and un-solvable complications because looking at things in-depth is just too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Kids getting shot, ban guns, shooting stops" is far more satisfying to support than "Since the 60's, when nearly all public mental institutions were shuttered, there is no longer treatment available for severe mental illness.  How do we rebuild a system to deal with severe mental illness now?  Especially when laws have evolved since the 60's making institutionalization against one's free will nearly impossible?"  It's also a hell of a lot cheaper.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also human nature to get pissed when our nose is rubbed in a reality we are trying to deny.  So theorist-bashing at a time when hysteria grips the nation is not a big surprise.

       Yeah, that was well said, and pretty much my thoughts exactly. It's a well established pattern, so it's not crazy to reiterate that fact or ask questions without jumping to direct conclusions. There's some of that too, but it's insane for people just to blindly discriminate against opinion because of the topic of discussion.

       I've been around way too long, and seen way too much, to discard thoughts that are not mainstream.  I have a nearly Eidetic memory; I recall almost everything I have ever read.  So the stuff that went down 30 years ago pops into my mind when something similar takes place today.  I think most people tend to forget all but the biggest issues and news: they remember Watergate, but not the hundreds of other times politicians have betrayed the public trust.

       Are the Bilderbergers really planning to throw the useful sorts in FEMA camps and off the rest of us?  I don't think so.  But on the other hand, I can't say with 100 percent certainty that they are not making such plans, either.  I do know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the federal government and the corporations do not advocate for what is best for our country or for the average citizen.  And I'm glad to see a growing skepticism among us: I say Question Everything - that's the only way answers are found.

       I mean, this is a conspiracy sub-reddit, but alot of people here act like everything has to be a conspiracy. Why can't someone believe that the Boston Bombing was real, while simultaneously thinking that the Denver Airport is created in the name of the New World Order? I feel like 'conspiracy theorists' sometimes 'force' themselves into believing conspiracies just because they are conspiracies, instead of being subjective on every case. Not saying that the Boston Marathon wasn't a conspiracy(some factors are really fishy). Also, the mudslinging is unacceptable, but it goes both ways...
      </p>
      <p>
       The place where I honestly believe that suspicion is a sign of mental illness is when everything has to be a conspiracy, and everything is linked.... like for example..... "The reptilian overlords created a quantum computer within the core of the planet, this computer was discovered by the Nazis through the hole in Antarctica, and it was subsequently inherited by the freemasons that infiltrated the American government after operation paperclip. Since then, the computer has been used to manipulate the minds of people such as the Boston Bombers through radio waves. The reason for this is currently unknown, but my friend who is deep in the project ensures me that they are trying to slowly limit our freedoms until the New World Order emerges.

       I don't get your point with the always hilarious wonka. Well atleast with the 'everything has to be a conspiracy'. Just because its a conspiracy reddit doesn't mean that everything has to be a conspiracy.... As in, if there are people disagreeing with a conspiracy, the diehards shouldn't be making threads as if the community is becoming slandered.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have a group of people that label themselves as conspiracy theory lovers, and they subscribe to this reddit. If they all believe every single conspiracy they are crazy, as acknowledged by oh yeah wonka. But, if people disagree with the Boston Bombers, they are ostrasized as both not 'conspiracy theorists', not being worthy of particapating in the sub, or the really crazy ones will create a new conspiracy that the new world order is trying to crash the subreddit through fake redditors...
      </p>
      <p>
       So what I meant by 'everything has to be a conspiracy' is don't act like there is no room for subjective discussion on this reddit. Don't act like people who disagree with you are fueled by even deeper lying conspiracies.

       Again, your stating your opinion as fact. I can say for a fact that I do not believe everything in this subreddit, but I'm not browbeating people for it. I get picked up by a cabbie at least once every 3 months that's just as batshit as the worst of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       I'm saying that there should be subjective discussion. People shouldn't be labeled as crazy if they are merely suspcious, and people shouldn't be labeled as not belonging in a subreddit because they voice their disaproval of a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a gigantic hypocrite! When I gave an example of what I see as warranting a sign of mental illness as believing that everything is connected; YOU posted the condescending, blatantly obvious wonka, as a reply. The message you obviously tried to send was: "That's obviously crazy" since you posted the same image in response for me saying not everything has to be a conspiracy in r/conspiracy.... "Its obvious that there are conspiracies in r/conspiracy"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm calling for subjective discussion, where everyone's comment is equal, and you turn it into me 'browbeating'? Seriously? I was responding to the poster calling out people saying suspicion is a sign of mental illness. I responded you're right! Its not! The only case that it is a SIGN is if everything is a rediculous conspiracy. And YOU agreed with me with the wonka.
      </p>
      <p>
       'shitting on them' Really? I'm shitting on conspiracy theorists by calling for subjective discussion and mentioning that thinking literally everything is a conspiracy is a sign of mental illness, as opposed to enjoyable suspicion being a sign? FFS dude. WOW.

       And it's not welcome or productive. Look up subjectivity and objectivity. Guess which one science likes. I guess I could start saying that the government is a big goon squad because I like radiohead. Is that subjective enough for you?

       You said they have mental health issues. You're not qualified to state that. It's your opinion. Subjectivity is not concrete and it's in the eye of the beholder. Objectivity is the study of things that two observers agree on objectively. Subjectivity is "My remote control is a spaceship and I like ice cream." or "Glenn Beck is a dick." Ok, that's ALMOST objective, but it's still subjective.

       Okay... so if this is for merely objective discussion.... then alot of conspiracies shouldn't be here. Where is proof of reptilians? Where is proof of the Boston Bombers not being the real people? Where is proof that the illuminati exists? Where is proof that those contractors were nothing but security forces? Show me proof that CISPA passing is related to this. Show me proof that 9/11 was a conspiracy. Show me proof that the Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones, Freemasons, are really who you say they are. You are actually calling out subjective discussion on R/Conspiracy? Seriously? Seriously.

       This whole thread is subjective discussion..... What we are even arguing now.... is subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
       YOU ARE A HYPOCRITE! YOU AGREED TO MY EXAMPLE OF CRAZY, YET CONDEMNING ME FOR IT! And saying unreasonable suspicion is a sign for mental illness is like saying a high temperature is a sign for the flu. They are not be mutually exclusive, but, when you find flu, you find a temperature, when you find Schizophrenia, you find unrelenting paranoia. However, at no point did I label myself as qualified, I am supporting the conspiracists by saying, no they are not crazy, but if they believe EVERY FACTOR of their life is a conspiracy. Then they should seek an opinion of someone qualified, because that may be a sign. Enjoyable Suspicion is NOT A SIGN for mental illness, and I said that from the getgo.

       I do enjoy you're Glenn beck comment so much that I might upvote you while completely disagreeing with you.

       You literally cherry-pick my argument. You say I call conspiracists mental, yet I supported them, and said unreasonable suspicion would be a sign, as opposed to being a conspiracy theorist.

       Cherry picking is someone taking a body of work, much less than 30-40% of your entire comment, and posting just the tiny bits that make their case, usually without context. It's hard for me to hide the context from your post, which is literally right above mine.

       We're both speculating.... Exactly. Innocent until proven guilty aside, there is no proof vs. no proof. So any opinion other than indifferent is subjective. The notion of innocent until proven guilty, is fundamentally, a subjective thought, because it disregards any factual evidence until an official verdict. It is a
       <em>
        belief
       </em>
       in the justice system of America, it is not an objective factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Innocent Until Proven Guilty' is an objective statement, until it is applied to a court system. If I shoot a man in the face, in front of the entire world,  and admit that I did it, then I am still innocent until an official trial. That is, if your personal beliefs align with the American Justice System.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's subjectivity.

      <p>
       So that means, you must believe there should be no Boston bombers material on here. Nor should there be any word of mouth support cited here. Such as anonymous posts from people 'working in the government that went rogue', there should be no support from people who claim they know about conspiracies, because unsupported claims are not objective.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is people's
       <em>
        belief
       </em>
       that this was perpetrated by the government.
It is people's
       <em>
        belief
       </em>
       that contrators are responsible.
It is people's
       <em>
        belief
       </em>
       that Dzokhar is innocent, yet there is eyewitness, and physical evidence of them alluding the police through using bombs and gunfire.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these are examples of subjective thought. All of these views dominate the reddit. This very thread is in response to people who do not believe in the subjective conclusion being reached by many in this community.

       I made my case... through those examples. Those are widely talked about theories here. Yet they are subjective. Thus, you are saying there is no room on this sub for subjective discussion. So you are condemning a majority of the content on this subreddit.

       You are cherry picking. You chose to post my example of a possible SIGN of mental illness as me shitting on the people in this subreddit. Yet I consistently defended them, and only mentioned this example, to show that those who frequent this subreddit should be labeled as NOT CRAZY, because they are engaging in ENJOYABLE SUSPICION.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep contradicting yourself. You agreed with my example of a possibly crazy person, then condemned me for making it. You say there is no room for subjective thought on here yet we both are speculating. You imply innocent vs. Guilty as a virtue, yet it is subjective in nature, something you condemn. You keep claiming that subjectivity isn't welcome here, but most cases deal with ongoing events where nearly no evidence is offered besides mainstream media reports. So conspiracists are being subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subjectivity belongs here, objectivity belongs here, discussion belongs here. Contradiction shouldn't be allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Spelling. And I must add, subjectivity isn't a bad thing, its a good thing. It fuels further questioning which is then reinforced by objective discussion. If no one was ever subjective, then we would never develop new ideas or theories.

        Here is a good rendition of what they say happened.
       </a>
       Are you kidding me? an unknown witness that will probably never be known gives a hearsay account of what he said. I can also tell you already what will happen to this so called video footage. It will be sealed from public view under a national security claim. Just like the pentagon 911 video. Then we will have to take "their" word for it. I know people are already doing Freedom of information act requests to get this video. First they will say it's evidence so they can't obtain it and later will say it is sealed.

       See like why was this downvoted.. just all these simple little comments downvoted. Do some people just thrive off negativity? I try to avoid downvoting altogether unless someone is being truly awful/mean... even if I disagree with something I'm just like, eh it doesn't bother me enough to drag them down. And goddammit I'm sick of it. Either way if this was a false flag or not, we should try to be supportive of each other. Our country is definitely going to shit, anyone can see that. I really have no idea about the bombings. Yes I have seen plenty of evidence and it's pretty clear the brothers are guilty. And these pictures are great evidence. But it still doesn't answer all the other questions I have, specifically about the Saudi "person of interest". All I know is enough shit has happened with the police (around the country and to me personally) that I do not trust them to keep me safe, and I sure as FUCK don't trust the FBI.

       Who cares about where the upvotes or downvotes stand.  Sort your comments by newest or oldest and read through them like that.  If you are concerned by how many upvotes people are getting then your not really concerned about the subject of their comment which is what this whole argument is about.

       For god's sake don't encourage people to use derogatory terms.  Evaluate based on the merits of an ideal, but don't insult.  If people never question the events of the '60's or the anomalies of 9/11 this field would have never taken off the way it has.  If you don't agree fine.  There's no need to resort to name calling.  But one little reminder, all these events happen (they always slip through no matter how much warning we get or the amount of money we spend on state security) and yet the MIC never seems to have a bad day.

       True this. I got major downvotes for asking why the first suspect would do this to his wife and child because "who wants to leave their child fatherless". Evidently, it's not a valid or "worthy" point to make.

       For a while now, i've seen lots of debunkers, in this sub. I would say a fair percentage of stuff i read here i don't agree with, some i think has merit for a further look.

      <p>
       Honestly the amount of times i've seen skeptics pull an alernative theory out there ass, that fits in with their 'world view', and then say oh thats it then. With no more proof than what they're arguing against, but because  it's possible it suddenly becomes 'what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to watch arguing with 'believers' of any stripe. Because mostly they're not out for the truth, but to defend a very 'threatened' view of their own reality.

       Mother Jones, The Atlantic, and Wired just put out some decent devil's advocate, which surprised me. Maybe this whole thing has gotten so sloppy the media can no longer sell it, and they are jumping off a sinking ship? We can only hope, especially if there is a smoking gun. Even if there was no conspiracy, it was a giant clusterfuck of epic unawareness which has become the hallmark of law enforcement and lawmaking in this country. It no longer takes a tinfoil hat to see that. People are going to scrutinize the shit out of this. It wasn't 3 years before a "Loose Change" came out. It was as soon as details started being released that between the press and the FBI, never matched up or completely made sense. You can't hide the truth forever, and when it's so self evident that people are willing to step out of their comfort zones, you know they've finally gotten too sloppy, whether through being inept or willfully conspiring to manipulate the truth. The $84M kickback tied to CISPA isn't helping endear anyone.

       Watergate was uncovered by conspiracy theorists. The knowledge of many genocides began as nothing more than some horribly unbelievable conspiracy theories. I do think there are some issues that raise questions regarding the extent of our government's knowledge regarding this event.  Law enforcement and government motives are not always nobel and altruistic, and some people have more reason to mistrust govmt and law enforcement motives than others of us. While some of the theories are a bit over the top, there are some unanswered questions regarding the drills being conducted and the possibility of a known credible threat having been present. I have to say that I appreciate conspiracy theorists. Among them are often the challenges to our government that increase accountibility and exemplify our basic right to speak out against corruption and to question our government. There are too many examples in history where the unthinkable happened...

       If you want to make any changes in the world, you need to understand what the rest of the market thinks and make decisions based off of what they think. If the market thinks it was a terrorist attack, then it was a terrorist attack.

       Criticizing the police and FBI and looking for wholes in their efforts is a waste of time. You are doing exactly what the international elite wants of you! They want the US government to fail, and you're negatively branding the police (of the US govt) and NOT the international elite.

       You can start a reputable grass roots movement. I'm all for it. It's rare that they actually take off. I guess the bigger objective is just to create a vigilant public that involves itself in government oversight in a direct and official capacity. I think there should be a 4th branch of government that is strictly public, citizen oversight.

       So I'm an entrepreneur and I'm interested in offering online high school education. I think the history we learn growing up in public school is created by the Internationalists and isn't actually American. I want an education that prepares young men for the real world without having to go to college!

       I'm interested in history and economic history and how they impact each other.

      <p>
       Right now I say The French Revolution and Economic history after the Napoloeonic Wars. Also the geo political changes gone through during WW1.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would you insert? From any point in history. For example, I would include the recent Boston Bombing and September 2001.

       I think it's important to go back and document anything that we know now, beyond a shadow of a doubt, to be a historical misconception that has been spread so long it became pseudo-fact.

       Robert McNamara admitted that the second attack on the Gulf of Tonkin was a fabrication, in Fog of War. There's also

        Sacco and Vanzetti

       We never learned about Japanese internment camps in US history in high school. I also had Oklahoma History in high school, which paints the indian relocation/genocide in a pretty ugly light. Stuff like that, really.

       That's strange, I thought the Japanese internment camps were taught often in public schools. Hell, one of our summer readings was specifically a story about a Chinese boy and Japanese girl who get separated due to WWII's human rights abuse.

       I'd like to see a 4th branch of government dedicated to public oversight. It would be their entire job to act as watchdogs. They would also be beholden to some form of online direct democracy, but it wouldn't be the final word. They would have term limits and wouldn't be elected, so much as put in a pool of volunteers like jurors. They would effectively be a jury that picks their cases.

       Not who gets elected necessarily, but I do keep track of who supports terrible legislation.

       You've got to come up with a campaign that convinces kids it's cool to be involved and not distant from their government. That's a tough one. Kids respond to, and fear authority, as well as popular opinion. I love Harry Potter because it subverted a generation of kids into questioning authority and valuing friendship and figuring things out for themselves. Also, it did a pretty good job of making kids see that not everyone seemingly evil is good, and vice versa.

       , but I love to come here and read everyone's theories.

      <p>
       I think that the reason you're seeing so many people side with the police and or government is that the recent bombings in Boston ( along with the past events like Sandy Hook ) seems to have brought more attention to this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       These newer people, coming to look for alternative answers, might not be ready to jump onto the idea that our goverment would/could be involved in plots to kill innocent people. Perhaps that is why they are so easily made hostile?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for trolls and shills, if someone is being vulgar and downright rude all you have to do is downvote and ignore them. The less attention you give to them all together, the less they will show up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my theory, not worth much I know, but there you have it.

       I would like to say that I agree with your opinions.  I see Reddit getting gamed by corporations, emotional children, and not least of all, by the military and intelligence agencies.

       I think those Persona Management people have been here since before the end of last year.  It also coincides with a change in all of Reddit at the same time.  Possibly a change in their business plan with the increase in the not so subtle spam in some of the default subreddits.

       We've been infiltrated. We're onto something, we know their is blatant corruption, we know the truth . And they can't have that can they? So they make us look crazy, down vote the intelligent , rational approaches . And then up vote trolls who don't like conspiracy. Diluting our whole thinking process

       Yep, and the people talking shit think that the only suspects are the government. Even Occam's Razor says conspiracies to overrun subreddits exist. They're usually perpetrated by other subreddits or social sites.

       No, it's witch-hunting, and it's patently ridiculous.  Tar-and-feathering people for an unproven and imaginary allegation is as absurd as it sounds.  Calling someone a shill or a troll is nothing more than intellectual bankruptcy and laziness.

       False; shilling and SEO spamming is subtle, veiled, and nefarious. Exposing Nerd Labs for its malfeasance is task 1, exposing those who take payola is task 2, and exposing those who attempt to suppress information with downvotes is task three.

       Perhaps you're missing my point in its entirety.  The routine insistence on dismissal of contrary opinions, for no reason besides the fact that they are different, is commonplace, and we ought not dance around this fact.  It's a way to escape from uncomfortable truths with no reflection or introspection.  If you can turn the other guy into a villain, then he is easily ignored.

       Oh really? So Solinvictous, saydrah, and cinsere were all figments of my imagination? The NY inner circle living with Alexis is a figment of my imagination? AJ paying r/politics to censor non AJ content during the last election is a figment on my imagination?

       and the like were examples of social media marketing and generic SEO, and are not, in any sense, related to the persistent allegations against dissent that is so common in many places.  It's an allegation they should be considered and serious, instead it's a flip, go-to dismissal.  That's the problem.  I'm fascinated by conspiracy theories--there's a reason I love the X-Files, Twin Peaks, Fringe, and the like--but those shows would have sucked if every time Scully challenged Mulder he called her a shill.

       The problem will always be that reddit is an advertising platform--that's what makes this place tick, that's why it exists.  Hell, IAMA is nothing but a low-effort autograph session for musicians and movie stars.  You have to know that going in.

       At the end of the day they can advertise all they want, so long as the ad is labeled as such. If they don't want to label the ad then we will force disclosure upon them. That is what I'm all about and that is why I'm here. When mods start removing content because it might stop the purchase OF .99 cent Itunes singles then we have a problem. When mods censor so that team breezy will continue to say "HE can hit me any day" we have a problem. When mods censor stories at the behest of private faction because shilling and payola is rampant on these here reddits the problem requires action. I am action.

       It is similarly lazy, but it's done usually for different reasons.  Calling someone a tinfoiler usually is part of a straightforward insult-troll.  Calling someone a shill, on the other hand, is a motivational challenge of dubious sensibility carried out specifically to discredit an opinion.

       Did you read my post? I was specifically calling out attacks, not for having a different opinion, but for trolling people with radical opinions. Share your opinion objectively, and keep the emotion to a minimum. It's OK to objectively disagree, but addressing their tinfoil hats is not cool.

       I believe r/conspiracy is 52% of redditors that feel superior to put down people that have different perspectives and 48% redditors that see things in a different light than what is spoon fed to us by the brainwashing, mass-control mediums.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing I see with the derogatory, name bashing, insulting replies to people that put forth some type of questioning is that the hateful replies have less weight and value.  The malice intent in debating what is submitted on r/conspiracy is counter productive and the point that you are trying to make falls by the wayside. All you're displaying when you attack submitters is that you can bark loudly on the internet but your bite is something left to be desired.

       I too noticed this subreddit is filled with downvotes and people bashing theories. I am more of a lurker on this subreddit than anything. I disagree with some of the theories but never downvote because this is r/conspiracy. This sub seems to have a lot more downvote/negative activity after the whole Boston situation. The fuck reddit? this is a place for conspiracies.

       I will venture that the mission of the Homeland Security Department is not to protect us from 'terror' but to create a Zionist-run federal police force to manipulate us and to keep us under control.

       This is my angle. Even without dubious motives, the incompetence seems to be pervasive, and the transparency after the fact, non-existent. How many things did we find out post Freedom of Information Act that wouldn't have come to light in any other way? If they hadn't caught Nixon's people breaking into the Watergate hotel, would that have just been a crazy conspiracy theory? Shit, Robert McNamara admitted there was no second attack in the Gulf of Tonkin. Is that a conspiracy theory too? This is the guy that drew up the documents for Operation Northwoods, and he admitted in Fog of War that there was no second attack.

       wouldn't it be scary to think they reviewed video and chose two totally random people so we would NOT think they were incompetent... buying them more time to find who really did it? "backpack, dark sunglasses, not u.s. born. perfect." I'm pretty sure in a couple weeks we'll hear they had accomplices aka the people that really did it and when that happens I bet we'll see tons of footage....... not just a five second loop of two guys watching a race.

       I agree. I'm a normal person with valid questions about boston. I'm shocked how people don't question the people that give them their news when that news is sandwiched in between paid advertisements. news is a business competing for your attention. what gets your attention? PTSD sounding news and photos, real or fake-- the more sensational it is, they've got your attention now. nothing about boston makes sense. ask questions, don't just be sheep! ask questions.

       And Jon Stewart went after CNN with full force for spewing misinformation as fast as possible too. I guess he was also strapping on the tinfoil. Even without pointing to an agenda, beyond scaring people into watching, the news is completely full of shit.

       I just googled and CNN made $600 million operating profit last year. what gets people's attention? news about a fire versus a cat stuck in a tree? the fire. whatever info your news outlet gets, they get to choose what and how to report it-- they have to sensationalize it because they're competing for readers / watchers. they have to keep advertisers happy. news is a business. question what you hear....

       I don't understand how easily everyone can forget that EVERYTHING is controlled by money..! I work in a casino so I'm reminded everyday. And when I talk about this stuff and people are like "oh do you believe everything you read on the internet"... um do you believe everything you see on CNN or MSNBC? Just cause the "news" said it doesn't make it the fucking truth! Everything made by humans is able to be corrupted.

       My favorite is the people who say "herp derp de derp I'm only here because it's amusing!" It reminds me of the kids in junior high school who used to poke all of the girls and when you asked them why they'd say "because it's funny!"

       I'm with ya on this man . Such love for the police since the Boston bombing . It's like they have forgotten that most of the cops would stomp your brains out if you had dirt on a fellow cop. That's why I dislike all cops even the ones who are good guys ,because when it comes down to it he would have the back of a fellow officer who was a corrupt motherfucker. In my line of work if a co worker punched a customer I would report straight to the boss and have him fired. The same should go for cops

       So you hope that someone is in the desperate situation to call on the people, whom we pay to help, but are corrupt, help themselves, and shoot people who are not even suspects, and shoot suspects handcuffed in police cars? Spend some time on
       <a href="/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut">
        /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut
       </a>
       and remind me why you think police are so righteous. How does our depending on them in the MOST desperate of moments make them moral? Normally we call that extortion and use RICO to lock them up and throw away the key. Did you kick in your protection money this month? Of course you did. It was deducted directly from your income and purchases. Being a sycophant is not an excuse to question someone's judgement.

       As someone who's spent a lot of time in this sub, and as someone who's completely put-off by the recent tone of this sub, I'd be happy to explain why I suspect the down-voting to be occurring, perhaps not uncharacteristically. The devil is in the details, as always, and I'm not alone when I say that I appreciate a good theory for the way it ties together all the different details, the myriad of tiny pieces that are out of line in the official story. The 9/11 theories are a perfect example, there's soo many things that are easy to point out as not adding up with the official story. But in this recent particular case, we're not really seeing that. In fact, there's been so little time to follow up on details, and so much released and discussed by so many outlets, it's hard to say anyone really understands the complete story yet. But that didn't stop any of you from immediately crying 'false-flag', or insisting people reported on didn't exist, or suggesting they used paraplegics as props, or insisting that this or that wasn't true. No one had any proof it wasn't true, there was just this ridiculous refusal to accept the facts as they were presented to you, and you've substituted those facts with hair-brained theories you took turns making up and mutually embracing. It's been an imaginary tea-party circle jerk since the bomb went off, and it's been surprisingly uninformative. We've seen posts celebrating the fact that 'the majority of people finally disbelieve the official story', which is a clear sign you've spent too long in this sub, we've got people saying the suspect wasn't bleeding in the boat, when the whole reason the home owner realized someone was in the boat was he saw blood on the tarp... You've got guns rights weirdos who have decided they should proudly perch on this sub like it's their own personal army and legitimizes their craziness telling us this is all an excuse to raid peoples homes and take away our guns, when it happens within days of congress being unable to pass the most watered down trivial gun laws we've ever seen them vote on, and these "raids" on homes took potentially minutes to search out terrorist suspects, pretty much an essential part of urban recon. I haven't seen a single fact about this case countered by evidence or scientific discussion, I've seen it countered by hallucinatory theories spawned by a paranoid reaction to violence that insists the government is trying to trick you. This sub could be a lot more than the stereotype of a loner who clings to his guns and an unfailing sense that people are after him and the news nothing but lies, but if that's what it's gonna be, well, I hope it gets downvoted. Feel free to let your frustrations out on my karma, but for the love of God stop pretending you know anything about the case when your only source of information is the news you're actively refusing to believe.

       You are free to rebut any of what you say with your own proof. But you came out here with none. We looked at the lack of evidence and the misreporting. Feel free to show me proof that they were the bombers and not just someone on the news just saying that they were.

       Here's the thing, I have nothing but the facts as they were reported and neither do you. The only difference between us is that I'm inclined to believe most of it, and you're inclined to substitute those facts with fantasies that have no bearing on reality except that they're loosely based on the same reported facts. Pointing out conjecture shouldn't demand additional proof, it is what it is. What I'm saying is that people who were privy to all the facts and tasked with finding the perpetrators provided us with whatever facts that they could reasonably disclose, and those were disseminated by the media. All you have to offer in response is a contrarian attitude towards the media. I'd be as well off asking my three year old who he thinks did it if I'm just going to blindly disagree with those facts that have been reported. If you want this sub to be the boy who cried false flag attack, it's within reach, but a lot of people are going to be unimpressed.

       So you believe news stations that misreported and have an agenda over people who just want to get to the truth. You use ridicule to bolster and distract the lack of logic your argument has.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if I was to call you a sheep for doing so what evidence do I have to prove it. I have every one of you that disagree calling people names, ridiculing, challenging their mental capacity..etc, etc. How come you all have the same M.O? Is it just you that goes around to all these 1000's of threads all across the internet or is there a group of you that all think the same way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Coming out to talk down to people like you all do doesn't prove anything except that YOU ALL have the same agenda. I notice none of you provide any legitimate argument, just name calling. You go on the offensive and hope nobody questions your intellect. You just hope that everyone says oohhhh nice burn and pats you on the back just like they learned to do with social programming by so many tv shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that more and more people are coming around. I know it is people like you. That on the inside you have to accept it because it makes sense. Much in the same way that you can't question any authority because you don't have the intellect to do so, you can't question my authority for the same reason, hence the attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the contrary. You want me to believe the media that has been proven frauds over my logic to demand proof.

       You don't have logic or proof, you're just uselessly contrarian and imaginitively uninformed. You're less a victim of my disdainful critiques and more a victim of your own persecution complex. If the 'truth' is more and more people are coming around, I guess I have flouridated water to thank for all the morons. I WISH you had the intellect necessary to question authority, but you don't, clearly, you're not even capable of defending your position (demanding proof that you're not making shit up isn't helpful or winning the argument for you).

       this is the fastest growing sub on reddit....worldnew and politics many times are now indistinguishable from the sub....we are mainstream now....they want the shilling to be transparent, they want you to know they are here...in the long run it will be us against them, here in the web and out in the streets....for example in the pic on the side bar, we see a group of men who are armed....there are about 20-30 in the full shot....those men are traitors and should be considerd a direct threat to your freedom...if operations were "open" instead of galavanting around down a neighboirhood, they would be walking into an ambush...in time it will be just like syria....but unlike syria, the military/ enemy combatants/traitors will be put down quickly, as larhge as the military is, they are no match for the amount of armed citizens that exist...they are able to waltz down the street like that because they have no resistance...the day you decide to resist collectivley, will be the start

       It's a shame but the citizens of Boston just displayed what would really happen if an armed uprising were ever to happen.  The American public would stay indoors and pies their pants.  The ones with the guts for a fight have either already joined the military or Police or are so few in number that they'd be ineffective.

       Couldn't agree more. So many people are so eager to approve the behavior of the police in Boston, apparently it's all justified because it's a special condition...right, all the media has to do is frame it the right way and people buy it hook, line and sinker.

       no, wrong, they displayed what they did based on the "set up" from media....if the citizens percieve themselves as "the guy hiding in the boat" it will be a different story....manipulation works to a point, here again, not one shot need be fired....talk to each other, thru logic understand what the problem is ...MONEY PRINTED AS DEBT"...spread the truth, educate, and then in mass stop using their shitty debt money....they will be stripped of power....FAITH IS THE KEY....LOOSE FAITH IN THE EVIL ONES MONEY....HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELVES, START YOUR OWN NATIONALIZED CURRENCY.....just like george washington....and after you do, make sure money as debt can't ever happen again....whne kids go to kindregarten, day one, money as debt class, psa's, everyone must understand these credit scams so they can not happen again...

       again it all  comes to to currency....we the people must negate the debt currency, to not only free ourselves from debt slavery, but more importantly to negate the value of the currency these "kids" are being payed with, if the money only has value to the kids and the puppet masters...it will be useless....that is the key, destroy the currency on our terms, not theirs

       I agree. If we ever hit a potential egalitarian high note, by sheer abundance alone, it wouldn't be sweet, because currency is king. Everything has arbitrary value, and when there is abundance, it's immoral to place value on individual power trips over the well being of humanity. I understand the need to incentivise success, but there comes a point when it's more a cold game than a harsh means to an end, as a result of morbid reality.

       wear your downvote proudly, or care not about them at all....brownie points are for children....the upvote/downvote is simply a form of mental manipulation for those who have predispositions to praise from the "group" fuck what the group think, think for yourself...the first thing you want to think {not like I'm telling you what to think, just some suggestions} is that you are dealing with a paid "force" that is here in order to exert "group think" based on consensus...it's an old trick, don't fall for it....and is not "upvote/downvote" a form of "group consensus?"....yes it is....so therfore it is manipulation

       What we're seeing though is how your average person thinks. How they circle jerk each other, bandwagon psychology in full swing, without any more or less proof than any of our theories, but because their beloved media said it. It's sad really, how dependent they all are on, not just the media, but eachother.

       That, that would be boring as all fuck.  I'm not interested in doing that.  The problem is, though, that the MO seems to be more centered on ignoring outside voices, which gives its own distinct circlejerk.

       Absolutely, and people get carried away, but that's not what happened here as much as a bunch of new people rolled in and started shitting on anyone for speculating. On the other end of that, I don't think anyone should EVER act on that speculation.

       You can start a reputable grass roots movement. I'm all for it. It's rare that they actually take off. I guess the bigger objective is just to create a vigilant public that involves itself in government oversight in a direct and official capacity. I think there should be a 4th branch of government that is strictly public, citizen oversight.

       Maybe they call you crazy and an idiot because you call them authoritarians for daring to disagree with your opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this whole forum is becoming more hostile because the tinfoil hat brigade has become more and more aggressive in defining any dissent as evidence that one is a "shill", an "authoritarian" or "has stockholm syndrome."
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that if I read a comment or post that is poorly thought out, poorly argued and makes entirely irrational claims and then doubles down on the derp by accusing anyone who disagrees of being some kind of fascist, I'm a lot more likely to respond to that person by pointing out that they are a pathetic loser with paranoid delusions.

       I don't really mind reposts really because when I've seen it happen, it's often a repost of something that was last posted a few days ago. Long enough ago where it's plausible that OP honestly just didn't know that it was already posted. This, however, is different. Four posts on the main page about the same thing? There's not really a plausible excuse for that.

       I posted a
       <a href="http://youtu.be/lu_VqX6J93k">
        video
       </a>
       a couple weeks ago about the creation of the Fed. Big conspiracy, and we deal with it every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also read Aftershock by Robert B. Reich, which tells of the near future bursting of the government debt and inflation bubbles that will send us into a depression never before experienced. Here is a
       <a href="http://youtu.be/f4ZTwPsmpnc">
        video
       </a>
       from him, but I have not watched it yet, only read the book. I will update after finishing with what I thought about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, we are on the same page I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I have made a terrible mistake. In my haste to find the book that I read and a video about it, I provided the wrong one.
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aftershock-Protect-Yourself-Financial-Meltdown/dp/0470918144">
        This
       </a>
       is the actual book. Same name, easy mistake. Didn't remember the authors so I went with the other video. That video, which I am only half way through, is putting off a big Socialist vibe. His solution for recession, as far as I can tell, is to increase government debt and pump money into the economy, creating inflation. So his "solution" is the very problem that the real book I read is about.

       Are you kidding me? an unknown witness that will probably never be known gives a hearsay account of what he said. I can also tell you already what will happen to this so called video footage. It will be sealed from public view under a national security claim. Just like the pentagon 911 video. Then we will have to take "their" word for it. I know people are already doing Freedom of information act requests to get this video. First they will say it's evidence so they can't obtain it and later will say it is sealed.

       Yes. Because when I'm dead I won't give a damn about future generations. And nothing is for certain. I'm not going to waste my life on something that
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       be happening.

       I gave straight answers and answered questions, you just chose not to accept them. That's up to you, I can't force you to take them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll have to do your own research on where I look I'm afraid. (see it doesn't work does it)
Every news site I visit, Twitter, YouTube etc. Although I suspect you won't accept those answers either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I never stated that I visit other sites, so that's another irrelevant question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I never stated whether or jot people here were in their right mind, you seem to be making an awful lot of stuff up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: ironic. You seem to be the one asking all the questions, yet you complain about me asking questions which there was only one, asking for evidence.

       So that's what you are doing here? Saving the future generations?
You seriously think that posting on reddit is the way to save future generations? Especially when you are up against the illuminati, lizardmen and all that stuff?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just admit to yourself that the only reason you are doing this is entertainment. If you would really want to help future generations you could for example try rooting out corruption in politics and getting your ass outside and actually doing something helpful. Not sit at home and come up with speculative "what if..."-s.

       How is it censorship to say that r/conspiracy is fucking r/conspiracy and we should be checking the leads most other places aren't..? The only people trying to stifle the debate are the ones coming in and saying "their guilty! period! done! lets go to sleep!"

       Fair enough but you seem to be making out it's a lot worse than it actually is. There was a guy with a gun and bombs on the loose and they were looking for him. It's not like they did it just because they could. They might of been over zealous but I'm sure the people in Boston were fine with it which is all that matters really.
