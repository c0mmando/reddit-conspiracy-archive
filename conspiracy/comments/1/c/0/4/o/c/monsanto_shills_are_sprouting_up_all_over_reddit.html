       firemylasers' citation ridden response was formulated in under an hour (pre-written garbage,) then later submitted to bestof in order to gain upvotes from the uninformed. Also, it's possible that JF_Queeny and firemylasers are the same person. Their prose is identical.

       Yes indeed. I will go out on a limb - maybe it sounds crazy - but it's a certain fact that shills are very real, and yes they do post what they're told for money.

       I don't know why it's so hard for people to accept the concept that a huge company might actually hire people to influence public opinion about them.

       Why is it so hard to believe not everybody is a shill who disagrees with you? I got called a shill for posting an article about the recent shooters fathers not being connected to libor. I'm not a shill, I just try to source out about info posted on here and call out people who are wrong so they can have factual info. I mean is it hard to believe ppl share the same fight that we all do, just about stuff we might not like.

       Or somebody who just agrees with one side in a specific topic?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if I read through the comment history of some people in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       and see a constant anti-GMO opinion, does this mean that they are corporate shills for the organic food industry?

       Or have they just educated themselves on an issue and decided that that is the right thing?

       The libor connection was a theory... Monsanto's corruption along with the overall discrepancies associated with GMOs is rather easy to prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       So
       <em>
        yes
       </em>
       they are shills.
Either that or they are seriously misinformed, 
which is totally believable thanks to the propaganda machine conditioning these fools to believe that there is no difference between natural foods compared to their frankenfruit

       I'm just saying the word shill gets thrown around here like the word hero now a days does. But I don't think everybody that is pro monsanto is a shill, I don't think half the people that get called a shill are actual shills.

       Don't forget that this is the Internet...meaning people are trolling or just trying to frustrate others by picking up a phrase and running with it. There is a subreddit called conspiratards. Just don't always take it seriously when people call you a shill or whatever, like anything they have to make a sound argument.

       That research is so useless and full of holes, it's basically useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issues are as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       A: The species of rat used is susceptible to tumours when given a uncontrolled food source. While this means that normally these rats are a good 'tester' for this kind of thing (As they grow tumours at a higher rate than most animals), it drops into problem two.
      </p>
      <p>
       B: The controls weren't big enough. Out of the 200 rats tests, they used a grand total of 10 rats as the control. This means that statistically speaking, because these rats naturally develop tumours, that half of the rats are going to have a higher incident of issues regardless. And this can be seen in
      </p>
      <p>
       C: And data that didn't fit the agenda was ignored. There were several datapoints that contradict his theory, for instance the highest concentrations of RR + GMO actually had a higher survival rate than the control. as well as 22% and the 33% concentrations of GMO in males. This is because.
      </p>
      <p>
       D: The data showed no correlation. If GMO's and RR truly caused this issue, you'd see that the more you add, the more cancer you get. This wasn't the case if you look at the study, with several data points contradicting this.
      </p>
      <p>
       E: The treatment of the animals was unethical, done for publicity reasons. The animals shown in the most common pictures are clearly hampered painfully by tumours. A ethical organization would have euthanized these creatures before allowing such a state to have appeared. But obviously they needed the pictures since the data shows nothing of the kind they were suggesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       F: The way they released the article screamed of corruption. They refused to let anyone actually review the science from actually scientists, hoping to get the initial shock headlines before people more intelligent could debunk the entire thing.

       Also, the OECD guildlines state that each group would need to have 50 rats in it, meaning for any meaningful statistics to be taken the study would have needed to study 1800 rats (100 rats per group, 50 as the control, 50 as the actual test)

       All treatments in both sexes enhanced large tumor incidence by 2–3-fold in comparison to our controls (total number of small expected tumors). Roundup/glyphosate has been shown to disrupt aromatase which synthesizes estrogens, but to also interfere with estrogen and androgen receptors in cells. 
androgen is responsible for male sexual characterics, responsible for differentiation (of male against female) of penis, scrotum and prostate, i.e. deforming male genetials. Females weren't as lucky, they just died.

       Shall we really talk about confirmed effects of glyphosate to humans, human reproduction / deformations,  and wildlife as well?

       Yes, they do have higher rates of tumors. Lets compare the typical (control) tumors found in these rats and compare to what GMO and RR did. This is why these rats are used for carcinogenic studies, to reveal anything that exacerbates the tumors and cancer. If it was safe, there would be no influence on the average cancer cell development.

Mostly because it's really fucking weird and probably against some laws, especially when your daughter (or whoever that hot chick is) gets involved. Partly because the 'throwing up in my mouth' sensation I get every time I see your name is super awkward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also due to the fact that I've been shown my place by the 1984 censorship power of an internet mod, in-between your IQ of 42 and various shifts at Mcdonalds, I don't think I can handle the grief. The fact that I'm unable to grasp the concepts of taking the 0.0001 seconds to make a new account for a completely free no email needed website, or even using one of the thousands of proxies that exist, means that I feel I may eventually take my own life due to this crippling feeling of only having my IQ of 137, and my degree, to comfort me on those long nights without the subreddit of morons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really hope this bad blood between us can be resolved, partly because I'd love to get involve in a threesome with your mum and the hot chick, but mostly because I believe our friendship can never be broken and is the most important thing in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sincerely, hugs kisses and a smile, your best friend, Bainshie.

       let us recognize that adverse name calling shows at least:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         A lack of vocabulary and ability to communicate, sometimes triggered by frustration;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Verbal Abuse and Bullying in belittling the target of the name calling;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Direct reference to and denigration of people with IQ scores of lower than 90 to 110 ("average), taken from an expired psychological system of classifying IQs that was once used on a daily basis; and
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Adverse Labeling.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Further, name calling is not classy behavior and the truth of this phenomenon is seen in muckraking proliferating political campaigns, perhaps more so than ever previously in the lead-up to the 2012 General Elections; in religious arguments; and in intellectual/educational discussions gone awry. Perhaps you have seen it in other discussions. Notice that by the rules of real debate, name calling is disallowed.

       You are obviously Pro-GMO and have your own opinion encrusted within your skull regarding Monsanto, so why would I waste my time? If you have done your homework like many of us have done on the subject already, then the divergence would be crystal clear.

       And trust me, I've probably done more research on the subject then you have. There is ZERO evidence currently that any of the current GMO strains, or the process of GMO, will cause any kind of health or environmental damage not found by ordinary farming.

       It's reasonable to disagree with someone, especially when you have a reason or evidence to back up your opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not what we're talking about however. There is an entire other class of internet users whose sole purpose is to spread disinfo, counteract certain opinions from becoming popular, and raise doubt in people's minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       One example (of many!) is the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Water_Army">
        Water Army
       </a>
       . That's just one. Think of what resources might exist for a multi-billion dollar company (like Monsanto, or a drug company, or even something as innocuous as an athletic shoe company). There are many people who doubt the existence of shills - but the reality is that the internet is shaped and molded by not only the users but by the people who want to use the users.

       I firmly believe that the internet (even reddit) has shills operating to discredit the truth, I do, my main point really has nothing to do with the post as it has to do with me ranting. Its just annoying when people throw that word around because some one corrected or disagreed with the other.

       Its pretty clear. I think its stupid for someone to be proven wrong and because all their info was just disproven, resort to calling the other person a shill. Like I said it was a rant. I know there are real shills and what not out there, but to see a lot of the arguments out there and how much of them resort to calling the other person a shill is ridiculous and takes away from the term. As of now I look at it as a joke more than anything.

       Seriously people don't think that major companies would pay people to sway public opinion?  I kinda thought that was common knowledge.. if not let me go on the record to say I work for a fortune 500 company, and we have an entire team dedicated to ensuring fires get put out that come up over the internet (Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, ect).  It's common practice.  To say it isn't happening is pure ignorance.

       Ditto, we have a Social Media Team where I work, that's what they do.  Businesses have historically always taken steps to shield themselves from bad PR, most companies spend more money on PR than R&amp;D or quality control these days.

       The problem we have here is that crazy people have twisted the word "shill" to mean "I don't need to explain why I hate
       <em>
        x subject
       </em>
       to you because you're obviously in the employ of
       <em>
        x subject
       </em>
       "  Sadly in a lot of cases "x Subject" is, of course, Jews/Zionists as it's part of the arsenal of tricks the white supremacist crowd indoctrinate their followers with.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when it's used in any other context you immediately assume that the person making the claim is the sort of person who denies the holocaust and thinks Rabbi's feed on gentile babies, and therefore pretty much everything else they are saying
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be insane as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not insane to assume companies spend money to suppress negative publicity though, but throwing the term "shill" around is framing the argument as one between crazy paranoid people and people who just don't think GM food is the antichrist.

       The terms "shill" and "Conspiracy theorist" are used on both sides of the argument to stop discussion...  It is silly, childish, and counter productive to a good discussion.

       Because they are referred to as shills. You have to label them as something else in order to be taken seriously. I have tried to make this point on here before, but no one seems to care. In order to get through to people, you have to treat them like people. Every time they hear "shill" they assume the person is a delusional conspiracy theorist. You are in a group, whether you like it or not. Think for yourself and explain for yourself, don't just regurgitate everything you hear. Might I suggest a thesaurus to start with?

       Classic shilling. Mock a word so much that people can't even express ideas. I'm sick of the word shill too. But what word gets used next? How long will it take for the
       <em>
        teasing

       and
       <em>
        mocking

       for example. Granted, it was two amateurs (by comparison) but what stood out is that one account managed to make over 500 posts in 6 months. It doesn't take a whole lot of time or effort for one or two individuals to send a lot of noise.

       I think it serves to validate the point that a company of Monsanto's size is more than able to organize and pay for numerous "influencers" on Reddit and of course on other sites. And consider what else they could buy with their money: everything from favorable articles (not just comments on articles) to actual research papers. Yeah, I think I'd make sure to invest in some research in fact, if I was them...

       Agreed. I'm getting paid to surf Reddit and post comments and it's not even my job. Large companies leak more money than it would require for them to hire shills. I think a part of it is people don't want to believe this website could be compromised or lead astray as it were.

       oh come on. cars were unsafe because they lacked basic safety we take for granted today (seatbelts, etc). small doses of radiation were used to treat minor illnesses, leading to deformations. cigarettes used to be ok for pregnant women to smoke. and yes, a sedentary lifestyle is now seen as detrimental to ones health. your strawman argument fails here because no one studies things that directly affect health until the effects have done their damage, while you talk about fear of technology. food isnt technology, it directly affects us and the pro GMO idiots' best defense is that there is no evidence either way. (by the way cars are still dangerous, only less so)

       No, my argument isn't that there is no evidence either way. And yes, GMO is technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we have is 20+ years of research from over 500+ groups, none of which have found any solid reason to suspect issues with GMO's. That in the realm of science is about as much proof as you can get (It's impossible to prove something save, just 'no dangerous to our knowledge')

       First of all, we don't even have a credible nutrition science in this country (why do you think diabetes/obesity is soaring? research was controlled by companies like Kellogg's into making people think carbs are good.) So to think we know more about GMOs effects on the human body over generations and not know conclusively just how bad carbs are for us is delusional. Most of the GMOs used today are new and the studies are minimal, most if not all are biased because they are funded by the same companies themselves, and there actually have been studies on mice in which a certain GMO affects them generations later. There need to be further studies before we all start eating "technology" (I disagree with you on the term, because technology being used to pervert your food does not make that food technology, but I digress), and people that proclaim to love science like you are strangely against (gasp!) rational, precautionary steps (the Scientary fucking Method!) being taken before this stuff is forced down our throats.

       Except labelling foods isn't really going to help consumers make an educated choice. If you wanted to do that, you'd make the public attend scientific seminars and other information sharing processes. All you do with the labelling is set up a bureaucratic process by which you can fuck over companies you don't like (I think there are a lot of exemptions for the GMO/non-GMO labelling, right? I can't remember exactly, but someone else mentioned it somewhere..) because the public automatically assumes that GMO is death and non-GMO is amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, it's kind of like natural vs artificial additions to ingredients. Do people even realize that the only difference is the process in which you get those additions? Natural additions are made by older, stupider processes, while artificial additions are made by newer, more efficient processes..
      </p>
      <p>
       Ugh, sorry, I think it's just that I don't trust the public to be smart about ANYTHING, and that includes pointless labels which cost more money than they are worth..

       I think you're wrong about the assumption for people's decisions. I wonder if there has been a study done on people buying more of a product because it says something like "GMO free" but without any difference in actual brand and ingredients. That would settle this disagreement.

       Yeah. I see your point. I guess it depends on the people you're talking about. In certain circles GMOs are seen as practically terroristic, but for every friend I have that thinks so, I have just as many friends who are pro-GMO, and the rest I can't imagine caring. Maybe there's a pretty good deal of psychology involved that as long as the general consensus is negative the people in the "middle group" might sway away from GMOs, but I'm inclined to think that GMOs are going to be profitable to see regardless of whether or not they're labeled. Glad we can disagree like reasonable people.

       :) Thanks, I do like to have reasonable discussions online, but I'm probably one of those people where anonymity brings out the impatient side of me (probably because face contact makes things more personal whereas lack of face contact lets me dehumanize the opposition in my head). You're right about the different circles, but I think my circles aren't representative of the general "middle group" because of where I am and what I do.

       The average American has no idea how much influence Monsanto is using to sway votes in their favor for the farm bill, for patents on food and chemical products and to make sure their agenda is supported. In my humble opinion, altering our food supply, by genetically modifying it's DNA is criminal. I support at the LEAST labeling GMO's in our foods and at the most holding Monsanto monetarily accountable for the destruction of pure strains of food and exposing us all the the ramifications. The Supreme Court's decision should be very interesting!

       I think there's an agenda beyond just profiteering on GMO.  If it kills off some population eventually, that would make the NWO population-reduction crowd happy. Two birds with one stone.

       Labeling should definitely be a minimum step. People should have the right to choose. I don't trust Monsanto nor the FDA to be competent enough or honest enough to verify the effects or lack thereof. Private testing and independent studies will be faster and more efficient at getting to the truth anyway. Just look at the "pink slime" the FDA allowed for years. Consumer advocate groups learned of it and the people/market rejected it promptly. FDA still doesn't care.

       I actually read that law and was the person who posted the details of it in the first
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have the same conclusion that I do then; I don't see what the fuss is about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually made the effort to
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/1b6zda/im_really_surprised_this_has_yet_to_be_mentioned">
        find what you wrote over there
       </a>
       .  You posted an article which was downvoted because it was stupid and sensationalistic.  The comments focus on the content of the article including things like people are trying to "poison our food" and "the Government is
       <em>
        waging war
       </em>
       against the people" and the like of.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also another comment that directly quote the actual law and asks you what exactly is wrong with it.  Then you declare that Natural News is the "real news" and tell everybody to "go back to sleep" because they quoted
       <strong>
        the actual law
       </strong>
       at you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're the exact type of person who gives skeptics a bad name.  You quoted a source that doesn't even claim to be unbiased then when people quoted legislation to you, you went down the "wake up sheeple" line.
      </p>
      <p>
       More to the point, the fact that you have +19 on this subreddit without anybody else thinking to check up on your claims says an awful lot too

       This is a conspiracy board amigo... the government "poisoning our food" and "waging war against us" have been topics discussed by conspirators for YEARS.

       Why the hell would you have a problem with someone suggesting these notions? The whole point of this place is for discussing ideas with open-minded folks, especially ideas that lack proper support/evidence so we can all try to gain a broader understanding or learn something new. If you don't like my conspiring then unsubscribe!

       Ideas that lack support, yes.  Not ideas that lack evidence.  And I certainly don't believe things that aren't supported by evidence, I weigh up the evidence of both sides and come to a temporary conclusion until something better comes along.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a difference between a conspiracy (that is, ideas that lack support or are censored) to a fantasy (ideas that lack any real evidence).  It's an important distinction to make and one that you should be making yourself lest you fall into the whacko category.

        He has a real hard-on for the posters in GMOfacts, JF_Queeny; I think he's been spamming his name on r/conspiracy to try and rally more people against him, which shows what sort of demographics make up the anti-GMO movement.

       Whole reply added though only the second paragraph catches my attention. It shows that this subreddit has many enemies. I'm not a advocate of "raid" style posting but clearly, they are.

       It also confirms that these posters have a clear anti r/conspiracy bias.

       Monsanto is posing as a 17 year old who plays minecraft, a vegetarian, and has an interest in computers/technology. They've been posting about these unrelated topics for two years, accumulating over 18000 total karma, just so they can start posting about GMO's in the last month.

       This is an issue with all of science. Everything needs to opened up (in all fields of science... knowledge needs to be free).
      </p>
      <p>
       GMO are great and can seriously help us out. But we need them to be free to everyone (and research being not for how much profit they can earn (and not checking out the consequences) but what role they can provide to us and how that affects everything)

       Its the same story, told a million times over... "If you have nothing to hide.."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the authorities telling us this spend millions, if not billions, to protect themselves from prying eyes of the public. This only seems to reinforce that they do indeed have quite a lot to hide.

       Some "sources" have been known to be dubious corporate sponsored "research" beaten and/or twisted until the desired results can be shown.

        ... former FDA commissioner Jane Henney remarked that “it’s getting much more difficult to get that pure person with no conflicts at all. . . . The question becomes both one of disclosure and how much of a conflict you can have and still be seen as an objective and knowledgeable reviewer of information.” More than half the scientists at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who responded to a survey conducted by the Union of Concerned Scientists in 2005 agreed that “commercial interests have inappropriately induced the reversal or withdrawal of scientific conclusions or decisions through political intervention.” Merrill Goozner argues that the danger runs deeper. “In many precincts of the scientific enterprise, the needs of industry have become paramount,” he says, turning science into “a contested terrain” where facts are increasingly contingent on who is funding the research. "The whole scientific revolution, which was a product of the Enlightenment, is threatened when you commercialize science,” he warns.

       Well ... you can't really. Not without checking things out yourself. But then I think there are a lot of PR &amp; marketing concerns, and organizations tasked with spreading disinformation or propaganda who are quite happy with that arrangement.
      </p>
      <p>
       So who is left to look out for the public's interest?  Virtually no one. The corporate media or anyone on their payroll isn't going to go against those interests - anyone stepping out of those editorial boundaries gets themselves sacked.  There's a handful but no where close to being enough independent investigative journalists left to run down even all the major corruption and conflict of interest stories. The US regulatory bodies are all getting staffed &amp; chaired by former executives of the industries those bodies are supposed to regulate - huge conflicts of interest but no one pays that any attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       The capper for me was when I heard Dubya admit on camera that the senior drug prescription bill was completely written by the drug companies themselves.  No one in the media commented on the obvious conflict of interest in that AT ALL.

       Everything about American life from news to politics to business to research to consumer products has become caveat emptor.

       I refuse to accept that. I still believe in facts and I still believe there are sources worth our trust. I do not believe that the entire media, medical community, and government are all conspiring to screw me over.  I'm not that paranoid. Sorry bud.

       I love how you insinuate I don't believe in facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is everything black &amp; white? Do you trust everyone and everything - every corporation and everything the government says as reliable fact? I would hope you're not that gullible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are sources you can trust.  But how do you vet them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who do
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       personally trust?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not about being paranoid. It's about dealing with the reality that everyone has an agenda and that for only a certain percentage, that agenda happens to be the truth and real science.

       I trust consensus over individual reporting. I will give a position the benefit of the doubt and compare that position or idea to other ideas I can find. That's why I'm subscribed to this subreddit and places like
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       as well as
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/skeptic">
        /r/skeptic
       </a>
       . I don't treat any source as inherently true or inherently false. I take each issue on its merits and examine the facts presented by all sides of the argument. Some sides however carry more weight than others. For instance I trust the American Pediatrics Association more than i trust Jenny McCarthy. I make those judgement's as the issues arise. I don't however doubt the validity of a source just because it doesn't agree with my own personal opinions, because the source i trust the least is me. I am too flawed, too average in my intelligence, too unschooled in science and technology to ever assume that something I think is true simply because it makes sense to me. I have far more faith in others than I do myself.

       Oh yeah, here is another exclusively pro-Monsanto poster,
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Not_Monsanto">

       post was about how great &amp; beneficial Monsanto is.

       Ohhhhh OK. Yeah, you're right. I did get selective breeding and genetic modification mixed up. My mistake. But about the herbicide, can you explain to me why it matters that: there crops resist the herbicide and why it so bad that there using a chemical that was once used in a war? There using it for good now, so why is that a bad thing??

       You have to admit that its a weird decision, at best. That's like saying "Kraft's caterer won't server Kraft products in Kraft's cafeteria".  Any "critical thinker" would stop to wonder exactly what was so wrong with Kraft products that the producers themselves wouldn't eat it.

       That was 12 years ago. Why does anyone still care. JFK &amp; Elvis are behind the whole thing. They were in cahoots with the phone company. The phone company was started by the Illuminati.

       Narrowing the debate again to only that of the belief GMO's are inherently unsafe. No, its the corrupt malpractice, the conflict of interest you pointed out and the fact that some of its seeds only regenerate when Monsanto says so which leads to a whole host of problems.

       And trust me, I've probably done more research on the subject then you have. There is ZERO evidence currently that any of the current GMO strains, or the process of GMO, will cause any kind of health or environmental damage not found by ordinary farming.

       oh come on. cars were unsafe because they lacked basic safety we take for granted today (seatbelts, etc). small doses of radiation were used to treat minor illnesses, leading to deformations. cigarettes used to be ok for pregnant women to smoke. and yes, a sedentary lifestyle is now seen as detrimental to ones health. your strawman argument fails here because no one studies things that directly affect health until the effects have done their damage, while you talk about fear of technology. food isnt technology, it directly affects us and the pro GMO idiots' best defense is that there is no evidence either way. (by the way cars are still dangerous, only less so)

       I love how you insinuate I don't believe in facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is everything black &amp; white? Do you trust everyone and everything - every corporation and everything the government says as reliable fact? I would hope you're not that gullible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are sources you can trust.  But how do you vet them?

      <p>
       It's not about being paranoid. It's about dealing with the reality that everyone has an agenda and that for only a certain percentage, that agenda happens to be the truth and real science.

       :) Thanks, I do like to have reasonable discussions online, but I'm probably one of those people where anonymity brings out the impatient side of me (probably because face contact makes things more personal whereas lack of face contact lets me dehumanize the opposition in my head). You're right about the different circles, but I think my circles aren't representative of the general "middle group" because of where I am and what I do.

       I think what you're describing sounds like how people conform to ideas without having to think through it. There was an interesting simulation done on this by Josh Epstein,
