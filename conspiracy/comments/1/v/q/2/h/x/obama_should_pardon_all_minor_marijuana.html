       He just said marijuana no more harmful than alcohol or cigarettes.   To keep these non-offenders in jail/prison is a crime against humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  Thanks for the responses!   I guess the NSA has enough data on all this to settle any disputes out there about the corruption of the system.   Wouldn't the NSA have an incredible amount of dirt on each of the sold out scum we "elected",  wouldn't they have the nail in the coffin for every criminal plan these politicians have hatched against us,  including the TPP,  including Citizens United?   Lets just hear the phone conversations and see the emails for Scalia and Roberts for example,  right?   What to speak of the untold little abuses that are plea bargained away with threats and never brought to the light of justice.   Its all there at the NSA,  and it could be turned against the 1% instead of the 99%.

       Don't forget timing.   Power trumps both money and morality when the timing is right,  when a re-alignment coincides with a generational shift.   The fact that Obama has put the cards on the table tells you that the money is already moving.   Morality is a pawn in this business,  it is always the loser.   Money and power move together until they don't.   And when power and money separate,  it is power that comes out on top.  When power and money separate,  THAT is timing.   There are signs that the time of shift is happening.   Might be a good time to take a small short bet in prison stocks.

       Oh I knew exactly what he was when I voted for him both in 2008 and 2012.  Just another Democrat.  He made that loud and clear on his FISA (think this is the correct acronym) vote in 2008.  The main reasoning behind that vote is that I'm in a swing state FL and voted 3rd party in 2000 and have seen the bullshit that happens when a voting block is split.

       Legalizing drugs would also produce a high volume of jobs producing, anaylizing, regulating, delivering, selling, and marketing the drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gangbangers and cartel members could be given amnesty for soft crimes and we can bring them into the fold so they can help us produce and supply our legal drug market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people would use these drugs responsibly with some education and police would respond to abuse and violence still. But money and life situations cause the violence more than the drugs do.

       Not to mention all the gangs losing power, they would be reduced to extortion and kidnapping. I personally think the world we be a safer place if drugs were decriminalized and regulated. I think drug addiction should be looked at as a disease rather than a crime. I personally don't do drugs, but have seen lives ruined because of it both legally and socially.

       It goes both ways. Pardon the inmates, jobless market widens. However, as more inmates come out, there is a higher chance of businesses starting up. Furthering this, the prison system costs a political arm and a leg due to overcrowding. The potential to solve two problems with one solution should override any disadvantages.

       Well, it was a very few number in the 1980s and it's grown a lot since then, but you're still talking about 120 - 130,000 prisoners out of the 2.3 million total. So they're not even a proportionate number of prisoners either.

       Why would there be an increase in crime for letting non-violent pot users out of jail? We aren't talking about releasing pot users that killed somebody in the middle of a giant pot deal gone wrong. That person would still be in jail for murder and have their pot conviction overturned.

       Well, if you asked Nancy Grace the violent crime rate would skyrocket with all those pot users were released. She said something along the lines of them murdering and raping, killing entire families. Really??? The only thing pothead want to murder and rape is a bag of Nutter Butters and Doritos, bathe themselves in remains of a 12 pack of Mountain Dew. She's a fucking moron.

       Dude, as you get older you'll see how exactly opposite to hellish living in the states is. There are unjust laws, but this isn't the 'evil empire.'  As far as the law being unjust, standing up against unjust laws or people means taking the beating or prison term, for the good of all, or just your own conscience.  When you break a law and get caught, you get punished.

       . i agree that they should be pardoned in the states where marijuana is now legal, and actually if you want this to happen you should start telling people to get in touch with the governors of CO and WA.

       but you have to understand that just because a law is changed/repealed, that doesn't automatically erase the fact that it was a crime when it was committed.

       Does it matter if the Law is Moral, or Just? People think that following the law is a good idea. People don't realize that those who are writing the laws have no interest in right, wrong, or moral. They write laws for their benefit. Hitler seized power in Germany Legally.

       They outlaw drugs, so the police get big bucks to fight the "war on drugs", While the politicians are creating tougher mandatory punishments, they are also sending guns and money to the cartels, importing cocaine, heroine, and other oppiates through CIA, DEA, ATF, while the cartels are laundering their money through the big banks, as the big banks keep buying off politicians.

       Who wrote the law?  Is it a moral law?  Should it have ever been written in the first place?  Who benefited from the law being written?

       These are not irrelevant questions.  You can't just make the blanket statement of "it's the law" for everything when some (many?) of the laws on the books today are complete and utter bullshit written by and for the 1%.

       they kind of are irrelevant questions at this point.
       <em>
        so many
       </em>
       of our laws are written for unjust, corrupt reasons. hell, here in texas we just
       <em>
        amended our fucking state constitution
       </em>
       to keep
       <strong>
        one company

       from leaving the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm not saying that they
       <em>
        shouldn't
       </em>
       be pardoned. if it's no longer a crime, there's no reason to be doing the time. that makes sense. i'm saying that it will never happen, at least not on a large scale, because of the message it would send about our judicial system. it won't be allowed.

       Half the reason we have so many bullshit laws like this in the first place is that a large percentage of the population has the same mindset as you.  A "law" isn't made valid just by virtue of it being written down.

       actually, i'm the only person who provided the correct information to get people released in the states where it's no longer a crime. this is what's called working with the system, instead of this pipe dream of obama somehow freeing every drug offender in america. by all means, keep waiting for

       I like the idea of that, freeing those unjustly jailed. I love the idea of freedom for all. But, I want to play devils advocate for just a second. Imagine, across all states that the Feds decide to pardon all minor marijuana offenders, assume it is less than 1 oz of possession and have no intent to distribute. Lets put the number at ~100,000 (i think it is a fair number, maybe even low.
       <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/20/marijuana-s-victims.html">
        Here is a great article about that
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       So now we have 100k people with no jobs, some with no place to live, no families that they can turn to, or with families that now have to share the burden of providing for someone what has been out of the already depleted job market, sometimes for as long as 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say these guys are all fully pardoned and convictions removed, ergo they are free and can vote and don't need to answer yes to that pesky felony conviction question of the application. What will they tell the employers about the 3-5 year gap in their employment history? While they are now free, they could be in a worse position...free without means to support. Where as before they got 3 hots and a cot, some of them may not even get that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been in jail before, and I do not wish it upon anyone, so i am not saying this with a light heart.

       Well to be fair, anyone in jail for a simple possession level conviction will not be there for decades. These guys will be on the streets pretty soon anyway, and as you mentioned, with all the limitations that "he's been in jail" comes with.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guys who were trafficking pounds and upwards of the stuff are typically guilty of other things -- even if they were 100% nonviolent, they're still guilty of tax evasion. Perhaps the possession component of the sentence could be rescinded, but it would be a hard sell to pardon big time tax evasion.

       Your right about the simple possession, and I don't know where I can get the source info, but there are some offenders that are some small amount long servers, but probably less than the 100K I posted earlier. I never thought about the tax evasion angle, but if it is possession and not selling/distribution, then I don't see how than can make a case concerning evasion.

       Yes, and while I prefer comment comments for political discussions, it is a learned technique to make your point and not appear to attack.

       Thank you for responding, I do understand, do you see how your comment looks like misapplied attack.

       Good question.   To serve and protect sounds major to me,  like we pay the cops for what,  again?   We need politicians why,  again?   So if the people get to the point where they don't want to be hassled,  maybe you should have a permit for selling bread,  gravel, beer,  etc.   Do they jail people for permit violations?

       Releasing everyone at once with no safety net would probably satisfy their prediction for chaos. If someone has a 5 year sentence and has served 2 years, that same money it costs for incarnation, the remaining 3 yrs. could pay for housing/education/vocational training for at least 1 year each, it would probably costs less.

       Maintaining reverence to law is of utmost necessity to the system.  The innocuous qualities of the plant in question would not subvert the transgression of the law.  Whether or not those imprisoned had done any harm to any persons they still caused harm to the system by breaking the law.  While you may view their release as a triumph of justice, the system would view it as admitting fault in its process which it cannot do.  They are in prison not because the predication of the law is true or in error but because of their disobedience to the system itself.

       It is true that people will do what they will do.  In many cases what people pursue is their own happiness and relief from stress.  These activities in no sane system would be considered as crimes, no doubt, as they cause no material harm to another person or property.  It is the nature of authoritarianism to maintain its status of superiority based on a façade of superior attributes in all respects.  The system must maintain a posture of infallibility and credulity for otherwise its right to be in authority is challenged.  Though fallibility is intrinsic to human nature, authoritarian systems comprised of humans still strive to maintain it as they view the system of their collective efforts as somehow a separate and superior entity free of their individual faults.  It will encroach progressively into all aspects of everyone's lives until it manifests its own self-destruction.  Any system that is not sustainable will ultimately collapse.  Until that point it will push forward without relent.

       While I do agree with this a thought occurred to me that provides the only legitimate reason i can see for keeping them at least to a certain reasonable minimum sentence assuming their criminal record will be erased upon release. The offenders are in jail for breaking the law, while the law may now have been changed, the fact remains that they broke the law of the time. Objectively (and I can't stress that enough) releasing people immediately sends the message that if you feel a law today might not be a law tomorrow, you can break that law expecting to be released as soon as it is revoked. This is something that can potentially cause a lot of problems as people may see it as an excuse to break any law they feel could be overturned, the prediction of what law may be overturned being subject to the individuals own perception. I understand this is a hideous and unjust law that never should have existed, and ridiculous sentences should definitely be cut right down, but to instantly release everybody incarcerated for it may be interpreted, by some, as an excuse to break any law they want. While I do feel that it is a citizen's responsibility to break unjust laws, we must be very careful how we do this, given the vast divide between what the blind majority and the awake minority feels is unjust, potential chaos could ensue. Personally, I feel current possession convictions could* be reduced to a period of say 6 months (rough number for arguments sake) should the convict have already served it, they should be released (in cases of multiple years served, compensation should be awarded), if not, they should complete the 6 months and be absolved of any criminal record upon release. I'm all for legalisation and drastically reduced Government regulations, but we must be careful of the implications that disregard for the law may bring about upon a public not accustomed to freedom, so thirsty for it in fact that they may run wild initially. An admittedly heavy example would be the rescued Jews in concentration camps that the allies free'd that had to be carefully fed back to health as they were so malnourished they would want to eat an amount that was in fact unhealthy given their weakened condition, food rations were carefully distributed for their own good, under the supervision of medical professionals. Personally though I still do feel they should be released, but without reasonable consideration to both sides of any argument, we could not say we have made a reasonable judgement. Thoughts? (edit marked * 'should' - 'could' illustrating an idea as opposed to my own position mentioned at the end)

        releasing people immediately sends the message that if you feel a law today might not be a law tomorrow, you can break that law expecting to be released as soon as it is revoked
Why should this be a wrong message? If you feel that a law is unjust and anticipate that the law will be overturned it should be you damn right to break the law - if it won't be overturned: bad luck.

       For the sake of your concentration camp victims (btw.: jews were only a part of the victims of concentration camps): If someone broke the law in the 3rd Reich and was sent to a KZ would it have been right to keep him there, even if the law was unjust? A few thousand members of Jehovah's Witnesses died in the 3rd Reich for their unwillingness to conscript in the Wehrmacht.

       Laws change and if we come to the conclusion that the ban of marihuana was unjust we should free the people convicted due to this law. Starting in the states where Cannabis is legal and giving it some time will work out fine..

       It was just an example to illustrate how deprivation of something can lead to unhealthy over consumption when it is suddenly in abundance, the transition must be eased. Nothing else from that situation was intended to supplement my point. I suspect you may have skimmed through my post in frustration under the premise that I was saying something I wasn't.

       Myth: Prisons are full of people in for marijuana possession
      </h2>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Fact:
       </strong>
       About 750,000 people are arrested every year for marijuana offenses in the U.S. There's a lot of variation across states in what happens next. Not all arrests lead to prosecutions, and relatively few people prosecuted and convicted of simple possession end up in jail. Most are fined or are placed into community supervision. About 40,000 inmates of state and federal prison have a current conviction involving marijuana, and about half of them are in for marijuana offenses alone; most of these were involved in distribution. Less than one percent are in for possession alone.

       How many people are actually in prison for possession of small amounts of weed and nothing else? I don't know so I'll be glad to see proof, but I have a feeling the number is really low, certainly I'd be shocked if it's really "tens of thousands".

       I am assuming by "minor marijuana possession" you mean personal use amount, not selling and no other crime attached to it. If you meant something else then, never mind.

       Unfortunately we have  "sentencing enhancing," game of multiple charges, possession, possession for sale, (if over an ounce), public intoxication, resisting arrest, (can be added to any charge), I have a homeless friend who was re-arrested and jailed for being homeless while on parole, when there was no housing/job available.  So many laws to be broken.

       Oh,  you caught me making trouble over here!   Hemp too,  such great prospects,  energy wise,  environment wise.   The fact that Obama opened his mouth on this,  at this time,  its somewhat remarkable.   In cosmic time,  things are moving pretty fast.   But for the 25 year old in jail who won't get to see his kid grow up,  things move a little too slow.   People look.   Things change.

       It depends to the degree they offended the law, even though I agree that marijuana for recreational use should be legal I don't think that someone who got caught with a hundred pounds of pot or something should be pardoned. Breaking the law to that degree is excessive and unnaceptable even if it is just a plant. Plus, I don't think you can get really far in the drug market even as I said before it is "just a plant" by being a stand up sweethearted guy necessarily. The fact is in a lot of cases you really can just get a job..

       The President can only pardon those convicted of federal crimes, not state. That law would have to change first, and that's not happening. This is why several individuals up for the death penalty could not be pardoned, even when their guilt was in doubt. (I do agree with the idea, but not going to happen.)

       Agreed. Cannabis is the world's best hope for understanding our planet and the world better in the coming years. There are 421 different cannabinoids and a large number of combinations of these cannabinoids are so useful. Some of them turn off hunger. Some of them kill cancer. Some of them stop panic attacks.

       I didn't think of that.   You have me worried now,  what could happen to those poor people if the prisons lose beds!   Oh,  maybe we could turn them into state funded universities?    Eco communities?   Or maybe stockholders took a bet on corruption that they should have thought more about.   Capitalism isn't capitalism without risk.

       So,  if there was a law against drinking,  like prohibition,  and prohibition ended,  would you also say that people in jail for drinking should also be held for their entire term?   Maybe we also need to end the prohibition on possessing a joint.   Ridiculous is ridiculous.   Enough is enough.

       I would like to see the statistics on these tens of thousands of people who are in prison for
       <em>
        minor
       </em>
       possession of a joint, and this is the only reason they were jailed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe you'll find that it is a  much smaller number than what you think it is.  Possession of small amounts of marijuana (with no reason to be declared as intent to sell) is not something that is typically punished with lengthy prison sentences.  I believe you are probably considering more of the instances where they ended up imprisoned with a three strike rule or some other such rule - where a multitude of minor offenses eventually leads to a larger sentence.

       The bottom line is that the vast majority of our prisoners are in jail for minor, non-violent drug offenses (in most cases weed).  That is immoral, unjust, and insane any way you slice it - if you wanna go on rationalizing it to yourself for whatever reason, be my guest.  Just don't expect me to agree with you.

       You are entitled to your opinion.   Its a strange world.   I tend to think that most prison experiences are harsh and inhumane.   It hurts to think of harmless people who committed no violent or property crime wasting away in hellish conditions,  their precious lives being wrongfully stolen from them day,  after day,  month after month, year after year.   I wouldn't wish that on a dog.

       American prisons are hardly harsh or inhumane. Some inmates live better on the inside than they ever could on the outside. Maybe you're watching too many movies. You seem to be more worried about these prisoner's "precious lives being wrongfully stolen" than they are. Trust me, most of these people aren't precious and nothing was stolen.

       These are criminals, plain and simple. They broke the law. Is it a stupid law? Maybe, but it's SO incredibly rare that someone gets thrown in jail for a small marijuana charge.. the people in jail for marijuana-related crimes have obviously either done something else on top of it or they've been caught distributing a large amount.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole post is ridiculous. It's never going to happen, it doesn't matter if Obama should or shouldn't do it. I personally don't understand why he should. I'm a pot smoker and an advocate for legalization but the proposition is insane for so many reasons.

       People don't get jail time for a small marijuana charge. They get a fine, they get some kind of rehab program, they do community service, there's nobody rotting in prison for having a gram of weed that doesn't also have a number of other charges.

      <p>
       Again, not true in all cases.  Stop speaking in absolutes.  Also, what are these "other charges" you're talking about that "they" were supposedly all charged with?  Are those laws equally unjust and immoral?

       I've never heard of somebody going to jail for having a small amount of pot unless they were committing other crimes, wanted for other crimes, were on probation or parole, stuff like that.

      <p>
       I'd be super interested in seeing an example of someone who was sent to prison for no other crime but possession.

       While of course for this to happen, the federal government would have to (long-due) de-criminilize drug possession (for personal use) and consumption, even if solely for marijuana, and apply it retroactively.

       Whoa... hold up there,.... you just can't go releasing these potheads out into the wild all willy nilly... what if they get our daughters hooked on pot and then rape them? Do you want pothead babies running around all over the country? They'll get us all hooked on pot and then the Chinese will invade and use us all as their personal sex slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       And another thing.... if they let all these potheads out of jail, do you realize how the demand for pot will skyrocket and maybe it'll even create a shortage? What will decent folks do then with pot in short supply and the price going even higher?
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you want thousands of pothead babies and to be some guy named Chin Loo's sex slave, I say leave 'em in. leave 'em all in. Pot is already too high.

       The average weed offender in jail hasn't just been hassled "for a joint". They've been repeat offenders who show addictive behavior, rather than responsible recreational use. I do believe in an individual's right to cultivate. I don't believe in drug dealing that perpetuates violence or funds for other "harder" drugs. Regardless of your feelings about fines or jail time, a lot of these "offenders" should have just abided by the law. You're not a "political prisoner" if you skip court or failed to pay a fine, you're a dumbass.

       I disagree with you here.  I think you'd be surprised how many non-violent, minor drug crimes have been prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is criminal, immoral, and unjust, especially when you consider that one of the main reasons most of the drugs are even on the streets in the first place is because our lovely government literally funds (runs?) and arms drug cartels around the world.

       That's why they go after the people who grow pot rather than make meth. Pot heads are easier to catch and don't get outrageously combative if arrested. Where as meth heads are dangerous,  will booby-trap their home, and have been up for a minimum of 3 days so they're already hallucinating.

       So,  if there was a law against drinking,  like prohibition,  and prohibition ended,  would you also say that people in jail for drinking should also be held for their entire term?   Maybe we also need to end the prohibition on possessing a joint.   Ridiculous is ridiculous.   Enough is enough.

       dude.
       <em>
        they broke the law
       </em>
       . i agree that they should be pardoned in the states where marijuana is now legal, and actually if you want this to happen you should start telling people to get in touch with the governors of CO and WA.
      </p>
      <p>
       but you have to understand that just because a law is changed/repealed, that doesn't automatically erase the fact that it was a crime when it was committed.

       Dude, as you get older you'll see how exactly opposite to hellish living in the states is. There are unjust laws, but this isn't the 'evil empire.'  As far as the law being unjust, standing up against unjust laws or people means taking the beating or prison term, for the good of all, or just your own conscience.  When you break a law and get caught, you get punished.

       Socially conservative organizations are for the prohibition of marijuana.  They are not silent on this subject at all.

       yeah, the system as it is is bullshit. but demanding that the president go over the heads of the states [which he would never do because it's political fucking suicide and he's a little smarter than that] and release thousands of prisoners into a shitty job market at once? really? you
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       be inevitably disappointed if that's the kind of shit you want to happen overnight. it doesn't work that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       baby steps. seriously. contact the governors in CO and WA. contact the state reps. make enough of a stink that they have to at least
       <em>
        talk
       </em>
       about it. i'm not telling you it'll never happen, i'm trying to tell you
