    <div class="md"><p>Wonder why they&#39;re leaving New York out of the requests. I&#39;ve actually <em>seen</em> armed and uniformed soldiers in Penn Station, guarding and patrolling in fire team size elements. They had open carry sidearms instead of battle rifles, weren&#39;t in body armor or anything, but it was pretty plain that they were being used in a civilian policing capacity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How so?</p>

<p>Are the bomb sniffing dogs that often accompany police at penn station also just for civilian policing?</p>

<p>Do you think it has to do with penn station being one of the busiest rail stations in America?</p>

<p>Lots of corruption there. I&#39;m to understand that it&#39;s the most corrupted Police department in Oregon, from what the Oregonian is stating. An Officer of that department is bring up charges against 12 of his <del>commanders</del>co-workers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow thats kinda crazy I wouldn&#39;t have thought Oregon was that bad. My house in a nice area of Portland was robbed and the swat came to my house and went through all my stuff (I swear to god they took some of my money that was sitting out. and it wasn&#39;t the thief because the thief took my bag of chump change and didnt find my cash, but some of the cash was missing. So I think some douche bag cop made a extra 200 bucks real quick while he was in my room.) and when I got home to talk to them all they wanted to talk about was the beer I had in my room and the bong on my dresser. Treated me like a criminal, took my stuff and left. I even told them the exact person who robbed my house because it was a &quot;friend&quot; who knew I was out of town. and they never did shit.</p>
