    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the plea bargain, it&#39;s the statutes creating the punishments and crimes. It&#39;s also the fact that many people don&#39;t know how to interact with law enforcement, or know their rights.  I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve worked with criminal defendants, but many admit to the cops exactly what they are accused of, or are caught red handed. In many cases a defendant will let police search their house without a warrant, or agree to do a roadside test. Another issue you may not be aware of are the sheer number of cases that are Motions to Revoke probation/parole. You have no right to trial for these cases, and many of these are argued straight to the judge.  Additionally, the Constitution gives you rights and allows you to knowingly waive these rights. The way to curb the prison population is to change the laws and educate people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once I went to court for &#39;right on red &#39; red light camera violation. When I went in, the judge said &quot;anyone who pleas guilty automatically has their ticked reduced to 100$&quot;
And &quot;for those of you thinking about contesting your tickets..: you will have to go sit back down until the end of the court, them schedule a date. You will be responsible for all court costs that may exceed $500.and I will schedule traffic school also.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is that even legal?</p>

<p>If we cannot afford to enforce the law as stipulated in the constitution, and to guarantee the rights of all accused, then we need to reduce the number of things that are considered to be &#39;crimes.&#39;</p>

<p>I know in my town they will lock you up for a year if you fight a summons and large fine from Animal Care and Control - usually due to owning an unneutered, unlicensed dog.</p>

<p>How in God&#39;s name is it justified to call that a crime?  Who is running this country - Bob Barker?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the severity of sentences should be its own issue that we should focus on, not trying to tie it to plea bargains. I think things like drug possession should have no jail time. Let&#39;s work on that instead of taking on the morality of plea bargains, first. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I think we must first, last and always defend and maintain the guarantees in the Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>None of this could be happening to us if those guarantees had not been eroded in our many &#39;wars&#39; on drugs, on gangs, on urban communities... basically, wars on our own citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I think we need to step farther back than that even.  The most broken thing about our country is MSM, IMO. Without an informed public, nothing will change.  If the public was fully informed of the penalty received for not taking a plea, I believe things would change.  CNN, MSNBC, never owed it to the public to produce informative news. But ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX are using public airwaves licensed from the American people.  They do owe it to the public to inform us of both sides of any story relevant to the people. </p>

<p>Yes, genocide occurs around the world - but you need only visit any black, urban community to see that this &quot;genocide by prison&quot; has taken a terrible and unexcusable toll on human rights.</p>

<p>BTW, wouldn&#39;t you concede that if you have to look to Iran and Nigeria to say the USA is OK on human rights, we have a real problem?  Especially considering the Bill of Rights.  Unfortunately, they only print that on toilet paper anymore.</p>
