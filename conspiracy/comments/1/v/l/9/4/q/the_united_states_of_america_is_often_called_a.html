       If we don't reform the plea bargain system we will still be stuffing people into prison like pigs into a slaughterhouse.

       I agree with what you are saying - that would take serious and lasting public support of campaign expenses, and declaring the current system openly as what it has been proven to be:  A legal system of bribes.

       It's not the plea bargain, it's the statutes creating the punishments and crimes. It's also the fact that many people don't know how to interact with law enforcement, or know their rights.  I don't know if you've worked with criminal defendants, but many admit to the cops exactly what they are accused of, or are caught red handed. In many cases a defendant will let police search their house without a warrant, or agree to do a roadside test. Another issue you may not be aware of are the sheer number of cases that are Motions to Revoke probation/parole. You have no right to trial for these cases, and many of these are argued straight to the judge.  Additionally, the Constitution gives you rights and allows you to knowingly waive these rights. The way to curb the prison population is to change the laws and educate people.

       Assuming your point is correct, how does it change my comment? When confronted by police be polite and quiet. If they want to search anything you decline. If they want to question you, you say that you do not talk to police without anattorney present.

       Plea bargaining is wrong. It's a loaded game. In a court there are no guarantees as to the winner. Every case is a gamble. Heads you get a slap on the wrist Tails you get eviscerated. Choose.

       If they want to plead guilty, fine.

       Using threats of severe punishment if they exercise their constitutionally guaranteed rights to trial by jury is not fine.  In fact, it is a travesty of both justice and international human rights guidelines.

       Once I went to court for 'right on red ' red light camera violation. When I went in, the judge said "anyone who pleas guilty automatically has their ticked reduced to 100$"
And "for those of you thinking about contesting your tickets..: you will have to go sit back down until the end of the court, them schedule a date. You will be responsible for all court costs that may exceed $500.and I will schedule traffic school also."

       How is that even legal?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we cannot afford to enforce the law as stipulated in the constitution, and to guarantee the rights of all accused, then we need to reduce the number of things that are considered to be 'crimes.'

       But the severity of sentences should be its own issue that we should focus on, not trying to tie it to plea bargains. I think things like drug possession should have no jail time. Let's work on that instead of taking on the morality of plea bargains, first.

       No, I think we must first, last and always defend and maintain the guarantees in the Bill of Rights.

       None of this could be happening to us if those guarantees had not been eroded in our many 'wars' on drugs, on gangs, on urban communities... basically, wars on our own citizens.

       Honestly, I think we need to step farther back than that even.  The most broken thing about our country is MSM, IMO. Without an informed public, nothing will change.  If the public was fully informed of the penalty received for not taking a plea, I believe things would change.  CNN, MSNBC, never owed it to the public to produce informative news. But ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX are using public airwaves licensed from the American people.  They do owe it to the public to inform us of both sides of any story relevant to the people.

       Yes, genocide occurs around the world - but you need only visit any black, urban community to see that this "genocide by prison" has taken a terrible and unexcusable toll on human rights.

       BTW, wouldn't you concede that if you have to look to Iran and Nigeria to say the USA is OK on human rights, we have a real problem?  Especially considering the Bill of Rights.  Unfortunately, they only print that on toilet paper anymore.

       Yes my friend you make a good point.  Then again, look who has been running black urban communities like Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia.
The people that supposedly have the blacks "best interests" in mind.

       Everyone calls you the prison nation because you have a greater proportion of your population in prison than any other country. You only give foreign aid to buy politician's and/or raw materials or sell munitions. Listen to Noam Chomsky, get educated, wise up.
