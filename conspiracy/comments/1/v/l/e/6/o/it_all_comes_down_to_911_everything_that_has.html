       This ball was rolling a long, long time before 9/11. Gulf of Tonkin, Pearl Harbor, Napoleonic Wars. Folks have been getting rich off of goading folks into fighting since antiquity. I'm not sure what it exactly comes down to, but I doubt it happened that recently. Have an ^ though, for being as cynical as me.

       Yet this time is unique in human history, because we finally have the means to be aware of these machinations, while they are happening, and communicate our ideas instantly to billions across the globe.  We, the people of planet earth, are finally at a time where those who have, throughout history, exploited us to this or that end, can no longer do so trusting in the ignorance of the masses.  Historically speaking, we finally have a chance to turn things around.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why this time is both so exciting and so dangerous.  We are in uncharted territory.  There is no historical model that encompasses all the elements of this equation.  One thing is certain, it won't be boring.

       You know what I wanted to do better than I?
Your arrogance knows no bounds, does it?  I didn't want to be as mean as my original comment had been. You didn't deserve it. But now you're starting to convince me otherwise. Get a real education and stop loitering around on blogs and the Internet. Then instead of being an armchair expert who thinks he knows what he's talking about you can write research papers and publish works that prove you do.

       So my first statement, which you misread, initially drove you to be mean, according to you.  Then, you felt bad and decided I probably didn't deserve it.  Now, you are back to thinking I do deserve it.  I have to ask, are you bi polar?

       I would be interested in knowing how you've determined what kind of education I've had.  As to your advice on where I should spend my time, I think it is more than a tad presumptious of you to even make a suggestion in that regard.  After all, who are

       And you had the nerve to call me arrogant.

       That's ok, I think I'll just keep doing what I am doing.  You are more than welcome to take your own advice.

       lol.  Even then though, it's important to recognize that we all have a limited ability to process information and we're constantly bombarded with new information.  Sometimes we just have to go with something whether it's truly valid or not just because we can only handle so much.  I think that's partly why we like to remain ignorant.  I'm not saying it's ok, I just think people aren't so much dumbasses, as just too tired from dealing with all the shit sometimes to actually adopt and incorporate new info.  Especially when they're bombarded with old status quo-entrenching information daily in the media.  We are trained to be obedient sheep.  It doesn't make us dumbasses, it makes us slaves.  The kind of slaves that hate the other slaves.

       there was simply too many beneficiaries from such a tragedy for the official story to be the total and complete truth.  also, its something that goes unnoticed a lot until it was pointed out in a documentary i watched, and it is that 9/11 was never treated like a crime, just like the 2008 financial meltdown. neither followed proper protocol with regard to proper detective work, just played on your emotions with no trials or in depth reporting of the who, what, when and why. both "investigations" were rushed and evidence was tampered with and/or outright destroyed (shipping the metal from the towers to China?) as fast as possible.

       Think of it as an exponentially growing ball of shit. I cannot agree more that this is a complicated issue, but the increase in parasitic corruption since 9/11 is, imho, greater than in any previous increase since the founding of the Federal Reserve; It is bleeding through the 4th Branch's cracks. This post 9/11 world seems to be more aware than ever, but with that comes the illusion that the inverse is true due to the increased gap size. Even if the newly awake only see this over generalization, they will have a great starting point. We
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       do this.

       It's not about failing to handle the evidence. I grew up believing in the conspiracy theories about 9/11. Particularly WTC 7. Yet as I grew older and learned to look at the world in a subjective way I realized that these theories are fantasy, they try to explain anomalies in this event with a conclusion already in mind and this isn't correct. All of these theories do not stand up to serious scrutiny, and when people try they get called out as shills. My standards are too high to accept this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I realized that the writers of these theories aren't exactly trustworthy or subjective. Most of them do it for money, so they have an interest in keeping their work interesting because they will make more money if they do. It is called yellow journalism, and it sells.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the website you wanted to link is obviously biased. They have an agenda to keep their narrative interesting so they get more clicks. It is a business, plain and simple. I don't know about you, but I don't trust a business to tell me what to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't appreciate you calling me a traitor or a tool because I have standards in what I believe. I think you are being childish so I wont judge you because it's obvious you have some growing up to do.

       Dude the theory of the towers being demolished by thermite charges has been scientifically proven by all available evidence and experimentation which YOU can legally do at home if you really refuse to believe others.

       There, you CAN NOT refute the evidence provided in this video, it's literally impossible as it passes all scientific scrutiny as there are multiple forms of documentation for most all evidence such as the molten steel cores, temperature analysis from NASA, NIST data which was "erroneously mistyped" and had to be corrected when it proved their theories WRONG, further NIST data that is straight up wrong about the type of construction, video evidence of molten steel pouring out of the buildings which completely DISPROVES the molten aluminum mixed with furniture BS that NIST tried to claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude it's just irrefutable, this isn't loose change or some other speculation based non-sense. This is based on hard evidence and testable provable science.

       I don't buy your youtube video. I've watched it before and I thought it was thorough, but upon further research I've realized it is only a theory. And as a theory it is outlandish, complicated, flawed and full of wishful thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe the thermite theory, there is very little evidence to suggest thermite was used, and the evidence there is can be explained by a much simpler and rational way.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I've said before, these people are coming up with the conclusion before they have done their investigation.

       LOL, this is a pathetic attempt at "debunking" the video, as the video PROVES multiple claims of your source to be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Let's forget for a moment that thermite doesn't explode so the claims of hearing explosions become meaningless."
      </p>
      <p>
       Thermite can explode when shaped into a specific charge, it's basic physics and the video proves it.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Let's also give ourselves selective amnesia and pretend thermite can burn sideways to melt vertical columns. Maybe with some device but no working device has been proven to me to work."
      </p>
      <p>
       What, so he's going off of the proof that he's seen thus far? Apparently he hasn't seen the youtube video I linked to you that proves how thermite can cut however you shape it to and shows you the very simply constructed device which does it, which again is basic physics and engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are either a shill, or somebody who is in massive denial and incapable of accepting scientifically irrefutable evidence which you can also replicate yourself, making it even more absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a waste of time, I have presented you clear evidence yet you act as if it's fake, while not being able to actually explain why.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt you watched the video because you don't even make any claims as to what presented is "outlandish, flawed, or full of wishful thinking".
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the most pathetic attempt to discredit proof that I have ever seen.

       I think it's probably a sign of greater intelligence to be able to use the simplest words possible.  People who have to use larger words to get the point across are in some deficit and it definitely can be an obstacle depending on the audience.  I actually do wish I were better at avoiding fancier words.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean to debate you, either.  When I say that you show bad faith, I mean it sincerely- you might serve yourself better by being inoffensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, if your concern is with the members of the community, and not the issues being discussed, you're probably not contributing much and should maybe go away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I try to avoid an us vs. them mentality, so I try to reason with anyone who will engage me.  This can be naive or wasteful of me, yet it's what I choose.

       The fact that the majority buy into the official story is more depressing than the incident itself in my mind. It's telliing of the intelligence of the average person and also something much graver: scientism (pseudoskepticism) is the prevailing attitude among those who are considered intellectuals, rather than the Baconian scientific method.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that this is the reason why Jones and Gage became so outspoken about it. The body of scientific and architectural knowledge is tainted because of that day, and every cell in their body demanded that they pursue it without looking back.

       journalists on the day didn't buy into it, not the ones who were not actively part of the NY MSM. notice it was the NY TV companies that supplied most of the

       from 'Harley guy' the fox dude, to one of the weather persons, and the actual TV execs living in Manhattan that talked to anchors. people that strangely don't have wikipedia pages unlike 99.9% of people working in MSM, media people thrive on publicity, from the lowest to the highest, its all about selling oneself.

       It's not that they know, it's that they can't do so in order to function. The stigma is too damaging. And it most certainly isn't pointless. You can't be oblivious to the fact that this has been the biggest catalyst for societal change since the second world war, like: multiple wars, security measures for traveling, and the worst one by far in my opinion: an increase in suspicion, hate, and disdain for your neighbor.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no doubt in my mind that the hate and distrust between people in the zeitgeist is the reason for increased police brutality. This world turned much colder since that day, and your attempt to rationalize it away is understandable, but not justified. The negative impact on Arabs around the world has also been unimaginably huge. It's unfair to call it pointless from their point of view, just because we're relatively warm and snugly in our lives.

       I believe that is for two reasons: One, they, like me for a while, can't believe that the president and vice-president would do such a thing, and Two, they haven't been exposed to the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel flattered when I am called a conspiracy theorist, though I tend to deny it and explain I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I'm a conspiracy expert. But I think of older theories, the theory of heliocentrism (that the earth circles around the sun), the germ theory, the theory of evolution. The theory of 911 is like those theories, an explanation supported by the preponderance of evidence.

       The fact that you're in media also makes you kindof biased, as is evidenced by your retort which contains the personal attack "you're such a dick", it seems you are personally offended by any criticism levied against media.

       Not any… I am just sick of assumptions like that. I work at a radio station, with pop culture stuff. It's all nonsense and fun, it does not mean I am some cover-up artist who knows 911 was a government job. Thinking that everyone in media is like that is so uninformed. Maybe I just read it wrong. I also had a very beloved Uncle get killed in tower 2, and I know that terrorists killed him, not the government. Not through lies, but fact, research, and careful consideration. I'm not here to shit all over your conspiracy theorists, I just really truly believe you are wrong about 911, and I wish you'd see it.

       Not everyone involved in a conspiracy has to know they're involved.  While im positive that you are not an active participant in covering up any conspiracy, you are a cog in a machine that benefits from the publics distraction through pop culture.

       So, you can concede that you have a horse in the race, and in your position (albeit a "nonsense and fun" one), you represent your opinion on the matter- which is only proper, if you ask me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to see any proof you might have, yet you may not care to provide any information personally, nor do I expect you to.

      <p>
       Many "conspiracy theorists" are soured on Noam Chomsky's take on 9/11 and any debate over domestic complicity regarding the event.  He says "who cares", because if you have to prove a giant conspiracy to find any wrongdoing related to foreign policy or the abuses of the security industry, you're terribly inept.  At least that's my take on it, as there's plenty of shady stuff going on out in the open.  I would maintain that the 9/11 attacks are a symptom of those wrongdoings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate your belief, and your generosity in sharing it.  I'll conclude by saying collusion hypothesis might be a more apt term than conspiracy theory.

       I think there may be an even larger tapestry with 9/11 being just a piece of the overall picture. 9/11 allows for Western Governments to impose restrictions, militarize domestic law enforcement and spy on it's citizens. In twenty years time tens of millions of jobs will be lost to sophisticated quasi intelligent robots and mechanized systems. Unemployment and hence poverty will increase exponentially and there will be rioting and attempts to overthrow Governments. 9/11 may just be the first move in a long game to ensure that those with the power keep the power. It may have been advantageous to Israel that it happened and they may have been complicit in the planning and execution but I think that was just the cherry on the cake.

       Alright, what is your explanation of events. I don't know what you are advocating. Do you have a proposal or hypothesis that explains what happened on 9/11. If so, how does it differ from the "official story" (a.k.a the standard historical account supported by multiple unaffiliated organizations).

       As far as I'm aware, none other places (or any conspiracy theory site/group) offers anything remotely close to an alternative narrative or hypothesis.

       It's literally all just negative assertions about the "official story"

       The 9/11 Truth movement is based on evidence showing that the official story cannot possibly be true. That's the whole idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "official" conspiracy theory consists if the 9/11 Commission report and various FEMA and NIST reports costing millions of dollars to produce. As far as I know, no single independent researcher, or even a group of researchers, has the funds or resources to provide an "alternative hypothesis" to all of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were to request an alternative explanation for any one single issue them I'm sure someone here or at
       <a href="/r/911Truth">
        /r/911Truth
       </a>
       could point you to some relevant sites or documents. I would suggest that you make a new submission with a specific request and not expect a complete solution for the entire operation in one fell swoop.

       I'd contend the that 9/11 Truth movement is based on the assumption that the official story cannot be possibly true, and generates doubt of any and all aspects they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       While a hypothesis covering the whole event may be asking a bit much (even the "official story" doesn't really have a single document on
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       ) - I'd be interested to see one for even any of the major events.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entirety of WTC7 discussion, for example, is centred around the idea that NIST's findings are impossible. They speculate that explosives were required. But there is simply no proposal put forward on how explosives were supposed to create the end result.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same goes for the collapses of WTC 1 and 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 Truth consists entirely of disconnected, often contradictory, assertions around the legitimacy of the "official" 9/11 explanation. Any assertions about the infeasibility of the conspiracy proposals (such as the lack of explosive sounds in WTC7 collapse) are brushed off or dismissed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may be generalising, but that's definitely my experience. I've never seen anything that comes close to an alternative hypothesis on any significant aspect of 9/11. Literally the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       detailed studies and accounts of the events are those that support the "official story" - either from government investigations (9/11 Commission, NIST, etc) or from independent researchers and academics.

       NIST claims that the collapse of WTC7 was initiated by the failure of column 79 due to heat. If that were even possible, then an alternative explanation might be that
       <em>
        only one
       </em>
       shaped cutting charge would have been necessary to cause column 79 to fail and the resulting total collapse. Being isolated from the outside by several walls no sound would be heard by people outside either. Considering NIST's failure to include key structural components (
       <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/news-section/41-articles/767-fraud-exposed-in-nist-wtc-7-reports-part-2-of-5.html">
        stiffener plates
       </a>
       ) in their model, the failure of column 79
       <em>
        due to heat
       </em>
       is very unlikely. Thus something else would be required to cause it's failure if the collapse was initiated there.

       That's an interesting idea, but there are two problems that I can see...
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, it relies on knowledge we gained
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the collapse - it's highly unlikely that, without very extensive modelling beforehand, it would be considered likely that failure of a single column would reliably cause a full structural failure. If demolition was the goal it would be a very risky way to achieve it (on a tangential side note, the same goes for the idea that thermite was used - it has no history of use in that type of application - a critical and highly public operation would hardly be the place to prove the concept)
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, it doesn't address the idea that the collapse, as witnessed, is a "classic controlled demolition" and that the short period of free fall would be impossible within NIST's collapse model. The argument there is that it would require the destruction of
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       supporting columns, over about 8 floors, at the same time to create the collapse that we saw.
      </p>
      <p>
       And ultimately this is the problem...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to say "it was explosives" but there's simply no detail on
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       explosives did it. Regardless of the flaws and failings in NIST's report it is still, ultimately, the only detailed hypothesis for the collapse. The model is, according the majority of experts, accurate and sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST have presented a full explanation for the events, in detail. Nobody has presented an alternative.

       The main problem is that all of the evidence against NIST's report (and the 9/11 Commission Report) has been studied by various individuals or small groups and the information is spread far and wide. Again, that's a result of a lack of funding and resources.

       I'm not saying that there aren't theories, of course there are. What I'm saying is that there are only snippets of ideas. No one has ever put forth an alternative narrative, for either the whole event or even substantial portions of it.

      <p>
       The problem is that's a tiny snippet - ignoring the long-since debunked photographs - it simply says "building can be demolished with shaped charges" and suggest that a few tiny puffs of smoke are evidence of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does nothing to address the real questions that are raised immediately by that assertion, for example; how did the charges get there? how did no one notice them? how could they be positioned so perfectly? why do there appear to be so few?

      <p>
       I'm not aware of any published papers refuting NIST's overall findings in any detail. There are differing opinions on the precise mechanics of the initial failure, but not the overall collapse or the ability of fire to cause it. Again, people like AE911Truth attack aspects of the report, but they never explain precisely how it's impossible, or present an alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while 9/11 Truth advocates may have difficulty finding funding, that hasn't stopped hundreds of other academics from studying aspects of 9/11 and publishing papers that, in general, agree with the conclusions of the official investigations.

      <p>
       I've certainly never seen anything close to proof of that. Plenty of other groups have managed to study the events of 9/11 without government funds.

       I honestly don't think they have. Every time a question is raised someone
       <em>
        comes up
       </em>
       with an answer, but those are ad hoc and often conflict with answers to other questions. I'm genuinely interested to see a complete narrative -
       <em>
        this happened, then this, then this
       </em>
       - that actually gets from A to B and provides a logically consistent path. I haven't seen one - if you see one around, I'd be interested to look.

       I'm interested in this stuff, but I don't really want to argue endlessly and be told to watch a million YouTube videos and read a hundred blog posts - and that's where that usually goes, and I've done all that before. I'll just continue to offer my opinion from time to time.

       To entertain all possibilities. I am asking for elaboration, and I will consider it fully. You have claimed that anyone who still accepts and promotes the "official" story is either a traitor or a tool. That is an extremely bold assertion. You must have reasons for making it. You must have an alternative explanation that you find more plausible, if not probable. I'd like to hear it.

       Most of the 911 truthers on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       have read hundreds or thousands of articles, looked at hundreds of videos. But since you don't want to do that you are clearly not serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here is a place to start, Michael Meacher's
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/sep/06/september11.iraq">
        "This War On Terrorism is Bogus"
       </a>
       . Meacher was on Tony Blair's cabinet for 6 years. But it's just a start. Read that then...look at
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW6mJOqRDI4">
        Architects and Engineers for 911 Truth: Experts Speak Out
       </a>
       . That is long but worth it. Then, at least, your questions won't look so foolish.

       I too spent years reading what probably amounted to thousands of articles and viewed many videos. Dismissing me with the usual tactic of claiming I am ignorant isn't going to work in this case. The ad hominem attacks are also simply tiresome.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the interest of being generous (which is necessary for any conversation to be fruitful), I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you are responding this way due to repeatedly being attacked poorly by others in the past for your beliefs. I am not trying to do that. So let me clarify and try again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not trying to embarrass you. I am not trolling you. I don't believe I have written anything but sincere questions for information. I apologize if anything I asked has offended you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not asking for links to other peoples statements (although I do appreciate the ones you have provided, I have already seen both of those). I am asking to know what YOU believe happened. YOU are the one who made the bold claims in your post about those who accept and promote the "official" story. If you would like to post links to refer me to evidence for your case, please do so. But actually MAKE your case. I don't even know what you are claiming yet, let alone whether it is valid or not. Sending me away to some other persons scattered video clip is not going to answer the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, simply state your claim. We can deal with evidence to support it once I know what your explanation is.

       Shill, you just don't get it. And you have not read even one article, much less a thousand.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I think about 911 is not important. 911 truth is a communal activity. We share information and it's evaluated by the community. Not just on reddit but across the internet and off it. Sometimes disinformation shills like you put out bad information, and the community evaluates it and decides it's nonsense. I'm not a researcher on 911, I'm a mere follower. What I think doesn't matter. I gave you some links for good information but you weren't interested. I have only been at the head of the pack on two things that I researched extensively,
       <a href="http://www.newsgarden.org/columns/anthrax/anthraxterrorist.shtml">
        anthrax
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://www.newsgarden.org/columns/alllietrust.shtml">
        election fraud
       </a>
       . These days I collect information on torture and someday hope to see the torturers and assassins tried in a Nuremberg type trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I think about 911 is not significant. Everyone reviews the evidence and makes up their own mind. If you weren't a shill you would know that.

       No but there was a NIST one. And one commissioned by Silverstien. That was pretty funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people have learned if they question 911 they lose their jobs. A scientist at Underwriters Lab questioned it in an email and it got out and he was fired. Griffin was fired. People learn to lie. Especially those NIST people. Which makes me wonder how long they have been lying. How many causes of airplane crashes they have lied about. They have no credibility at all.

       Amazing.  Hundreds of scientists and engineers are all cowards, and Richard Gage is the brave one.  No chance Gage is just flat out wrong, or better yet, that he's
       <em>
        actively making money
       </em>
       off of peddling 9/11 conspiracy garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's telling that the American Institute of Architects, the group that Gage constantly touts his membership in, have publicly stated they want nothing to do with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no comment at all on the actual science involved, hey?  Just tar the entire scientific community as complicit in the coverup.  So much for your "a couple dozen Americans" theory.

       You're right, I don't get it. I'm still not sure what you mean by "shill", but it appears that it means you somehow believe I am "in on" something with someone. In on what? I don't know. With who? I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I know I am writing all this of my own volition, with no other agenda, merely trying to find out what you're talking about. If you have reason to suspect otherwise, and you think I am somehow associated with people I don't know about, please inform me ASAP. I would like to get that figured out right away, do you feel that I'm in danger? Get back to me on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what you mean when you say "Sometimes disinformation shills like you put out bad information". I don't believe I've put out ANY information. I have asked to know what you are saying. I have yet to find out. There are a few things you said that seem to be the model of truth however. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm not a researcher on 911,"
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm a mere follower."
      </p>
      <p>
       "What I think doesn't matter."
      </p>
      <p>
       "...what I think about 911 is not significant."
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all pearls of wisdom which you should share with others upon first meeting them. Perhaps you would consider these as attractive tattoo options for such locations as your forehead or chin?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're playing a game. It's a shell game. You make the most outlandish statements about people, you make vague and ominous assertions about all sorts of things. But if you are pressed to simply give a straight answer on what your version of what happened on 9/11 is? you shift. 
You know, there's a very clear reason why you won't allow yourself to be pinned down to a direct statement on what you think happened. It's because you know full well (either consciously or subconsciously) that any such statement would crumple under the weight of a 5 minute fact-check.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask you a straight question. It's a fair question. What is your explanation for the events of 9/11? and you won't answer. "What I think doesn't matter."??? It does if you're the one calling the majority of the planet either traitors or tools! That wasn't a "communal activity". That wasn't "evaluated by the community". YOU SAID IT. I want to know on what grounds. On what basis do you get off making such an audacious claim? You won't answer. Well than shut the fuck up about it.

       A lot of these conspiracies are out in the open with little on no consequences for the perpetrators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some examples include the financial meltdown, LIBOR scandal, fast and furious, HSBC laundering money for drug cartels, the invasions of both Iraq and afghanistan, the FBI conspiring with banks to shut down occupy wall st, and the NSA scandals.
      </p>
      <p>
       And those are just recent examples.  You still have things like the Gulf of Tonkin, Bay of pigs, Iran contra, and the USS liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost no one went to jail for any of these crimes.  They don't have to hide shit because there's never any punishment.

       So, what do you think we, the American public, can do about it?  I, too, am sickened by the lack of any real consequences for the people that will take extreme risks that benefit them, and only hurt us.  I feel rather helpless to do much about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always thought that it will simply take enough of these scandals to push the public over the edge, but it seems we have an all-too-healthy appetite for forgiving/forgetting these things.

       Interesting question. I think at most, only a few dozen Americans were involved in 911. I think Mossad was recruited because they could be trusted not to tell, while Americans could not be trusted. The Americans who were involved were members of US intelligence and had spent their lives hiding evil.

       If it truly is a small group of people that know what really went down, then it's a bit more understandable.  However, wouldn't there be people in the media that have to know something?  Using the media as an example, wouldn't there be reporters that dig and dig until they uncover something?  Are these people killed or silenced?  If they are silenced, who is telling them to stop digging?  The media company's CEO?  Does that mean he/she knows something?

       I don't doubt that the American public is in the dark on so many things, but why is there so much complacency and apathy about finding out the truth and/or punishing wrongdoers?

       Mossad definitely had a hand. And yeah, there isn't always a whistle-blower with the courage to blow.... the whistle. The Manhattan Project had tens of thousands of employees, and no information was released until they wanted it released. I think it's just keeping all the players in the know just enough so they could carry out tasks, but not see the connected whole of events.

       9/11 was a necessity to keep the system of corruption running. And the system of corruption is what allows America to be a top superpower. It's a dog eat dog world, always has been, always will be. Until we evolve into a type 1 civilization, assuming a disaster doesn't wipe out every single human being. Think about it, our world is much safer today than hundreds of years ago. Well for most of us. We don't have to worry about being attacked by hostile tribes or anything. Violence is at an all time low in this day and age. There was far more conflicts in the past that have wiped out large percentages of the human population. It's just the process of building ourselves up, breaking down, and building up stronger. The Earth is the way it is for a reason, and that is that decisions are made based on necessity and survival. Sure shitty things happen to some people, but it's basic Darwinism. They have to in order for the strongest regimes to hold their power. But one day America, Russia, China will eventually break down, and a stronger, more conscious race will develop from that. Most people aren't conscious enough to handle a utilitarian world. We still have natural survival and competitive instincts. People would still fuck each other over if the world was this Utopia, we aren't ready for that. Some people may be, but that's besides the point. The world is this way for a reason, and that is basic evolution and survival. I know this will get downvoted but this is the logical truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not justifying 9/11 I'm just saying it was a necessity for our government to maintain their power. People die, sure that's sad, but when you have covert operations that are the real reason for being the strongest regime, you have to do it in a way that nobody would ever suspect it was you who did it.

       I find your post very interesting. Not saying I agree with you, but because you have the same reasoning as many "intellectuals" like
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GooNhOIMY0">
        Michio Kaku

      <p>
       What you're promoting is a New World Order in every sense of the word. It can be a beautiful idea of a world under an umbrella of protection, but have you really thought about who controls that umbrella, and more importantly, which system the umbrella operates under? You assume a more "conscientious race" will end up ruling. However, this is a huge leap of faith and a naive assumption in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The average rent in New York City is $3,000/month. Why is that? To put it bluntly, the New York stock exchange is a black hole for the world's resources. Free market capitalism devalues the currency at an immense rate. Bubbles are created one day and popped the other, which destroys the dollar to the extent that the inflation has severely affected everyday life in the city. It's a corroding system that eats itself from the inside out. The bursting of the housing bubble devastated America and many nations on the up-and-up, but it barely affected the Scandinavian countries (not Iceland). Even most of the Scandinavian people themselves don't understand why. It's very simple however, the strong taxation of their society kept on circulating to ride out the wave with ease. Only big losses were the banks' investments offshore, which required a milder bail-out.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is still only the secondary problem to a much more important one, the genesis of the currency itself. What is money really? It's a question a tiny fraction of the population even ask themselves. This is a question I can't answer for the sake of not making this way too long, but I'd advise you to watch

       Yes it is a naive assumption. But I forgot to add though that at first we would most likely live in a 1984 type setting then we would transition to a more utilitarian setting. It would be naive to assume that we would transition to a utilitarian setting from where we are now. Sorry, that's not what I meant. I do agree that with a One World System, the potential of abuse would be very high, but that's something that the human race would "have to" suffer through in order to learn the consequences and become more educated in the future. The more we break down and learn from our mistakes, the stronger we will be in the future. You can't have good without bad with increasing technology. Potential for abuse will always exist, maybe until we're educated and conscious enough to handle our technology properly.

       And you shouldn't because they will inevitably fail but that's what will need to happen for people to learn from their mistakes. Think of everything that we know now, about the corruption that goes on in the world, and think of how lazy/unwilling to change people are. There will be a global conflict that will bring us under a one world system. It's necessary suffering. The average person is too stupid/scared for people to make meaningful change. Our government is too powerful and has most people under Stockholm Syndrome. Therefore things won't change until shit really hits the fan. For the better? Not necessarily. But the more our race will inevitably suffer, the stronger we will be in the distant future with education and learning from mistakes. The world will reach a point when it is run by scientists and intellectuals that will be one of the few people that would understand, be able to use, and handle supremely advanced technology. They will be the ones with power because having a brain will actually mean something when the world is modeled after education, and not business.

       The only real big change you should hope for is that Americans dissolve the FED, replace it with a government controlled monetary system and rebuild your country for the benefit of all, not just elites. The rest of the world is doing fine, especially most of Europe.
      </p>

       Americans tend to view government as something external instead of the extension of the people. Rightfully so, since it has been infiltrated by private interests since way back when.

       Yeah that's a big reason why the world is messed up. But you should also remember that the world's superpowers; China, Russia, U.S., all follow a business model. That's how they remain the most powerful, and will continue to do so until that bubble bursts. The rest of the world will take a big hit when the superpowers do fall. We privatized the fed in 1913. It's going to take a lot to change a system that has been in swing since the Industrial Revolution, with the privatization of the Fed catalyzing that situation. The best way to combat this is education, which I believe has been compromised. Only few people realize it after they made it through the "education" system, which is obviously a major hindrance to any sort of revolution.

       It's not just 9/11...it's been going on all through recorded history...good vs. evil etc. etc.  The American Revolution was an attempt to be liberated from the old money powers...everything that's happened since...robber barons...growth of corporations...the Fed...the CIA...bogus wars on terror and communism...9/11...and many other things...are all attempts of the old world establishments to maintain their power in the coming world age...at this point they're winning and it seems more and more that a large world crisis, possibly a collapse and complete revamping of the world financial system will be needed before anything changes.

       One of the biggest crime scenes in history yet is was dismantled as quickly as they could get the steel onto the boats (where it was sold
       <em>
        at a loss
       </em>
       in China by an Israeli company--but of course).
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you Israel/Mossad for helping the Neocon whackjobs "earn" another few trillion dollars for their (basically unlimited) coffers in the form of war profiteering--among other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a Jew it
       <em>
        utterly sickens me
       </em>
       that so many of "my own" were in on perpetrating 9/11--but, then again so were a LOT of non-Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, let's not forget, it was a Jewish man who heard the entire plan at the Gomel Chesed cemetery long before it happened and tried to get the FBI involved...after THREE unsuccessful attempts he was basically forced to give up. He handed the Israeli involvement of 9/11 to the FBI on a silver platter a year before it happened...and was dismissed as a "nutjob."
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope people keep this in mind when differentiating Zionism and Judaism! It seems as though many people thing that they are one in the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Us Jews who tell the truth and are not self-deluded KNOW that Zionism is going to, eventually, be the final nail in Judaism's coffin once the American people start to wake up...and I want it WELL known that many, if not most, Jews in America condemn this criminality.

       At the time 9/11 happened I also didn't accept it. It all sounded phony. I wasn't much of a conspiracy theorist at the time, I just figured that was the way things were and it was pointless to worry about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward a few years and I start regaining interest in 9/11. Now I wish I had spent more time when it happened to research things.

       The cultural narrative is the important thing. Think of who became the victim and who became the enemy on that day and it will (hopefully) become more apparent how we can slowly change this narrative without directly attacking anyone's beliefs about 9/11.

       How does organized religion come into play here? I am and know many Christians, all knowing the lie of 911.  I really struggle understand how you relate them and think you're more just trying to take a shot because the opportunity presents itself.

       Further, I know a great deal of Atheists and some agnostics,any of them believe the lie...so....feel free to elaborate.

       The Patriot Act was written way back in the '90s and the Clinton's wanted to pass it in response to domestic terror incidents. People weren't scared enough so it went on the back shelf. 
The biggest thing about 9/11 is that it happened. There is no going back, that was a well utilized crisis, whether false flag or not. People need to stop focusing on it and start focusing its consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be so angry at things you can't change. Focus on what you can, focus on what effects you and what you can effect. Get a real education, and live life.

       This is so true. In France if you just ask questions about the official version of 9/11, not say it's lies, just if you ask questions, you are immediately, IMMEDIATELY, accused of being antisemitic.
Many artists literally lost their job the next day because they asked question on TV debate show.
They had to say "I'm sorry, it was a misunderstanding etc..." in order to get invited again on TV.
The only one who can still say something, not too much though, without having too much trouble is a jew (Mathieu Kasovitz).
If you want to know who really is in control of your country, see who you can not criticize.

       Because while 9/11 was an inside job without a doubt, it's also proven than the mossad was linked to that. Also the towers were managed by a Jew, Larry Silverstein, that many believed was in the loop. The fact the the Jewish zionists are so on edge when we talk about 9/11 only make them more suspicious...

       I haven't reasearched 911 theories yet, so I can't weigh in very much here, but even if a Jewish man was in on it, why would this matter to a large amount of people who share his ethnicity??

       So I wouldn't alienate the people who you want to inform by calling people that for whatever reason cannot act a liar, coward, or a mass murder. They all have been manipulated by the same system of control that we were all apart of of. We just got informed and chose to wake up.
We bring these people on board by empathizing with their situation by strongly reminding them of what happened in the past when people refused to stand up for truth. Then, when they are ready to act that reminder will be the catalyst for change.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't force people to act by using the same tactics the government uses on us to try and manufacture consent. Like Bush did with the war in the east when he said "you are either with us or against us" It has blow back in the long run because if we use it on the people that have been manipulated these tactics it will be hard for them to trust the right people. People then have little choice and will follow whoever spreads the most fear. Its not a healthy way to handle it.
Listlen to this video , concider getting some of the books he recommends.

       No. They deliberately engineered this to occur on 9/11 so it would be a memorable date for their propaganda. But it's also a memorable date, now, for our truth.

       10 years to the day after Bush Sr gave his nwo speech.  In the movie The Big Lebowski, right at the beginning, he writes a cheque and the date is 9/11, 1991.  Bush's speech can be heard in the background on the television.

       Does this mean everyone in Hollywood and tons of other people knew it was gonna happen?  I don't imagine so, yet the numbers and coincidences are quite weird.

       There is an absolute ocean of scientific research regarding the collapses of the World Trade towers.  They are the most studied structural failures in human history.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a few posts up you seem to think at most a few dozen Americans would have been involved.  How do you explain the thousands of scientists that have researched the event and come down firmly on the side of the official explanation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are a couple dozen peer reviewed scientific studies on the collapse of the trade center towers:

      </p>
      <p>
       Are all of these scientists in on the cover up?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a link to the American Society of Civil Engineers library.  Dozens of articles, studies and papers regarding the WTC collapses, all done by heavyweights in the engineering world.  Actual science.
