      <p>
       This is a gradual realization I've had, so I'll start from the beginning:
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd been reading in this subreddit every now and then and I'd been noticing something odd. In many threads there are what people call "shills"-that is, people who are paid by corporations or the government to post against the general attitudes in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Examples can include statements like "the NSA is working in your best interest," and "the banks should not be broken up," both of which are indicative of clear influence from the government or corporations, respectively. That wass not what I'd found odd, as it would be only natural that corporations and governments would do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I did find odd, however, was how people identify shills. Apparently, shills seem to be people in the comments sections that deny the existence of a conspiracy being discussed in the thread-people who defend Israel in Israel conspiracy threads would be JIDF shills, and people defending Monsanto in an Monstanto conspiracy thread would be Monsanto shills. However, I've seen many times when people here claim that the Holocaust really did happen, and yet they aren't labeled as JIDF or general pro-Jewish shills. Personally, I believe that the Holocaust was a grand scheme to secure Israel for the Jewish elite, and that the Jewish elite to this day continues to attest to the truth of this lie for their pro-Israel interests. Yet, people who say the Holocaust is real on this subreddit are rarely called out for being shills, and are more often accused of being of working for such sites as conspiratard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does this subreddit attest to the truth of the Holocaust? Don't you realize how this very assertion plays to pro-Israel interests? This is where I really don't understand. This is a conspiracy subreddit-so why aren't all conspiracies entertained here? I'm thinking that this might be some sort of ploy by the moderators, whom I believe are working for Jewish pro-Israel interests, and are intentionally keeping this subreddit as a place where the truth will not out. They distract us with many minor conspiracies while keeping the grand one, the Jewish plot to control the world, in the dark. The evidence is clear: why else would a subreddit named conspiracy dismiss conspiracies, lest its moderators are in the pockets of the JIDF and their Jewish organizers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all comes back to shills-and how the moderators, shills themselves, are shilling for the purpose of protecting shilling. By letting some people be labeled as shills-shills who aren't defending Jewish interest, and making sure other shills are left to shill freely-those who are defending Jewish interests, they are making clear to all but the apathetic that they are affiliated with the JIDF and the Jewish conspiracy. By keeping a list of "approved" and "disapproved" conspiracies, on a subreddit that should entertain all conspiracies, they are merely showing that they are shills. We are distracted by conspiracies that have nothing to do with the Jews on this subreddit, as a means of keeping us ignorant of how the Jews plan to keep and use Israel to advance their own power. We may have Israel conspiracies, but people here who know the Holocaust for what it is-a blatant lie-are still shunned, and the engine for the Jewish conspiracy still runs strong. And thus, the Jews have managed to do something dumbfounding-turn

       Denying the Holocaust is no indicator of hate. It is simply a matter of believing in a conspiracy, something this subreddit should support.

       I completely disagree. They have been very reasonable with keeping most of the Jew-hate garbage out of the sub, while at the same time allowing posts about Israel. All governments should be scrutinized, and from what I've seen on subs other than this one is criticism of Israel = criticism of Jews simply because most Israelis are Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also usually allow talk about the Talmud, which would be equivalent to people talking about the Koran and how it influences the behavior of Muslims. So if you have a reasonable post about Jews, I'm sure it will be fine.

       I agree and there is a certain tribe who want to use r conspiracy for their own personal hate and fear mongering site.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love conspiracy because it limits the banning and removal about as much as possible and not be buried in non-conspiracy posts.

       It's weird to me that some people think this sub should automatically be supportive of all conspiracy theories or, I guess, alternative narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it's fair to expect reasonable consensus on many issues, and perhaps an openness to certain types of new ideas, it's clearly absurd to expect uniform agreement?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also people here who like to debate/discuss various issues and offer alternative viewpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly I think the shill claims are almost entirely bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the holocaust - it's very widely accepted. The majority of opposition to the idea originates from people who are, basically, anti-Semitic. Their belief (and "research") doesn't stem from evidence, but from their pre-existing beliefs about Jews.

       I should probably restate my positions regarding this, despite the fact that I would probably receive a blue reception here as a result of influences from outside subreddits, one of which I posted a version of this in also.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the most important point:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This all comes back to shills-and how the moderators, shills themselves, are shilling for the purpose of protecting shilling.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Isn't there some grand hypocrisy in that? We are meant to be a bastion of free speech-yet if your beliefs are "bigoted," something entirely subjective, then they can be deleted. It's quite frightening to watch posters rail on that subreddit about other subreddits enacting rules on posts, when they already have very abusable ones themselves.
Isn't the spirit of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       involved with going against the drilled narrative? And yet, rule 1 purposely silences heterodox opinions when it comes to matters of race, religion, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't much to make the leap that the mods made that rule for the protection of Jewish interests-they simply had to make a blanket rule that would take all opinions against the grain of pro-Jewish thought today, and wipe them off the page. Other opinions would also go under the rug, but when putting myself in the mods' shoes, I can easily see that the pros outweigh the cons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flytape was trying to divert the conversation away from that main topic, that is, how the mods are Zionist shills, by making it about the Holocaust. As I can see by this thread, it worked-yet another victory for the Jews, I suppose. Of course this post will do little, and pragmatically, there isn't a high chance it would change anything. However, in times like this, I like to refer to the words of Atticus Finch:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        [Courage is] knowing you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.

       Interesting post. I don't believe anyone has expressed these points in this sub before this. I have a couple of comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Holocaust was not "a grand scheme to secure Israel for the Jewish elite" because the Holocaust mythology did not really take the shape we now are so familiar with until after Israel came into existence. I would agree that the proto-Holocaust, the earliest beginnings of the Holocaust myth, were indeed used by Jews as moral leverage to encourage the formation of the state of Israel. However, the Holocaust as we know it, the full-blown Holocaust mythology, has been used to justify Israeli crimes, and to continue to extort money out of Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the matter of the mods being shills for Jewish interests, this may be so in one or two cases, but for the most part, the mods are antagonistic toward posts and threads skeptical of the Holocaust mythology for the same reason the general public is antagonistic -- they have been brainwashed all their lives to automatically believe the mythology. The mods just don't know any better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Awakening is a process, and it does not happen all at once, or all to the same degree. We can be awake on some topics but still in the grip of the media conditioning on other topics. The conditioning of the general public to buy into the Holocaust mythology is the deepest and most pernicious conditioning of all, and the most difficult to break. For me, to realize that most of what we know as "the Holocaust" is complete bullshit, was the last stage of my awakening. It was the fiction, the brainwashing, that I clung to the most tightly and didn't want to give up.

       You actually don't think its possible at all that maybe many people think what is posted here is stupid fear mongering and at many times thinly vailed hate speech?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, you think it has to be some organization (of course involving jews lol) that has paid contractors who post things that disagree with what you think?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think it might actually be genuine people who don't like or agree with you and many people here? that maybe these people exist and aren't being organized by anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone who disagrees with you is not a shill, thats retarded denialism. Maybe your ideas are actually unpopular and offend people.
      </p>

       Edit: "Personally, I believe that the Holocaust was a grand scheme to secure Israel for the Jewish elite, and that the Jewish elite to this day continues to attest to the truth of this lie..."

       lol, no possible way anyone could disagree with this. anyone who does is a shill!

       I don't understand why people here are claiming my belief in a Jewish conspiracy means I hate the Jews. I do not, I simply believe they are conspiring to take control of us, like any large and powerful group would. Calling my post Jew hate merely serves as evidence for this subreddit's pro-Jewish interests.

       So why doesn't the corollary apply to you: Anytime you attack Jews/Israel/Holocaust, ect. it MUST be evidence that you have anti-jewish influences/interests.

       Disagreeing with you isn't evidence that someone is "a paid Israeli shill"

       So all the millions of Jews are?  You have to be more specific, otherwise it sounds racist.  The overwhelming majority of Jews are good people, imo.  It's the extremist politicians that are the problem.

       I understand your distinction, since I have the same views and express them in my own posts from time to time. But, (1), the Jews who post here are going to pretend not to see the distinction, even if they do see it, so that they can demonize you; and, (2), the general public has been so well-conditioned in the media and schools to believe that any critical comment about Jews or Zionism or Israel is hate speech, that they will close their eyes to this distinction and reflexively damn you as a racist/anti-Semite, in the same way a frog's leg will twitch when electrical current is passed through its muscles.

       This is the problem with people today.

       I could tell you my views on the Holocaust but honestly, nobody gives a fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Holocaust happened so long ago that it shouldn't even matter any more.  The Holocaust happened 72 years ago.  If we go back in time to 1942 when the holocaust started 72 years ago, then we go back in time another 72 years (a total of 144 years) the civil war just ended.  Nobody gave a fuck about the civil war ending in 1942 and we shouldn't give a fuck about the Holocaust in 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes it was bad and should be remembered as a historical anomaly, Jews should remember it and not let themselves end up in that situation again.  But 72 years is almost 3/4ths of a century and people need to move the fuck on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care what you believe about the Holocaust, or what conspiracies you propose about it.  Just don't expect me to read it and applaud for you when we have 2014 shit to worry about.

       Many people look at the economic crisis Germany was facing and look at the laws regarding how goyim should be treated and in part think some wealthy exclusionist Jews aided in creating a hostile climate that resulted in the holocaust. All of Germany didnt wake up one day and willy nilly decide to suddenly hate the population they hosted for four hundred years, the cultural differences were a long time brewing and discussed since even Luther's time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now don't go thinking I agree with this. I'm just familiar with the line of thinking because I am a German, my opa was a German soldier, some of my aunts were Nazi officers, my father grew up in the youth camps, I'm privy to what many folks think because of that upbringing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think the holocaust was sad, I also think the abrahamic religions are primitive crap, I think what's happening in Palestine is disgusting, I hate war, period. No matter who wages it. But I also understand how one person's terrorist can be another person's freedom fighter, so when making an opinion you really have to investigate the wide breadth of views and compile the most sensible outlook based on available evidence

       it kind of was, after WWI Germany's economy was fucked dealing with both debt from the was and hyper inflation. Their money lost so much value that wheel barrels of it was required to buy a simple loaf of bread. 
Some groups of people managed to profit from this hyper inflation and debt. notable Zionists with their finical knowledge and international connections managed to seize this opportunity and buy up property, business and what ever they wanted since it was going cheap and would increase in value (eventually).
      </p>
      <p>
       So long story short Germany switched to socialism (state owns every thing), implemented a sort of token reward system so pay people for goods and services given to the government that could then be traded with international entities in return for other goods/services pretty much removing their debt ridden and almost worthless currency from any involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       That self preserving act of the nation upset the Zionists and the Rothschild's banks as it affected their monopoly of the German peoples. Banks being banks, Zionists being Zionists started tried to bully the nation in to playing their game. Someone along the way figured out most of these people threatening the recover of the nation were Jewish and we all know what happened next.

       Focusing on spelling mistakes in an argument on the internet should be it's own fallacy. You don't touch his argument at all and rather focus on something that could happen to over 50% of the world's population because English isn't their first language.

       Yes baseless. There's a difference between saying there could be shills, and calling someone a shill. If I call you a shill right now and provide no evidence, then that's baseless, all it does is stifle conversation.

       You don't think it stifles conversation to respond to a decent, but controversial, post with baseless shill accusations? Hell to be honest, it should be covered under rule 10 but it never is.

       Example: Look at OP's submission. It's calling all of us mods here shills ("baseless shill accusation") yet has 25 responses so far. And look at

        my response to OP
       </a>
       . The way to show that the term "shill" is baseless, is to actually
       <em>
        show
       </em>
       it's baseless, not just
       <em>
        claim
       </em>
       it's baseless.

       If no evidence is provided, it's baseless. End of story. You shouldn't have to "show that it's baseless", they should have to show that you're a shill or not make an accusation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just find it strange that you're okay with baseless shill accusations, yet on other subjects you seem to realize that something similar does not add to the conversation...

        The problem was that your comment had absolutely nothing to do with the content and was solely an attack on the submitter. If and when users violate Rule 1, please see Rule 2 and if the mods agree that it was an actual violation, it will be dealt with appropriately.

      <p>
       How is yelling "SHILL!" at someone not the same thing? Granted this specific post is a bit more detailed, but it's more of an exception than the norm. 99% of the time when the word "shill" is thrown around on here it's nothing more than an attempt to end the conversation and silence and vilify the opposition.

       One could argue that that is also warning people not to engage, but it was deemed to be against the rules and deleted. Which hey, I agree with that, good job. But the baseless shill accusations are an attack that should fall under that rule as well.

       There's a huge difference between those and "shill".

       The mods have discussed this on several occasions and at this point in time we're not going to start down the slippery slope of banning words like "shill" and "troll". Period.

       I can understand not wanting to ban words, but at least ban comments that are obviously using it as an attack. For example if someone is in a thread about GMOs and expresses an opinion that is favorable about GMOs, they often get met with posts that are to the effect of "GTFO MONSANTO SHILL!" That's what shouldn't be allowed. It's a deliberate attack and attempt to stifle dissenting opinions. It's a very similar tactic to what governments do to stifle political dissent.

       Actually there's nothing wrong with my reading comprehension when you look at how I worded my response vs how you worded yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I think it's time for you to grow up. You whip out the bans when you get caught being lazy and a hypocrite. One day you're proclaiming yourself a free thinker who is starting discussions on topics no one will let others talk about (like the Holocaust), the next we should stop giving a shit about the holocaust because it's 2014 and the Jews brought it upon themselves anyways. One has to wonder if you apply that same standard to all events.

       6 million people died 72 years ago.
50,000 people died 240 years ago supplemented by some random dudes drafting documents. It was a historical anomaly. It's 2014. Get over it.

       it kind of was, after WWI Germany's economy was fucked dealing with both debt from the was and hyper inflation. Their money lost so much value that wheel barrels of it was required to buy a simple loaf of bread. 
Some groups of people managed to profit from this hyper inflation and debt. notable Zionists with their finical knowledge and international connections managed to seize this opportunity and buy up property, business and what ever they wanted since it was going cheap and would increase in value (eventually).
      </p>
      <p>
       So long story short Germany switched to socialism (state owns every thing), implemented a sort of token reward system so pay people for goods and services given to the government that could then be traded with international entities in return for other goods/services pretty much removing their debt ridden and almost worthless currency from any involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       That self preserving act of the nation upset the Zionists and the Rothschild's banks as it affected their monopoly of the German peoples. Banks being banks, Zionists being Zionists started tried to bully the nation in to playing their game. Someone along the way figured out most of these people threatening the recover of the nation were Jewish and we all know what happened next.

       Many people look at the economic crisis Germany was facing and look at the laws regarding how goyim should be treated and in part think some wealthy exclusionist Jews aided in creating a hostile climate that resulted in the holocaust. All of Germany didnt wake up one day and willy nilly decide to suddenly hate the population they hosted for four hundred years, the cultural differences were a long time brewing and discussed since even Luther's time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now don't go thinking I agree with this. I'm just familiar with the line of thinking because I am a German, my opa was a German soldier, some of my aunts were Nazi officers, my father grew up in the youth camps, I'm privy to what many folks think because of that upbringing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think the holocaust was sad, I also think the abrahamic religions are primitive crap, I think what's happening in Palestine is disgusting, I hate war, period. No matter who wages it. But I also understand how one person's terrorist can be another person's freedom fighter, so when making an opinion you really have to investigate the wide breadth of views and compile the most sensible outlook based on available evidence
