<p>What is your hypothesis as to why such study needs to be done?</p>

<p>What side effects will you be measuring?  BMI,  Urine, Stool?   The FDA doesn&#39;t demand any &#39;human feeding trials&#39; on fruits and vegetables, no matter what growing or cultivation method.    Why are you choosing GMO for this?  Why not the Kiwi?  Why not the Ruby Red Grapefruit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then how would you determine what was caused by consumption of GMO products or unrelated?</p>

<p>Every study that shows harm to animals regarding GMO uses roughly the same plants with roughly the same genes, yet all come out with amazing and entirely different harmful effects.   Why didn&#39;t Seralini have is rats grow giant testicles and hair on their tongue?   Why did the rate of stomach inflammation go up in pigs, but in no other mammal has this ever been observed...not even in other pigs?   What makes Judy Carmens study different than the others?   </p>

<p>These are the questions you should be asking, long before you move on to human trials, is why do the animal trials all have different results?   How is that possible?    If you can&#39;t even pinpoint what you have to observe to determine harm, how can you even begin the study?</p>

<p>False equivalency. I am talking about humans, not rats. Stop deflecting. If you have no long-term human study of GMO consumption then you have no basis to claim GMO is safe for human consumption.</p>

<p>Gosh, you really seem to want to make people dislike you!</p>

<p>First, you seem to have zero understanding of the scientific process.  The idea that you should do long-term testing of drugs and food stuffs <em>doesn&#39;t need a hypothesis</em> to be logically necessary.  Consider all the substances in the past, from lead pipes to tobacco, that turned out to have significant effects that only appeared in the long term.</p>

<p>Second, the idea that people are going to be skeptical of studies done by a group that stands to make billions of dollars by the result is perfectly reasonable.  You wouldn&#39;t allow an accused prisoner to be on eir own jury, would you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DOJ decided not to intervene.  The lawsuit was filed by the whistleblowers.</p>

<p>However...</p>

<p>On 25th May, 2013, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a 54 page document, (Case 2:10-cv-04374-CDJ Document 54) delivering a swift winkle-picker up the backsides of Merck’s lawyers, by incisively demolishing Merck’s arguments. The highlights of this document are: </p>

<p>1) The DOJ continues to remain a real party in interest with a strong interest in the outcome. </p>

<p>2) Merck&#39;s argument that suits by private citizens are not allowed, “is not supported by statutory text or case law and is inconsistent with the purposed of the False Claims Act”. </p>

<p>3) That the relators stand in the “government’s shoes” </p>

<p>4) That Merck’s illegal application interpretation of the of the False Claims Act, seeking to limit or bar cases for fraudulent conduct which violates FDA or federal laws and regulations, is inconsistent with the purposes of the Act. </p>

<p>5) That “it is no surprise that Merck cites to no decisions that only the Government and not a relator can litigate this type of False Claims Act suit” and that” the government is aware of no such holding in a False Claims Act”. </p>

<p>6) DOJ successively trashes the use of the cases argued by the Merck lawyers, making the Merck legal team look like a bunch on bunnies caught in headlights. </p>

<p>7) DOJ then took apart the other spurious arguments of Merck, in such a way that pretty much backs up the relators, stating “allowing relators to prosecute such False Claims Act suits (as long as sufficiently pleaded) serves the primary purposes of the qui tam provisions”. </p>

<p>8) And finally, the DOJ, opposed all Merck’s reasoning to dismiss the case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typical conspiratard-esque reply when a question is answered with facts.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s more</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to a recent filing by the whistleblowers: &quot;The government has not joined in Merck&#39;s current motion [to dismiss the case] and has made no decision on the current Complaint. <strong>Instead, it has taken a &#39;wait and see&#39; approach requesting that it be served with all pleadings, motions and court orders in this case, and that its consent be obtained before the case is settled, dismissed or discontinued.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;While the Department of Justice has chosen to sit on the sidelines of this case for now, <strong>both the FDA and its sister agency, the National Institute of Health, have since the complaint was filed begun to take steps to address the failure of Merck&#39;s mumps vaccine. The FDA has initiated its own study to determine the vaccine&#39;s efficacy, acknowledging that the recent mumps outbreak &#39;indicat[es] lower vaccine efficacy than previously estimated.</strong>&#39; The NIH has gone even further. It is funding the University of Georgia to develop a new mumps vaccine because the recent outbreaks &#39;strongly suggest that the current vaccine is not effective.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>Worst is that I&#39;m quite pro-vaccination - but your subreddit is pretty annoying.  </p>

<p>For one, you conflate vaccination for measles, mumps, diphtheria, TB etc, and flu vaccinations - but flu vaccines are nothing like the others, their very effectiveness is in doubt.</p>

<p>For another, you act as if the only reason that anyone&#39;d be suspicious of vaccines is that they were stupid - but in fact there&#39;s a long and established history of giving out incomplete or even fake vaccinations in order to spy (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/us/deans-condemn-vaccine-ruse-used-in-bin-laden-hunt.html?_r=0">example</a>), amongst other fake medical tricks (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment">example</a>).

    <div class="md"><p>As I pointed out elsewhere on this page, this guy has many bozoness properties, and I&#39;ve downvoted him a net 18 times before.</p>

<p>That said, there is <em>overwhelming</em> proof that vaccines work - and you can get that proof by cracking any history book.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s a huge list of diseases that were dreaded by humanity for many, many years - smallpox, polio, rabies, diphtheria, and so on - diseases that used to kill millions and now barely register on the scale.  We still don&#39;t even have good treatments for many of these (e.g. polio and rabies) - so why are they gone, after literally thousands of years?</p>

<p>Vaccinations.  There is no other possible explanation.  These diseases were endemic to the human race throughout recorded history - then vaccinations were introduced and the rate of appearance of these diseases dropped to basically zero in the vaccinated population, and as humanity was able to extend vaccination throughout the world, the diseases vanished completely.</p>

<p>As a result, my life-expectancy is almost twice what it would have been if I had been born a century earlier than I was (actually there are three big reasons - vaccinations, antibiotics and trauma centers).  To be specific, if I had been born 100 years before I was, the chances are that I would have been dead ten years ago...</p>

<p>EDIT:  After responding to this page, RES now says I&#39;ve downvoted him 22 times.  /me rolls his eyes.  He should learn to realize that a little politeness and respect for people with whom you&#39;re discussing goes a long way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I describe elsewhere, the effectiveness of flu shots is doubtful, and marginal at best.</p>

<p>BUT the main point is that you are <em>completely wrong</em> about mercury being in vaccines.  They haven&#39;t put mercury in vaccines in this century (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/Thimerosal/Index.html">citation</a>).</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t even clear that thimerosal caused any issues at all.  Yes, metallic mercury is a horrific poison - but not every mercury compound is.  Regardless, they took it off the market and it is not in use any more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And, yes, there is proof of this, actual bona fide real scientific proof (no, I am not going to look it up for you).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Downvoted for &quot;intellectual laziness&quot; and &quot;lack of rigor&quot;.</p>

<p>Again, the effectiveness of flu vaccination is very much up for debate - but just writing &quot;There&#39;s scientific proof but I&#39;m not going to show you what it is,&quot; is completely and utterly bogus.  I personally would be ashamed to say something like that.</p>
