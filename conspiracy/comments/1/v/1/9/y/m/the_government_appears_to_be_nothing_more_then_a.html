They contrive the concept &amp; live the life of power, of rule writers, &amp; they have thousands of lobbyists throwing sick amounts of artificial wealth &amp; even more unrealistic powers onto them &amp; are providers of the very papers that&#39;ll be &quot;passed&quot; by some 300 people onto 350 millionish. It preposterous! I blame it on the perception of representation, which appears as an illusion, like the association perception between a sports fan &amp; their favorite team. </p>

<p>Some of these bills, my goodness the Obamacare going from around 2700 pages first passed without oven being read! Then expanding to over 10000 pages in three years! Wow, It looks worse then buying a new car, house, boat, atv, &amp; a Russian mail bride without even seeing any of them or reading the paper work associated with such purchases. That seems insane, &amp; that appear to be what these people &quot;in power&quot; could be. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see this evolve into a discussion ( &amp; I also have to go to work soon) but I want to see if anyone had some other simple little comparisons you&#39;ve observed yourself. Even something simply &amp; kinda funny, like: The NSA looks more nosy then I was with my ex-girlfriend when I found out she&#39;d been texting another guy in front of me for 3 months. Or dark, funny to me though haha.</p>

<p>Take care fellow Earthling. I must go slave for a little while. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if we have a nation of people, and the people pass a law by majority vote, then you decide you&#39;re going to break that law, so they then send armed men to throw you in jail, I see nothing wrong with that. <strong>It is not inherently violent for a &quot;government&quot; then, to enact a law, when the people who live in the country are the ones who create the laws.</strong> That bolded part is for you, incase you decide to tl;dr. You live in that country, you knew what the law was. Even if you, yourself, personally didn&#39;t vote for that law you still lived under it&#39;s protection. Breaking that law was your choice, you should have to live with the consequences. If you don&#39;t like it, you can either work to change the law, or leave. </p>

<p>Long story short, no one is making you live in a certain country. If you don&#39;t like the law where you live, then immigrate to a place that you do. It is not unjust to use force to enforce the laws of the land when the people are where the laws originate. </p>

<p>If you want to argue that the law in our country does not originate with the people, that is valid. But the system itself is not inherently unjust, unless you&#39;re some kind of bullshit anarchist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but I am not culpable if you choose to disobey the law. You knew what the law was, you broke it anyway. Thus you are the one who is instigating violence, not the government. The government has an obligation to uphold the law; when those laws are enacted via a democratic process, then they are not inherently unjust. </p>

<p>Like I said, feel free to immigrate to a country where you agree with the law. No one is holding a sub machine gun on you and making you stay here to take advantage of our 35% tax rate and Obamacare. Somehow, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find very many other western countries that tax you less, or have less mandatory social programs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I understand it, we are in a system of authority by way of force.  As opposed to authority by way of reason.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a bit of an overlap, or an equivalency between these two concepts, which I will attempt to summarize.</p>

<p>The masses of people are where the true power of force lies, no matter how fast a machine gun can shoot, a single person cannot overwhelm 1000s of people by force alone.  Violence can be a means to achieve authority by force, yet it can also be a demonstration of a very poor version of authority by reason.  As I said, the way I see it, we are individually convinced (by our own reason) to acquiesce to the force exerting control over us- because, though we could resist and if everyone did it would overwhelm the authority, individually we might die, so it is most reasonable for us to keep ourselves out of danger by not drawing the ire of the authority.</p>

<p>This, in turn, actually kindof makes this system of authority by force into one of authority by reason, as it would seem most effective for authority to exert that control by way of force and intimidation.  To elicit compliance via reasonable discourse voluntarily would be far too expensive and thus, unreasonable.</p>

<p>I know this doesn&#39;t really answer too many questions, yet I feel part of the issue at hand is that &quot;might makes right&quot; or &quot;the law of the jungle&quot; is some real shit that can&#39;t be ignored.  We might be able to do better with our treatment of each other as humans, yet until we revolutionize our resource management, economics, and social structure, this might be the best we can do for now.</p>

<p>I maintain that the highest authority is reason, yet to disrupt our present system to the extent that production is reduced would cause mass starvation (we are already somewhat in a house of cards, which is also perhaps intentional).  So, we can&#39;t just veto our current methods, we actually must devise superior methods in order for things to improve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most impact an individual can make is in areas closest to themselves.  Inside yourself would be the closest stuff to you.</p>

<p>I love R.A.W., yet I haven&#39;t actually read the books yet, thanks for encouraging me too, I should probably do that immediately!</p>

<p>That&#39;s probably a very timely bit of advice for you to give me, to not put too much faith in my own reasoning.  Humility would be one of the best arguments for that.</p>

<p>I said that my statement up there didn&#39;t answer many questions, but maybe it clarifies the questions a bit...  like I said it&#39;s reasonable for individuals to not draw the ire of authority by way of resistance.  At a certain point, individuals may come to believe that there is more to lose by not resisting than there would be by resisting.</p>

<p>I also stated that to &quot;elicit compliance via reasonable discourse... would be too expensive&quot;, while I also consider that with a cogent and informed enough populace, it would actually be more profitable to bring all individuals into the fold by way of reason than it would be to do so by force.</p>

<p>As we agree, however, this would require some revolution in culture to enable this.  I think it could be as simple as having plans that everyone can endorse and believe in.  To have 7 Billion free and moralized humans not working against each other would be a huge resource, with massive productive potential.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve built a very small wall up to keep the waves at bay. Every once in a while a wave comes along that their wall needs to keep down. Occupy, Tea party, Anonymous, Restore the Fourth, etc. When the wave appears that it might get a little too big, they hit it when it&#39;s out deep in the ocean to minimize its later effects. I think this is what happened with Anonymous, Occupy, and Restore the Fourth. They get a few government agents involved and derail the movement. So that wall doesn&#39;t really need to be that big to keep in power. They just need to keep the waves small and controllable. And nothing will ever get done until one of those waves gets out of hand or enough of the people realize how the game is played. </p>

<p>some would argue that all property is immoral</p>

<p>You can argue it all you want.  If you can&#39;t own property, then you can not own yourself; thus someone else owns you.  This is the definition of slavery.  </p>

<p>As for your &quot;finite resources&quot; argument... crack an economics book for once in your life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your obviously not familiar with anarchism, because these ideas stem from it. People thinking they can tell other people what to do will never be good. As for what they Should do, we could write a huge list. &amp; overall the societal functions aren&#39;t really good ones, like taking advantage of tribal association based off something completely out of your power (where you were born i.e. Nationalism). I&#39;m from freaking Earth, just like everyone else...(maybe?)..hahaha.</p>
