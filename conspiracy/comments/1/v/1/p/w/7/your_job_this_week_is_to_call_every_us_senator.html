        Senators of the 113th Congress
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The White House is lobbying hard to stop this bill, they want diplomacy to work and know that more threats of sanctions will scuttle the peace process. The White House believes the Senators and lobby groups behind this bill have an agenda to force the nation into war against Iran. The bill currently has the 'bipartisan' support of 59 senators, and 67 are needed to override a presidential veto. Reid plans to bring the bill to the floor for a vote by the end of the month.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, your job is to call
       <strong>
        every
       </strong>
       US senator and make it very clear that there will be hell to pay if this bill passes. Do not make any personal threats, but use clear, forceful language. Do not let the staff member you speak with cut you off or speak over you. Ignore any reasons or excuses the staff member gives for the Senator's support of the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can call only one senator, please call:
      </p>
      <p>
       Schumer, Charles E. - (D - NY)  Class III
      </p>
      <p>
       322 Hart Senate Office Building Washington DC 20510
      </p>
      <p>
       (202) 224-6542
      </p>
      <p>
       As you know, Mr. Schumer is a dual US-Israeli citizen. A pro-sanctions advocacy group, United Against a Nuclear Iran,
       <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-white-house-iran-nuclear-deal-20140110,0,1510706.story">
        recently said:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “It is wrong for the White House to continue questioning the integrity and motives of anyone who supports more sanctions,” said Mark Wallace, chief executive of the group. “It is nonsensical and out of bounds to say that a bipartisn majority of U.S. senators secretly wants war with Iran.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       We know Mr. Wallace's comment to be a lie. The usual suspects (AIPAC, et al) are behind this bill, and they designed it to drag the US into war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said in a statement: "If supporters want the United States to take military action, they should be up front with the American people and say so. Otherwise, it’s not clear why any member of Congress would support a bill that possibly closes the door on diplomacy and makes it more likely that the United States will have to choose between military options or allowing Iran’s nuclear program to continue."
      </p>
      <p>
       America is done fighting Israel's wars. We are done sacrificing our blood and treasure to the god of Zionism. Let us be very clear, we shall hold personally responsible each senator who votes yes on the ‘‘Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2013’’ if the US consequently engages in any military action against Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       We stopped a war against Syria. We can stop a war against Iran.

       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       10 (3) Iran remains the world’s foremost state
11 sponsor of terrorism, having directed, supported,
12 and financed acts of terrorism against the United
13 States and its allies that have resulted in the thou-
14 sands of deaths, including the deaths of United
15 States citizens and members of the Armed Forces of
16 the United States.
17 (4) The Government of Iran and its terrorist
18 proxies, particularly Lebanese Hezbollah, continue to
19 provide military and financial support to the regime
20 of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, aiding that regime in
21 the mass killing of the people of Syria.
22 (5) The Government of Iran continues to sow
23 instability in the Middle East and threaten its neigh-
24 bors, including allies of the United States, such as
25 Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I take exception to these remarks presented in this Act Of Aggression towards Iranian people and to the people of Syria! The Worlds leading terrorists are American Tyrannical Politicians in bed with Saudi, Israeli Freaks! These are the most abhorrent souls that will see to the slaughter of Billions
       </strong>
       !
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 2:
      </p>
      <p>
       1 (6) The Government of Iran denies its people
2 fundamental freedoms, including freedom of the
3 press, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, and
4 freedom of conscience.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Saudi recognizes none of these for any person other than the Very Elite! Israel is Apartheid! America is Imploding by design! The Iranian and Syrian People took to the streets and America turned Her back on them! Just people would be simple people, like you and me! Not these brutes and freaks!

       One ANTI Peace US Senator is "youth role model" Cory Booker of NJ
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Booker...What came of the $100 million dollar investment from Mark Zuckerberg? If Cory Booker was truly capable, wouldn't we have seen a rise in utility levels in Central NJ? $100,000,000, if managed properly, would have such an impact in Newark that the surrounding cities would also benefit from the wealth created in part by the users of Facebook. But few economic opportunities actually have been created and presented to the youth of NJ.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Cory Booker truly represents the new generation of youth then this means the youth in NJ is prepared for war. And as a representative of the youth from NJ, I ask Cory Booker: "Where do we sign up for the war against Iran? Where do we go to get our state issued rifles for combat? Will you stand next to me in the Persian Sands without the support from our strongest Allies?"

       We postponed. We haven't stopped anything. The assembly line may have came to a screeching halt, but they're just trying to fix the machine first before they start up production again. Either way, this could also help chip a tooth off one of their sprockets if enough people get behind it.
