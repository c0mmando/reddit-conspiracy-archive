        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We all need to know about Codex Alimentarius.</p>

<p>I know the name is sort of off putting, maybe that&#39;s why so many know so little about an organization that will be such a threat.</p>

<p>What is Codex Alimentarius?</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a plan to get complete control of all food and nutrition all over the world for the U.N. trade group.</p>

<p>They began their mission to get control of all food, worldwide all the way back in 1962 and are currently still working continuously  in many nations toward that goal.</p>

<p>They are currently the reason that we can&#39;t have GMO labeling, having delayed their decision on it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agbioforum.org/v3n4/v3n4a04-mackenzie.htm">http://www.agbioforum.org/v3n4/v3n4a04-mackenzie.htm</a></p>

<p>They are very near completion of the process of getting worldwide control and, so far, very very few people are even aware of them.</p>

<p>This is a highly detailed look at Codex Alimentarius from their own perspective.</p>

<p>It contains records dating back to 1963 on their own website.</p>

<p>Codex Alimentarius Current agenda <a href="http://www.codexalimentarius.org/meetings-reports/en/">http://www.codexalimentarius.org/meetings-reports/en/</a></p>

<p>These guys are yet another very serious threat since they are a trade group not some humanitarian outreach, and even if they were, no one group can ever be trusted with control of all food output and intake.</p>

<p>Here is the scope of their eventual world wide power</p>

<p>From,</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Alimentarius">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Alimentarius</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Codex Alimentarius covers all foods, whether processed, semi-processed or raw. In addition to standards for specific foods, the Codex Alimentarius contains general standards covering matters such as food labeling, food hygiene, food additives and pesticide residues, and procedures for assessing the safety of foods derived from modern biotechnology. It also contains guidelines for the management of official i.e. governmental import and export inspection and certification systems for foods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you but I&#39;m afraid that if a single organization was to get total control of whether you could produce, or buy or sell food or provide nutrition in any other way, they may tend to become somewhat evil over time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m assuming that the OP is bringing this up because there is a shit load of new &quot;vitamins are bullshit&quot; articles everywhere.  A relative of mine is the MSNBC/NPR type and I knew that we were in trouble over Thanksgiving when he was really trying hard to convince me that they don&#39;t do shit because Dr. Dean Odell said so.  I agreed with him that typical mainstream store bought ones are not very good and that I instead only buy minerals extracted from plants because the roots are the best possible filter for absorbing only the smallest particles that are suitable for life.  Well so he doesn&#39;t want to hear that because he is programmed to follow the agenda.  He says &quot;But they are bullshit.  I just found out&quot;.  Basically this is largely what family gatherings are for, mainly to find out what the El-ites are selling.</p>

<p>Without the perspective of the agenda we are just lead around from one disingenuous concern to the next.  This otherwise smart guy actually believes that suddenly so many great people are really concerned that some people are buying a useless product.  Better pass laws!!!  Oh noes!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh, sorry you have to deal with those types of family members. People that are convinced that there is no narrative being sold, and that anything the mainstream news says is the new gospel. The proof is in the results. I was having digestive issues a year or so ago, and I started cultivating my own milk thistle, and making my own supplements from it. I&#39;ve noticed such profound changes that it actually makes me kind of angry when people like the ones you described just say &quot;they&#39;re bullshit&quot; because someone else told them what to think.</p>

<p>Is it really so unbelievable to you that American business is trying to sell you crap you don&#39;t need - i.e. vitamins? Assuming you&#39;re already getting a fairly balanced diet, why exactly would you <em>expect</em> vitamins to do anything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that a side step on an agenda?  Do you recognize an agenda to exist?  Yes articles can be written about papers and you have to be particularly trollish and arrogant to believe that you know what I&#39;m reading.  I&#39;d expect high quality vitamins to improve any deficiency in a diet that is lacking proper amounts of at least one thing.  Apparently it is an axiom to you that everyone is always eating properly all of the time and so therefore vitamins even if effective would have no purpose.  <del>You are a bitch troll who can&#39;t think properly.</del>  You are annoying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya the living well club is something that people are going to be only gradually kicked out of.  Pretty soon once you use up your capital then you just simply will not be able to get it back without a few decades of hard work whereas currenlty many simply just need to land a high paying job and to save for three months.  Its not going to be increasingly not like that anymore.  Of course someone who wants to put their head in the sand will be able to point at someone who is doing well to say &quot;See everything is just fine because I just spotted a winner&quot;.  Its simple logic really.  The statement &quot;Many people are doing poorly and this number is increasing&quot; is not negated by the existance one a single person who is doing well.  An existance invalidation only works against the statement &quot;All people are doing bad&quot;.  Anyways, I&#39;m rambling on about this because I&#39;ve heard this shit enumerable times when people simply want to feel a certain way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think the idea that the codex alimentarius (latin for book of food) was part of some nefarious agenda (21). Then, i read articles about how Big Pharma complained to the FDA that vitamin b6 was available over the counter as a dietary supplement. They complained that if it were to remain otc, it will hurt their future profits on a certain medicinr they are planning on inventing that involves vitamin b6, so they asked the fda to take it off the market. Nothing has come of this yet, but there are other instances where big pharma made similar complaints, and the fda willingly took those products off the market to eliminate competition of big pharma  and holisitc/homeopathic solutions. </p>

<p>In germany, and much of the european union, they are much further along in this process. Codex alimentarius seeks to label dietary supplements as drugs, and to regulate then as such, requiring prescriptions and such. I just read something that said in germany, vitamin c in any dose over 200mg is illegal. </p>

<p>Vitamin c, btw, has been shown to have incredible benefits to your health. There was this one doctor whow rote a piece about it, ill try and find it again...</p>

<p>But, until i find it, i will paraphrase:</p>

<p>Basically, the 90mg per day as the recommenxed amount of vitamin c by the fda js muchower that what the body can handle. In much higher doses, it was shown to prevent all kinds of diseases, proved to be antiviral and antibacterial, even hekped cancer patients much better than chemo/radiotherapy. Intravaneous injections of many times the recommended dose, per this doctor, solved many peoplez issues ranging from cancer, migraines, diabetes, arthritis, and many other things. </p>

<p>This same doctor was fired for her scientific research on vitamin c. </p>

<p>I wont say if its true or not, but since then, ive taken a kot of vitamin c daily, not just supplements, but also from foods, and have lost weight, my receding hairline was reversed, and i have never felt better.</p>

<p>I tell my wife, when they take the dietary supplement aisle out of walmarts, that is when we need to really staft to worry.</p>

And &quot;become&quot; evil?   Smile.   Not that it&#39;s &quot;biblically evil&quot;,  its just been human nature for quite a while to &quot;herd&quot;,  other humans like sheep or cattle.   Let&#39;s have another fire alarm practice just to remind you,  this is SOP,  always has been since we stopped being hunter gatherers thousands of years ago.   We are in the middle of re-inventing what civilization is and could be,  where those who help administer the infrastructure are just &quot;one of the boys&quot; not one&#39;s who can open and close bridges at whim and get away with it.</p>
