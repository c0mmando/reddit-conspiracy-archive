       We are living in a new America, a country founded on the idea of a system of Government by the people for the people that has lost its ways, where the people of this country are force fed fear and suppressed in order to benefit the richest and most powerful. Our democratically elected leaders have pandered to corporate and foreign interests, while simultaneously stripping away the liberties and freedoms of their constituents in the name of greed and government suppression of its people. While the media coverage seems to point the finger in many directions, whether it be at the poor, or immigrants, political interests, etc, the real reason that hard working Americans across the land cannot seem to get ahead is because the people with the most money and power are making it that way. Tax breaks for the richest Americans, unpunished crimes perpetuated by banking entities, companies paying a barely livable wage so that millions are forced into poverty and have to seek out assistance, the writing is on the wall; it is an out and out attack on liberty and freedom as we know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is high time that we, the people wake up to these offences and act against them. As Dr. Martin Luther King and Mahatma Ghandi demonstrated, the key to real change is to raise awareness by using non-violent civil activism as a tool to trumpet the voice of dissent. These men died as martyrs for the greater good, they realized that there was something bigger then themselves worth fighting for and they willingly did so, selflessly. I believe every person in this country needs to look in the mirror and ask themselves if living in a country where your every movement and correspondence is tracked, where men who reveal these offences are hunted and portrayed as criminal masterminds. I want every man and woman in America to ask themselves if they believe that they should pay more taxes in order to perpetuate corporate greed and political corruption while police forces across the country are militarized and murdering the people they swore to protect. Every person in this country ought to think about the countless men and women who have laid down and died in order to protect the idea of an America where life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is a birthright and ask themselves- what can I do to stop this sickening dystopia?
      </p>
      <p>
       We as Americans were bestowed with not only the right to speak out against transgression, but the responsibility to. I feel encumbered and obligated to act against a Government that value profits over human life, that forces fear down the throats of the people in order to shackle and silence them, while perpetuating war crimes and true terrorism domestically and overseas. I have seen and heard the shift in this country, and can no longer acquiesce. Having the attitude that “we cant do anything about it” is Un-American at best, this statement is nothing more than a cop out, essentially lying down to the forces that aim to hold us down and ensuring that the current sickening agenda is continued. I will never lie down, and would rather die on my feet then live on my knees.

       Yes, part of the problem with the economy is corruption at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, another part that should not be underrated is the Green Movement, and its ugly little step-child, man-made global warming with its carbon credit trading. Environmental concern has become a new religion, run by fanatics, and it is deliberately destroying much of the economy of the country by attacking cheap forms of energy generation, and pushing with subsedies expensive and impracticall forms of energy distribution, while pursuing a new tax in the form of carbon credits, a scheme that accomplishing nothing of use except to line the pockets of those who operate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet another reason for the economic decline is irrational fear about terrorism, and the absurdly excessive measures that have been taken to combat it. Terrorism scarcely exists in the US, but the government wastes hundreds of billions of dollars fighting this imaginary threat, and the measures taken depress economic activity. People are reluctant to travel because of the TSA. They have trouble crossing the borders (unlike illegal Mexicans, who have no trouble at all). There is so much red tape, and so many regulations that businesses are strangled before they are born. Meanwhile, the elite are above such petty concerns and continue to reap record profits ... for themselves.

       Its just about being focused on one issue, I cant go trying to fix the world, just the parts I can make a difference in. I have taken a stance to stand behind the cause of taking the huge corporate money out of politics, these other issues that affect us, the environment, education, food safety etc will ultimately fall in line once uncorrupt leaders are elected

       I live in Salt Lake City Utah, the air is so thick you can chew it, ranked in the top 5 polluted cities in the US during the winter, and it is because the legislators in this state have passed laws preventing tighter restrictions on pollution for corporations. There is an "action plan" calling on people to carpool and drive less, while a huge oil refinery is slated to increase production. This would not happen if we had people other than Mike Lee, Orrin Hatch and Gary Herbert running things, I truly believe that, yes

       mike lee helped conspire to shut down the government with cruz last summer,  Utah ended up paying the government millions to reopen the national parks to open them during the shutdown,  because their Senator helped mastermind the whole thing. Hatch is the Senator with the most seniority in Congress,  and recently received just shy of 6 figures by aipac, an Israeli lobbying interest that pressed for at stricter sanctions against Iran that would over step unilateral peace talks that started this week with Syria

       Kay did I just misunderstand you at first cause I do that sometimes. If you're actually pro-ecological conservation that's great, the thing about cheap energy in your other post threw me off a bit.

       No worries, the local government is working on focusing on having people act in their personal lives to stop pollution, while corporate pollution will increase. Obviously, this is wrong and pro business, anti people, so getting people elected who arent able to receive contributions by oil refinery groups would make for a real change in this valley rather than just having the actions of the individual help offset the actions of a corporation

       I wasn't aware one could obfuscate the truth, it has always been my experience that when a truth is told, all who are present have no trouble seeing it, or, that is, at least a consensus of those present.
Secondly, the quotes you posted do not originate from
       <a href="/u/fighttherealenemy">
        /u/fighttherealenemy
       </a>
       , stop baiting that user.
Thirdly, leave your thesaurus at home when you are trying to stupefy an audience.
