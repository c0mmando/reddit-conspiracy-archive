       <p>
        DeHaven-Smith has shown that the conspiracy-theory label was popularized as a pejorative term by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in a propaganda program initiated in 1967.[20] The program was directed at criticisms of the Warren Commission’s conclusion that President Kennedy had been assassinated by a lone gunman. The propaganda campaign called on media corporations and journalists to criticize “conspiracy theorists” and raise questions about their motives and judgments. The CIA told its contacts that “parts of the conspiracy talk appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists.”

       "Conspiracy" is normal for humans. Hiding information from each other and attempting to fool people in order to get what you want. I have been involved in many conspiracies, but they were local. All you have to do is scale them up. One example: A local business uses cheaper beer later in the evening when everyone is drunk and sells it at a higher price. The bar tender doesn't even know this. I was instructed by my manager to replace the kegs (I was a cook there, and I also stocked everything), and told to use the cheap beer later when a keg ran out. So it was just me and the manager.
      </p>
      <p>
       This solves the criticism "but so many people must be in on it." The waitress taking the order, the bar tender, etc. Not true.
      </p>
      <p>
       So simply scale this up to a government agency or corporation. Conspiracies are as American as apple pie. Cointellpro, MKULTRA, Edgewood, St Louis experiments, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, by definition, crime investigators are conspiracy theorists.

       Compartmentalization is the term you're looking for, to explain how so many people could be a part of a conspiracy, but have no idea that they are participating in a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who says the government couldn't possibly keep a "big" conspiracy a secret is actively and deliberately ignoring how well the government keeps big secrets every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
       A simple way to prove that someone who claims the government is incapable of keeping a big secret is to ask them when they discovered that the NSA was spying on everyone, and how long they were doing that before it was public knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another good way is to inquire as to the person's
       <em>
        specific knowledge
       </em>
       about ongoing military &amp; intelligence operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow the fact that the FedGov has millions of employees yet still keeps numerous huge secrets is easily ignored by the people who claim that the government couldn't possibly keep something like 9/11 a secret.

       The term only came to use in the years proceeding the Kennedy assassination. Because some people insisted that Oswald didn't act alone, but instead "conspired" with others, they were called "conspiracy theorists" as they were theorizing a non-singular (Warren Commission) narrative of the events.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term eventually soaked into popular culture, and is now associated with anyone who goes against the popular viewpoint on scary issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       The puppet-masters know that only about 80% of people are susceptible to hypnosis. Therefore they knowingly cater to the other 20% and in fact try and propagate a lot of the "conspiracy" knowledge in the first place. The black propaganda is actually beneficial to them as it makes the truth seekers look even stupider to the rest.
