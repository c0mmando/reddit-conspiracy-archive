       December 7th, 1941.  Do some really basic research.  You wont have to dig very far.
      </p>
      <p>
       The local newspapers were printing front page stories predicting the attack several days in advance.  It was well known that it was impending upfront, but the after the fact narrative was treated much differently.

       The attack and the Arizona are 2 different things. The Arizona was a lucky hit, and the bomb exploded in the munition room. Without that PH's casualties would be half of what they are.
  The attack itself, I agree with you...

       I get your point. The shot that broke it's back may have been lucky, indeed.  But the fact is, the Arizona and 17 other ships were treated as bait that day.  2500 American soldiers lost their lives as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had the Arizona not exploded due to the lucky shot, the casualty numbers would more likely have been less than a 1/3 of the total outcome.  Also, the Arizona, like most of the other ships in the harbor might have been salvageable.  Hindsight is 20/20, but it can easily be seen that US military intelligence took a gamble on this day, hoping the collateral damage from the Japanese attack would be enough to inspire enough shock and public outrage to go to war, but not enough damage to ruin the long term chances of the pacific fleet.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this light, I consider the attack and the Arizona all part of the same thing.

       The Japanese (and the US government who knew about the upcoming attack) got lucky at least twice if not more.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        If no lucky bomb, casualties are much lower.
       </li>
       <li>
        They actually noticed the airplanes coming in, but mistakenly they thought they were Americans coming home.
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They discovered a Japanese U-boat but no alarm was sounded.
        </p>
        <p>
         So let's imagine that they have a 20-30 minutes warning and the Arizona doesn't sink. Casualties would have been most likely under 1000, and they would have inflicted great damage on the Japanese airplanes, and if they decide to follow them, maybe on some of the warships.
        </p>
        <p>
         Imagine the headline:  US Navy successfully repel Japanese attack!
        </p>

         Well, that wouldn't have been that good for the war plans....

       Husband Kimmel was the admiral and commander of the pacific fleet and a family friend.  Kimmel knew it was coming, but not when it was coming.  It's the well regarded belief among his peers that FDR was alerted by British intelligence days before the impending attack and made the decision to sacrifice the fleet.

       That fleet had been stationed in San Diego up until just a few months prior to the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       The movement of those ships to Pearl Harbor must have appeared to the Japanese, to be in preparation of upgrading the embargo to a blockade (which would have been an act of war).
      </p>
      <p>
       So placing those ships in harms way while presenting a credible threat to the Japanese -- could very well have been a sacrifice of some of those ships.

       There is no Al Qaeda as an international terrorist organization. There are a lot of loose groups which have a common goal and they are associated with Al Qaeda. The point being, it is a fake enemy. It conveniently sprouted up in Iraq before Iraq was bombed. It pops up wherever needed.

To what department did they submit the forms? Is there an official Al Qaeda tax ID number? Can we see their expense reports? Which departments recognize them as legal entities? No. Al Qaeda is not a legal entity. It's fictional, but it's not a legal entity. I don't think you know what a legal entity is.

       Or... Israel is a much much smaller country with much higher security due to the prevalence of violence, terrorism (or freedom-fighting/rebellion against unjust rule, if you prefer), or general security threats than pre-9/11 US.

       Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Al Qaeda fails much more often than it succeeds everywhere in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Al Qaeda failed badly the first time it tried to blow up the WTC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Al Qaeda has tried to blow up planes coming into America in 1995 (the "Bojinka Plot"), 2001 (the "Shoe Bomber"), 2006 (the "liquid bomb" plot that started the TSA's "War on Moisture"), 2009 (the "Underwear Bomber"), and 2010 (the "printer cartridge" bombs).
      </p>
      <p>
       They sent a guy to the US to hijack a Propane truck to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge, he decided he liked Americans better than Al Qaeda and defected.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attack on the USS Cole was a second attempt, the first time they tried it with the USS The Sullivans the boat sank.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just a handfull of their failures, try googling "failed Al Qaeda plots" for dozens more.

       Not really. Al-Quaeda is a fake organisation propagated by the Western media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, terrorists exist. Or should I call them freedom-fighters trying desperately to repel foreign invaders?
      </p>
      <p>
       But the truth of the matter is that Al-Quaeda (as a global terrorist organisation) is a propaganda meme designed to instil fear in western voters, in order to create support for illegal wars in Islamic countries who are trying to resist the corporate paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Israeli regime is the foremost proponent and designer of this propaganda.
       <br/>
       Therefore, it makes perfect sense that the creators of this fugazzi would deem their own territory off-limits for these fake terror attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       All international conflict (and wars) are created, controlled and dictated by the 'needs' of Zionism.

       I wouldn't say Al-qaida doesn't exist though, I think it exists but it's completely organized and made by the Mossad. They recruit young impressionable minds and nudge them to do things. This kind of organization isn't limited to one group though, they do this across the world and give the impression of organized groups. In Russia you have the Chechens, in China you will have the Uyghur terrorist. Uyghur people are Turks who live in China, they are obviously a minority group which combined with their Arab heritage gives them the perfect MO for a terrorist group.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attacks on tiananmen square  are just the beginning of their operations in China. Israel is demonozing Arabs en mass, because who hates the Arabs more than the Zionist pigs? Well it seems now most of the world hates them, and guess why?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you understand where Jihad comes from it makes zero sense for them to go after the targets they are going after. But they want you to believe that terrorists indiscriminately bomb everyone across the world because of some insane drive to kill all non believers, which isn't at all true and isn't at all what Jihad means.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Yemeni hospital massacre for example is a complete setup. No practicing Muslim would ever do that in the name of Allah. But you go on the internet and look for the videos of the massacre and you will see a whole list of comments damning the Muslims into hell. Even Arabs fall for it and they start to become disgusted with Islam because they don't agree with the incredible disgusting things that are done in their name.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they don't understand is that these attacks not only divide the world against the Arabs, but it divides the Arabs among themselves. It creates "extremists" and "moderates". The "extremists" are those who do not fear to fight the NWO, the moderates are those who conform to western culture and practice Islam in a mostly passive and symbolic manner. They will never stand up for injustice because they are afraid to be labeled terrorists. In essence they will be passified in much the same way as the west is passified into inaction.

       I agree with almost everything you've said.
       <br/>
       Al-Quaeda, as depicted by the MSM does not exist.
       <br/>
       It's used as a catch-all term for all Islamic resistance groups that have sprung up post 9/11.
       <br/>
       Hezbollah, Hamas, Fatah, Muslim Brotherhood et al cannot be clumped together by western MSM because they obviously existed as seperate entities long before Al-Quaeda was ever reported on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the term 'Al-Quaeda' itself was a CIA creation used to describe the Afghani mujaheddin that were supplied and trained by the CIA to fight the Soviet occupation of their country.
       <br/>
       Post 9/11, this term was co-opted to describe a non-homogenous group that conveniently could be blamed for the attacks that happened on that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, your opinion on the 'Tiananmen Square Massacre ™' is one I've never heard before.
       <br/>
       Not saying you're wrong, but does any evidence exist that can point to there being an Islamic element in this event? Whether a genuine attempt at resistance or one created by CIA/Mossad.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I also do agree that many so-called Islamic jihadists are created and funded by western intelligence agencies using naive and idealistic patsies.
       <br/>
       And I agree that many so-called terrorist attacks are not perpetrated by Islamic jihadists at all. These attacks are performed by the CIA/Mossad/MI6 et cetera and then dressed up to look like they were performed by Muslims.

       Note especially this : "The CCTV report, however, said the Tiananmen plotters decided to form a terrorist group only last month."

       This was a setup by the same people that are known for this imo. I guess it could be argued that China is taking it's first steps into false flag to perpetuate an agenda. That's how its being portrayed by some media, but knowing the Chinese I don't think this is the case, this is clearly Mossad. Remember the Zionists are making their "pivot" to China, so my guess is you will be seeing a lot more attacks like this.

       Wow. Not sure how this one slipped under my radar.
       <br/>
       But again, I agree with you. And seeing as this Tiananmen event is different to the one I thought you were referring to, I agree with you entirely this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 was a poisoned chalice for the western elite.
       <br/>
       Sure, they achieved many long-standing goals following this event. But, it woke millions of people up to the reality of their deeds.
       <br/>
       I'd hazard a guess that many within their ranks are angry at the exposure it's brought them. And Pandora's box has now been irretrievably opened.

       man we all know the us owns alqueda. alqueda also just happened to invade syria as they decided against central banking.
      </p>
      <p>
       what we need to do is compile ways of spreading conspiracies and focusing on a few big undeniable ones. that way shills will be destroyed by our unity guy. If we each day/week focus on one conspiracy to spread with undeniable proof then anyone against it will therefore have to employ much larger resources to deny it. Hopefully making reddit focus on the topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       we keep posting info to each other only which keeps it from spreading as fast.
We need to prioritize information, then uniformly administer it to others. Even if we focus on one subreddit at a time, this subreddit will grow and our resources aswell. But we also have to follow rules, each conspiracy has a section it would apply to, UFO, science, health, politics, money, spirituality, aliens, technology(tesla), so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       and if we do it with only the information each of us ACTUALLY KNOWS then we can fend of shills quite easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       even if you dont agree with what i say, if anyone has a better plan then by all means go ahead. Id like to know if you guys would actually be interested in doing something like this. so ifso comment give an idea even if it isnt mine some popularity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we can get people who know whats going on more so in their feild applying it to the conspiracy, then more loose ends get fixed. and more people feel obligated to make things better.

       exactly. and this is why there is a 50/50 split in ukraine. I just hope by the time it gets to each of us in our respective countries. enough people will know whats really going on, and spread within their groups.
the 50/50 split is what they want. We already know its suppose to be a 1%/99% battle.

       i know, im just lazy. when i actually give it effort and my facts are sorted i will proofread/organize. its just this keeps me under the radar until i have a planned method of spreading. you are completely right and i intend on doing that eventually.

       English speakers tend to skip over sentences/posts that don't feature capitalization in the beginning of sentences.

       It makes it much harder to read posts if there isn't any capitalization. If nothing else, just do that.

       Documentary Power of Nightmares by Adam Curtis.
      </p>
      <p>
       In it he implies that Al Qaeda as a hierarchical organization with international cells (the bogeyman summoned by the neo-cons) does not exist, but it is still a flag for Jihadists and Islamists, an ideology. And of course while not discussed in the article, once such flag is rised by any group, funding starts pouring in.

       Actually, not a a single jihadist group proclaims themselves to be a part of 'Al-Quaeda'.
       <br/>
       This is a tag forced upon them by western MSM.
       <br/>
       Each and every resistance group has a separate identity driven by their own grievances.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying Islamic terrorists don't exist, and I'm not saying there isn't a threat to western society.
       <br/>
       But, the idea that there is a global terrorist group with cells around the world plotting coordinated attacks is the biggest crock of shit ever perpetrated and consumed en masse by uninformed and gullible westerners.
       <br/>
       Second only to the Cold War lie.
       <br/>
       And, practically all of these jihadists exist only because of the misdeeds/crimes of our governments abuses of their human rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       "If you illegally invade another country, bomb the shit out it and then indiscriminately kill innocent civilians, you're gonna have a bad time.."
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is what our elite wants. Perpetual war. And the ability to propagandise the need for perpetual war.
       <br/>
       Just like the War on Drugs. It can never be won, and the 'enemy' can never be defeated.

       See... I can't even agree with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if ALQ doesn't truly exist as some sort of facebook group, to say there isn't a threat from radical islam...is absolute shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is the IDEOLOGY that seems to be so pervasive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything from the Boston Bombing to the Stalingrad bombings seem to be motivated if not by separatism but by ACTUAL religious influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its always what "some power" has done to "Muslims around the world"...and when they say that...then we have a problem.

       They were done by young men (chechen islamists) who felt the people in their homeland were being taken advantage of by the larger states of influence.

       Incorrect. How does this same claim keep surfacing?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is actually claimed is that the
       <em>
        threat
       </em>
       posed by Al-Qaeda never existed as substantially as was said. Not the same thing at all.

       I agree that they control the governments of the US and Canada.
       <br/>
       But I vehemently disagree that we're doomed.
       <br/>
       Global support for Israel is rapidly diminishing.
       <br/>
       Without US support militarily and in the UN, they would be fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       And one only has to look at the recent refusal of the British Parliament to join the 'coalition of the willing' in attacking Syria, and then the US choosing to try to make peace with Iran as a sign that their is influence is definitely on the wain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone now accepts that the leaders of Israel are insane, bloodthirsty and racist psychos.
       <br/>
       Unless you're a Zionist or are being paid to trumpet their ideology, then it's hard to find anyone who supports their stance.
       <br/>
       Everyone knows they're war criminals with no respect for international law or the rights of non-Jews.
       <br/>
       And everyone, who's not a shill, condemns Israeli settlements.
       <br/>
       Israel has defied more UN resolutions than every other country put together.
       <br/>
       Everyone knows the truth, but change is always difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: This is not a complaint against Judaism. I hold Judaism in the same regard that I hold Christianity, Islam and all other religions. They're all full of shit and are simply archaic forms of peer-pressure and mind control of the unenlightened.
       <br/>
       What I have a problem with is Zionism.
       <br/>
       A demonstrably racist ideology writ large.

       Yeah.  I was wondering if someone was going to call racist on me.

       It also needs to be said that like most countries, the actions of the government don't necessarily reflect the will of the people, although they might.  I just don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Canada the opinion of the majority doesn't effect the actions of the government.  I think that can be said for most modern governments.  Even if it did, public opinion is easily swayed the propaganda put out by our media.

       AQ isn't the "defender of all things muslim", they are a descriptive term used to label the loosely connected sunni muslim militias that wreak havoc in the middle east.  Their primary goal seems to be unseating shiite backed governments.  It seems pretty clear that most of these militias are funded by Saudi and Western backed interests because the Shiites are doing business with Russia and China.

       Good question, something to think about.  Al Qaeda whether real or fake has not to my knowledge attacked Israel or Israeli embassies. I think the whole Palestine thing is an add on for them to unite Muslims, nothing more than a political ploy.

       No. Not at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Al-Quaida is not ideological. They are sold as such, but they are not interested in ideology. It is as much a tool to them as it is to whoever plays them as the Great Satan to be destroyed to save everyone from Terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       They take over a village and say that the infidels will be purged, extract tributes from the population, and leave a local presence to crush any dissent under the guise of Sharia. In Afghanistan I can only assume it's like a circlejerk, where the American army fucks shit up, then they say it is all their fault, then they fuck shit up, then the area gets re-taken, and so on. Nobody wins there. But they both reinforce the "Great Enemy" lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Al Quaida, in short, is interested in money, and attacking Israel would be financial suicide, as any local operatives would be ruthlessly disposed of and would bring them "attention" that they would rather avoid.

       The fact that Muslims go to Israel for refuge to begin with is ironic, no? If Israel is so evil and Muslims hate it, why go through the trouble to get there illegally? Why not stay in beautiful Egypt or Sudan? The deportation aside, which are I might add, are perfectly legally, since they are illegal immigrants. Hell, the US does it with Mexicans everyday.

       I am not denying that fact its ironic they are trying to go to Israel of all places. But let's be honest..that is the first place I would go if I was in a country with warring factions killing everyone in their path. Drones flying over head targeting random people. These people are crossing vast amounts of desert just to find a refuge in what they perceive is the safest place in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's sad is that Israel is turning them away.. If the cartel wars in mexico become even worse I would expect mexican's to want to come here.. But they come here for better work. That's not a reason to illegally enter a country.

       no shit.. we didn't just take the land. it's been hundreds of years. It's been less than a century since Israel took over Palestinian land. You will see them fight for at least another 100 years..then it will subside as generations get further away from the root.

       And so who, exactly, has "gone after Israel" before? As if anyone could just decide and plan to do this. The fact that you are implying that Israel owns and runs Al-Queada(or it's run by a multi-agency "industry") yes, shows some legitimate criticism, but don't just fake blame Israel.

       This is the blowback from their support of ISIS and related groups in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Support like that, with Iran as a common enemy, is the reason that Israel tends to be more threatened/endangered by extremists other than Al-Qaeda.  Hezbollah and Hamas are more typically the terrorists who threaten Israel.  I'm surprised no one has pointed out the comparative weakness of the threat of Al-Qaeda to Israel as opposed to their older and more established enemies.  In the worst case scenario, it looks like the Israeli government is abusing the peace process to pit enemies against each other; while hoping to acquire territory in the wake of violence instigated.  That would be consistent with some of the worse rumors I have heard about 'Eretz Israel' and crass expansionist plans.  It's a convoluted situation where you can't ascribe malice to an entire group.  However, it would be madness to deny that there is a wingnut portion of Zionist policymakers who will expand Israel by any means necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       From an outsider perspective, it looks like there is a  very unpopular group with a very secure hold on power, and that group is making deals to further its own interest at the expense of the common good.  It is blatantly obvious to see that support of Sunni extremism in Syria would create dangerous links between Hamas and Al-Qaeda.  The only way that I can reconcile smart Israelis making such a stupid move, is by attributing the mistake to a fanatical subgroup that is abusing power for its own ends.

       It's because you are not thinking religiously and contractually.  The Lord of Israel promised Jacob's people the land. It is the Promised Land. The Lord does not break his covenants as long as descendants of Jacob/ Israel do not break theirs.

      <p>
       So, what were the "contractual obligations" of the "descendants of Jacob/ Israel"? (please be precise).
      </p>
      <p>
       Have the "descendants of Jacob/ Israel" fulfilled their end of the bargain, or not?
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, it would seem like retaking "the Promised Land" by cunning, force and deception would fly in the face of their "contract" with "The Lord", no?

       In it he implies that Al Qaeda as a hierarchical organization with international cells (the bogeyman summoned by the neo-cons) does not exist, but it is still a flag for Jihadists and Islamists, an ideology. And of course while not discussed in the article, once such flag is rised by any group, funding starts pouring in.

       I get that they are willing to do it, but I can't see why. All other false flag  attacks had some type of outcome that played into their plan.

       The attack and the Arizona are 2 different things. The Arizona was a lucky hit, and the bomb exploded in the munition room. Without that PH's casualties would be half of what they are.
  The attack itself, I agree with you...

       I get your point. The shot that broke it's back may have been lucky, indeed.  But the fact is, the Arizona and 17 other ships were treated as bait that day.  2500 American soldiers lost their lives as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had the Arizona not exploded due to the lucky shot, the casualty numbers would more likely have been less than a 1/3 of the total outcome.  Also, the Arizona, like most of the other ships in the harbor might have been salvageable.  Hindsight is 20/20, but it can easily be seen that US military intelligence took a gamble on this day, hoping the collateral damage from the Japanese attack would be enough to inspire enough shock and public outrage to go to war, but not enough damage to ruin the long term chances of the pacific fleet.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this light, I consider the attack and the Arizona all part of the same thing.

       Incorrect. How does this same claim keep surfacing?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is actually claimed is that the
       <em>
        threat
       </em>
       posed by Al-Qaeda never existed as substantially as was said. Not the same thing at all.

       Actually, not a a single jihadist group proclaims themselves to be a part of 'Al-Quaeda'.
       <br/>
       This is a tag forced upon them by western MSM.
       <br/>
       Each and every resistance group has a separate identity driven by their own grievances.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying Islamic terrorists don't exist, and I'm not saying there isn't a threat to western society.
       <br/>
       But, the idea that there is a global terrorist group with cells around the world plotting coordinated attacks is the biggest crock of shit ever perpetrated and consumed en masse by uninformed and gullible westerners.
       <br/>
       Second only to the Cold War lie.
       <br/>
       And, practically all of these jihadists exist only because of the misdeeds/crimes of our governments abuses of their human rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       "If you illegally invade another country, bomb the shit out it and then indiscriminately kill innocent civilians, you're gonna have a bad time.."
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is what our elite wants. Perpetual war. And the ability to propagandise the need for perpetual war.
       <br/>
       Just like the War on Drugs. It can never be won, and the 'enemy' can never be defeated.
