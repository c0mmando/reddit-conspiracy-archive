    <div class="md"><p>I agree, for the most part. However I do think hard financial times are coming for the federales, and they may start seeking out additional methods of revenue. We&#39;ll just have to see how legalization goes in Colorado and Washington.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>TPP legislation is going through. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership</a>)</p>

<p>Marijuana is definitely a &quot;give the peons back a god given right and pass some horrible legislation while they are distracted&quot;</p>

<p>Just like they did with the gay rights. They let the homosexuals have their Federal rights, meanwhile they tried to pass something while everyone was cheering. I can&#39;t remember what it was. Was it the bombing of Syria? It was something really big that they wanted to pull the publics attention from. Shit I wish i could remember.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re all missing the point. Like gay marriage the Feds may come out and say &#39;sure guys, make your state laws and enjoy your pot!&#39; Meanwhile, you&#39;ve got them making sure all new legal marijuana users are put into a database to track and cross examine the gun-owning pot users. While maybe the government has been supportive of state laws, they&#39;ll keep it illegal on a federal level and go in and swoop in on pot smoking gun owners legally. They know they can&#39;t pass the gun control they&#39;ve been trying to get passed. Especially with all the natural disasters and the potential for looting. No one wants to be victim to that. The federales also know that legalization, at least by this point is inevitable. If they give us pot and swear to the states tht won&#39;t raid the pot stores under federal law, you can be damn sure they&#39;ll be using it as grounds for gun confiscation. Without a doubt. </p>
