<p>Really?  There has to be a log of him doing activities like this.  Wouldn&#39;t he have spent more time on the golf course than doing this?</p>

<p>It would seem that the probable reality (as opposed to plausible deniability) is that you couldn&#39;t have &quot;written a better storyline&quot;.  I can&#39;t stop wondering about this stunning &quot;coincidence&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I mean, there has to be a register of his activities.  </p>

<p>Just using common sense, though, I would speculate that he did not spend a significant proportion of his time with schoolchildren.</p>

<p>Even a first grade teacher would only have an opportunity to be with the students for, at most, 8 hours a day.  This would equal to a 33% chance <strong>for a teacher</strong>.  I doubt the President would reach even 1% of that amount of time.  So at best... .33% probability?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might be a conservative estimate: 1 day per year he reads to school children. </p>

<ul>
<li>1/365 chance for that day.</li>
</ul>

<p>Time range to read: somewhere within the normal 8 hour school day.</p>

<ul>
<li>1/8 chance to be within the hour of the two planes hitting</li>

<p>So 1/365 X 1/8 = 0.002739 X 0.125 = 0.000342375...converted to percentage is 0.0342%</p>

<p>Is it a <strong>fact</strong> that he was in a classroom at the time?  Yes.</p>

<p>Is it a <strong>fact</strong> that for him to be in this exact situation is extremely unlikely?  Yes</p>

<p>You can decide what narrative you want to believe.  If you want to believe that it was simply an extremely unlikely coincidence, then that is fine.  If you want to believe that he was placed in this exact situation, then you can investigate that too.</p>

The only things you&#39;ve said are circular comments about <em>thinking</em> and <em>cognative dissonance</em> (which you don&#39;t understand).

<p>I do understand probabilities. The probability in question is low. I don&#39;t think it is relevant. I explained why (low probability [alone] does not turn coincidence into cospiracy) and you disagree but offer no counter explaination. Is it unreasonable to inquire about your opinion on the matter?

<p>&quot;Where were you when you heard Kennedy was killed?&quot; is a common question asked of people in that generation.</p>

<p>Is it plausible that some people do not remember?  Yes.  Is it even probable that some people do not remember?  Yes.</p>

<p>Is it plausible that GHW Bush doesn&#39;t remember where he was that day?  Yes.  Is it probable that GHW Bush, being involved in the CIA, having a father who was a senator, and who was family friends with the Dulles family doesn&#39;t remember?</p>

<p>I guess you can decide that.</p>

<p>I agree, I just found it interesting that you posed that question and when I answered it for myself I realized that most people were probably doing something they usually do. After all it was a weekday morning, most people have a routine at that time of day.
But of course, again, the odds are that at any given time of day most people will be doing something they usually do at that time of day... kind of circular logic but that&#39;s the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in class. Anatomy, I think. </p>

<p>And you are exactly right. On a weekday morning, most people are going to be doing routine things. </p>

<p>Whats funny is that while the president doesn&#39;t read books to kids that often, he <em>does</em> make public appearances often. So while the odds of him reading to a class during the event are quite low, the odds of him doing some sort of PR thing are much higher. </p>

<p>To extrapolate and use our own experiences as an analogy; I was in class when it happened (quite likely), I also happened to be working ahead so I didn&#39;t have homework (maybe the second time I had <em>ever</em> done that). If one were to focus on that particular detail, one could say that I was doing something incredibly unlikely to ever coincide with the events on 9/11. </p>

<p>This is what made me consider the line of questioning posed in this topic a dead end. He&#39;s probably doing speeches or talks where it would be awkward to interrupt fairly often. The fact that it was in front of kids is probably immaterial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That has always been a powerful clue in my mind that Bush was involved.  The chances of him being there at that moment are stupid.  Plus there&#39;s that video of him saying he watched on TV as the first plane hit the building.  Look at the stupid look on his stupid-looking face when he&#39;s &quot;told&quot; about the attack.  He isn&#39;t shocked in the way I&#39;d be shocked if someone told me something like that and I didn&#39;t already know about it.</p>

For example, &quot;Mr. President, we are under attack!

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly the worst thing they could do is rush him to the car in a panic. How would they know if AF1 was the target? What if an ambush or car bomb was waiting for them? The president was at least immediately safe, and it would be a bad idea to move him from immediate safety to potential danger without feeling out those potential threats first. Also, even in the whitehouse they would just move him to another part of the whitehouse. Are you suggesting that the entire Secret Service is in on the conspiracy too? </p>

<p>So no, thats not the real problem. </p>

<p>In some cases, absolutely yes. Its how pheasant avoid predators. They do not move. When they take flight is when they get shot. Similarly, the school was secure, while the road was not. Just because a building was hit by a plane does not mean that all modes of attack that day are by way of plane. The WTC could have been a tactic to lure him on the road back to AF1, where an ambush lie in wait. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t abandon immediate safety unless either you know for sure it will no longer be safe in the immediate future, or you have secured a safe means of movement. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does Andrew Card, Chief of Staff and in charge of the SS detail that day, translate to &quot;the entire Secret Service&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the entire Secret Service would know protocol, not just one guy. If this one guy and his subordinates were in on a conspiracy and were going against protocol, you can bet your ass the entire rest of the organization (those not in on the conspiracy) would call them out on it. There comes a point where you have so many lies flying around that either everybody is in on the lie, or there are fewer lies than you think. </p>

<p>It would only have been necessary for Card to be &quot;in on it&quot;. Everybody else would simply be obligated to follow orders. If fact, at that time we have no idea if anyone besides Card even knew a second plane had crashed. It could very well be that he was the only one there that was notified.</p>

<p>I imagine in that situation you are running the president out to the car to GTFO. I would grab my radio or phone and have op support patch me through to the nearest air port. &quot;Hey Jim, I need you to tell me if there are any deviations in our local airspace. No? Good.
