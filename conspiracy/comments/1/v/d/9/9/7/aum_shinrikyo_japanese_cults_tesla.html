      <p>
       I posted this about a year ago, and I thought I would resubmit because I'm sure there are many out there who haven't come across this extremely fascinating information.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/report-japan-police-arrest-final-cult-fugitive-from-1995-nerve-gas-attack-on-tokyo-subway-159142215.html">
        First of all, here's a link to the story of the final suspect in the 1994 subway attack who was just captured. He was the personal bodyguard to the Aum leader.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A little background:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aum_Shinrikyo">
        Aum Shinrikyo
       </a>
       was founded in 1984 by the eccentric mystic
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoko_Asahara">
        Shoko Asahara
       </a>
       . Asahara developed a relatively good reputation and a decent following, and he was even allowed to attend personal meditation sessions with the Dalai Lama.
      </p>
      <p>
       That changed quickly and dramatically when
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aum_Shinrikyo">
        Aum Shinrikyo
       </a>
       was internationally discredited after
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarin_gas_attack_on_the_Tokyo_subway">
        the deadly sarin gas attack in Tokyo
       </a>
       which killed 13 people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, Aum is known as "Aleph" and they try to distance themselves as much as possible from Asahara and the early days of Aum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my question: was Aum
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       directly involved and did
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoko_Asahara">
        Shoko Asahara
       </a>
       really order the attacks?
      </p>
      <p>
       In one night, Aum went from a quirky cult to a universally hated terrorist organization (the Dalai Lama had to quickly distance himself from Asahara, obviously).
      </p>
      <p>
       But is there more to the story? Of course, that's why I'm posting to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       !
      </p>
      <p>
       There is evidence that Aum was beginning to dabble in some taboo areas of technology, mostly under the guidance of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideo_Murai">
        Hideo Murai
       </a>
       , who was claimed by some to be
       <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_AUM04.htm">
        one of the most intelligent men in Japan.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.deepblacklies.co.uk/the_battle_for_aum_shinrikyko.htm">
        Aum was getting into some dangerous territory: none other than Nikola Tesla's electromagnetic weapons systems.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you think they were just in the "research" stage of this taboo technology,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjawarn_station">
        a bizarre seismic event occurred on May 28th, 1993 at the Banjawarn station in Western Australia, a site owned by Aum
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened at Banjawarn is eerily reminiscent of the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event">
        Tunguska event
       </a>
       which was rumored to have been caused by Tesla himself in an experiment gone wrong (...or right?). Earthquakes and a meteor were ruled out, and the event remains a mystery, but in light of Aum's interests, it isn't too hard to speculate what may have occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the 1995 attacks, Banjawarn station was raided, and when it was determined that Aum had tested sarin gas on sheep at the site, it wasn't long before the "evidence" was used to damn the entire cult, Asahara included.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asahara and several other members are
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       on death row, almost 20 years later, as the defense claims that "new evidence" will turn up and exonerate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was there any particular reason, other than their increasing independence and dabbling with devastating super weapons (not to mention their buddying up with Russia and the KGB...several individuals in the KGB were also Aum members), that Aum needed to be put out of the picture? I think there is!
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_earthquake">
        The Great Hanshin (or Kobe) earthquake
       </a>
       occurred on January 17th, 1995, killing over 6,000 people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's where things get a bit fuzzy. The rumor is that eight days earlier, on a Tokyo radio broadcast on January 8th,
       <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/tesla/esp_tesla_9.htm">
        Shoko Asahara predicted that a major quake would soon occur at Kobe and it would be initiated by a "foreign power" with an EM weapons system.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Eight days later, the earthquake happened!
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the tricky part: for the life of me I can't find a legitimate confirmation of the January 8th radio broadcast, but the internet is littered with that claim, so it must be based on
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       . Any help confirming or denying this would be greatly appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>
       What
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be confirmed, however, is Hideo Murai's immediate response, namely to come out publicly with his belief that the earthquake was actually an attack. After all, if Murai was dabbling in Tesla doom weapons, I'm sure he would recognize one if he saw it (and also their KGB connections may have tipped them off).
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, Murai put his life on the line and made several high-profile appearances with the Japanese press regarding his claim. On April 23rd of that same year, literally during one of these press conferences, a Yakuza member stabbed Murai repeatedly in the presence of 10 police officers, who practically just watched.
      </p>
      <p>
       So enter the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza">
        Yakuza
       </a>
       . Why were they silencing him and who were they doing it for? Some have also alleged that Aum's rival Buddhist sect (cult)
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soka_Gakkai">
        Sōka Gakkai
       </a>
       which had ties to the Yakuza and Japanese politicians was
       <a href="http://socyberty.com/history/conspiracy-theories-the-gassers-of-tokyo/">
        involved with framing them as well.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, these are obviously wild-eyed speculations, but it's a conspiracy I rarely hear anyone talk about, even here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was Aum stepping on too many toes and did they have to be "put out of the picture" and discredited forever?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or were they really psychopathic people under the deranged rule of Asahara who were ordered to carry out a murderous act of terrorism?
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, is there any correlation between these recent Aum arrests and the
       <a href="http://siftumbra.wikia.com/wiki/UMBRA_Wiki">
        Umbra broadcasts
       </a>
       , a mysterious "number station"-like series of encoded radio broadcasts that began on March 20th, 2013, the anniversary of the sarin gas attack?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for reading this, any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

       One minor thing I would point out is that the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event">
        Tunguska event
       </a>
       is now widely believed to be caused by a large ice comet which exploded in the air rather than impacting the ground, thus accounting for the lack of rock debris. This hasn't been proven definitively of course, but I've never seen hard evidence for a Tesla Death Ray either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, though, some interesting information and speculations. There is certainly a history in America and Europe of
       <a href="http://www.deephistory.us/secret-societies.php">
        spook ops overlapping with weird cults
       </a>
       . A prime example would be the Masonic Lodge P2, which served as the major operational hub for Operation Gladio, one of the longest-running and widest-ranging black ops in history. Ordo Temply Orientis, the Church of Scientology, the Temple of Set, the Roundtable Foundation, and other occult groups were likewise set up by people with strong ties to military and intelligence organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of this crossover can perhaps simply be ascribed to the personality of intelligence agents and occultists alike who enjoy the feeling of access to secret knowledge and power unknown to the masses. What attracts a certain type to one group might attract them to the other. Clearly though, the secretive nature of many occult organizations does make them useful sites to organize illegal activities out of the public's view. A more cynical motive on the part of intelligence agencies might be to prey on the number of social outcasts and misfits who are often drawn to occult groups, whether to use them as MKULTRA-style test subjects (see Jonestown) or useful idiots/brainwashed patsies (see Sirhan Sirhan). Last but not least, intelligence agencies have shown a genuine interest over the decades in studying psychic phenomenon for espionage purposes, so keeping tabs on those who dabble in such areas might seem a sensible precaution.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1995, British born Geologist/Geophysicist, Harry Mason, stumbled across a strange, unaccountable earthquake which rumbled across the vast open spaces of Western Australia two years earlier.  The event took place at 11.03 p.m., on 28 May 1993 with an epi-centre close to Banjawarn sheep station in the Leonora-Laverton area - North-west of Perth.  The event registered 3.7 on the Richter scale and was assumed to have been the first ever recorded quake in that part of Australia.  Mason, who was very familiar with the region and it’s geological composition, was intrigued.  Initially believing the tremor was the result of a meteorite impact, he set about gathering detailed data.[xvi]
       </p>
       <p>
        Eyewitnesses reported sighting a fireball trailing across the sky just minutes before the subsequent tremor.  This was followed by a bright blue flash and shortly afterwards, by an earth tremor measuring 3.7 on the Richter scale.  Shortly following this a “large hemisphere of orange light, lined with a silverish glow, rose above the apparent blast site.”[xvii]  Extraordinarily, the dome of light remained in place for two hours, and then rapidly vanished like “someone turning off a switch.”
Additional investigation by Mason centred on the South East Great Sandy Desert of Western Australia.  An area unknown for earthquake activity until 1970, an amazing 173 tremors measuring between 3-0 on the Richter scale occurred between 1970-3, with the majority between March and early October 1970.  The epi-centres of these events are spaced exactly 10 kilometres apart, along “8 lines each 50-70 km long.  Several similar events have occurred subsequently.  With the present figure standing at 246 (through 1995), Mason concludes they are “abnormally regular,” and believes Australia is being surreptitiously used as a testing ground for advanced “scalar E/M weapons exercises. Originally, Mason thought these tests may have been of Russian KGB - or more probably French origin.”[xxvii]  However, recent data points to Scalar EM weapon tests conducted from the top secret US Navy Exmouth Peninsula Tx facility.[xxviii]  The US Navy connection is intriguing.

       Thanks for posting this theory. I am intrigued by what happened at Banjawarn station event. The 'gas' testing seems to be a perfect cover to keep people away for years from investigating such a remote area for more information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I am lazy, was there ever an official report about the raid at Banjawarn station and what was discovered?
      </p>
      <p>
       If 'cold molding' as described on your "most intelligent" link above is a true process (I cant find any real science after a quick google search) could it be used to liquefy solid rock along a fault line? Could the 2011 earthquake be a use of the technology?

       His yelling of "Judea" likely had nothing to do with Mossad. Israel isn't at the heart of every conspiracy, obviously.

        The Judea Cipher
The last utterance of Hideo Murai, following multiple stab wounds was "Yudaya." Translated as "Judea," this led to intense speculation.
        <strong>
         Aum press spokesman, Fumihoro Joyu later revealed that this was a codeword.
        </strong>
        According to investigative reporter Yoichi Shimatsu Clark, its significance partly lies in the Jewish state’s Star of David emblem - the six-pointed star. This is also the symbol of Japan’s imperial household.
        <strong>
         Inside the grounds of the Imperial Palace is a guarded facility boasting thousands of six-pointed stars.
        </strong>
        It was here that representatives of Aum met with other shadowy but powerful individuals then in government to discuss methods of acquiring the most advanced weapons technology. The order to assassinate Murai also originated from this building, it is now believed.

       The US Senate took it seriously. You sure you're in the right sub? "You guys," assuming it's false without glancing at it to see that it was the subject of a US Senate investigation, belittling while doing 0 actual research- seems like a conspiratard to me.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Aum’s singular interest in weapons of mass destruction - including sophisticated earthquake, weather and plasma weapons - were considered serious enough to launch a special investigation by the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.  Chaired by Senator Sam Nunn, the committee spent five months conducting hundreds of interviews of “both government and private individuals.”[iv]  These included classified briefings from numerous US intelligence agencies.  Their findings were published in an October 1995, 100 page report on the Aum cult.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Nunn report, in addition to outlining Aum’s large international membership and massive finances of US$1 billion plus, also revealed the cult’s fascination for Tesla weapons.  The Senate report describes Aum’s visits to the New York based International Tesla Society (ITS), where they sought to obtain a number of his books, patents and papers.  A representative of the ITS told Senate investigators that Aum’s interest focused on Tesla’s experiments with “resonating frequencies,” adding that “Tesla had experimented in creating earthquakes.”  Significantly, the report also states that Tesla claimed “…with his technology he could ‘split the world’ in two.”

       <p>
        At some point, the Aum became very interested in the ideas and inventions of 
Nikola Tesla, a scientist who experimented in the fields of atmospherics, 
electromagnetics, fluid d)Tiamics, and geodynamics in the early 1900's.
When the Staff inquired as to why the Aum would be interested in Tesla's work, 
the official speculated that they may have sought information on Tesla's experiments with resonating frequencies. He stated that Tesla had experimented in creating earthquakes and that Tesla was quoted as saying that with his technology he 
could "split the world" in two.
