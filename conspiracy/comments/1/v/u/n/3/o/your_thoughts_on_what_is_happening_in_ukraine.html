Apparently even John McCain is supporting the protesters.

       Could greater worldwide powers be involved in this disturbance??

       Im from Ukraine, our current president is dictator, he was in jail 3 times for different crimes. The reason he became president is because he is head of the most powerful mafia clan and friend of the richest ukrainian oligarchs Medvedchuk and Rinat Akhmetov (who has more than 100 hired kills of his opponents since 90's). They are also supported by Russia because theare from eastern regions, and support close integration with Russia. In exchange for support of their dictatorship they help russian corporations to interven the market and overtake national companies for cheap, they also maintain russian naval base in Sevestopol, which is why Ukraine unable to cooperate with NATO. It appears that we are heading towards civil war, becouse there are strong supporters from both sides and Yanukovich want to maintain his power by any price, because if he loses he will surely go to jail again

       Might be kind of an obvious question but who do you think the military would support if civil war broke out? Are there supporters for both sides or do they support Yanukovych?

       The govermant has strong support from state police forces which is totally corupted, there are no fair courts in country either. Actually at the moment country is controlled by mafia clans from eastern regions who had integrated in the government, this is the main reason of the riots.  The influnce of military forces are much weeker now than it was after the collapse of soviet union. During the orange revolution in 2004 they maintained neutrality, but now if they are forced to engage the crisis it would would be about 50/50, depending on the region (eastern regions vs western).

       could go either way. it could be whipped up, or a situation being taken advantage of and manipulated. could be a fight that goes deeper, into engagement of 'them', or could be completely unrelated to anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       the most likely to me is that, though we the people have not yet begun to fully articulate what is happening, there is a global process or resistance and reform underway. despite particular analysis, look at Greece, Thailand, the Latin American Pink Tide, the Arab Spring, etc...

       This shit is getting real. things are coming to a head. and not some foretold, BS Mayan 2012 shit. this is, perhaps, a staggered yet collective (though perhaps independent entirely) response, or series thereof, across the globe to the absolutely systemic, pervasive and intentional rigging of the game for them against us.

       I've lived in L'viv for a year (near the Polish border).

       I think that either the Ukrainian leadership is incredibly stupid or very smart.  It seems like they could not be doing more to rouse the population into rebellion.  I'm considering the possibility that this is being done on purpose, for some reason.  If it is not a purposefully bad move on their part then Sun Tzu would have to smack the shit out of the Ukrainian leadership.

       I've lived in Kiev, L'viv, Odessa and Chernivtsi and some months in Moldova including Transnistria.  I'm from Calfornia and a long time poster here and its my opinion that Western Ukrainians simply do not understand the dangers and downsides that the EU brings.  There is lots of corruption in Ukraine but IMO there is a particular decadence in the West that is quite difficult to understand until you have lived both in and out of it for some considerable time.  Currently I'm choosing to be in Poland for the Winter and then I will go into L'viv, Ukraine and then to Transnistria.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the Ukrainian women go I would not expect them to be so incredibly involved on the front lines in a massive revolt such as this where they are literally smashing up against police lines with their arm strength.  IMO that sort of thing is mans work and although you may not see it that way I can guarantee you that if you are from the West that Ukrainian women would see it like that much more than you would.  This is not a situation like some chick getting pepper sprayed at UC Davis.  This is warlight with less calories.
      </p>
      <p>
       [edit] I've really taken an interest in US immigration policy and I've been particularly compiling and noting the types of people who are let into the country through anecdotal experience.  I believe that if you read Zbigniew Brzezinski's The Grand Chessboard then you will understand that the US likes to make itself into a soft power (that is not brittle in an overt sense).  It likes to incorporate the strengths of the entire world while keeping duel loyalties to a minimum (with one main exception, of course).  So what you largely get in America is people who know how to sing a sad song.  Sure nasty shit happens in the world, and those are
       <strong>
        Exactly
       </strong>
       the types of people that the US government would like to see living in America.  Between the "news" and who is simply let into the country it creates a very overly negative and distorted view of the quality of the rest of the planet.

       Its a different kind of strength and that is mostly just one particular small group.

       Also your boss was likely only let into the country because he already had strong leanings away from Russia.  Your main argument doesn't really make sense though because the status quo has been to move towards Russia.  So then why would the Ukrainian administration bring in hoards of people to fuck shit up and to fight the police?  We're not talking about like a few dozen people to be caught on cameras but all kinds of people, thousands of them.  Really the current administration is a piece of shit who happens to be going Russia's way but that doesn't mean that a piece of shit is in power because and only because of Russia.  Years ago the EU didn't even have an interest in Ukraine so who else would there have been to hand out bribes?  We are only seeing this clash because now there is another player in town and this new player is playing a different game than the old player.  Regardless throw the asshole out but that shouldn't automatically mean that Ukraine goes with the EU.  Also the timing of this is such because Syria is not going off like WWIII so Ukraine is the next easiest weak country to manipulate.  If the EU was not in the game now then Ukraine would be safely in the hands of Russia and this sort of thing would not be possible.  If you think that the people who brought us the Greece and Syria situations have something positive to offer Ukraine then I guess feel free to feel that.

       My Boss is a women who grew up poor as fuck in Russia with her husband having ties to the criminal underworld as most Males in Ukraine do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its the Russian's sending young males to protest in Ukraine as per the opinion of my boss; also stating that what they are doing is worse to Ukraine then what Hitler did.
      </p>

       Fine well its extremely rare for me to have met a foreigner in the US who was not already from a rich country and could bring their lips to say something negative above a whisper about the US, the EU or Jews for that matter.  I think that immigrants basically know to keep their head down to enjoy the increased prosperity that America has provided them.  I'd be curious to know what their options are to go to Russia and more importantly on being able to return easily to the US.  Just wondering because I've met a lot of don't even fucking dare risk not being able to get back in types.

       I think that Russia would be willing to distance itself just slightly it knew that the EU wasn't going to be all up in there and the pipelines could be guaranteed to flow.  So, basically I agree, no.

       Surely they could just shut down the pipelines and have Russia divert to flow through the North instead.  Then they could try to sell food to the EU where paranoid inspectors would scour every single food truck for radionuclides.  Have you ever walked across the border to and fro Ukraine to Poland?  Have you seen that situation with the meats going one way and the cigarettes and alcohol going another?  Have you seen how Poland/EU treats those poor Ukrainians who do that everyday?  Free travel will not be possible for a very long time.  Then of course look at Greece, Spain and Portugal.  Ukraine would get hard fucked.  I've drank, fought and fucked out of ultra pro-Ukrainian language dive bars and I've heard all of the Russia/Moscovite/Putin sucks shit that you could imagine.

       I don't know too much about the protests, but it seemed to stem from bad politics, and a recent law against protesting. From what I have heard, their Govt. is stepping way over bounds, and trying to jail people on bullshit causes to silence opposition.

       there are well-funded intelligence services on both sides of every revolution. one side provides resources to the rebels to make slick propaganda videos and provide matching flags/headbands/etc ("color" revolutions), while the other side tries to stop the rebellion. so in the ukraine and syria the US funds the rebels, while in bahrain and egypt, the US funds the government. it all just depends on which empire the puppet government is loyal to.
