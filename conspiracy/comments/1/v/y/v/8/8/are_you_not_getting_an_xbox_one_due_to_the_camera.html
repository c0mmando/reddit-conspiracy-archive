<p>And I&#39;ve had plenty of people say I can just cover the camera, but it seems that it would slowly contribute to a non-chilant attitude about the privacy and security of my home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  I remember reading about a hacker in California (a handicapped dude living with his mom actually) who figured out how to hack into people&#39;s webcams without turning on the light.  This was pre-NSA scandal but I had already seen a PBS documentary called &quot;Secret America&quot; (if I remember the name correctly) about these huge data centers that the government has been amassing.  So yeah, putting 2 and 2 together, I figured that this hacker was not the only one who was able to do that and if he was, then others would be close behind, and they&#39;d probably be from the people with the most resources (the government).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention corporatism. What is stopping companies from using the face detection in order to charge more on rented movies if you have more than, let&#39;s say, three viewers in the room?  Maybe developers start requiring that you leave the camera uncovered so they can do exactly this. </p>

<p>I can only imagine this little pop-up at the end of a movie rental.</p>

<p>&quot;Your account has been charged an additional $1.50 for an extra viewer&quot;</p>

<p>When it comes to ways they can make more money, they&#39;re usually the first to figure it out.</p>

<p>Also, they&#39;ll charge for movies per viewer before you start it, and if an extra person walks in then it will be stopped until they leave, unless you want to pay more to add that person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, most of the Xbone policies have been dropped such as the use of the camera. You no longer have to even have it plugged in, and you no longer have to have it hooked up to the internet 24/7. Sooo it is a little better.. and I only mean a little. They are still not allowing retroactive game play, and many many people were/are upset that they cannot play their 360 games on it. </p>

<p>I quit playing all my kinect 360 games once I realized it was taking random pictures and storing them during game play. later it tried to upload them online... My wife and I would play naked or half naked quite often. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s great! If and when I have kids, they will definitely have restrictions to TV, the internet, and video games. I thought my mom was a total Nazi for not allowing cable TV, a VCR until I was in middle school, or any junk food in the house. Turns out, I was LEARNING through PBS and my coveted trips to the library. I distinctly remember seeing my middle school peers flirting and misbehaving in the library and thinking, WHY ARE THEY BEING SO LOUD? PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO RESEARCH HERE! </p>

<p>It kept me aware and away from &quot;the herd&quot;. Even in my new town with a kick ass library, so I&#39;m so ecstatic to see there&#39;s IMPLICIT rules all over the place, preventing it from being a homeless &quot;warming station&quot; and hangout for the unruly types. My last little town library had all the good gossip, but was impossible to concentrate on work. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m doing now with reddit (and the internet in general) is setting my own timers. I allow myself one hour in the morning to &quot;catch up&quot; on this sub, and then keep the cell phone off the wifi and only use it to reply to comments throughout the day. Otherwise, the Netflix has been cancelled and the app unistalled. Redbox is off my email and text reminders about new rentals. I&#39;ll go to the library to get FREE movies, and that movie watching only happens after a daily list of &quot;chores&quot; is complete, both self-care items and work. </p>

<p>When I realized I was spending DAYS on reddit and like, not even bothering to apply lotion after a shower, it was a real wake up call. It&#39;s super tempting in the winter to just &quot;live online&quot;, but my diet, exercise and sanity were reflecting this obsession. Maybe I&#39;ll allow myself to &quot;play online&quot; on some social website that you actually play with other live humans, but that&#39;s not on the agenda for the moment. I need to budget my living expenses, focus on the &quot;real shit&quot;, while I have the luxury of free time in my off season. Hell, I have gardening to organize and start planning cuz it&#39;s already almost February and I want a lush and PROFITABLE garden this year. There&#39;s literally MILLIONS of things I want to read, do and experience, rather than reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe they can also use it as an eavesdropping device, even if the device is turned off. The security of electronic devices is compromised and has been for years, but there are ways around that. However, I believe there is much more to be gained (from a spying perspective) from a camera that covers an entire living area than a camera that shows just my face, the floor, or the palm of my hand. A stable camera that records an entire living area can give insight into the layout of your home, the company you keep, and your personal habits and patterns. The analysis of these things over time can form a very detailed and accurate psychological profile, which in the wrong hands can be dangerous. </p>

<p>Also, I really don&#39;t want some perv hacking the camera and watching me fuck my SO.</p>

<p>Long term, however, when the system is cheaper and there are games on it, I will not be buying one if the Kinect is built in.  I assume they&#39;ll release one eventually that doesn&#39;t have it, though, and I&#39;ll pick it up for 100$ near the end of its life to play the 3 or so games exclusive to the console.</p>

In theory, it parses through and tosses away anything before or after the voice commands it understands, though. </p>

<p>However...if you already have a phone with voice controls enabled or a SmartTV or a laptop...well, honestly, the XBox One is just one more monitoring system. And I don&#39;t trust Microsoft, but gawd, at least maybe they&#39;d use a secure means to transfer my data vs. LG or Samsung who tend to do it in the clear...I purposely bought a non-SmartTV for this reason, and avoided the XBox and was kind of boastful about it...but then felt like a colossal dumbass when I spent a few minutes to take stock of the number of devices I have with cameras and with mics that can&#39;t be easily disabled.</p>

<p>This is starting to become like our presidencies (had to turn this into a conspiracy rant somehow). They attack each other, pretend that they are different, when in the reality they seem like the exact same thing only at each others throats to produce sales </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering we live in a world in which the Government can log everything you type into a computer or phone, log every phone call and who you called, log all web activity... Search history... blah blah. A world where your phone / computer mic and camera can be remotely activated with no need for a warrant, it seems rather amusing to me that folks are suddenly drawing a line with the Xbox one because of the kinect camera.
Unplug it.... Or like me, leave it in. If the federal govt or microsoft wants to spend their time watching me scratch my balls while i watch tv or stare blankly and slack jawed into the screen while i play a game then fine. Seriously, if they really, really wanted to watch us there are a million other ways they are doing it before they jump to the kinect camera, which as stated... Is unpluggable.
The very notion of privacy today is a sham and a pipe dream. Getting all squeamish because of the Kinect camera, as if this one thing is the straw that will break the camel&#39;s back, is daft. The frog was boiled long ago. If you want a ps4 then just buy one... don&#39;t go all stupid about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i love my xbox 360 and i have no intention of getting an xbox one. my main reason is i think the kinect is fucking stupid and id rather not have one. also the fact that they arent backwards compatible is ridiculous, so when this 360 takes a shit or they stop making games for them im not sure if ill get a playstation or be done.</p>

<p>If I get a new console I&#39;m switching to PS4. The Kinect was the biggest reason.</p>
