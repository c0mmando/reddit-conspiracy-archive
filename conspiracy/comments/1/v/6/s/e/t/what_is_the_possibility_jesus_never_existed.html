        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve had this theory for a while, that the story of Jesus may be one of the oldest conspiracies ever created. And by this I mean no offense to Christians, just look at this my way:</p>

<p>During the Roman empire, the people of Judea were a constant threat, always threatening rebellion, ignoring the Roman gods, racist to outsiders, etc. So wanting to keep control, the Romans decided they needed to invent a way to unite the Jews under their banner. What better way to do this then by using their own prophecy of the messiah. They could have added him into the census records, hired people to be his followers, and make up the tale. As for the crucifixion, its possible he got out of hand and they needed to take him out, or they needed to make him a martyr. This would explain why his body went missing from the tomb, the Roman forces could have easily removed and disposed of the body, then make up something about angels to fill in the plot-holes.</p>

<p>But then of corse things didn&#39;t go to plan, and Christianity was cut off from the rest of the Jewish people, becoming an underground cult. It was not until 300 years later when Constantine converted to Christianity, marking it as a major religion. But what went wrong? Why did the Romans fall to a lie they made up? Because the people who made up the story, whether they had been military, the local government, or the emperor himself, had kept the information hidden, maybe even destroying it, trying to make it seem that Jesus of Nazareth actually was the son of God, as the Jewish people prophesied.</p>

<p>What do you guy think, am I making sense here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll preface this by saying I am an atheist, and have been for a decade.</p>

<p>Religion is social glue. It keeps people together, like a family. It builds communities and networks of people who stick together. If the government of any particular state can control that religion, they control the people. But if they can&#39;t control it, then presumably they would want to destroy it. I believe this is the issue we are seeing today. There is a massive anti-religion campaign that, sadly, I participated in for years. </p>

<p>What issues do religious people oppose? (not all, but some)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Abortion. Look into Margaret Sanger and Rockefeller Foundation. Abortion, while I personally believe it is necessary, has been overused as a depopulation/eugenics mechanism.</p></li>
<li><p>Teaching evolution. Although evolution is factual, ideologies that spring from it should be monitored very closely. It is a very small jump from belief in evolution to human eugenics. Not everyone will agree on who can/can&#39;t have children, so you <em>must</em> do this in a tyrannical fashion or through manipulating and fooling people. Whether or not someone believes in evolution should be the last thing you worry about. </p></li>
<li><p>Vaccines. Technically, vaccines are a good thing. However, historically, incompetence has been fairly rampant with vaccinations. This strange, almost religious worship of vaccines and science is a local phenomena. See this article written in the Israeli press: <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Health-and-Science/HPV-To-vaccinate-or-not-to-vaccinate-326711">http://www.jpost.com/Health-and-Science/HPV-To-vaccinate-or-not-to-vaccinate-326711</a> Skepticism and suspicion are healthy. Vaccines could easily be used as a depopulation tool. </p></li>
<li><p>Accepting a New World Order, One World government, global currency, etc. This seems to be on the agenda, and religious people tend to oppose it.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting &quot;the chip.&quot; Religious people tend to see microchips and things like that as signs of the end times. The US government and affiliated entities clearly want to microchip everyone. There have been hints at this for a decade or more. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWJMocALUes">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWJMocALUes</a></p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>Kill religion, and all of these things are more accepted. Religion keeps populations stable and together. The state wants to split everyone up and break down the social glues that bind us together. We are more controllable/accepting of the State without social glue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to several churches throughout these 10 years as an atheist. I&#39;ve only dated one atheist, so usually I&#39;m kind of stuck with this on Sundays. Luckily, it&#39;s not so bad. Even when people know you are an atheist, the church community still helps you out any way they can. You are greeted very warmly and treated kindly, etc. The music is sometimes decent. I can&#39;t find that anywhere else. College clubs, weekend hangouts at your friend&#39;s house, even family gatherings- but to an extent, they serve a similar role. A group of people who bind together and help each other out. Trade unions are similar as well. All of these things serve to bind people together so that they can all become better people and move <em>as a unit</em> instead of individuals. A church can do many amazing things for their local community. A union (forget politics here for a second) can move mountains for their workers. A family can bind together and make sure everyone has a place to stay and eat. </p>

<p>All of these things need to be demolished. The state will be the church, the family, the provider. If they can&#39;t control these things, they will destroy them and replace with a system they can control. </p>

<p>The state is a unit of people. Its power is limited if other units exist that are similar in size. I think of it as organisms. Your cells bind together for one purpose- to live as a human. Humans bind together into units for one purpose, like a beehive. A bunch of scattered bees are nothing without a hive. Look at what most people have become. Mostly solitary with fake substitutes for their previous &quot;hives.&quot; At family gatherings, look around. Everyone is looking down at their phone. People would rather text than hear the sound of a person&#39;s voice. I could walk down the street to hang out with my friend, but it&#39;s easier to just post shit on their facebook. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch Caesar&#39;s Messiah.</p>

<p>Not mentioned in that video however is the fact that Christianity is a religion that goes back to around 300 BC. Christians was a label given to the followers of another God invented by the Caesar which combined Roman and Egyptian God traits when Ptolomy and Alexander were stretching their empire into Egypt.</p>

<p>This God was Serapis Christus. The Egyptians were ordered to worship Serapis and the followers of Serapis were called Christians, hundreds of years before the invention of Jesus. Jesus was made in the image of Serapis at the Council of Nicea in response to a Libyan named Arius. Arius had inspired the African people to cease tribute to the Roman Imperial Cult.</p>

<p>Jesus, was a Roman invention. His philosophy is derived directly from Apollonius of Tyana. His trip to Jerusalem is a metaphorical allegory to the military campaign of Rome against Israel. His mythology is based on Mithras.</p>

<p>Did Jesus ever exist? Not a chance in hell. Jesus was a prophet created by Rome to prophesy the coming of the Caesar and written into Judaic prophecy in order to portray The Caesar as their God and messiah. Why? Because like the Pharoahs, the Caesars were living Gods on Earth. Either way, Jews and Romans both are garbage and Americans would be better served reading their Constitution and Federalist Papers and Newton&#39;s Principia.</p>

<p>If you want a savior than look in a mirror. That is your job, that&#39;s what you&#39;re here for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seriously had this theory for over a year now. The Romans made Christianity. They totally could have, they had the means and the power to do it. My money is on he probably was a real person, may not have been named Jesus, entire story of miracles ripped from other cultures and didn&#39;t happen. Body was removed from tomb to fit the whole rose from the dead thing. The internet and photography didn&#39;t exist, so they totally got away with it and deceived thousands of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make complete sense in my opinion. Whether or not i believe it is a different issue. But nonetheless, i find this theory at least just as credible as the one in the bible. (Im agnostic atheist, btw.)</p>

<p>Its important to note that the life of jesus is not known, even to biblical scholars. For the majority of his life he was travelling to the east, to places (speculated) such as china and india, to learn their culture and religions and beliefs. He came back to jerusalem when he was thirty, and most of what is written about him his when he was thirty to the day he died when he was thirty three yrs old. Yes, most of what is written about him encompasses a mere three years of his life. And, even during that timeframe, it is said not many people liked him. Until, as you said, many years after his death was he written and almost diefied. </p>

<p>Anyhow, Jesus the Man could have existed, and i believe he did. Jesus the Prophet and Son of God i believe is a hoax, for whatever means. It certainly is possible that he was glorified as a conspiracy to assimilate the masses under the roman empire.</p>

<p>Also, most of christianitys stories actually originate in pagan beliefs and ancient accounts (of sumerian and other origins.). I have always been suspicious of the holy crusades that sought to wipe out the pagans, and the very origins of the stories in christianity, the burning of the library in alexandria, egypt, and the destroying of south american texts by the conquistadors. It seems plausible that these were attempts to eliminate any evidence of your theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Jesus&quot; did not exist.  The man they say was Jesus was actually named Joshua( or Yashua ).  The only notable aspects of this individual were that he ran the money changers out of town with his flash mob, claimed to be the son of god, and was publicly executed by crucifixion with other criminals.  The Romans along with the money changers( priest and warrior kings alike ) needed a new religion to corral the population that was steadily rejecting their debt based money system.  They needed a figurehead for this religion, so they picked Joshua.  They needed a name people could get behind that wasn&#39;t completely Hebrew, so they picked Ya( Lord in Hebrew ) Zeus( Jupiter to the Romans and Greeks ).  Yazeus, or Lord Jupiter, which eventually morphed into Jesus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I will agree. The Bible consists of stories told orally for generations, and so, is biased. It is a game of telephone. Once you get to the time that they put the stories into a book, it&#39;s twisted. There&#39;s more to it than that, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a Roman-era Messiah figure called Jesus genuinely existed, performed miracles and gave speeches to thousands of followers, don&#39;t you think somebody might have recorded that fact at the time? </p>

<p>Not one contemporary chronicler, Roman or Hebrew was apparently aware of this individual. Nothing remains of this Christ figure - apart from stories cobbled up generations after his supposed death. </p>

<p>It is extremely likely that Jesus was a myth, created and promoted for political reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chris White is a fraudulent charlatan who has made a career out of misleading viewers with misdirection. His entire arguments work out as if he never paid attention to what he is debunking. His debunking efforts of Ancient Aliens and Caesar&#39;s Messiah are garbage and mostly rely on the viewer being completely oblivious to the content of what is being debunked. </p>

<p>His Caesar&#39;s Messiah argument is based on the use of the word Christian prior to the era of Titus, etc... this argument, right off the bat, ignores the fact that a variety of messianic jews were called Christians as were the followers of Serapis Christ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not classify myself as an atheist, because I don&#39;t seek labeling for myself, don&#39;t try to associate with a &quot;group&quot; and don&#39;t give a fuck what people think about me. That being said, of course Jesus could have not existed. If you&#39;re looking for a probability number, or a statistical chance associated with a number, it would have to be 1 chance in x billion (x being the number of people that have been alive). I have no physical evidence of him being alive, aside from a story in a book written by someone, therefore, fuck it. Probably wasn&#39;t alive. Give me your green papers and ill tell you I know he was alive though. I have a mortgage to pay too, you know? IN AFRICAN VILLAGES PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE WITCHES AND BURN THEM ALIVE WITH THE ENTIRE VILLAGE WATCHING IN ENJOYMENT. That logic alone should be enough for you to understand that Jesus is a myth. Has anyone ever been named Jesus, yes.</p>
