       This is all I need to know. If there is even a
       <em>
        possibility

       of a hardening/accumulation of flouride in the pineal gland, it sounds extremely harmful to me.

       The woo-woo part would be an intentional poisoning to lower our creative thinking as well as spiritual awakening becoming increasingly difficult.

      <p>
       If somebody is dis-content enough with their lives spiritually, they will more easily buy into mass-consumerism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only consider this because I have experienced DMT and extremely hyper-spiritual experiences that connect with the godhead, giving perspective on life that some people would definitely not want out in the open. There are definitely links between the pineal and the spiritual path.

        Check out the "answers" about
        <strong>
         systemic fluoride
        </strong>
        on this page.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When young children consume fluoride in drinking water and other beverages or in supplements,
        <strong>
         the fluoride is absorbed into the gastrointestinal tract, taken up by the bloodstream and deposited into the permanent teeth as they are developing behind the gum line.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Systemic fluoride makes those developing teeth stronger and better able to withstand the effects of cavity-causing acids and bacteria later on. Once the permanent teeth have erupted from the gum line (usually by the time a child is eight years old), systemic fluoride still offers benefits because
        <strong>
         it becomes incorporated into saliva
        </strong>
        , making that protective. Talk to your dentist about the benefits of systemic fluoride and whether you and your family are meeting your fluoride needs.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So according to the experts, the fact that we're drinking fluoridated water (AND soda AND beer AND Kool-Aid AND etc) means that our bodies become SO FUCKING SATURATED with this glorious gift of god that we're literally floating in the shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And unless this is some newfangled "smart fluoride" that only goes to the teeth, every fucking cell in our bodies and brains is saturated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every.Fucking.Cell.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it "helps prevent cavities - RIGHT?
      </p>
      <p>
       If that works so well, maybe we should add insecticide to our water supply - that way we won't have to worry about the danger of ticks, lice, mosquitoes etc because we'll be walking sacks of poison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brilliant, no?

       That's not counting additional sources of fluoride. I didn't know if anyone actually went through each of those sources, but it's really worth your time. Things like pickles and wine can add significant amounts. There's even residues on all kinds of foods because they spray fluoride onto the food in warehouses. 70 ppm tolerance on food and 130 ppm for wheat. And I'm

       I can’t prove this was their Profume but we bought a bag of mini carrots, they didn’t taste right, like a chemical taste, we didn’t eat them. I set them on the counter for a week; they died up with a white coating, not moldy, just a white powder, probably fluoride.

       Might be…still it’s likely there since fumigating with it ProFume® (Sulfuryl fluoride) is still permitted…the carrots tasted horrible so who knows what chemical that was.

       If you're talking about the clickable links and the bullet points, etc, just hit "source" and see it for yourself. If you don't see "source," download

       , then check again. I'm pretty sure that's an RES feature.

       Source copies everything the person typed into the reply box. You're basically viewing the background of the comment, instead of the comment that everyone else sees. So you can click source, select all, copy and paste anyone's comment, retaining everything they typed, rather than simply copying text.

       We're not allowed to mention that, because as soon as we do the entire notion that DMT is endogenous and may be the root cause of NDE, etc gets thrown out the window because 'thats not proven.' It's kind of absurd, because then most people are like DMT is just a theory. No, no, it's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe me, I know the pineal's probability for producing dmt is 99.999999%. It doesn't even matter when you experience a DMT trip and see how profound it can be. I don't care if it comes from my pinky toe, that shit is profound.

       I don't know for sure what fluoride does to the mind/body but I don't see how someone thought it was a good idea to put it in water.  Maybe if we didn't actually drink water and swished it around our mouths but obviously that's not reality.  It just seems ridiculous.

       I am now in a community with unfluoridated water, and let me tell you I feel like an uncivilized barbarian knowing my turds are being flushed without fluoride in my toilet bowl. I may as well be wiping my ass with corn cobs, too, while I'm at it.

Having a topical application they way dentists apply it and drinking it in a solution is comparing apples to oranges. You can keep believing that they put it in your water out of love if you wish.

       Seriously... They go from paying to dispose of it legally to using it legally to "enhance" tap water and getting paid for it. God, fuck this country. This government  literally worships profit, at our expense... They regulate the destruction of ecosystems and then blame us for global warming...of course it's not about their suppression of clean free energy, it's OUR fault because we are forced to participate in their system just to pay the bills with their debt fiat money. These criminals need to be dragged out of their bed and burned alive

       I think you guys might be being a little paranoid. I know this is r/conspiracy but come on, its flouride. It cleans your teeth, and if it hits your teeth then it will likely have some sort of small effect. Personally I think that it is unnecessary, but if they have to put it in then I dont have a problem.

       It’s not cleaning anything, besides who in America can’t get fluoride toothpaste? Ever read the do not ingest part of toothpaste? That's because it’s toxic. My advice…if you care; try and avoid drinking it, and if you can, help others remove it from our drinking supply.

       Your brain may not be working due to the fluoride poisoning.  Fluoride does not clean teeth.  It is only minorly effective when applied topically to the teeth. Consuming does absolutely nothing beneficial to tooth health.  This is why it makes NO sense to consume fluoride for tooth health.

       Well I honestly don't know anything about the issue but adding something to water to help your teeth actually makes SOME sense, seeing as how it comes into direct contact with your teeth. If you added sunscreen to water it wouldn't come in contact with your skin, unless you're drinking water the wrong way.

       When your body is mostly water, does it make any sense to adulterate it with known toxins? I tend to agree with this man's opinion on the subject of water purity:

       "Fluorine has played a significant role in insect control since about 1896 when sodium fluoride and various iron fluorides were patented in England as insecticides. Sodium fluoride was used in the United States for cockroach control before 1900 and was introduced in 1915 for the control of poultry lice. However, the use of fluorine insecticides did not become general until the 1930´s when the disadvantages of arsenical residues on food crops became apparent and the inorganic fluorine compounds were introduced as safer substitutes. Systematic investigation of organofluorine insecticides began about 1935 in the I. G. Farbenindustrie and the fluoroalcohols and fluorophosphates (phosphorofluoridates) were intensively investigated largely through the research of Schrader (1952). During World War II fluoro-DDT or "Gix" was used for the control of insects of medical importance. More recently, fluoroacetamide and analogues have been used as systemic insecticides and a large variety of other fluorinated organic compounds have shown insecticidal activity. Sulfuryl fluoride has recently been marketed as a fumigant for household and structural pests..."

       Years ago, before I knew of the dangers, my dentist gave me prescription-only
       <a href="http://www.colgateprofessional.com/products/Colgate-PreviDent-5000-Plus-Rx-only/details">
        toothpaste with extremely high amounts of sodium fluoride

        dental fluorosis

       along the gumline. I shudder to think what it's done to my bones and my brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some

       So new people don't sign up? I’ve been lurking for a couple of years but never bothered to get an account, until recently. Why now, I'm recovering from an injury and had some extra time. Again what is your proof? If you have time to critique this post maybe you can Sleuth the IP's to see who made the comments. All of my comments have 1776ftw next to them.

       Not sure if it's still there, but the WHO used to have graphs of countries and # of carries (cavities).  There was no difference in cavities between fluoridated water (natural and additives) and countries with no fluoridation.  All of the countries trended down over the last few decades due to overall better diet and overall better dental care

       That study looked at research done in China on children exposed to abnormally high amounts of fluoride from natural sources.  The studies included flouride levels of up to 11.5 mg/L.
      </p>
      <p>
       The recommended fluoride level in drinking water in the US is 0.7 mg/L.

       People who drink more water get a cumulative higher dose; it’s a flawed method of delivery for one. Some us believe medicating drinking water with toxic chemicals is unhealthy.

       You're mad about the wrong thing.  From the paper you linked:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In its review of fluoride, the NRC (2006) noted that the safety and the risks of fluoride at concentrations of 2–4 mg/L were incompletely documented.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I couldn't get access to the NRC report so unfortunately I couldn't investigate any further.  You should be calling for more thorough research on the risks of fluoride rather than proclaiming things that have no evidence.  You should look up "A systematic review of the efficacy and safety of fluoridation" by CA Yueng published in Evidence-Based Dentistry if you want a good overview of the scientific literature on fluoride.
      </p>
      <p>
       Water itself is a toxic chemical, that phrase doesn't mean anything.

       I'm not sure if you're deliberately stretching the numbers here, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Anyone reading- notice he chose the highest number in the study to compare to the lowest dose in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is this: In the US, water is fluoridated between .7 and 4 mg/l. That is dangerously close to the doses in the study. If a statistical trend was found in a population with levels just slightly above the levels in the US, then you know that slightly higher levels cause brain damage. Is it possible that some people in the US get levels at these higher numbers? Yes.
      </p>

       You aren't counting additional sources of fluoride. This is from a poster from a month ago who actually went through and dismantled every myth about fluoride:

       I was just quoting the study he linked to, I really wasn't trying to be misleading.  I hope everybody who's interested in this reads the actual study rather than taking my word for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the comment you linked to, that poster is highly misleading with his headlines
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/fluoride-childrens-health-grandjean-choi/">
         Because a Harvard meta analysis confirms that fluoride doses attainable within the US cause brain damage
        </a>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I already went over this.  The study says nothing about "brain damage", and his summary is heavily biased toward his own point of view.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/18/10/1102.abstract">
         Because fluoride in daily attainable dosages within the US lowers thyroid function in people with low iodine levels, and was once prescribed for hyperthyroidism
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This paper (from 1958) studies only people with hyperthyroidism, which is an extremely important point that the poster fails to mention.  They administered a daily does of 5-10 mg of fluoride, which would have been on top of the fluoride that is already contained in their drinking water (which was higher back then than it is now).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15153698/">
         Because fluoride's "benefits" are only topical, meaning there is no reason to eat or drink it
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not even sure what he's trying to get at here.  The study he linked to spends most of its time talking about all of the benefits of water fluoridation.  The only argument they're having is how exactly that effect is occurring (pre-eruptive vs. post-eruptive).
      </p>
      <p>
       He then goes on to cite a grand total of 13 fluoride accidents over a 10 year span back in the 70's, and he claims that
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        water authorities routinely hire incompetent employees who install defective equipment that subsequently causes mass community fluoride overdoses and poisonings.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Come on...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll go ahead and stop now.  Every single link I looked at was at best severely misrepresented by the poster.

       Since that post was heavily sourced and the OP clearly spent time on it, why don't you re-write the headlines from an unbiased point of view? Not pro-fluoride, not anti-fluoide, but someone who is simply reporting the information. But keep in mind the section of each article that the OP is focusing on. So for instance, the sulfuryl fumigation link. He's obviously focusing on the fact that the residues of fluoride are left on food and they are in such high doses that even the government thinks they need to phase it out. Try that and I'll bet your headlines would be similar to his. I spent a few days researching everything in that post when I first saw it. He's slightly biased, but you wouldn't be taking anything away from the post if you rewrote it with a 100 percent unbiased view.

       There was another link right after that showing more recent cases. Now I know you're being deliberately misleading.

       No, I'm talking about the post I cited for this slayersdildo guy, not the Harvard study. But the Harvard study was heavily sourced as well. It was a meta-analysis, which means it's a study of a compilation of studies.

       Here's my list of headlines for the sources I looked at
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         A review of studies in China shows that high levels of fluoride exposure may have a small adverse affect on child IQ test results (mean difference of 0.45).  Every study reviewed was significantly above the recommended level of 0.7 mg/L, but many studies were within the maximum allowed level of 4.0 mg/L.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Administration of a daily dose of 5-10 mg of fluoride to patients with hyperthyroidism may cause clinical improvement (limitation of hormonal synthesis).  Fluorine does not impair the capacity of the gland to synthesize thyroid hormone when there is an abundance of iodide in the blood. (this last sentence is word for word from the abstract)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is an abundance of evidence that water fluoridation prevents dental caries, but we do not yet fully understand exactly what is going on.  This paper argues that topical fluoride application should be used to treat dental caries as long as proper precautions are in place to eliminate the risk of over-exposure.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I said I was going to stop so I never made it to the next link that you're talking about.  I'm not trying to be misleading.  I looked at that link and it adds 11 new cases of accidental fluoride spillage or contamination.  You can hardly claim that as being "routine", which was my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The link on sulfuryl fumigation is a good headline.  The negative effects of over-exposure to fluoride are not a contested topic, and it seems like the EPA is doing its part to make sure fluoride intake is at safe levels.

       Fluorosilicic acid is the most commonly used additive for water fluoridation, followed by two dry additives—sodium fluorosilicate and sodium fluoride. Fluorosilicic acid is derived from production of phosphate fertilizers.

       Someone else in this thread said they got fluorosis in their gums. So I'd be very careful about letting it touch any membrane in your mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It won't be deadly but any negative reaction will compound over the years. Just use it with caution and try to keep it on your teeth.

      <p>
       Personally I'd brush my teeth with normal strength toothpaste then do the fluoride treatment separately with extra caution.

       I think that it should be optional. Instead of people putting water filters into their homes, why not sell fluoride canisters if those people want it in their water so bad.

       You don't want Joe Blow handling the stuff. If they manage to damage the container there will be some pretty nasty results. The stuff literally eats through asphalt, it is toxic waste after all. Can you imagine if somebody got it on themselves and their stuff? Massive lawsuit and back to square one.

       Medicine should never be forced upon people.  Especially where the dose is controlled by the amount of water consumed by the individual and their body size.  A page dose for an adult is a massive dose for a child that drinks more water than average.  The same is true for an athlete or baby.

       Do they add fluoride to water there? Study's show long term benefits of not being subjected added fluoride include higher IQ's. Sort term, reverse osmosis water is tastier; it gets most of the chlorine out too.

       Unrelated do you know how many of liters of water you use in a month on average? Is it tracked by household and area there? Here’s a breakdown of our use and the local area’s average…in gallons. Six hundred gallons cost us about fifty dollars.
Current Month: 600 gals.
1 Year Ago This Month: 250 gals.
City-wide Avg This Month: 8,520 gals.

       It's not quite the same system but a typical family of 4 would use about 400 gallons a month... Water isn't in short supply in the uk, most pay a flat annual fee of £400/$600 and we can use as much water as we like.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do get told how much water we've used annually and we get free tools to reduce use. But as a result of the flat fee system, there is not as much data available on usage rates . The Environment Agency might have info though.

       Berkey is actually an alternative to RO. RO you normally install into the plumbing, whereas Berkey is a stand-alone filter (no water waste). If you aren't concerned with the environmental problems with wasting clean water, then RO is your best bet.

       It seems that other than dental florosis, calcification of the pineal gland is the most empirically proven effect of fluoride. Theoretically this could lead to circadian rhythm disruption by affecting the pineal gland's natural synthesis and secretion of melatonin.
       <br/>
       The pineal gland has also been an important area of the brain for cultures interested in the third eye. Even Descartes describes the pineal gland as "the principle seat of the soul"

       Here in Australia you can buy Nobles pureau brand water.....says its guaranteed fluoride-free water - unlike other brands doesn't come in a plastic container. Can't say that of other some brands. Some brands claim their water comes from a fresh spring.

       From what I’ve read it’s very difficult to remove. The use of Aluminum oxide seems as if it could be counter productive. I’m not sure if Reverse Osmosis systems effectively remove all the fluoride derivatives.

       I am right there with you OP. I try to tell almost everyone I know about this but no one listens.  I get 3 gallon jugs filled with RO water at a grocery store.   There are people here in Raleigh and Durham really trying to get legislation changed but the people on the councils are old and shitty and couldnt care less.  There are videos on youtube of council meetings where amazing points are made about negative effects of the fluoride in the  water but the council members just ignore the speakers. It sucks.  It also baffles me that people that I regard as very intelligent, some more than my self, won't consider what could be in their water and what it could do to you.  So many people I know buying into the agenda.  No rational/critical thinking involved at all.  If anyone could post about the pineal gland that would be informative as well.

       Seems if citizens in each water district had petitions with enough signatures, that couldn’t' be ignored...then push to get a referendum on the ballots. Vote it out. I don't know of any solid evidence of pineal gland effects.

       In Portland Oregon they have removed fluoride from the water on like 4 different occasions because it is unhealthy, unnecessary and expensive. They just keep lobbying to put it back in. Right now we are fluoride free though. I think its bad. Don't swallow fluoride tooth paste. Don't swallow the fluoride stuff in the dental trays they put in your mouth at the dentist.

       Useless in water because it doesn't stay on the teeth, but it is then ingested which goes from useless to toxic. Add that to a cocktail of pharmaceuticals in drinking water and it's a compelling reason to have a filter. I actually do believe there is benefit to fluoride ON the teeth , like in toothpaste , which is then spit out. Studies have confirmed that , but in drinking water? Useless

       Your toothpaste has fluoride, if you swallow a 1/4 of what goes on your toothbrush it recommends you call poison control asap. the same amount is put into drinking water. fluoride makes people stupider, docile, and calcifies your penal gland.

       The flouride in drinking water is an industrial by-product of producing phosphate fertilizer, not the pharmaceutical-grade stuff used in toothpaste. It boggles the mind how anyone thinks it's a good idea to add a carcinogenic, mutagenic waste product to water supplies. The people who advocate adding flouride to water are batshit fucking crazy.

       Fluoride was added to water so that companies have a way to dispose of waste they create. If you really buckle down and do the research, there is no correlation between decreased cavities and water fluoridation. Tooth fluorosis occurs at level that are far lower than we get today. Not to mention the effects of fluoride from anything from organ disfunction to brain disorders. Just spend some time on pubmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is people cannot choose to have fluoridated water or not. If you want to believe the BS about fluoride then you can brush you teeth with it. We get enough of it! It covers our fruits veggies nuts...ect. Why water?

       If fluoride is categorized as a drug (which it is) then it should be completely logical the conclude that fluoridating water and other products is completely asinine as the dose cannot be controlled. Medication must be personalized and doses must be adhered to.

       Adding
       <strong>
        Potassium Fluroide
       </strong>
       (since noone can seem to tell the difference.) sounds like a great idea. However, the
       <strong>
        Sodium Fluoride
       </strong>
       that is, technically, chemical waste/runoff that is added to the water, should stop.

       Also, I hate (srsly) everyone one of you that calls it fluroide. The

       </strong>
       of fluoride is what's important, you mouth-breathing bastards.

       Yeah think so. Fluorosilicic acid is the most commonly used additive for water fluoridation, followed by two dry additives—sodium fluorosilicate and sodium fluoride. Fluorosilicic acid is derived from production of phosphate fertilizers.

       Of course it's a terrible idea.  Adulterants should never be put in the water supply.  Fluoride causes tooth decay it doesn't prevent it.

       This subreddit is not great for taking criticism. I know that when I don't agree with something, I often don't spend a great deal of time on it because I'm either feeding a troll, upsetting someone, or starting a debate as productive as those found on youtube.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I suspect that's part of why you see more downvotes than arguments.

       Dental fluorosis, also called mottling of tooth enamel, is a developmental disturbance of dental enamel caused by excessive exposure to high concentrations of fluoride during tooth development.

       As a libertarian, I believe that local/state tax dollars shouldn't be spent on making teeth healthier. If we're going to spend millions of dollars on updating water treatment plants to fluoridate water in the name of stopping tooth decay, I really think there are many, many more efficient ways to spend that revenue. This is why I find this practice so fishy.

       It's been shown that each dollar invested in fluoridation systems in towns and cities can save up to $38. I don't know many other areas where an investment gets a return of 3800%.

       The $38 is from a news piece, I think, which calculated the cost of all the cavities and other dental work in kids that fluoridation prevents.

       Over the years I've read about and listened to most, if not all, conspiracy theories. This one falls into a category with anti-vaccination theories. Here's the thing. It is only because of programs like this, vaccines, capitalism, agribusiness, etc. that we can have the health and free time to think about what these things do to us as individuals. Hey, you don't want to drink fluoride, great, get a water filter. In other words complaining about this and vaccinations or even immigration or big government is a bourgeois luxury.

       Trans-fats was not a program initiated for the common good. Monsanto is another good example. Lets say climate change was far enough along that we needed, not only, drought resistant crops, but disease or even water resistant crops, I'll bet everyone that was complaining about monsanto will be screaming for them to produce even more.

       People will be screaming at Monsanto aright, for toxifying the soils, for killing the bees and poisoning their food. This organization is a prime example of a corporation not out for the common good of humanity.

       Someone else in this thread said they got fluorosis in their gums. So I'd be very careful about letting it touch any membrane in your mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It won't be deadly but any negative reaction will compound over the years. Just use it with caution and try to keep it on your teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I'd brush my teeth with normal strength toothpaste then do the fluoride treatment separately with extra caution.

        Because fluoride's "benefits" are only topical, meaning there is no reason to eat or drink it
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.sharecare.com/health/dental-drugs/how-does-systemic-fluoride-work">
        Check out the "answers" about
        <strong>
         systemic fluoride
        </strong>
        on this page.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When young children consume fluoride in drinking water and other beverages or in supplements,
        <strong>
         the fluoride is absorbed into the gastrointestinal tract, taken up by the bloodstream and deposited into the permanent teeth as they are developing behind the gum line.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Systemic fluoride makes those developing teeth stronger and better able to withstand the effects of cavity-causing acids and bacteria later on. Once the permanent teeth have erupted from the gum line (usually by the time a child is eight years old), systemic fluoride still offers benefits because
        <strong>
         it becomes incorporated into saliva
        </strong>
        , making that protective. Talk to your dentist about the benefits of systemic fluoride and whether you and your family are meeting your fluoride needs.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So according to the experts, the fact that we're drinking fluoridated water (AND soda AND beer AND Kool-Aid AND etc) means that our bodies become SO FUCKING SATURATED with this glorious gift of god that we're literally floating in the shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And unless this is some newfangled "smart fluoride" that only goes to the teeth, every fucking cell in our bodies and brains is saturated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every.Fucking.Cell.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it "helps prevent cavities - RIGHT?
      </p>
      <p>
       If that works so well, maybe we should add insecticide to our water supply - that way we won't have to worry about the danger of ticks, lice, mosquitoes etc because we'll be walking sacks of poison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brilliant, no?
