<p>The next is slot 79 in r/news. There&#39;s many thousands of people who won&#39;t see this story today because it was censored.

The one from Jerusalem Post that went up at 20:04:42 was allowed to stay up 6 hours and get to 3300 upvotes and almost 1000 comments. It has just been removed because it was &quot;already covered by other articles&quot;.</a></p>

<p>Reddit inc works so hard to veil their manipulation of the organic curation of content. Perhaps because they know what awaits them if the behavior were to be exposed? Ah yes, Alexis and Kevin Rose sitting down, penniless, for a cup of coffee is the only end result this manipulation will have.</p>

Too soon to speculate reddit is already trying to impress and placate the new world order? ...OK that&#39;s maybe far-fetched.

Pity mods don&#39;t understand that the votes are somewhat self-moderating and should in some cases of legitimate reader interest take precedent over their personal decisions and rules.

I post content to see the what people have to say, if it has to do with technology or the internet, I would post in r/technology.  If I want to see what people have to say about the political aspect, I would post it over at r/politics.  An example of this would be <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1pk4re/nsa_infiltrates_links_to_yahoo_google_data/">this post being removed by the mods over at r/technology</a>.  The <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1pk4re/nsa_infiltrates_links_to_yahoo_google_data/cd37eg0">mods claimed since the NSA is part of the government</a>, it is a political agency.

    <div class="md"><p>I could, but why should the community trust that I&#39;m not corrupt or corruptible?  With 3 million eyes on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, there&#39;s bound to be some money offers to remove particular content or for a moderator position.  The point is that if there is any central point of power or control, and people put their faith into it, there are bound to be special interest working to shape the discussion.</p>

<p>The only real option is to dismantel the centralization and allow easy selection of who moderates for you.  If reddit will not make that code change, then people should not contribute content to reddit, but rather seek out or create a site or system that does not lend itself to abuse of trust/power.</p>

<p>If you want to post it to <a href="/r/ideasfortheadmins">/r/ideasfortheadmins</a>, here&#39;s a cleaned up version...</p>

<p>TITLE:</p>

<p>Let users select individual moderators to filter content rather than letting moderators delete content.</p>

<p>TEXT:</p>

<p>The problem:</p>

<p>Many feel that the moderators of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and a few other major subs are pulling content irrespective of what is popular and for arbitrary enforcement of &quot;rules&quot;.  Also, since there are a large number of eyeballs for particular subs (3 million in the case of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>) there can be a vested interest to game the subs by bribing the mods or simply purchasing a seat from the other mods.</p>

<p>These potential problems with corrupting the mods for vested interest leave even new and developing subs such as <a href="/r/politic">/r/politic</a> (which seeks to replace the current <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> because of &quot;censorship&quot;) prey to this problem.  Thus all the energy and momentum of creating a new &quot;politic/s&quot; sub will be for nothing, because eventually (when it has enough eyeballs) it will fall to the same problems.  This is making some (like myself) looking for alternatives, and others seeking to develop a different competing service that would be immune to these problems.</p>

<p>With the upcoming TPP push that is expected to enact all sorts of internet censorship rules, can you blame people for looking for alternatives?  (Watch the <a href="/r/ModerationLog">/r/ModerationLog</a> for a bit and things become a bit disturbing.)</p>

<p>The potential solution:</p>

<p>Disallow deletion of content, but rather allow the &quot;moderators&quot; to filter by hiding the content (along with a short reason).  Users &quot;subscribe&quot; to moderators to filter out (hide) poor content.  Users will be &quot;subscribed&quot; by default to the most popular moderators to start with, but if the moderators start filtering to much good content, users can &quot;unsubscribe&quot; and switch to different moderators.  Thus each user&#39;s view of the posts is based on which moderators he selects to filter out poor content.  In this way, if a moderator is being heavy handed or selective in his moderation, users could migrate to better moderators.</p>

<p>The rule would apply to public (not private) subs.</p>
