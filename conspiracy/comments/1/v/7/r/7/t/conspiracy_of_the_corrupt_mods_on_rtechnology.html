        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">106</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-01-14 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/thoughtxchange.html">thoughtxchange</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So the following was posted on Reddit 4-5 hours ago about the Net Neutrality news that affects every single person on Reddit and on the internet in the US:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1v7138/us_appeals_court_kills_net_neutrality/">http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1v7138/us_appeals_court_kills_net_neutrality/</a></p>

<p>It was taken down about 1 hour ago by the mods and has a wrong subreddit tag.</p>

<p>My question to the mods is why did it take you 3 HOURS to do this? Allowing this to get to the #1 position on Reddit. It took you 5 minutes to respond to my message about this to tell me this should be in news or politics (even though the rules say &quot;Posts should be on technology (news, updates, etc).&quot; You either were not paying attention or you are corrupt. I believe you are corrupt.</p>

<p>The appearance is that you got paid by one of the ISP&#39;s to suppress this from the #1 spot on Reddit. Shame if that is the case. This affects the very existence of Reddit! The ISP&#39;s have the power today to BLOCK any website they chose! And the mods of r/technology are supporting this in my opinion. Everyone who sees this, please send a message to the mods at r/technology expressing your rage at them and to demand that they put this news back up and allow it to be #1 on Reddit again. This discussion is too important for this bullshit.</p>

<p>he really went to town in PMs defending that <a href="/r/history">/r/history</a> mod who came into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to shit talk when the submitter of the fallujah article posted the deletion on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, followed shortly thereafter by an obvious downvote brigade</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously, I have already. And I want everyone else to do the same. Glad to see other people are paying attention. This issue in my mind gets a special exception to just about any and every rule or annoyance of overposts, etc. I hope the r/conspiricay gets overflown with reposts to be quite honest. The fact that the ISP&#39;s can now LEGALLY block my access to Reddit? Wow. I think a little bit of yelling and screaming and going overboard is in order, don&#39;t you? You are talking about these companies now having the right to suppress entire sites. That means they now have the right to block this conversation. Me and you. And for a mod on Reddit to suppress that news is like treason in my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>has anyone tried to post this on r/politics?
I looked a r/technology. If they said this is a political post then why are they allowing <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1v7sws/reporter_visibly_stoned_after_doing_a_field/">http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1v7sws/reporter_visibly_stoned_after_doing_a_field/</a> on the top searches? isnt that political?</p>

<p>I sent a message to the admin /user/davidreiss666 to see what his reasoning is. If its political then there are a lot of posts that should be removed as well that are not related to this subject. Is there anyone we can report the moderators too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question. I was wondering the same. Are moderators just given power to do whatever the want or is there another level above them that can review their actions? You know, I usually don&#39;t get this pissed about stuff but you are talking about playing with our ability to access the internet with net neutrality. I mean if we can&#39;t discuss it on Reddit where can you? I still have not seen posts on the front page on this topic- it&#39;s unbelievable.</p>

Because if the mode of operation here allows companies to buy off posts they don&#39;t like doesn&#39;t that kind of go against everything Reddit is about?
