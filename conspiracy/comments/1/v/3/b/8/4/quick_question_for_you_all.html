<p>I&#39;m dumbfounded to explain how the fuck they fill these stadiums, Globally for Soccer (Football!) or the NFL given the unemployment rates but by Hell, they do!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your wisdom, like I stated in a previous comment I could&#39;ve strung some thing&#39;s together about it but it was merely shaving points, rating orientated playoff scheme.  I didn&#39;t think about the money side and now that you&#39;ve mentioned how a stadium can be packed every Sunday put some new light to it as well. The other articles on here are good to as I was reading them.</p>

<p>I wanted to post this originally in NFL but thought against it due to the fact I will get ridiculed for it (knowing that I have questioned this before amongst the ppl I hang out with they were not amused about the idea of a conspiracy with the nfl, I usually get &quot;Dude that&#39;s just stupid, you sound retarded it&#39;s just sports&quot;) so, I thought no one better than you guys and you delivered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was one of the first hits. If you read the second link, you&#39;ll get my point. Sports has nothing at all to do with nationalistic pride or a love for the military industrial complex. Those two things are installed in the minds of sports fans. Right at the peak of an amazing/emotional song, you typically see fireworks and jets flying over. This instills a deep emotional nationalistic pride simply because they are associated together through simultaneous timing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The monetary policies are definitely corrupt.  As with any major corporate institution they screw taxpayers.</p>

<p>Watching the NFL (as with any professional sport) is like social junk food.  If you moderate and watch a game occasionally, then it can be a great way to unwind, enjoy the company of others, and some light entertainment.  Consume too much and you can become healthy: living by your team winning or losing, losing track of what really matters in life, forgetting what your priorities should be.  Unless you&#39;re employed by it, the outcome of the games really don&#39;t affect your life.  Remember it is only a game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The addictive behavior some seem to express when it comes to sports in my opinion comes from our inherent need to connect with our fellow man. It&#39;s like the social easy-button that virtually anyone can have access to if they really want it.</p>

<p>I often times find myself in awkward situations at work with all of my co-workers chanting religiously about different stats, teams, and coaches standing there with virtually nothing to add to the conversation. I&#39;ll even joke with them sometimes and simply yell out &quot;SPORTS!&quot; when their chanting ceases for a few moments. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really no different than celebrity drama/gossip, just more focused on the left brain (Stats, strategy, competition etc.) . It&#39;s much easier to control an entertained populace. Less focus on policy, more focus on this year&#39;s draft picks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anything, I think the conspiracy is that this is the only way we’re supposedly allowed to connect.  You can only discuss celebrity gossip and sports, no politics or issues that really impact our lives.  Part of the justification is that it isn’t deemed polite to have heated arguments (ironic, because people resort to violence over sports all the time).  However, we should be able to have informed discussions and debates about politics and learn to compromise.  Unfortunately, most people don’t know how to do this, because their role models for discussing politics are the politicians that constantly sling poo at each other in a very uncivilized manner. Sports and other temporary outlets from the stress of everyday life aren&#39;t bad. If anything, it can be a healthy way to relax and bond. Using them to escape realty is bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>|isn’t deemed polite to have heated arguments|</p>

<p>This is one thing I will never understand about our social norms. I can understand not wanting to &quot;fight&quot; over certain topics, but like you said, what&#39;s wrong with civilized discussions about important happenings in this world? It&#39;s almost as if when the subject for discussion is actually important, then it&#39;s all of a sudden rude to mention. Very ass backwards if you ask me. </p>

<p>| Sports and other temporary outlets from the stress of everyday life aren&#39;t bad|</p>

<p>Totally agree. I guess it&#39;s the seemingly religious frequency that irks me. Everything in moderation I guess.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s ass-backwards. People&#39;s priorities are just flipped upside-down. People are like, “you care about issues that affect your life? You’re weird. You care about stories that have no direct impact on your life?  You’re totally normal.” Some people actually don’t think political issues affect their lives. However, you can easily point out that political policies directly affect their lives from the food they eat (e.g. GMO labeling) to the water they drink (e.g. water privatization) and the air they breathe (e.g. carbon tax).
Part of the reason people can’t have normal discussions about politics is because a lot of people think this is a healthy debate:
