    <div class="md"><p>The first guy&#39;s question hardly seems like some TSA public relations question - his inactivity is hardly proof of anything - it&#39;s pretty clear from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/smooochy">his comment history</a> that he doesn&#39;t say much.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/forte2">user profile</a> of the second guy is hardly that of some TSA stooge - for a start he&#39;s a New Zealander, and in his 2 months he&#39;s managed to accrue 4,000+ link karma and 26,000+ comment karma. If he&#39;s a sockpuppet he&#39;s a very busy one.</p>

<p>This all seems pretty paranoid.</p>

<p>If it was a PR exercise for the TSA it wasn&#39;t a very successful one - many of the highly visible comments are negative about the TSA, and even OP&#39;s answers to many things are hardly shining examples of positive TSA spin.</p>
