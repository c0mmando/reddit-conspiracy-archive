    <div class="md"><p>Are we to understand you are a U.S. citizen?</p>

<p>My take on the current relationship, U.S. &amp; Israel is:  </p>

<p>The insane and violence loving bigoted conservatives who have taken over the dialog and government in Israel, is not different from our own violence driven, bigoted U. S. conservative movement.  </p>

<p>The odd thing in the U.S. is a sizable number of our own conservatives are bigoted against Jewish people at the same time they defend more wars to support Israel.  The dichotomy of it all is a head spinning experience.</p>

<p>Do you think this aggressive, violence driven and bigoted conservatism is the problem?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m not an Israeli or American politician, so I can&#39;t answer with absolute certainty.</p>

<p>The Israeli government has their own agenda, largely in trying to push Muslims off of land they consider holy and which, by all accounts including the Quran, the Jews had a claim to first. It&#39;s like two brothers fighting over their father&#39;s estate because the will was very ambiguous.</p>

<p>As for American politicians, I&#39;m not certain that a sizable number are anti-semitic, since other posts on this subreddit claim that the majority of government elected officials are Jews. I do know that America&#39;s best interest right now is to keep the Middle East regions from imploding into all-out civil war, and supporting the existing stand-off/status quo is the probably easiest way of doing this. As long as the Middle Eastern nations are relatively stable, they can produce oil.</p>

<p>If real war did break out in the region, world superpowers would be forced to take sides. In today political climate, there&#39;s a good chance that this would put the US opposite to Russia and China. Nobody would really win, and nobody would ever gain anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From Wikipedia: </p>

<p>The word jewellery is derived from the word jewel, which was anglicised from the Old French &quot;jouel&quot; round the 13th century.[1] It has also been suggested that the word is derived from &quot;Jew&quot;, as the Jews were important jewelry artisans of that time.[citation needed] Further tracing leads back to the Latin word &quot;jocale&quot;, meaning plaything. Jewellery is one of the oldest forms of body adornment; recently found 100,000 year-old beads made from Nassarius shells are thought to be the oldest known jewellery.[2] </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for the majority, but historically Jews haven&#39;t approved of many Catholic ideals, Christianity vs. Jewish Orthodoxy aside.</p>

<p>The new pope, on the other hand, seems like a cool dude. No lavish clothes, no golden throne, and a message of tolerance and moderation. He acts like a spiritual leader, not like he&#39;s God.</p>

<hr/>

<p>As a bit of backstory, I am Jewish in heritage but was raised Christian. Respect for both worlds has made me a sort of Judeo-Christian. I focus on trying to lead a clean life and doing nothing that could make Christianity itself look bad. I also ignore the concept of denominations and rarely attend a brick-and-mortar church. Terrible things have been done in the name of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. I try to show people that most of us religious folks aren&#39;t violent, hateful, holier-than-thou jerks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I get most of my stuff from the Christian Bible.</p>

<p>If you want ritual, the catholics have it. Gold talismans, mummified body parts of saints, popes appointed to the papacy after slaying dragons, etc.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with that, of course. But when I study the ancient Jewish patriarchs like Abram, and then the early Judeo-Christians, I see something far from the pomp and circumstance of the papacy. It&#39;s what the Lutheran reformation was all about, really. The idea that you don&#39;t need a complicated ritual, a fancy building, or an old man wearing a dress that costs more than your net worth to relay messages.</p>

<p>You just sort of talk and have faith that someone&#39;s listening. In my case, everything seems to work out. By medical experts, educated and talented as they may be, I should be blind, brain damaged, and not conceived in the first place.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When I was conceived my mother was on a hormone therapy that, unknown to her, is also prescribed as a contraceptive. Her doctor was flabbergasted.</p></li>
<li><p>As a toddler, I was running, slipped, and ran right into a corner. My skull split open. I was put back together and stitched up and sent home, apparently stable. The next day I jumped on my bed, fell off, and ripped all the stitches out. I&#39;ve got a little scar on my forehead, but that&#39;s it.</p></li>
<li><p>In high school, I tried opening a D-cell battery without wearing goggles. The chemical sprayed into my face and dissolved the whites off of my eyes. Two hours of saline drip later, I was sent home with dark glasses and a grim prediction. A month later, my eyes had healed completely and even my mild astigmatism was gone.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Ironically, I discovered the magic of computer engineering less than a year later and have since developed severe nearsightedness. </p>

<p>The point is that I have to think that I&#39;ve got someone looking out for me.This makes me think that my simple approach to faith is approved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of which you stated about Catholicism is currently being reformed by the new pope. Which makes me wonder if that&#39;s the biblical prophecy of the second coming, or if he&#39;s the Antichrist and the church has been the &quot;whore&quot; the whole time! </p>

<p>We are living in odd times indeed. I guess what I meant by ritual is that I fundamentally believe that faith without works is dead. One can&#39;t pick when to be spiritual, we are spirit all the time. Yes, we&#39;re human and will make mistakes, but we aren&#39;t given a free pass to err on &amp; on without consequence. (Example, I can&#39;t have casual sex anymore. If I&#39;m not in love, it hurts my soul to its core. It&#39;s not fun. It doesn&#39;t bust any stress, it only adds to the &quot;shit&quot;. I will not have sex again, outside of a healthy, stable, committed relationship.) </p>

<p>But even in my example, how do I proceed? Do I believe people should be married to have sex? Prolly yeah, because if someone is willing to wait, it means they&#39;re committed to a lasting relationship. Is it realistic that I will find a man that believes that too, who can also be secure about my past? Idk. But I&#39;m not willing to risk my mind, body &amp; soul again for &quot;charm&quot;. </p>

<p>I guess I think we&#39;ve all lost a fundamental belief and that in turn, shapes our behavior. I don&#39;t know who &quot;has it right&quot;, but I don&#39;t think God approves of the smorgasbord view of religion. I know when I experience God in my soul, so maybe I need to start journaling to sort out when &amp; how that occurs. </p>
