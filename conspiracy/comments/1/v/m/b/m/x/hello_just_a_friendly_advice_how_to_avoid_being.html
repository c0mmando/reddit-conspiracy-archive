        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello, this is r/conspirology speaking. Unfortunately the conspiracy theory movement is constantly under attack of the obscure forces who are using theor agents in mass media to discredit and ridicule the seriousness of it. It is enough to see what they did in Wikipedia, basically writing all over the page &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; that people who belive in conspiracies are mainly mentally sick people.</p>

<p>Look here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory</a></p>

<p>Their modus operandi is quite obvious for aware people, they discredit people who are trying to solve conspiracies, but also trying to deviate the original meaning of words used in this field, in order to confuse and alienate unaware people who might be iinterested in it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately r/conspiracy is the main portal here on Reddit, but it is main purpose now is only conspiracy news related portal, the problem is r/conspiracy and other minor subs are not providing serious informations that have definitions about what we are all interested in on their subreddit. Which is conspirology.</p>

<p>Here is my solution for all posters who are iterested in conspiracies and moderators who own Conspiracy related subreddits.</p>

<p>I started a sub named conspirology, which is the serious name for all those who are interested in solving conspiracies. I put some vital and basic definitions about conspirology on my sidebar, and in the sticky post. I also have a post including quotes by famous people. The sub is still new, and I am trying to gather helpful informations as much as possibe for being aware and defending our seriousness.</p>

<p>I am inviting all the people interested in conspiracies, including posters and moderators to visit my sub and paste and copy the informations I posted about conspirology in your posts or on your sidebars. In order to show the enemy that conspirology is a serious thing, that has ancient roots, starting from ancient philosophy.</p>

<p>Here is the sub: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspirology/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspirology/</a></p>

<p>Feel free to paste &amp; copy all the informations you find useful for promoting the conspirology movement. The powers that be cannot attack what we are doing if we are using the name of conspirology, because it is ancient and respected.</p>

<p>And I am also inviting anyone who has some free time to use the information provided on my sub to fix the page on Wikipedia about conspirology. As you can see there is nothing there right now.</p>

<p>Look here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conspirology&amp;redirect=no">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conspirology&amp;redirect=no</a></p>

<p>Somebody deleted all the informations from wikipedia. I have bits from it on my sub. Definitions and quotes. We really must go to Wikipedia and restore it using the bits I have there. It is the only way to fight the huge disinformation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s right. This is why we need to start calling them by appropriate names. Like Conspiracy deniars, Conspiracy delusions, and pseudo Conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>The disinformation is trying to put everyone on the same plate, and then eat it all. The best way is to start speading real information in order to not let them eat all that it is the same plate.</p>

However just taking a claim or a blog at face value because it fits your personal bias for whatever reason can&#39;t be healthy.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, continue, and continue to be ridiculed. As for plausibility and probability, are you talking about justifications for your belief that are not based on any observable actions, regulations/laws or other visible evidence.   </p>

<p>For example while one may or may not find a document that details the plan to strip the wealth and power from the working class.  The evidence that is has been done and when it began is plentiful, in laws, regulations, where the tax money goes, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try to learn some history, and understand that the whole current members of the ruling elite had ancestors who were involved in slavery, instead of looking for documents that you will never obtain personally.</p>

<p>Because of historical dicuments avaiable now it is easy to understand what their minds are, and how they see humans as cattle to use, abuse and exterminate at will.</p>

<p>Also try to find the locations of where the ruling elite lives, and check out of some natural disasters happened there.</p>

<p>You probably don&#39;t understand how detecting and deduction works.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy is a cool sub, but it&#39;s purpose is mainly for conpiracy related news, I suggest you to visit my sub, there are informations an llinks that real conspirologists can use to find useful informations by themselves. Try to post your hypothesis or theory there, and we will start discussing it. You will understand how it all works in a serious way.</p>

<p>Black Panthers if not originally created by FBI/CIA to assist in electing Richard Nixon, were certainly taken over, then the leaders killed and imprisoned, now they can be invoked by conservatives, every presidential election.  Oh! scary black men with guns! </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you mean by that, as we are definitely able to make a full hologram, though again I&#39;m not sure what you mean by that.</p>

<p>I have made like 5 holograms, it&#39;s pretty fucking simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which claims?</p>

<p>Look up &quot;how to make a hologram&quot; and you can see how you can do it yourself.</p>

<p>You can go and view holograms at art exhibits and such.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure whether they would be using actual hologram projection, or holographic projection much like the Tupac concert.</p>

<p>All I am stating is that this could be a possibility as the technologies to do it with exist.</p>

<p>I know that reptilians is disinformation. It says basic truth about the existence of an elite Conspiracy, but by adding the word reptilians it makes look it naive and foolish. Very smart trick.</p>

<p>But I can talk seriously about UFO and aliens on our planet. I have my own hypoteses. The problem is that no one was able to obtain tangible profs.</p>

<p>The swastika is ancient and respected as well. Once a symbol of great faith and hope, it is now a disgusted and feared symbol of oppression.

<p>Well it does and it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to rule anyone or their favorite subreddit, but I feel like I have a decent grasp upon what this community wants and also what they need.</p>

<p>Wants are easy to please people with, needs are not so easy.  The rules changes I suggested were a need.  A lot of people didn&#39;t want them.  Its easy to feel enlightened by standing up against perceived evils like hate speech but then you see rules like that in action and more often then not they are used to silence people with legitimate criticisms.  Rarely do hate speech laws/rules get used in the spirit which they were crafted in.</p>

<p>This IS conspiracy and nobody should be limited to preapproved subjects.  If a sub like <a href="/r/ainbow">/r/ainbow</a> or <a href="/r/lgbt">/r/lgbt</a> wants a rule against criticism of gays lesbians bis or trans then that makes more sense.  Those subs are supposed to be a safe place for those people and having antigay users raiding them to call them fags or accuse gay people of being child molestors wouldn&#39;t be very safe.  Incidentally our rules here wouldn&#39;t allow that either, while protecting free speech.  But subreddits are free to make their own rules, as we did here, and if &quot;all subreddits&quot; were forced to have the same or similar rules then reddit would be pretty bland.</p>

<p>I do care about conspiracy, its users, and those people who haven&#39;t yet discovered its unique style who will end up here after the other subreddits white wash themselves in political correctness and lose their value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It helps if you reply to me instead of yourself.</p>

<p>We allow this thing called &quot;free speech&quot;</p>

<p>That includes unpopular speech.  If you don&#39;t support free speech then you are using &quot;us&quot; wrong.</p>

<p>Please show me one example of homophobia being allowed in this sub.  Obviously this answer of yours is because of the example I used above where I said <a href="/r/lgbt">/r/lgbt</a> makes sense to have rules against homophobic speech.  This is an example of how different aubs need different rules.  </p>

<p>What if every group was protected everywhere?  Free masons and Catholics and fraternities and men and women and we weren&#39;t allowed to say one negative thing about anyone?  Hell why not make Republican and Democrat protected groups where we are only allowed to say pleasant things about our government.  Why not make all government employees a protected group so if you complain on Facebook about the crappy workers at the DMV they can charge you with a hate crime.</p>

<p>Wake the fuck up man!  Free speech or no speech.  There is no grey area between them.</p>
