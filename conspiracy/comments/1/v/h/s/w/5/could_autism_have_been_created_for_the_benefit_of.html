    <div class="md"><p>Funny, they name the underlying causes and blame flame-retardant clothing but not US diets, which provide most of the chemicals they blame...bread and pasta (major staple, especially for kids in the US) is brominated/enriched (enrichment was mandated in 1998), fluoride and chlorine are in high concentrations in our water, fluorine from medications also leaches into our drinking water.</p>

<p>Re: the bromination/enchrichment - I really believe that it&#39;s not gluten that causes most people&#39;s &quot;wheat issues,&quot; but the synthetic vitamins used for enrichment (some actual celiacs, yes, but everyone I know has stopped eating gluten due to heartburn or whatever, and they are NOT celiac). I am convinced that others at higher levels know this, but let the gluten intolerance myth propagate anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The gluten thing is GMO related, I believe. While I believe the &quot;enrichment/fortified&quot; label is a total marketing scam to distract consumers from the increasing INDUSTRIAL chemicals in food, the GM of wheat has gone insane. The protein is fundamentally different. Our grandparents ate another grain entirely. Unless you have a seed cache from before the turn of the century and grow in a controlled environment,  the &quot;pollination contamination&quot; continues. Look at the bees, they literally live in one of the most amazing and beneficial foods like, ever, and they&#39;re dying. Silent Spring indeed.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes it&#39;s reassuring to think there are some all-knowing powers out there creating bad situations for cash, but too often it&#39;s really humans not knowing anything about anything. Not understanding that all actions cause reaction. If we&#39;re around in 50 years, and science is allowed to science without all the garbage politics that have been infesting it lately, they&#39;re probably going to have a better understanding of the role of the human microbiome, and how constantly nuking beneficial native bacteria affects the body/brain (and &quot;food&quot; allergies - it all ties together). I don&#39;t think it started out maliciously--I think we&#39;ve fucked up, and some people know it, some people don&#39;t, but the people that know are trying to hide the fuckup. The people that don&#39;t know have their hands over their ears, just trying to get by. Kids and parents are caught in the crossfire. Same issue w/the med+mass killing connections. How do those in the know sleep at night? I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Now adult-onset diabetes and &quot;we can&#39;t be arsed to figure out what&#39;s wrong with you, it could be a bunch of things, but we don&#39;t have time. Let&#39;s just call it fibromyalgia and be done with it. Take these highly addictive painkillers and antipsychotics and a letter to support your disability, have a good&#39;un!&quot;, well...<em>that&#39;s</em> a different issue. ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They can give you Humira for the joints, but then you&#39;ll get cancer. Ooo-rah. Better to take a microscope to diet, it helped me at least. Cut sugar, cut any grains with synthetic vitamin &quot;enrichment,&quot; add some kind of probiotic. Make sure you&#39;re getting enough magnesium, B12, D3, C, et al. It takes awhile to figure out what causes a problem. Pepsi gives me the weirdest repeatable tingly extremity nerve pain...it took me a long time to correlate it. At first, you&#39;re afraid that you&#39;re going to wake up unable to walk or function, and it&#39;s terrifying...but eventually you realize the pains are messages...they&#39;re just a total bitch to decipher.</p>

<p>Their sales reps get paid for each prescription, by the way, which translates into something like invites to free dinners or cruises or something sad like that for them. In positive news, GlaxoSmithKline is stopping the practice (<a href="http://www.prohealth.com/library/showarticle.cfm?libid=18595">http://www.prohealth.com/library/showarticle.cfm?libid=18595</a>). Likely just reactive, maybe they <em>finally</em> can&#39;t pay their way out of all the lawsuits and/or Japan and China are putting massive pressure on them to clean up the corruption (but not the FDA, no surprise...), but whatever the nefarious motive, it&#39;s some progress, at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where I live the resources are scarce. It&#39;s hard to get any help and it&#39;s like it doesn&#39;t exist. If the grand plan is to make money, they&#39;re doing a piss poor job so far. For example I&#39;m middle class. Maybe more towards upper middle. I have, by today&#39;s standards, good health insurance. Health insurance covers nothing for autism in my state so I have to pay for everything o out of pocket or through county funding. County funding covers very little, but enough to help us with getting a decent IEP at the school and a little bit of therapy on the side, not much and definitely not enough for a lower functioning kid. We cannot afford aba therapy (which is the recommended treatment) even for our HFA kid  because aba therapy is 10&#39;s of thousand s of dollars. No one who is middle class or below can possibly afford it out of pocket. So who can afford it? The rich obviously which isn&#39;t all that many people, but by and large folks on medicare can get it because medicare covers it 100%. The first thing I was told after I said &quot;I can&#39;t afford that&quot; was to get a divorce, quit my job, retain full custody of the kids, but continue living in my house with my husband. Then <em>I</em> would qualify for medicare and it would be covered. So if the  government devised it to get rich, bad plan. Cause now they are paying for most of the treatment. Apparently many people go this route. They won&#39;t run around bragging about it, but it is what happens. However I do think the govt knows what caused it. I think something got ducked up somewhere along the line and they don&#39;t want to cop to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand. Doesn&#39;t autism qualify as a disability? You should be able to file for a disabled child (SSDI), which would cover a monthly benefit for the &quot;labor of care&quot;, disability services and Medicare. 
<em>looks around</em>
When looking at websites, it seems like SSI (which is state funded, not the federal SS funds) is tied up into the ability to qualify for SSDI. Basically, if the family has money, they don&#39;t qualify for help, and the kid can&#39;t claim SSDI benefits as an adult unless they meet the work quota to qualify. </p>

<p>WTF, that&#39;s totally convoluted. Our whole medical/insurance system is utterly fucked up. I&#39;m currently having the conversation with my elderly mother on which state she should choose to die in, based on state health insurance plans. &#39;Murica... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. And my health insurance tells us that since she was never able to use a fork (among many things, fork is one small example) they won&#39;t cover ot (our whatever else might apply) because they only cover REhabilitation not habilitation. Meaning if it was an ability she had and lost due to injury or illness, they cover the therapy. If it&#39;s an ability that was never developed or is slow to develop in the first place, you get nothing unless it&#39;s one of the illnesses on a list of diagnosis, which autism (and similar) are not on. Yeah it&#39;s a fucked up system especially when you consider 1 in 88 kids has a form of autism. People think it&#39;s over diagnosed, and often point to me daughter as an example. Because she happens to have an IQ of something like 145 or there abouts. So she can communicate and you can sort of have a conversation with her. I have people telling me I got a bum dx and that it is just behavior problems. No. They see her at her best. When she knows she needs to she can kind of hold the pieces together and &quot;pass&quot; especially if she just doesn&#39;t say too much. But stick her in a noisy room... a crowded restaurant... or heaven help us all group lessons of any kind or a birthday party? She goes full blown autistic and other people start getting mad that my kid can&#39;t &quot;behave&quot; and I say look at her! Does she look like she even knows what she is doing right now? Despite the high IQ and despite the grade acceleration and fucking brilliant shit she comes up with, she has to have an aide full time in class. She can&#39;t focus, wanders around the class, strikes up conversations with herself, starts singing. All because she can&#39;t pick up on the social cues that tell all the other kids NOT to do that or her brain doesn&#39;t find it rewarding enough to care. Add to that the sensory issues and resulting anxiety, she is a hot mess anytime no one is really looking at her!</p>

<p>We aren&#39;t certain what her future looks like. Right now she can&#39;t use the bathroom on her own or dress herself. We don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll be able to go to college. If we could get the ABA therapy, it would be a sure thing. She is high functioning enough and smart enough that it would tip the scales for her. Right now we really don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This could be. But if you are into the medical field you will see how many mistakes have been made to get us where we are. Not saying these living, breathing, beautiful people don&#39;t deserve the same rights we all have, but people harm themselves without realizing it. Sometimes it&#39;s handling medication which allows room for birth deficincies with women who are pregnant, or something like HIV and AODS where people literally fear a disease! History repeats itself. I would like to think all those with autism are the same as everyone else, and there are people in the world who will make you so out of place with yourself because of how insensitive they are. So maybe autism is somewhat faked, it could be a way to split us all up, maybe they are more spiritually aware than we realize! They are every single opportunity that we have in this day and age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like when I thought the HPV vaccine was going to prevent cervical cancer and now my fertility is compromised?  Like when I realized the allergy shots were making me feel like I had an electrified metal tube in my esophagus? Like when I was a vegetarian and ate a bunch of soy and had early menopause symptoms? </p>

<p>Denial and assumptions are a mutherfucker... :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Created?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>But the rates of autism in the modern era are unquestionably higher by an order of magnitude than it was in the past.</p>

<p>It does beg the question of why, doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>I think you&#39;ll find the graph labelled &quot;Autism and Mental Retardation as a percent of All Disabilities (from USDE data)&quot; of particular interest.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice over time that diagnoses of mental retardation <strong>fall</strong> as incidents of various autistic spectrum diagnoses <strong>rise</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend has a toddler who seems to need a lot of help. Physical therapist and specialized footwear. A crazy amount of testing, some requiring hospitalization. Speech therapist. Recreational/social therapy. Hell, they even buy business cards with &quot;my kid is autistic. it&#39;s kinda rude to stare&quot; messages. </p>

<p>I agree there&#39;s a known source, concealed. I&#39;d say the real starting point for investigation would be co-occurring disorders. Trace the &quot;malfunctions&quot; there to determine a &quot;cause&quot;. </p>
