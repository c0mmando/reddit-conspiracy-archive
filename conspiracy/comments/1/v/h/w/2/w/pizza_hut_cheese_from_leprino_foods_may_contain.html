    <div class="md"><p>I used to work at pizza hut and to be honest, the cheese is the least of your worries. </p>

<p>The pizza pan itself has 600+ tiny 1/8&quot; holes throughout which unless knocked vigorously against something would retain the wash water from the dish washer. Also, policy was 5 seconds of &quot;food release&quot; per pan. (cheap knock off aerosol pam)  the &quot;garlic butter spray&quot; which was also an aerosol was equally disgusting.   And the cheese sticks and cinastix oh god, those were just a container of &#39;butter flavored oil&#39; that sat out all day long. Everything is frozen upon delivery including the dough &#39;discs&#39;....  I could continue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend is manager at papa Johns, they do not even have a freezer and cut all their vegetables in store fresh.  Their dough is freshly stretched completely by hand and is awesome. I rate them pretty highly after he let me come in and make my own pizza </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked at Papa John&#39;s for a few months. It was by far the worst job I ever had. PJ&#39;s did very little in training their managers and I watched 4 new  managers come and go in less than 3 months; none of which I would trust in a household budget. The delivery range was way too big, not enough CSR&#39;s worked, and managers were always passive in  problem solving. </p>

<p>I once watched my 32 year old manager accept a food order with half of the ingredients being rotten. His plan? Throw away the bad ingredients and go to the local grocery store and pay out of pocket for fresh mushrooms, tomatoes, and bell peppers. He expected myself and another driver to pitch in, without being paid back; for the good of the business, he said. Having gained management training for a whopping 3 days at a local culinary school, I, being 19 years old and new to the working force told my manager I would handle it. Keep in mind I had been working here for approximately 3 months and my manager, the man appointed to run a profitable business by a major pizza company(and worked there for 8 years), didnt want to be mean to the delivery driver and didn&#39;t think he could reject the order. </p>

<p>I talked to the driver and pointed out that our food shipment was rotten and that it wasn&#39;t acceptable and that he needed to take the rotten food back, replace it, and get back here immediately. </p>

<p>Three hours later, we had fresh food and a butthurt manager. I quit two weeks later after he demanded I continue working after I threw up all over the bathroom, I had food poisoning. </p>

<p>I should have reported him to the state, health department, and Papa Johns but didn&#39;t. I can only hope he never worked as a manager or in the food industry again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kinda got side tracked with that. Yeah, Pizza Hut doesn&#39;t cut shit. Nothing is particularly fresh, and everything is coated in chemical food products. The sauce is tomato concentrate with tap water. The &quot;marinara&quot; is just the same pizza sauce with more tap water added.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We had the automatic dishwasher and yes while it did get the dishes clean they came out wet. I&#39;d smack the pans individually on the counter while removing them from the tray to knock all the water out. Everyone else would just throw them on the top of the stack full of water, then when prep came they&#39;d put the frozen discs on wet pans. Disgusting, that is why the pizza is always soggy.</p>

<p>Whenever I&#39;d make my own pizza it would actually be good but only if I did the dishes the night before and did dough prep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only that my friend. It goes much much deeper. The USDA allows organic eggs, apples and pears to be injected with antibiotics. I could go on and on. We must grow our own food. Veggies, fruit, meats etc. If you want to know what&#39;s in it, grow it. My friend used to be a USDA certifier for organic farms. You&#39;d be sickened if I told you the real truth. Money talks, and it can buy you a cert.  for a small farm. Imagine what money does for corps. Truly (r)evolution is gardening and becoming self sufficient. Favorite quote ever-&quot; Growing your own food is like printing money&quot; Ron Finley TED talk. Best TED ever IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you. I started growing in pots in an apartment. It can be done slowly but surely. Honestly once you start with something simple and you harvest basil, cilantro, a tomato; you are inspired to go big. I&#39;m happy to mail you some organic non gmo seeds to grow indoors or out. Have plenty to share. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow thanks. About six months ago we bought a decent variety of vegetable seeds, they’re vacuumed packed. We were saving them for some rainy day. Maybe we could trade some...I&#39;ll look and see which ones we have. There’s a couple of spots outdoors we could grow a bit, it just didn&#39;t seem very practical for how little would be grown. Thinking about sprouting, seems like a simple way to get some fresh greens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey I&#39;m happy to do it without a trade. I&#39;m a year round organic gardener in Hawaii with a lot to share. What do you guys eat? What do you want to grow? I&#39;ve got the seeds for sure. All organic non gmo heirloom. You can save seeds forever growing heirloom. And it&#39;s so much easier than it sounds. I expect to get downvoted for this comment because it&#39;s in a conspiracy post BTW. But let me know seriously. My life is gardening and sharing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s awesome! There a few libraries around that have seed banks for people to share their seeds. It&#39;s an absolute necessity to keep these pure seed lines going. Last year I visited the Native Seed Bank in Arizona, they do a nice job preserving authentic seeds. I like everything from Brussels sprouts to Zucchini, my girlfriend is a little picky but if she tries home grown, I’m sure she’ll love them all. I’ll PM you later and if you like trade address with you. Maybe I can find something local here you’d like.</p>

<p>Dihydrogen monoxide:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Major component of acid rain</p></li>
<li><p>Found in cancerous tumors</p></li>
<li><p>In its gaseous state, causes severe burns to internal and external tissues</p></li>
<li><p>Inhalation usually leads to death</p></li>
<li><p>Corrodes metals</p></li>
<li><p>Causes soil erosion</p></li>
<li><p>Found in cleaning solvents and industrial waste</p></li>
<li><p>A study of 50 infamous serial killers found that every single one was exposed to large quantities of DHMO as children</p></li>
<li><p>The NSA uses DHMO to cool their supercomputers at their domestic spying facility in Utah</p></li>
<li><p>DHMO is in every soft drink on the market</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Sound like an awful chemical, eh? Maybe we should ban it?</p>

<p><strong>Dihydrogen monoxide (DHMO)</strong> is fucking <em>water</em>.</p>

<p>Stop being so afraid of chemically sounding names. None of these chemicals in the cheese are that bad for you. Too many people equate &quot;chemical&quot; to &quot;dangerous&quot;. Everything is a chemical.</p>

<p><strong>(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanal</strong> is <em>SUGAR</em>. You put it in your coffee. Your body converts it into <strong>Adenosine triphosphate</strong> which is used as energy by your cells.</p>

I&#39;d smack the pans individually on the counter while removing them from the tray to knock all the water out.
