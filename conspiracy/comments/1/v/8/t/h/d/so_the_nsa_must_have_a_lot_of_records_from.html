       Lol, like that's going to happen. I know your post was a bit of sarcasm but it's entirely possible that they have or can collect records of corrupt individuals but the discussion doesn't or won't even register at all. You can compare the NSA with the quote from Voltaire...

       "With great power comes great responsibility."
      </p>
      <p>
       In the hands of the NSA lies a tool that can be used for great good or great evil. It's not being used in a good way which makes it clear the path that we will taken down. It could be used to find corruption and fight major crimes, solve a lot of problems in the world yet it's been turned on us like an omnipotent Sauron, ever watchful, ever intent on utilising it for evil.

       Two wrongs doesn't make 1 right. 1 wrong doesn't make 1 right. NSA is wrong, is criminal, is unconstitutional, it should be abolished without destroying anyone's rights, even supposed criminals, because in the eyes of the government everyone is a criminal.

       I couldn't tell you who the suspects are, but anyone with a brain and sufficient power would sure be interested in all the financial data collected by the NSA... Options, Commodities, Forex - the NSA is a gold mine for anyone capable of acting upon all that secret information.

       I think this is a great idea.
       <br/>
       I hope the fact that the NSA is spying on bankers and politicians is it's undoing.  The American people can't do much without the support of bankers and politicians, and bankers and politicians must getting weary of being spied on too.  By spying on the very people that control it's political and financial support it is shooting itself in the foot by biting the hand that feeds it.  Like all institutions, there must be infighting and back stabbing between and among the ranks of the bankers, politicians, and the NSA.  I doubt they all hold hands and sing kumbaya to get ahead and climb the ladder.
