       I apologise for the slightly hostile title, I thought it'd generate more attention than what I had originally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm writing an essay about how psychology can be used for social control. My lecturer seems to have an image of me as a conspiracy theorist (no idea why /s although I'm not really an Illuminati-believing kind of guy if you catch my drift) as a result of my skepticism, so I've kind of taken it as a personal challenge to take on the definition of "conspiracy theorist" and the psychological associations of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to make the point that while believing in "conspiracy theories" is considered a personality trait and there has been research done on "why people believe in conspiracy theories" and it has pointed to psychological roots for the "phenomenon", perhaps a more valid explanation for why people believe that powerful people conspire and governments engage in covert operations is because they bloody well do (though it goes without saying that I will be mentioning how some alleged "conspiracies" are down to personal mental disorders - hallucinations and the like).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I've already made mention of one of my favourite books, Machiavelli's
       <em>
        The Prince
       </em>
       , but what I need from you is
       <strong>
        any documented, verifiable conspiracies and evidence of them that could be cited in a college essay
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm talking overthrow of governments, meetings to collude between big business + governments, scientific experiments on unwitting populations, you know, proper X-Files fuel, written about in reputable publications or well-regarded books.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've already got good stuff for Iran-Contras and MK Ultra. What else?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: The hilarious thing is that this is the most densely sourced section of my essay. There's more evidence for this stuff than half of Psychology.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT THE SECOND: My essay is complete and has been handed in. Feel free to make more suggestions of
       <strong>
        well-sourced
       </strong>
       (official documents, government confession/apology etc) conspiracies if you wish, but please check the thread first as we are getting a lot of duplicate replies at this point.

       Also; although I haven't read it myself, I have heard the book "economic hitman" details how the american government coerced other countries into giving up their resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also; the recent NSA spying revelation is most obvious.

       One of the lesser known aspects of the 1953 coup is that the CIA ended up putting fascists who were sympathetic to the Nazis in charge of the Iranian government.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Iranian fascists and Nazis played prominent roles in the coup regime. Gen. Fazlollah Zahedi, who had been arrested and imprisoned by the British during World War II for his attempt to establish a pro-Nazi government, was made Prime Minister on August 19, 1953. The CIA gave Zahedi about $100,000 before the coup and an additional $5 million the day after the coup to help consolidate support for the coup.[11] Bahram Shahrokh, a trainee of Joseph Goebbels and Berlin Radio’s Farsi program announcer during the Nazi rule, became director of propaganda. Mr. Sharif-Emami, who also had spent some time in jail for his pro-Nazi activities in the 1940s, assumed several positions after 1953 coup, including Secretary General of the Oil Industry, President of the Senate, and Prime Minister (twice).

       This is really where conspiracy theory gets started: how these link together.  Arguably the Unabomber was created by the CIA, and that's just one example.

       Great documentary on the OK bombing called A Nobel Lie- I think...  Talk about an amazing coverup- what they did to this one guy while he was in prison. A case of mistaken identity which led to torture and death- Kenneth Michael Trentadue.

       Both of them were charged after they refused to recant their claims.  Bonacci's charges were dropped after Owen was convicted of perjury.  Several jurors in the Owen case have asserted that there was jury tampering occurring, which led them to vote guilty, a vote they would not make again knowing what they know now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alisha Owen’s appellate attorneys appealed her conviction on several grounds, including prosecutorial, judicial, and juror misconduct. Specific motions included perjured witness testimony, denial of Miranda rights, the jurors using a dictionary to define “reasonable doubt,” and the judge being a practicing attorney. All the appeals were denied.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Gary Caradori initially videotaped Alisha Owen’s testimony, she voiced her reservations about coming forward, saying she had been warned that talking would endanger her or family members. On November 7, 1990, as Owen awaited her perjury trial, her 17-year-old brother Aaron was found hanged in his cell at the Lincoln Correctional Center. His death was ruled a suicide. Alisha Owen has never recanted her version of events and was released from prison on 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several of those accused of sexual improprieties with children were also convicted, including Peter Citron. There is also a standing $1 million dollar judgement against Lawrence King (key perpetrator).

       I recommend two books which will walk you through all of the evidence:

       and the
       <a href="http://franklinscandal.com/index.html">

       . There's much more here than what you've heard.

       Thanks.  There are some pretty extreme claims made by Franklin victims, but there's also quite a bit of evidence to substantiate those claims.  I started researching it thinking "No way this is real" but the books are pretty compelling.

       The franklin case actually had tons of evidence. Maybe you should do some more research on the topic before opening your mouth to bullshit. Because that's exactly what it is when you try and connect the Franklin Case with satanic panic and conspiracy theorists. If I were more of an ass I'de call you a shill. No surprise when I bring out the Franklin Case. Still raises hairs to this day.

       They pled innocent to perjury charges. Paul Bonacci also won a 1 million dollar judgement.

       Why don't you tell Gary Caradori and his kid Andrew that this wasn't a coverup or something bigger then it was..? OH WAIT YOU CAN'T BECAUSE HE'S DEAD.

       Troy Boner dead as well.

       to be timely, consider bringing up some of the media that once denied that the NSA even existed, or the repeated denials that a place called Area 51 even existed. perhaps mention the 50 year complete blackout of bilderberg meetings, which were only revealed after the internet allowed media communication to occur outside of the mainstream media corporations, who are all themselves bilderberg members.
      </p>
      <p>
       consider mentioning CNN's apology following the discovery of project mockingbird, or Clinton's apology following the discovery of project mk ultra, or the government's own 1979 panel that determined through previously undiscovered (at the time of the Warren Commission) audio evidence that JFK was indeed very probably shot at by multiple shooters.

       Hmm, perhaps. I've come down pretty heavily on the side that "conspiracy theory" is too politically charged a term and should not be used in scientific research.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I've been very neutral about the rest of the stuff but I have repeatedly made the point that scientific research should drive social and political perception, not the other way round.

       I think "conspiracy theory" is fine in scientific circles.  It is just unfortunate that the phrase has been hijacked.   Most people that use it no longer have a clue what it actually means.   That is why it fails in scientific circles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the word "scientific" has been gradually been being hijacked as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most of us know "terrorist" as a word has been hijacked.   It certainly does not mean now what it meant in 70s and 80s when I was being taught about it.  It now means anyone that disagrees with the official government view of things.   Which puts anyone that believes in any conspiracies directly in the cross hairs, unless the conspiracy that is believed in happens to be one the government is pushing.

       MKUltra was declassified in 1977, before Clinton was president:

      <p>
       Clinton declassified other documents on human experimentation &amp; other covert actions, and apologized for those.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrary to what some may believe, Clinton's actions in apologizing for previous administrations were actually a pro-reform strategy.  Because of Clinton's apology, he established the fact that there will be no easy two-party consensus that experimentation is OK.
      </p>
      <p>
       This does not mean it won't be just as easy for future administrations -- but it does mean it will make it harder for future Democrats to participate in experimentation because there is a public moral standard that he paid lip service to, which means more than you might think in D.C.

       yes that's completely correct. i was lazy, but the incident refers to CNN apologizing about being discovered to have psyops personnel "interning" in cable news networks, which is a relationship familiar to mockingbird's insertion of approved personnel into media relationships.

       i didn't mean that clinton declassified mk ultra, but that he apologized for some of the experimentation that had occurred under its umbrella network of projects.

       my statements were too broadly defined in timespan and attribution. sorry.

       i like what you say about the public moral standard, i really like it. it was a pr inspired move, obviously, to associate himself with a good guy presidential legacy, apologizing for the misguided abuses of previous administrations. just a wax job. but those things can backfire if surprising disclosures occur.

       another thing you should look into, is the fact that proof has come out that members of the saudi arabian government financed 9/11 and now the families of victims are legally able to sue them.
      </p>
      <p>
       this isnt a secret, its well known, because this on its own isnt a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       but when you consider it in the context of the US starting two wars in retalliation for 9/11, the US reaction to saudi arabia seems almost comically absurd. they declared war on two nations without any evidence, and yet when evidence arises of who is really responsible, they completely ignore it.
      </p>
      <p>
       nobody seems to give a shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       i believe a big aspect of the "conspiracy theorist" mindset is "putting the pieces together"... where a normal person would see a coincidence, a conspiracy theorist sees correlation and causation.
      </p>
      <p>
       this "attention to coincidences" is a trait that in EVERY OTHER INSTANCE is considered to be a good thing. this is also a big reason why many conspiracy theorists are former cops. there are dozens of TV shows about detectives and secret agents who have the exact same "attention to detail" when it comes to unusual coincidences, and its almost always the main characters who have it. in some shows, (I.E. the mentalist, monk, etc...) that personality trait is the entire driving force behind the show.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        so why is a beneficial trait being used as a basis for defamation? because that "beneficial trait" makes people much harder for the government to lie to. it makes them much better at detecting conspiracies. thats why US government intelligence agencies made the term "conspiracy theorist" a derogatory insult. it was the easiest way for them to discredit anyone who questioned the official story.

       The US government entered into a formal alliance with the Sinaloa (Mexico) drug cartel between 2000 and 2012:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is tied to the "Fast and Furious" scandal in which US gun stores were ordered to sell guns via dodgy or non-existent paperwork to Mexican nationals:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/194221-report-fast-and-furious-gun-turns-up-in-mexico">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We've known for years that most of the guns went to the Sinaloa cartel.  We now know from US DEA agents that there was a formal agreement to allow the Sinaloa to take drugs into the US and ship money out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy extended across banks, too:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/03/us-bank-mexico-drug-gangs">
        http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/03/us-bank-mexico-drug-gangs
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note which gang the major US banks were laundering money for: the Sinaloa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       The US allied with the Sinaloa against other cartels.  As best we can tell, and this isn't proven yet but it makes sense, the main "enemy cartel" was the Zetas, which started out as an elite anti-cartel unit of the Mexican military given special SWAT-level training and equipment by the US before they went rogue.  The US hated those guys so much they got in bed with the Sinaloa...drug running, gun running, money laundering.  No proof yet of joint ops in murder and/or kidnapping but that's probably next.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US ATF tried to bust the various gun dealers they roped into this shit and some were smart enough to prove they were acting under ATF orders by secretly recording the ATF.  Those ones escaped criminal prosecution later as the cover-up started in earnest.  Others...not so lucky although criminal charges are getting fresh looks now that enough of the stink has gone public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and the Obama administration tried to use this "US guns in Mexico!" hype to further regulate modern rifles in the US.  Bastards.

       Shell Oil company successfully hatched out and participated in a conspiracy to kill innocent non-violent protesters in Nigeria. It was carried out by Shell with the goal of stopping citizen opposition to their oil businesses in Nigeria. Shell was destroying their land and their means to live.

        The particular incidents raised in these cases were:
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         the 1995 judicial hangings of the Ogoni Nine, leaders of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP); the torture and detention of Owens Wiwa and Michael Tema Vizor;
the shooting of a woman, Karololo Kogbara, who was peacefully protesting the bulldozing of her crops in preparation for a Shell pipeline, and another female protester, Uebari N-nahby by Nigerian troops allegedly called in by Shell.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        American photojournalist Ed Kashi's images from the book Curse of the Black Gold: 50 Years of Oil in the Niger Delta[2] were deposed as evidence of the human rights abuses that the oil industry, particularly Shell, has inflicted on the Ogoni people.

       I believe the case was settled in 2010. Shell got to admit to no wrong doing and a minuscule fine of $15 Million. Shell is the 2nd largest company on Earth.

       A lot of people went to jail for the LIBOR scandal. Entire companies were destroyed because their corporate officers were imprisoned. The LIBOR scandal also primarily dealt with the housing market and loan interest rates, since that's what LIBOR determines.

       i think the shock doctrine by naomi klein is a great read. it details how moneyed interests take advantage of "shocks"- either natural (as in hurricane katrina) or contrived (economic/war).
      </p>
      <p>
       confessions of an economic hitman also detail the conspiracies to give economic shocks to other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       also try blackwater (forgot the author). its about the rise of the world largest private army.
      </p>
      <p>
       also crossing the rubicon, which has plenty of evidence to suggest 9/11 was an inside job, or at the very least allowed by insiders to occur (ala shock doctrine).
      </p>
      <p>
       those (imo) are the most relevant today, as we enter a world of economic doom and a global police state.

       As for why I posted this, I just wanted to be reminded of any I might have overlooked as I really want to get this right. For me, this is more than getting a good mark or passing my course (as this essay is required for me to do that), it's about proving a point.

       Look into the many patents of Nikola Tesla, and how all his research papers and patents were confiscated by the government immediately after his death. For instance, he invented the death ray, a machine that shot microwaves in a controlled and deadly manner. Then, several decades after his death, the military brings out the active denial system. Literally the same technology Tesla invented years before. Imagine what else is to come. (Earthquake machines--yes, tesla invented one, free wireless energy transfer, and he did a lot of research into the ionosphere and magnetosphere of earth, something HAARP is into as well...)

       Personally, though, if you want a conspiracy with evidence, it is the beginning of civilization and the suppresssion or ancient knowledge thereof. Underwater cities are being found lately that couod only have been built when the water levels were much lower,l. A common theme seems to point to am era before the melting of the ice age, before 9000BC, a time that "mainstream" scientists say we were cavemen, hunters and gatherers. The earliest accepted civilization is of sumer, circa 6000BC. These underwater cities blow the accept dawn of human civilization back thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I feel, if civilization was that old, and were maybe destroyed, their knowledge is still contained within esoteric circles who---i gotta stop myself here. You get the idea.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, evidence exists for a prehistoric human civilization, but they wont accept it for some reason. From the water erosion on the sphynx, to gobleki tepe, man. If theres one provabke conspiracy theory, its the suppression of forbidden history.

       You're completely right.  Tons of evidence to support the idea of a technologically advanced "parent civilization" or something like it existing in the distant past.

       The links between the religious teachings, symbols, buildings (like pyramids), etc. of civilizations from all over the world (who never would have come into contact with each other) are impossible to ignore.

       Not sure if you can apply this but did you know the Reichstag fire is still being disputed, as in how much of it Marinus van der Lubbe was responsible for &amp; how much of a hand the Nazi's had?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm under the impression most people are certain it was a false flag carried out entirely by the 3rd Reich, I hope this is of use, &amp; don't forget people sometimes use the event as an archetype, when referring to events like 9/11.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Historians disagree as to whether Van der Lubbe acted alone, as he said, to protest the condition of the German working class or whether the arson was planned and ordered by the Nazis, then dominant in the government themselves, as a false flag operation. The responsibility for the Reichstag fire remains an ongoing topic of debate and research.[4][5] According to Ian Kershaw, writing in 1998, the consensus of nearly all historians is that Van der Lubbe did, in fact, set the Reichstag fire.[6] Although Van der Lubbe was certainly an arsonist, and clearly played a role, there has been considerable popular and scientific debate over whether he acted alone. The case is still actively discussed.

       The whole of human history is filled with proven conspiracies. Why is this presented like it's supposed to be difficult? How about the recent actions of Chris Christie's top staff, to name one from just last week.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's at issue isn't whether proven conspiracies exist. Obviously they do. What's at issue is
       <em>
        why some people believe conspiracies for which they do not have proof.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I can speculate about the existence of ghosts or UFOs or a CIA plot to kill JFK, but I should also acknowledge that I can only speculate about these things; I can't prove them. If I could prove them, there would be no "conspiracy theory." They would just be acknowledged as facts of history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real mystery is why people stubbornly insist conspiracies exist even when they can't prove them. I guess it's harmless enough for a person to hold their own personal beliefs, even if they're unproven. But many conspiracy theorists are convinced of the truth of their theories despite the absence of evidence, and become quite hostile and belligerent when asked for evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should add: I'm not immune to the temptation to believe in conspiracies I can't prove. I'll give you some examples:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) I'm fairly sure the reasons for the Iraq War (GWB Edition) were related to the desire for American dominance of geography and resources (oil), as well as to restore the
       <a href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Iraq/Iraq_dollar_vs_euro.html">
        denomination of Iraqi oil in US dollars
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. The man was a major threat to the status quo and the powers that dominated the country and the economy. He was the leader of a major national movement that threatened to completely up-end the prevailing social order of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) Botched Hurricane Katrina relief. It's a well understood fact of American political life that voters tend to punish their state-level government if natural disasters aren't handled properly. Especially in the American South, this lesson has been learned over and over as governors lost seats due to mismanagement of various crises. I've always had a hunch that George Bush's administration decided to withhold disaster relief and coordinating personnel from Louisiana following Hurricane Katrina, knowing that the Democrats who controlled the state would be turned out of office in the next election, thereby increasing GOP control of Congress and at the state level.

       These are all conspiracy theories that seem plausible to me. But here's the difference: I acknowledge that they're just theories. I don't have any evidence to prove any of them, and I don't pretend to. You will never see me screaming in someone's face that they're a "sheeple" or a "shill" because they don't completely accept my theories as proven fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think investigation of each of these is warranted. It's good to ask questions and dig for the truth when we are convinced a conspiracy exists. We need a system that enables the fourth estate to do investigations, and a separation of powers that allows different government entities to hold each other in check. But we will make fools out of ourselves if we decide we can just skip the step where evidence is required to make factual claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad truth is that this means a lot of conspiracies will never be exposed. A lot of major criminal operations have never been exposed. Sometimes the bad guys win. But that sad fact doesn't mean we can just make up any theory we want and insist it's the truth.

       It's not a mystery. It's called making a judgment based on the weight of evidence.

       There is very little about history which is provable beyond doubt. We have to rely on "authorities" to tell us what happened. Not surprisingly, there are many instances where the evidence that could prove something is deliberately withheld or destroyed.

       What's at issue in my essay is why people class all such theories as "conspiracy theories" and why are studies done on all of them like they're a defined block, looking for psychological reasons within individuals for belief in this nebulous concept of "conspiracy theories" instead of looking separately at paranoid delusions, recognizing social and historical reasons for belief in (I would argue in the sorts of cases I'm looking for that it's
       <em>
        knowledge of
       </em>
       ) conspiracy and leaving the issue to historians.

       There's been stuff up here recently explaining how the CIA sparked the use of the term "conspiracy theorist" as a tool to discredit researchers. Also, this made me think to mention Dr. Ewen Cameron. I know you researched MKUltra but don't know if you came across information on him.

       EDIT: I liked this quote from that article "According to studies, those who subscribe to conspiracy theories are less “married” to their theories than those who accept conventional wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       One study showed that people who believe strongly in something are greatly offended when proven wrong, causing emotional stress that and in some cases can threaten self-image."

      <p>
       EDIT 2: And this one... "Invented term
      </p>
      <p>
       DeHaven-Smith said that the term “conspiracy theorist” was invented and made popular intentionally by the CIA in an effort to discredit those who asked questions surrounding the assassination of JFK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the CIA is banned from domestic activities, if true, it is illegal, contends Kevin Barrett of Press TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said “people who use the terms ‘conspiracy theory’ and ‘conspiracy theorist’ as an insult are doing so as the result of a well-documented, undisputed, historically real conspiracy by the CIA to cover up the JFK assassination.” "

       There's massive amounts of convincing evidence that the U.S. intelligence community was involved in the assassinations of both JFK and MLK. You're just not well-researched. Start with the Committee on Political Assassinations. Or with JFK just start with Oliver Stone's film.

       While not necessarily a conspiracy, I'll hit you off with this bullshit...
      </p>
      <p>
       During the outbreak of WW1, the public sentiment was to stay out of the war.  At the time, the USA thought of itself as an isolationist nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       President Wilson kept the United States from entering the War for quite some time.  The sinking of the Lusitania in 1915 (it was a British liner, but had American citizens on board), among other things, forced Wilson's hand into war. Keep in mind I am paraphrasing bullet points.  I would also like to add that the Germans took out an ad in US newspapers telling people that they were sinking all ships, but people traveled anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wilson knew the public didn't want to enter, so to help whip up some good old fashioned nationalistic fervor and to swing the public opinion, he created the United States Committee on Public Information.
      </p>
      <p>
       This organization was used purely as a massive propaganda tool.  Here is the wiki link:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Public_Information">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Public_Information
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The CPI hired thousands of actors to give rousing public speeches about how the US needed to enter the war and they also worked with Hollywood to create pro-war films.  The agency created the feeling that if the average American didn't contribute to the war effort, then they were anti American.  The CPI suppressed anti war efforts and the worst part about it, is that it worked alarming well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem now is that people have no idea about American history.  These kinds of propaganda campaigns do not get regulated and vanish, but they are perfected and honed to the point of being close to undetectable. Don't listen to the people that label you a "conspiracy theorist" or "tin foil hat."  Keep asking questions because the people in this country that used to do the things that are being done here weren't called conspiracy theorists, they were called patriots.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on for quite some time about this agency.  The wiki does not have a ton of information, so if anyone has more questions about this I will do my best to answer.

       If you're wondering where the term V2K came from, it's the Army's abbreviation for said neuroweapon. This is their definition for the weapon- it was quickly removed from the Army's website but was archived.

NOTE: The sound modulation may be voice or audio subliminal messages. One application of V2K is use as an electronic scarecrow to frighten birds in the vicinity of airports.

       This weapon utilizes the Microwave Auditory Effect.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The existence of non-lethal weaponry that exploits the microwave auditory effect appears to have been classified "Secret NOFORN" in the USA from (at the latest) 1998, until the declassification on 6 December 2006 of "Bioeffects of Selected Non-Lethal Weaponry" in response to a FOIA request. Application of the microwave hearing technology could facilitate a private message transmission. Quoting from the above source, "Microwave hearing may be useful to provide a disruptive condition to a person not aware of the technology. Not only might it be disruptive to the sense of hearing, it could be psychologically devastating if one suddenly heard "voices within one's head".

       CIA veterans say that MKUltra never really ended, only that it changed acronyms and went further black (MKUltra Wiki, Marchetti, various scientists who have worked on said projects). MKUltra subprojects included the "remote electronic activation of the human organism." Navy documents as recent as 2006 discuss how non-consensual human experiments can be done which involve "severe physical and psychological intrusion including consciousness altering drugs and mind control."

       Russian president Putin says psychotronic weapons will be "more powerful than the atom bomb." Many credible witnesses, including a former major in Russia's foreign intelligence agency, have come forward to say they are currently being experimented on with weapons "many times more powerful than in The Matrix films." This particular individual was thrown to his death from a Scotland high rise after informing Western Intelligence Agencies about his plight.

       During the Cuban communist revolution, the CIA deliberately spread false rumors on the radio that Castro's government would take the Cubans' children away from them to make them work on collective farms and such. The idea was to destabilize the communist movement by breeding discontent and fear amongst the families of Cuba.  The dictator before Castro was a friend of the U.S., so we did not like this revolution. This was called Operation Peter Pan.  Thousands of Cuban children fled the country to the U.S. and were separated from their families as a part of this effort to destabilize the Cuban revolution.

       you are living in a time where the propaganda and mind control is so beyond out of control you don't even understand. no one does. they wanted us to know they were spying on us. they don't care. at this point they are now doing tests and projects on all of us. compiling dossiers on the people and stealing more and more "money", splitting off into factions for different causes and beliefs that go much beyond globalism and nationalism.

       I was really tempted to suggest that in fact you could argue that the tendency to reject conspiracy theories was evidence of maladjusted personality traits (arrogance, too much reliance on authority and guidance, naievity or overabundance of trust, for example) but I thought I'd better not as I couldn't spend the whole essay talking about conspiracies, I didn't want to push my luck, and, to be honest, it would have conflicted with the general tone of the essay and my personal beliefs.

       The go to essay on conspiracy theory for those academics who see  conspiracy theorism as a symptom of a psychological condition is

       Don't have the time for a long explanation but essentially having FPTP in areas means that the individual MP is directly linked to their constituency and can therefore represent the area on matters important to that area instead of just being a representative of their party elected on a national level.
      </p>

       The most convincing one is that proportional systems would just hand more power to parties and make individuals less influential.

       Right, McMartin pre-school. And still almost no one knows that tunnels were discovered by an archeology team, because the story got a single paragraph mention in a weekly paper and no mention at all in the L.A. Times, if I remember right. Alex Constantine covered this in "The History of CIA Covert Operations." McMartin was a pre-school apparently set up as a child ritual abuse operation, with dozens of satanic "teachers" involved, who led the children through tunnels to a military base, where they systematically raped them in bizarre black magic rituals, which the kids all testified uniformly about and drew very clear pictures of. Yet the media was able to convince the public that therapists had brainwashed the children, and the whole thing was fake.

       You are doing good work. Putting together all of the proven and documented major conspiracies in one place to go through will be immensely helpful to reveal the connections to the still theoretical conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, it's also a great way to suss out the well informed to have them point to the data that needs to disappear. In light of yesterday's Internet outage, it may be prudent to backup as much of this kind of information as possible offline. The cyberwars have been going on for quite a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's historically accurate to assume that information control efforts will be getting more desperate. He who controls history absolutely can dictate humanity's identity. Creating a new future by erasing or modifying the past based upon the whimsy of a leader's translation and predilections has been an increasingly irresistible temptation throughout history.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not sure that I can find great sources easily at the moment, and I can't be entirely certain that this is a confirmed conspiracy, but I recall a relevant story regarding Iraq. I remember reading about organized operators stealing ancient texts from museums at the same time as the American troops invaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       That I am not certain if the story is accurate is a bit of an indicator of the efficacy of disinformation campaigns in obfuscation and discrediting legitimate information. If you can't be sure that the story you are reading was not a product of disinformation, it's incredibly difficult to trust anything. Making people distrust their government is coup 101.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, if I didn't have proof in my daily life of government malfeasance, and all of my interactions with authority were largely positive and never were brutally unfair, I wouldn't be here writing about this. I wouldn't spend time researching this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy that triggered my interest was 9/11, because like the Kennedy assassination is imprinted in the memories of my parents, the towers falling down like they were made of sand is burned into my mind. Watching the fires burn for months underground further piqued my interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, we all want to find a truth that fits our understanding of the world. It is my opinion that the anecdotal evidence of increased knowledge or intelligence doesn't usually result in a happier life is not entirely inaccurate. If you are being lied to by the people who you are governed by, and if your thirst for knowledge is marked by frustrating resistance, being content is not an option.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignorance is only bliss to those who profit from it and feel no guilt. Everyone else is taught that they should feel guilty for seeking bliss, and be scared to challenge authority. Ignorance is a good key to servitude. But saying "servitude is bliss" isn't an acceptable notion, regardless of the similarities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Convince people that they serve only themselves, and then watch societies crumble. It's a "cleaner", more subtle form of war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit : I suppose that this post is more relevant to the psychological side of this. Hopefully it's still helpful. If it is useful to note, I get called crazy a lot. Less so lately, with a lot of the recent news, but I don't know if I can consider the statistical data as negligible at this point. An interesting thing about having a conspiracy theory confirmed after positing it to friends and family is their reactions. Some become alarmed that the other things that you have told them may be true. Some merely acquiesce only to the very narrowest interpretation of the nationally recognized narrative, and minimize the insights that you had on the subject. Take from that what you will regarding the psychology behind wishing to reveal conspiracies. I wonder though, if being correct isn't an attractive outcome, and being wrong damages your credibility, what drives us to take part in the endeavor?

       The link mentioned doesn't actually say this, the closest seems to be that after the war, the US "made direct cash payments to obtain their experimental results." Given the unit was no longer functioning, your link title is misleading. Also, hearsay quotes about 9/11 from an un-named source are a long way from
       <em>
        proving
       </em>
       it was a "false flag".

       Just because the US Goverment doesen't acknowledge offical that 9/11 was false flag operation, it doesen't mean this wasn't the case.

       All your link had to say was, "Pieczenik also asserted he was directly told by a prominent general that 9/11 was a stand down and a false flag operation". If that's the best and most "overwhelming proof" you can offer, I'm unimpressed.

       I clicked on the link where you said "Dr. Steve Pieczenik confirms that 9/11 was false flag" - another misleading title. Dr Pieczenik appears to have
       <em>
        no direct knowledge
       </em>
       of 9/11 being a false flag. So he can't confirm it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes: let's talk about Dr. Pieczenik, whose
       <em>
        own website
       </em>
       calls him "An expert in psychological warfare, political psychology, regime change, intelligence, counterintelligence and covert operations" who "continues to volunteer his time and expertise as a consultant to the Department of Defense."

       If someone is trying to get into your house, you don't sit around, agonizing over their reasons for it, you deal with it. Same here: why Pieczenik is spinning his yarns doesn't matter. You'd be foolish to believe him, regardless of his motives.

       It's possible to entertain an idea without

       There may be "value to be gleaned" from it, to be sure, but that would require information regarding their agenda that is hard to obtain and verify.

      <p>
       What I'd say is equally foolish is
       <em>
        accepting

       someone's testimony, when their background gives enormous reason for skepticism and doubt they're telling the truth. We're not dealing with "preconceived notions", these are FACTS.

       The Federal Reserve has "leased" out government gold reserves to "bullion banks" (JPMorgan, Goldman, et al). Banks short it, then sell it, depressing the price.
      </p>
      <p>
       The leasing of gold was admitted by Alan Greenspan in Congressional testimony:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nor can private counterparties restrict supplies of gold, another commodity whose derivatives are often traded over-the-counter,
        <em>
         where central banks stand ready to lease gold in increasing quantities should the price rise.
        </em>

       The theft of sovereign gold likely extends to foreign holdings. For example, Germany supposedly has 674 tons of gold at the NY Fed (result of a deal reached after WW2). Germany is not allowed to audit or view it.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Politicians from Germany have come over and asked to see the gold. They have either been denied or shown a small portion of their supposed holdings, which don't match the bars that were there originally.

       That second one doesn't make sense, because to be SOCOM units were already in Iran running operations the day of the embassy storming, if that's what you're referring to. If Ragen's administration didn't want the hostages freed, why would they have immediately turned to a military response, which is normally the last resort.

       There are many things that you can deduce using simple facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance:  Just because it is an unpleasant thought does not mean that humans farming other humans does not exist.  It has existed throughout recordable history.  What makes you think that humans farming humans has gone away?  We are, after all, the most profitable livestock you could possibly own.

       Well... that's debatable. Sure, he was a republican, but he was also an accomplished diplomat trying to get back into favour. He did publish satire, sure, but it's also still likely that
       <em>
        The Prince
       </em>
       was a job application.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not he was writing satire with that book, he still documents the attitude towards power of the time, and he's still been read 100% seriously by countless politicians since, influencing their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think he's just a well-intentioned bloke who realises that uniting Italy and bringing peace to the land isn't going to be all hugs and smiles and rainbows. Brutal times breed brutal men and all that.

       The CIA has been caught smuggling heroin and cocaine many times over history. They continue to do this while waging a "War on Drugs" at home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a 9-minute video portraying several whistleblowers about high-level drug corruption:
       <a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LYOVQezWaCY">
        http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LYOVQezWaCY
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another whistleblower who's not mentioned in the video is Michael Levine. He was a DEA agent in Bolivia who started going after some real high-level cocaine traffickers, and when he did his DEA bosses pulled him off of the case and launched an investigation against him instead. He wrote a book called "The Big White Lie." There have been several other excellent books on this subject, notably Gary Webb's "Dark Alliance," about the CIA working with the Contras and running crack into L.A., and Yale Professor Alfred McCoy's book "The Politics of Heroin."
      </p>
      <p>
       Drug money is untaxed and untraceable, so it's easy for the CIA and other intelligence agencies to use it to fund their "black operations."

       I'm new to Reddit, so I'm not sure how to link anything, but I do know of one conspiracy that you might be interested in: The Death of Meriwether Lewis.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a nutshell, President Andrew Jackson (Trail of Tears, Battle of New Orleans General, lost presidency due to a corrupt bargain) sent Lewis and Clark to not only survey the land, but to make sure that No One Else had been there before. Lewis found several indications that (Like we now know) peoples of Norwegian (?) descent had already been to Louisiana and the rest, including the physical appearance of the Natives, the similarities between their boats and the Norwegian (?) boats and a specific artifact... The something Stone....
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm really sorry that my memory's failing me so badly right now. &gt;.&lt;
      </p>
      <p>
       Any rate, Lewis chronicled all of this in his journal and after leaving the expedition and arriving at an inn, he was found dead due to an apparent suicide by the innkeeper. Here are the issues - He had two gun-shot wounds, one in the abdomen and the other in the temple; specific pages had been ripped out of his journal; the innkeeper never heard any shots fired, nor saw anyone else enter the inn; and Lewis's Master Apron (High-ranking Freemason) had blood spatter on it, but the DNA did Not Match that of the Lewis bloodline- In fact, it was of Multiple people, and not one of which was Lewis' blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully someone else can help fix this up and fill in the blanks that I'm leaving out.

         Calling someone a conspiracy theorist to insinuate that something they claim is less likely to be correct is a logical fallacy. I explain this here:

         Notice the first link. Most people appreciate that link compared to wikipedia or some other source on the same topic. I find that people respond much better when you clearly know how to dig up decent sources. Some of the other links I was lazy about in this instance, but you get my point. Good luck with your professor.

       Not a surprise. When I see a post of mine that usually get's heavily upvoted suddenly hit with a bunch of downvotes and a troll from r/conspiratard, I check for their link and obviously found it. There's two of them actually. One is towards the bottom of their front page.

       Edit: I just got banned from there for being a "pathetic whining troll," even though I post content there every day. My only issue was the vote brigading, so apparently calling out brigading is "whining." Fuck em.

       No shit. Nowhere in there did I claim this. Read it a few times. Maybe you'll get it eventually.

      <p>
       No I didn't. The list is historical examples of chemtrails. This is meant to keep discussions about chemtrails more accurate. Nobody can claim that the government would never do such a thing, since historically, it is common. The
       <em>
        theory
       </em>
       of chemtrails is that the government simply won't declassify the types of spraying they are doing (obviously!) and we won't hear about anything until some of it is partially declassified in 40 years. The very last link is evidence that the testing has been going on at least until 1994. There is no reason to assume they stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 theories:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) chemical/biological testing
      </p>
      <p>
       2) weather modification.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both are facts. Some people think one or both are still happening today (the theory). This is reasonable. What brings you to this sub anyways?

        There are two fundamental differences between the examples you gave and the common chemtrail theory today, at least as I understand it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Doesn't really matter. There's several theories, not one. The word "chemtrail" is just all-encompassing.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The first is that the current theory suggests that the function of chemtrails is sinister in nature, like mind control or population control, while the examples you give are not sinister. Most of them involved testing the vulnerability against biological or chemical attacks by the soviets, using harmless, or at least thought to be harmless at the time, chemicals and bacteria. So while it was certainly unethical, it did not serve a sinister purpose. The exception is the weather modification in Laos, which was sinister, although it was used against an enemy during war, and so not consistent with the current theory that the government is attacking it's own people.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Many people believe hurricanes and storms can be steered or modified in other ways. Some of my links are on this type of "chemtrail." Also, whether the chemtrail sprayer personally believes the spray is harmful or not is a red herring. Some people believe the chemtrails are purposefully harmful, some don't. Some people think the chemtrails have negative side effects, such as barium and aluminum residues in soil.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The second difference is that the current chemtrail theory suggests that commercial planes are routinely spraying these chemicals, while every example you gave involves only military aircraft. In my opinion this is what really discredits the theory because proponents often assert that it is impossible for contrails to linger for more than a very brief time as evidence that chemtrails exist.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not really sure what you're talking about. Maybe you have a misguided interpretation of current chemtrail theories or you simply concentrate on only the people with mental disorders who upload youtube videos about contrails. Additionally, I don't see why the military couldn't retrofit commercial planes or disguise military planes as commercial.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This means that thousands of commercial planes daily are secretly spraying chemicals, which is pretty ridiculous considering the complete lack of evidence for this
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Strawman argument. Not every chemtrail theorist believes this. Although, there was a thread about this a few days ago.

      <p>
       This is the most pathetic of all arguments against conspiracy theories. I'm surprised it is still thrown around in 2014. Many massive conspiracies have been exposed in the past where thousands of people would have to keep the conspiracy secret. For example: MKULTRA and related programs. It involved thousands of people, many high level government officials, scientists, psychiatrists-
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Ewen_Cameron">
        including the president of the APA
       </a>
       "It was during this era that Cameron became known worldwide as the first chairman of the World Psychiatric Association as well as president of the American and Canadian psychiatric associations. Cameron had also been a member of the Nuremberg medical tribunal in 1946–1947."

       ridiculous and has been discredited entirely many times, including in my last post. That argument holds no water at all, and is therefore pathetic. I additionally gave a link that is apparently someone "leaking" the information. This would be expected in a situation like this, although I haven't really looked into that specific case. I provided it to counter your claim that the information would eventually leak out somehow, which apparently it has.

      <p>
       I would have to see pictures and video comparing proposed evidence of geoengineering chemtrails in both countries. Perhaps they differ. Everyone agrees that contrails exist. You can't claim that your country has contrails that look similar to the contrails here and then conclude that both are contrails 100 percent of the time.

       secrecy among all those responsible for the allegedly daily, mass spraying of the nation over decades. In reality, not a single credible pilot, ground staff or administrator has come forward.

       What are you talking about? The Manhattan project is a good example of compartmentalization. And we are talking pre-Operation Mockingbird, so presumably the media would report leaks. That's getting very off topic though. Let's stick to the topic. If you're unsatisfied, MKULTRA. That's all you need to discredit the theory that conspiracies are limited in size. Many other examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can massive conspiracies happen? Yes or no? I even provided multiple examples of millions of people being sprayed and not hearing anything about it for decades.

       [Edit] And, indeed, has claimed elsewhere, "The difference between contrails and chemtrails is easy.

This is so bogus and basic, I can't take anything else she says seriously.

       Just because it's a conspiracy forum, doesn't mean we have to accept at face value everything people say. If you don't treat conspiracy sources with the same degree of skepticism as you treat government ones, you're part of the problem, not part of the solution.

       I think you're being generous here.

      <p>
       You can turn the question around and point out those officially espoused conspiracy theories (or lone nut theories) that people readily believe in on the basis of authority alone.

       What "officially espoused conspiracy theories" and who is the "authority" you're referring to?  Because that sounds like a bunch of nonsense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I would also add that his comment about there being more evidence for some conspiracies than there is for much of psychology was pretty spot on, whether he was being facetious or not.

       How far back do you want to go?  Historically there are plenty of proven conspiracies.   You see we have been conditioned these days to treat the phrase "Conspiracy Theory" as one word.   People often forget it is to different words.  There are conspiracies.   Then there are speculations about possible conspiracies.   Those are the theories.   Just like any theory the evidence needs to be weighed and at some point probabilities come into play.   If the probabilities supporting a theory are stronger for one theory than an another then that theory tends to be the one that is considered the actual conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me give you some old time conspiracies.   We the people of the United States did conspire against the nation of England for our freedom.   I believe this is proven.   That was in fact a conspiracy.   When you get down to it ANY revolution in history was a conspiracy.   A group of people conspired towards a specific goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's take a modern Conspiracy Theory:
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you realize that the official story is also a conspiracy theory?   It is based upon speculation, and probabilities.   There are many conspiracy theories around 9/11.   It is important to realize that in fact even the official story is only a "theory".
      </p>
      <p>
       It is interesting and worth noting psychologically that most people will not ask questions if the theory comes from an official source.   In fact they will strongly defend it and might even ignore anything that contradicts that theory.   That is until something causes a paradigm shift.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I thought I'd point out that historically there are a plethora of proven conspiracies.   At some point in the revolution someone may have said "I think person X may be a rebel".   That was a theory at the time.   Later on that would cease to be a theory if it was proven whether person X was indeed a rebel, or not a rebel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy Theories are healthy and normal.   We have just been conditioned to react negatively to people that express them.   This is even when we use them ourselves in many ways throughout or life.   Anytime we speculate that a group of people may be working together in secrecy towards a goal that is a Conspiracy Theory.   If you think your spouse and friends are planning a surprise birthday for you, then you have a theory that they are conspiring towards such an event.   It will either be proven, or disproven when your birthday comes.
      </p>

       the disparities between the official story and some fine reporting are very much alike the huge discrepancies in the official 9/11 fairy tale and the research done since and before.

       one book should be mentioned in particular: Doemvlucht by Pierre Heijboer (not available in english i'm sorry to say).

       I'm completely convinced Iraq was not for oil, but for Israel. Those in power massively benefited from 9/11. And considering they all talked about their plans before 9/11, and said on paper they needed an event like 9/11 to implement to plans, it makes it all very fishy, and raises the question who was really behind it. Also makes the situation in Syria sketchy.

       I'm not sure if this qualifies as a conspiracy or not, but here it is.
Gmail sells your information for sure.  I say it because it happened to me.
Before I got my job, I was applying to many places.  I also had a linkedin account, but I was very minimalistic on it as I didn't want to share much information.  Anyway, I get this phone interview with this guy from the east coast, and we communicate through gmail.  The interview comes to pass (I didn't get that job), and one day I log into my linked in and on the side links, it asks me if I knew that particular guy.  I found it odd, but thought nothing of it.
Until I got my recent job at xyz.  I never updated my linkedin, and I log into linkedin, and they have already setup that I work at xyz.  I was like, wtf.  So that's the story of me deleting my linkedin.
Whether gmail sells to linkedin directly I do not know, but I'm now sure Gmail sells your information.  Be careful what you put out there.

       The whole idea of using "conspiracy theory" to discredit ideas is ludicrous. Look up the definition of conspiracy. People conspire, happens all the time. So how about discussing the relative merits of any one theory instead of using a meaningless pejorative.

       I'm worried it'll just be disappointing now. The section on conspiracy theories in particular is only a 1000 word section of the essay (part of a wider section about use of psychology for social control) and it doesn't go massively into depths about the conspiracies themselves (what with the focus being on the psychology and all). Still, once I can I think I will.

       Domestic spying, plenty of leaked classified documents to back those up. When it comes to the military-industrial complex, please note that Government admits the problems in the middle east are being driven by the fall of Secular leaders. Also note that the United States is systematically destabilizing and overthrowing Secular dictators, replacing them with Islamists.

       The very fact that a subreddit is dedicated to the harmful interruption of information and debate on this sub is a conspiracy in and of itself. Yes, conspiratards have created their own meta conspiracy based solely on the definition of a conspiracy alone. They berate, troll, and otherwise harm the ideas being posted here, whether truthful or complete and utter craziness; their incessant use of condescending terms like 'son' and 'gubmint' or my favorite: 'joos' shows they have absolutely nothing but contempt for anyone who can entertain a thought without accepting it as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The are the epitome of the COINTELPRO attitude. Its just wholly ironic that its a conspiracy unto itself.

       Check out Operation Northwoods, project Paperclip, the Tuskegee experiment, the house committee on assassination -the second congressional group who looked at the Kennedy assassination.  This would be really interesting for your paper as there were two separately appointed committees from the elected government who had different findings, the other being the Warren Commission, of course. There was also a plan to overthrow Roosevelt.  Just some ideas.

       The Benghazi cover up was a conspiracy between the news media and the white house to circumvent people from finding out the truth about the attack on our embassy; later revealed that it was a preventable, coordinated attack by armed terrorists who shelled the embassy, stormed it and murdered American employees and a US ambassador...Yet it was blamed on a spontaneous protest by civilians supposedly marching against an anti-Muhamed youtube documentary created by an Egyptian-American low budget film maker.

       The Iraq war was in the works long before 2003.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Iraq War was planned by Israeli interests and Neocons in the US government because Israel didn't like the fact the US didn't take out Saddam Hussein in Desert Storm. This timeline which is hosted on the George Washington University education portal and the National Security Archives clearly shows
       <em>
        who exactly
       </em>
       wanted the Iraq War, it being planned way in advance and people going against various administrations and designing their own plans.

       Still think this is bullshit? Here's a retired general (Gen. Wesley Clarke) naming the people involved and calling it a foreign policy coup in 2001 when all of them were elected. He then goes on to name several other countries that have been, are being or will be knocked out in the future including Libya, Syria, Lebanon, Somalia, Sudan and Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the video was made and time stamped in 2007, it pre-dates any conflicts of the countries being mentioned that would be (and have been) targets for this agenda.

       Then you have the IASPS think tank paper wrote in 1996 outlining how Israel needed to take out Saddam and how to gain American support for their security ambitions. This is the source document.

        Wikipedia link - Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm (commonly known as the "Clean Break" report) is a policy document that was prepared in 1996 by a study group led by Richard Perle for Benjamin Netanyahu, the then Prime Minister of Israel.The report explained a new approach to solving Israel's security problems in the Middle East with an emphasis on "Western values".
        <strong>
         It has since been criticized for advocating an aggressive new policy including the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, and the containment of Syria by engaging in proxy warfare and highlighting their possession of "weapons of mass destruction".
        </strong>
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then a year later, a large number of Israeli supporters and Neocons in the US wrote the PNAC document with the same idea to remove Saddam Hussein as a priority and then those people got elected into every single position that would effect foreign policy. It also mentioned a catalysing event needed to gain public outrage, like a New Pearl Harbour or surprise attack that was fabricated (to an extent).

The PNAC's stated goal is "to promote American global leadership."Fundamental to the PNAC were the view that "American leadership is both good for America and good for the world" and support for "a Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity."
        <strong>
         With its members in numerous key administrative positions, the PNAC exerted influence on high-level U.S. government officials in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush and affected the Bush Administration's development of military and foreign policies, especially involving national security and the Iraq War.

       It PROVES, using docs the NRC was forced to release via FOIA (the FOIA request sent PERSONALLY by this brave investigative journalist), that Reactor 3 had an open-air meltdown, not a "hydrogen explosion" like TEPCO claimed. It also proves that the NRC position was to lie, obfuscate, and mislead the public for as long as possible.

       I hate to comment with something so negative for a reponse but here it is:
      </p>
      <p>
       One cannot, as an individual
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       a conspiracy, in your use of the word. In the proper use of the term have, you would need something an individual may logically possess such as empirical evidence say a photograph or sensitive document.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your misuse of grammar in the title of your post offends and confuses me, and likely the  other readers of this post as well.

       While I do admire your initiative, I still think it is going to fail. What saddens me these days is that people of particularly younger generation do not have systematic thinking. They are caught up in single events trying to prove or disprove them. As someone said(don't remember who exactly) People can be easily confused by events, however if people understand the trends its much harder to confuse them. If you will nit-pick certain events from history I guarantee you, despite all of the proof you present people with mind set will not believe you. Instead of looking for proof of a single event, in your place I would take a systematic approach. Start from analysis of the system as a whole from a historical perspective. Analyze the genesis of Geopolitical constructs(Particularly North-European, would suggest timeline from around IX century), the way they emerged, what tactics they used, what problems they had to solve, what institutions they have formed in order to resolve those prbblems. As system theory states the genesis of the system determines its function. Why I am suggesting this is because system in question has been constructed over centuries, and the rules of Geopolitics  have not changed since(they only got more sophisticated). This means if you do not understand how the system has emerged/was constructed, understanding its function in modern world is a futile task at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I would suggest an analysis of emergence of modern cap system(all the way back from Venetian traders). The way the capitalist system is taught today is a two dimensional "capital - state" construct. Marx at the end of his life said that if he had to rewrite "Capital", he would start from the State. However that would not help describe the cap system. Capital transcends the traditional nation state architecture. Since capital functions across state borders it has to adjust itself to state laws or break them. To do that you have to have a system of institutes that solve these type of problems. Among other issues different types of capital have to function within one system. Hence to resolve these problems you have to have supranational institutes. They are not an anomaly of the system, they are an integral part of it. Without them the cap system would not function. So this adds a third dimension to the cap system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now one and last suggestions. While writing your essay(s) on this topic stray away from sources that  use emotional rhetoric. Those are likely placed there to discredit any meaningful inquiry. As famous Anglo-Saxon expression goes: "It's just business, nothing personal".
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. Sorry for the rant.

       If you like Machiavelli so much, have you ever looked into the Tupac conspiracy? His death certificate is accessible and it says the wrong SSN wrong weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know before he "died" he released an album called The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory" under the new rapper name of Makaveli? He also has a song called Art of war with the outlawz (his rap group) I believe he fled to Cuba and faked his death.

       You know.. US Army PSYOP developed some rocks, like they're actually rocks, that block cell phone signals. The US Army Intelligence Support Activity (formerly) had a way of turning on people's cell phones, copying those phones onto a blank clone, then using the cloned phone to look through call logs, contacts, current location, and even listen in on calls. There is a massive, secret complex underneath Dugway Proving Grounds that no one is supposed to even mention. None of these things, really, are supposed to be mentioned. They're not public information so far as I know, and last I heard I'm not supposed to talk about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean I'm going to get black bagged tomorrow and vanish off the face of the planet. I've even tried to log into the Army's Secret Internet Protocol Network before, albeit on accident, and no one even talked to me about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you think you know something that you're not supposed to talk about, and you feel like it could be dangerous.. by all means, don't share it... But I'm also going to say, don't worry about it either. The government isn't going to just make you disappear. It doesn't actually work like that.

       I know your just a lowly student and just trying to understand, but what an absurd question.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is there are thousands if not hundreds of thousands languishing in jail right now because they committed 'conspiracy'. Every time a police office follows a lead, he is engaging in conspiracy theory. The fact that he has a badge makes it ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real conspiracy, is that the CIA invented conspiracies.

       If you want an example, then the Boston Marathon Bombings are beyond doubt a conspiracy insofar that the official narrative is almost completely fabricated. If you have spent as many hours as I have looking at the footage and reading about the event, you have to conclude that you were lied to. That doesn't mean I know what actually happened or, crucially, why - only that the official story is a tissue of lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's not what you want is it? You want a conspiracy which is OFFICIALLY proven, and therein lies the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       The events that make up history happen once, and unlike a scientific experiment, cannot be replicated. What remains from a "conspiracy event" is evidence and first hand testimony, but OUR access to this is controlled by governments, the courts, the media and corporations.

       What they allow US to see is sometimes heavily expurgated, sometimes completely fabricated. It is they who get to determine what is "proven" and what is a mere conspiracy, and the majority of people seem happy to believe what they are told.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why you have to use your judgment about which conspiracies are proven, by considering the weight of evidence from all sources. Don't let others tell you which conspiracies are true and which are not.

       This is true (well, I'm not sure about Boston but the rest is very true), but that isn't the issue here. The fact that they are officially proven just backs up my point to my lecturer: this stuff happens, it's not all the imaginings of "nutjobs". I don't need to prove all conspiracy theories, just enough to show that that title itself is not worthy of use in a scientific discipline.

       Did you know that for many decades, the Mafia was a "conspiracy theory". The FBI (under Hoover) and the media managed to persuade ordinary Americans that the Mafia was just a figment of the popular imagination.

       I completely agree that the Sandy Hook event was not what the authorities and the media have made it out to be - the official story is self-contradictory, and many of the individuals involved (eg the laughing parents of murdered children) behaved in ways which should alert any intelligent person that they are not genuine.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, can you honestly say you know who carried out Sandy Hook and why they did it? No, we are just speculating.

       It's not a mystery. It's called making a judgment based on the weight of evidence.

      <p>
       There is very little about history which is provable beyond doubt. We have to rely on "authorities" to tell us what happened. Not surprisingly, there are many instances where the evidence that could prove something is deliberately withheld or destroyed.

       What's at issue in my essay is why people class all such theories as "conspiracy theories" and why are studies done on all of them like they're a defined block, looking for psychological reasons within individuals for belief in this nebulous concept of "conspiracy theories" instead of looking separately at paranoid delusions, recognizing social and historical reasons for belief in (I would argue in the sorts of cases I'm looking for that it's
       <em>
        knowledge of
       </em>
       ) conspiracy and leaving the issue to historians.
