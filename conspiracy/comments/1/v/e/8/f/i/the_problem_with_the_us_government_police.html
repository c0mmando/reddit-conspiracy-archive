    <div class="md"><p>So there are the top ranks, who are just chosen to be corrupt and in on the game.</p>

<p>The rank and file folks (e.g., police) see themselves as protectors of the status quo.  They don&#39;t see the status quo as &quot;the empire of the parasites-that-be&quot;, but instead see it as preserving their tribe, their race, their &#39;Murica, their freedoms, or just their plain old goddamn ORDER.</p>

<p>Voices like Rush Limbaugh and other right-wing talkers, combined with pulpits and churches across America, drill into people&#39;s heads that the social order is GOD&#39;s social order, and it&#39;s not for you to ask questions about how that all works.  The Democrats play their court jester role by shitting on reform-minded Americans... the media present the Democrats as reformers, and since the Democrats suck and sell us out, we all learn to hate the reformers.</p>

<p>This is one reason why Snowden was such a threat... authoritarian governments depend on a huge array of low-level operatives (analysts, police, etc.) to cover up their secrets and abuses.</p>

<p>Snowden told government employees to grow a conscience and reveal some of the shit they see.  It&#39;s a very fragile system.  (Look at how the Democrats had to censor the discussion boards to beat down the reality that Obama is Bush III.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a new law made everyday. How long will it be until one puts us all in jail? The way this world is headed, it will not be long until every normal person is just born in jail. Think of North Korea. I believe the only reason North Korea has never been liberated, is because this is the eventual model the whole world will be ran on. Rich people are good, normal people live in prisons and are just born criminals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s impossible to know exactly why &quot;they&quot; are waging what is essentially a war against people, not just american people.  the divide between those who have and have not is wide and so is the divide between those who know and those who do not.  orwell had an interesting theory about fear and power.  power is essentially a solution to fear, a self-preservation instinct; the problem is that the solution doesn&#39;t work psychologically, since the powerful still fear losing their power.  this is all the more so when that power is through corruption.  the only way to know you still have power is to apply that power to making people suffer, since in the end you won&#39;t know you really have power to control if you are telling people to do what they would do naturally.  this is why power eventually turns cruel and supposedly the cause of injustice in a world were technology could provide plenty for all.</p>
