Which means that they shouldn&#39;t be allowed to have a gun or be near combat afterword.  I would like to discuss the issue and hear people&#39;s comments because I think the idea is ridiculous.  Yes, if someone is incapable enough and a danger or threat to others, this is usually seen right away and dealt with in the military, as well as at home.  I don&#39;t like the government <strong>not</strong> taking care of our Veterans and then try to label them a threat or a danger without giving them the proper disability pay and healthcare.  This idea the President is trying to pass, pretty much means as soon as you show battle fatigue or any other stress, that you should be sent home.  You can&#39;t have both this law on the books and force active military to repeatedly engage in combat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to look up the regulation right now, but you&#39;re mistaken.</p>

<p>Its not just the PTSD, its being admitted to an in-patient facility. After evaluation by the doctors, they decide whether or not to keep you for a while, or manage you through outpatient. If they release you back to your unit, you&#39;ll be under more scrutiny and your leadership will be extra vigilant. Mess up too close to your original incident, and its considered a release and the doctors will have you in in-patient.</p>

<p>Some people get better, some people continue to have issues. Those that get better just have to deal with the legal ramifications of saying &quot;I&#39;ve been admitted to an inpatient medical facility&quot; on some forms (conceal carry permits for example). Which is much different than saying I&quot;ve been diagnosed with X, Y, or Z. Those that continue to have issues will be kicked out of the military for a mental defect under AR 635-200 CH 5-17.</p>

<p>Not everyone that has seen combat is incompacitated by PTSD. I&#39;m one of them. Memories fade, reactions dwindle. One of PTSD&#39;s main discriminators is the fact that you have to not be able to handle it, that it impacts your life and causes disruption.</p>

<p>Best analogy about PTSD and combat is this: Combat is a crucible, the fires will change you. Before you go in, you&#39;re clay. Afterward you&#39;re pottery. 
Sometimes the fire is too hot and it hurts the product on the way out. Sometimes the clay wasn&#39;t formed right and shouldn&#39;t have been put in the fire to begin with.</p>

<p>Not everyone comes out of that fire cracking up, about to fall to pieces. And not every cup that has a chip in it is useless. Having the clay wrong or fire being too hot isn&#39;t a personal issue... Its either bad luck in combat, or bad luck with upbringing/training. My buddy went on all the same patrols I did. I excelled in the army, he couldn&#39;t handle it and got 2x DUIs trying to drown the pain.</p>

<p>But the way that the laws and rules about PTSD are written is that going for out-patient treatment can be as bad as inpatient and the general consensus for people looking at PTSD veterans is that we are all vases that have been smashed on the ground, not a simple chip or crack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly the way I understand it should be.  From what I understood, and I hope I am completely wrong, it was an all encompassing decision to prevent anyone, even if they do recover, from owning a gun.  I hope I am wrong, but if I am not, your explanation is exactly what I hope is how it is handled.  Somehow the way the government works, I have doubts it will be done so professionally.  Hey good luck to you by the way, and take care of yourself.  That was a very great explanation and I appreciate it, Semper Fi.  (I actually have a problem with hearing that this may be happening simply because as you have pointed out, I have friends who shouldn&#39;t own guns who are badly suffering from the effects of PTSD, and purposely were not diagnosed for whatever reasons.  The Corps is known to frown upon such things.  There was a class action lawsuit that started against the military because in September 2008, they came out publicly for whatever reason, and admitted they were purposely underrating all their Veterans, they admitted this again only a few months ago.  The investigation that followed said that every Armed Force except the Air Force were underrating their Veterans.  I still remember the outrage about the Marine who had a daughter and wife, was medically discharged but given 0%, after a mortar landed next to his head, he had so much brain damage he was reading at a sixth grade level.  After the news went National he resubmitted and was given 0% again, and then someone stepped in and I believe he was given 100%.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re throwing PTSD around like people throw around OCD when really they just like their house clean and they&#39;re organized. PTSD isn&#39;t some battle-fatigued self-diagnosis. Saying you feel sad on a form isn&#39;t what this is about. It&#39;s about being committed so to speak at an in-patient facility for treatment. </p>

<p>That seems reasonable. If you have to be hospitalized because of depression, you probably shouldn&#39;t have a gun either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct about PTSD and being thrown around and claimed by too many people. It&#39;s just like people that are naturally melancholy vs people that have had a bad week vs someone  that has full blown depression.</p>

<p>I agree with your thought about hospitalization for depression and guns, but I believe that there should be a time limit attached to it, like 10-20 years. Likelihood of going off meds and killing yourself after a decade of good behavior and habits is fairly low, so why should you be denied your second amendment rights after displaying good mental health habits? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it shouldn&#39;t be a straight up ban for any and all people, you should be able to get your guns back eventually. I honestly don&#39;t know where the lines should be drawn, it&#39;s very delicate. </p>

<p>Maybe checking yourself in versus being forced to check in could be a big determinant. </p>

<p>But is the issue not wanting those with PTSD or depression, etc. to own firearms because they might hurt themselves or because they might hurt others? The gun ban on those people probably won&#39;t stop them from killing themselves if that&#39;s how badly they mentally feel and it only affects those who have gotten/currently getting treatment. I would imagine a large portion of PTSD related suicides are untreated but I don&#39;t really know. </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t know. Who is it really helping? Is it even helping anybody? What percentage of people suffering from PTSD get themselves into dangerous, unwarranted shooting incidents? </p>

<p>If you&#39;re getting treatment, couldn&#39;t your doctor say &quot;hey you&#39;re suffering from PTSD and I&#39;m worried about your safety and others&quot; and you could voluntarily have you guns kept in a safe place. </p>

<h1>3 is the one I want you to read as a minimum... It kinda refutes your &quot;won&#39;t stop them from killing yourself&quot; argument.</h1>

<p>Mental Health by its nature isn&#39;t clear cut, and laws by their definition have to be. There will be a grey area that is labeled &quot;Black&quot; and outlawed, and then sucessively lighter areas will be encroached upon when people fuck up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I don&#39;t think so, I know many people that have never been committed anywhere that were given diagnosis of PTSD.  PTSD is a far stretching thing.  I think you and the people making this law are confusing extreme cases of PTSD and mild cases where people aren&#39;t threats to the public.

    <div class="md"><p>Having someone tell me they &quot;were ordered to kill a child&quot; makes my BS flag wave real hard.</p>

<p>Even if there was a compelling reason to kill a child (like child running towards patrol with grenade pulled) it would be a media firestorm no matter how and why it happened.</p>

<p>Maybe he killed a teenager, and not a child... I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>But you say he has PTSD... Maybe he has other problems and is using the fact that he deployed as a nice smoke screen to his real problems. Its more socially acceptable to say &quot;I&#39;m a vet with PTSD&quot; than to come out and say &quot;I&#39;ve got Borderline Personality Disorder&quot;, or &quot;Depression with anxiety issues&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t know why you would assume all the above, but I will elaborate, as I am on a computer now, and not just my cell. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember how the military came up, but as someone with PTSD, I saw him physically and emotionally disassociate. We had been talking about basic training, which led to his frustration that &quot;veterans&quot; were claiming the &quot;combat stress&quot; of Basic and getting PTSD/disability payment, despite never being deployed. He called it absolute bullshit. </p>

<p>I was telling him about the first weekend I moved to my new apartment, the kid next door, who&#39;s in the National Guard, had held his ex-girlfriend captive in his place, assaulting her, then screaming he would &quot;be dead by morning&quot; as she made her escape. I said something like, if he&#39;s flipping out now, what&#39;s the dude going to be like in a combat zone?</p>

<p>This cable installer and I had been shooting the shit for a good 20-30 minutes about semi-pro football in the area, the future of cable and telecom companies, we joked about the stupidity of facebook.  </p>

<p>When he started to tell this story, I saw the lights go out of his eyes and he even had bumped into some of my boxes while telling the story, and looked at them after they fell, like in utter confusion. He was in the midst of what I call &quot;the fog&quot;, when you are physically still aware of your surroundings, but not really in line with cause &amp; effect. He never said if it was Iraq or Afghanistan (he&#39;d been at his cable job for 4 years, I believe), but he said he had befriended a local family. He had given them $10 twice before (which he said was like a month&#39;s worth of food) and had even been in the family home, he mentioned home cooking. </p>

<p>This is hard for me to type, simply because I watched an average American man, unable to STOP telling his story. He said he was at a checkpoint, that the restrictions had just been tightened and the two boys were waving and approaching him. He screamed a warning to them, but he had &quot;someone screaming in his ear&quot;, to shoot them if they crossed beyond a certain point without compliance. That he morally knew these kids were no threat, but &quot;orders were orders&quot;. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think he was bullshitting. Sure, the dude had some opinions about father&#39;s rights in MA, about Comcast, etc. But when he told this story, there was no dramatic context, no signs of mental illness (I&#39;ve spent a LOT of time with the mentally ill and addicted, he said that he doesn&#39;t even really enjoy alcohol or drugs and finds it frustrating that his peer group thinks it&#39;s the only way to have fun...). </p>

<p>As for your assertion that dead children would incite a media storm, I encourage you to try a Google news alert, you&#39;d be surprised at number of daily bombings overseas that NEVER make it to the MSM. There&#39;s kids dying both here and overseas EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY and NO ONE GIVES A SHIT. (I mean, how many here will troll all of YouTube for evidence of the Illuminati, but have no idea where our military is actively engaged? People don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass, until it inconveniences them.) </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe he was lying. He has a home, a steady job, his kid on the weekends. His PTSD was apparent, but not debilitating. I don&#39;t know why he felt &quot;safe&quot; enough to share, or maybe it was the PTSD, the inability to turn off that switch that says &quot;This isn&#39;t polite conversation&quot;.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always considered getting a Masters in Social Work, but fear I would turn into one of those heartless counselors that looks at clients as numbers and not people. Bureaucracy and the clinical setting are not my cup of tea. It&#39;s also why despite EVERY generation of my family serving since before America was a country (My family came over in 1637, PERCUSSUS RESURGO!!!), I know I could NEVER comply in the military, I&#39;m too damn bullheaded.</p>

<p>He chooses not to shoot or own guns. He chooses not to play triggering video games. He chooses not to drink or drug. To me, that says he&#39;s making healthy decisions and isn&#39;t &quot;bound by a disorder&quot;. Again, I dont&#39; know why you assumed the points above, but maybe I&#39;ve explained myself better now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s bullcrap.  I don&#39;t know anyone that has been in direct combat that hasn&#39;t had signs of PTSD, no one.  I have been in combat, and I have spoken with many others.  As they always say, you are a changed person after combat, that right there, is one of the defining factors of PTSD.  If someone makes a broad statement that anyone with PTSD can not own guns, then this needs to happen.  I don&#39;t think you understand what PTSD is.  Someone in the United States who isn&#39;t in any combat or gun related situation, who is just working a stressful job can have PTSD.  It is a very broad term that covers many areas of psychology.  The question isn&#39;t whether someone has experienced PTSD in these situations, but to what degree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Veterans with PTSD aren&#39;t allowed to have guns maybe they and their hometown friends can go on a hunting-fishing trip together; that way the &#39;responsible&#39; people who aren&#39;t veterans with PTSD can say that they lost the gun in a boating accident. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the Army EVERY single time you go to the clinic for any medical issue, sore back, teeth cleaning, scraped knee, ANYTHING... you fill out a form that asks you all kinds of questions about how you are feeling and if you feel depressed or anything like that. Everyone in the Army is either depressed to some degree, or a psychopath. So the goal is to have it on record that any veteran, regardless of experience, has some type of history of &quot;mental health issues&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well for one thing they have a very direct interest in limiting the number of disability claims they have to pay veterans.  if losing one of the passions of your life (guns, normally) you might think twice  before trying to get that check.  of course it&#39;s all quit absurd because soldiers are sort of crazy as a rule and we give them the most powerful weapons...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the PTSD, it&#39;s the treatment for PTSD. Obama knows it, everyone in the administration knows it, but no one will admit it due to liability issues. And it&#39;s bullshit, because those who have the PTSD took the treatment for PTSD that was provided for them, and it&#39;s not their fault. You want a shorthand anecdote that tells a big part of the whole story--read about Eddie Routh and Chris Kyle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but, but... your just using facts, logic and reason to ignore the irrefutable evidence that mental distress and guns are a deadly combination - they had a whole report about it on CNN. You just dont understand the PTSD and guns are bad, and Obama - bless his heart, is only trying to protect the public from bad things and bad people.  I support our troops, but I also dont want some dishonorable discharge having some sort of flash back in the middle of the mall where Im shopping with my kids and pulling out their gun and going on a rampage screaming about hadji or whatever. If they are too sick to deal with life day to day, then they are too sick to own a gun. Period.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not making an argument that it is irrefutable, I&#39;m pointing out what this actually means, and what needs to be put in place in order for them to actually make this legal.  If we are going to say that people with PTSD can&#39;t own a gun, then anyone engaged in a firefight showing battle fatigue or any signs of stress, which is pretty much everyone, needs to be pulled from theater and returned home immediately, and then properly discharged from the military.  This also as I have said, applies to law enforcement as well.  It has serious consequences, but the truth is that it needs to be done.</p>
