        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi there,</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know me but you were one of the highest upvoted posters on a thread I posted on Reddit yesterday, about my friend receiving an offer for his user account, so I thought I&#39;d let you know what happened afterwards.</p>

<p>About 12 hours after I posted the image, both my original account, Scott_Summers and the account of my friend who got the offer, girfuy were both deleted. These accounts had a total of 6 years history but today they are gone. Additionally, both my and his alt accounts have also been deleted, I assume based on IP or something. All of our Reddit history from all accounts have been wiped.</p>

<p>Also, the account that sent the message was deleted too, I&#39;m not sure if that was by an admin or himself to cover his tracks. He had quite a long posting history so at least I took the fucker down with me.</p>

<p>Anyway, thought I&#39;d let you know. That&#39;s me done with Reddit now, I&#39;ve had some good years on here but can&#39;t really be assed with what it&#39;s become recently. Keep up the good fight, my man.</p>

<p>Scott_Summers</p>

<hr/>

<p>Thread from yesterday: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1vrrde/friend_got_this_message_today_anyone_else_seen/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1vrrde/friend_got_this_message_today_anyone_else_seen/</a></p>

<p>His account : <a href="/u/Scott_Summers">/u/Scott_Summers</a></p>

<p>Friend&#39;s account who got offer: <a href="/u/girfuy">/u/girfuy</a></p>

<p>(this is an alt account posting through proxy so I can avoid a ban on my main account. But, as you can see, I must be one of the top commenters, so I guess the admins will have to ban 3 or 4 of us ;)</p>

<p>And that&#39;s besides the point, the news here is controlled.  People can have discussions and they&#39;re not shut down (because they get downvoted into oblivion).  But go try to post an anti US article in <a href="/r/history">/r/history</a> and it will be deleted.  Or an anti israel article in r/news.  Or just go to <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> and go down the list of things deleted and you can see the narrative they&#39;re creating and what legitimate news doesn&#39;t fit into that story.  Of course occasionally people flip out about a deleted article and it&#39;s reinstated with a bs excuse, but that&#39;s not too often.</p>

<p>I was arguing with <a href="/r/history">/r/history</a> mods last week about that deleted &quot;US war crimes during the battle of fallujah&quot; article.  The lines of bs coming out of them were ridiculous.  It was never reinstated though, because &quot;since the US still has soldiers in Iraq, a specific battle from 2004 would still be considered current news&quot; LOL</p>

<p>A prime reason for the censors/shills/propagandists to ensure it stays ghettoized and ridiculed. I&#39;ve noticed that in most other subs, there is rarely any discussion - it&#39;s just memes, dumb jokes, pun threads, deflecting comments and of course, apologist comments from shills.</p>

<p>At least here we can have a discussion without it just being shitposted all over.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the modern equivalent of taunting a UFO witness with &quot;So did you see little green Martian men too!? Hahaha!&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing I found curious about it is that &quot;Lacerta&quot; (the reptilian) claims that some UFOs are natural phenomena currently unexplained by physics, and then mentions in particular high-altitude plasma formations.</p>

<p>Now, the reason that struck me, is that this was written in 1999, and the &quot;high-altitude plasma&quot; she mentions is essentially a dead ringer for the Hessdalen lights, which have been found to be natural plasma formations.</p>

<p>But the Hessdalen lights and the research into them didn&#39;t happen until only fairly recently, <em>well after</em> 1999.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t really mean much, but it is something I noticed that was interesting.</p>

<p>Other things point to it being fake, in particular I found it dubious that any alien species would come to Earth to extract hydrogen from Earth&#39;s water (as &quot;Lacerta&quot; claims at one point), given that hydrogen is abundant in space.</p>

<p>It&#39;s still a weird and interesting read, regardless of being able to verify it at all.</p>

<p>From what I understand that&#39;s the behavior when it&#39;s an admin ban, since [deleted] shows up (as we all know) when you delete an account yourself.</p>

<p>As with protecting other high profile, constant-spam shills (<em>cough</em> AdamWhore <em>cough</em>), I&#39;m sure this is a case of at least one or more of the admins being in on the shilling. Probably taking a cut.</p>

<p>That is a pretty good one. Unfortunately, it&#39;s actually because he used 4 accounts to upvote his post immediately after submitting it. That&#39;s right, he was trying to artificially influence his post about companies supposedly trying to artificially influence reddit.</p>

<p>By the way, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1vsluz/there_is_a_group_attempting_to_buy_reddit/cevk3xm">the whole premise of the post was completely made-up too</a>. Somebody created a new account to send fake offers out to a bunch of people (including his own account), then created a fake conversation between himself and the &quot;buyer&quot;, then tried to post that conversation to stir up conspiracy theories (and was probably hoping some of the other people would jump in and corroborate). Too bad it wasn&#39;t this subreddit they posted it in, I guess. You guys would have loved it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There are some of us doing benevolent social engineering and that&#39;s what makes reddit different.</p>

<p>In normal news mediums only the monied factions get to manipulate. Here both sides get to have a go at Beryanisan condtioning. It&#39;s ugly, but that&#39;s a microcosm of human culture at the moment.</p>

<p>Hoards and hoards of people abdicating their civic duty to be properly informed means social engineering is the hexis of the day. For that we should weep, but also we must not be afraid to fight fire with fire. Much akin to what Welles did in <em>Citizen Kane</em> when he used his epic to go after after not only Hearst, but the edifice of Yellow Journalism itself.</p>

<p>*Use their tools against them! Turn negative feedback loops into an arena for discussing the actual problems of the day. As but one example. </p>

<p>The media sold the narrative that Rupert Murdoch was kicked out of England because he used Brroks and Caulson to hack into Millie Dowler&#39;s voicemails to delete messages in 2004. They did this when Millie was still believed missing such that the family would hold out hope she was alive and give intervierws to the papers. </p>

<p>The thing is though, Rupert Murdoch wasn&#39;t kicked out of England until 2010. What the media didn&#39;t report so much was that in 2010 Repurt Murdoch attempted to engage a full buyout of bskyb (the main competitor to the BBC in England). This buyout was denied by the Culture Media and Sport Committee in Parliament. Murdoch decided to go ahead with the buyout anyway, and before he could the Millie Dowler story came roaring back. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a negative feedback loop. Wherein the public is only presented with the Millie Dowler story and the Story of Murdoch getting kicked out of England. Therein entirely missing the actual weighty nature of the incident as it pertains to television rights distribution. </p>

<p>Benevolent propaganda is that instance would entail going around plastering Murdoch&#39;s failed 100% takeover bid of byskyb on every story that talks about Millie Dowler. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s from my understanding a way for you to still post to &#39;feel&#39; involved; however, none of your posts show up for anybody else. Typically I feel this is a way to mitigate anger in a passive way; that is: if you&#39;re banned and instantly realize it you&#39;ll immediately in most cases make a new account and continue on. If however you learn of your &#39;banning&#39; only because your friends cannot view your posts; nobody replies; no up/downvotes, nothing; well, oh well I suppose. At least that&#39;s how I felt. I called out u/sleekery for being a shill for the grist. I had literally everything. From linked accounts on twitter to the users google+ profile; everything matched. I narrowed it down exactly to place(s) of employment. The Grist is one of them. I was shadow banned. Only after the fact did i learn of this; I figured I won by that time. </p>

<p>This is not happening as far as I know. And I watch the new queue and the modqueue for hours a day (I have a problem, I know.)</p>

<p>What <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is, is marginalized. Alexis and his merry band of PR minions want us as far away from their &quot;monitzation arenas&quot; as humanly possible.

<p>I wouldn&#39;t consider that strange. Given <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> exists solely to vote brigade, spam and derail this subreddit, you can&#39;t expect us to react kindly to that.</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, everyone who is &quot;in&quot; on the activities there is just as bad as the corrupt admin who banned Scott_Summers, or the corporate/gov shills from elsewhere.</p>

<p>Now, @redandterrible, I don&#39;t have anything personally against you.</p>

<p>LOL, seriously? That&#39;s pretty big-headed of you. It exists to mock the entire <em>world</em> of specifically <em>silly</em> conspiracy theories / theorists.</p>

<p>The only reason <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> gets mentioned is because we&#39;re on the same website.</p>

<p>If people from there vote brigade, that&#39;s up to them, and they can live with the consequences of doing something that stupid. I&#39;m an free individual, and share no one else&#39;s agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just out of curiosity, when all these kinds of things go nuclear and the admins supposedly ban/delete/nuke everything in what is said to be a cover up or push a certain agenda, then why is the subsequent fallout and drama allowed to carry on with screen caps, cached pages, open discussion and rabid dissent, and all that stuff?  Are we naive enough to think that the admins here aren&#39;t aware of the Streisand effect?  They have to know there&#39;s going to be some kind of reaction that will bigger than the initial story.  So why does it happen this way?  One would think that if someone was trying to cover something up or silence something they&#39;d keep a close watch on things and nuke anything that even touched on the subject in the coming hours...and ban anyone who brought it up.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m asking for serious answers too, one liners like &quot;this is too small of a sub and it doesn&#39;t get the views&quot; don&#39;t make sense because that&#39;s where the drama originated, so if it&#39;s too small of a subreddit now, why wasn&#39;t it too small when they killed the thread?  And I&#39;m not saying anyone here is wrong or crazy, I just don&#39;t understand why everybody screams CONSPIRACY and then the admins (or whoever) allows free and open discussion about the thing that they&#39;re supposedly trying to keep quiet.  </p>

<p>The goal, almost certainly, was to keep the previous post from getting to the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> or anywhere near it.</p>

<p>They only need to disappear it for a few hours for it to fall off the list.</p>

<p>What are you getting at with your comment? It seems like you didn&#39;t understand that IP here means  Internet Protocol, not Internet Provider. Is this correct?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, he&#39;s really not, especially considering lordthat100188 never suggested a person was being banned, just an IP. </p>

<p>Listing off internet providers as if thats what was going to be banned leads one to believe thats what he thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a dynamic IP address. I can change it any time by reconnecting my router, and having my ISP assign me a new IP address from their block. In order to ban me by IP, a mod would have to ban the entire block owned by my ISP, otherwise I could very easily just reconnect and get a new IP that hasn&#39;t been banned. So yes, they would have to ban my entire ISP&#39;s range in order to ban me. Same probably goes for any of the ISP&#39;s which he listed in his post, which is why he asked the question, which IP will they ban? The entire range owned by the ISP?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve obviously miscommunicated. As I&#39;m sitting here, a website in another tab thinks I&#39;m in &quot;Schertz, TX&quot; from an &quot;IP address&quot; owned by AT&amp;T (U-verse). So; if I run afoul of some ban-worthy thread, isn&#39;t <em>that</em> the &quot;IP address&quot; subject to &quot;ban&quot;? </p>

<p>As another commenter mentioned, all one has to do is reset their router to get another number in my <em>ISP&#39;s</em> range of &quot;IP addresses&quot;, so what could be done to <em>me</em> other than &quot;banning&quot;, at minimum, AT&amp;T U-verse service to &quot;Schertz, TX&quot;?</p>

<p>Just for my education, am I using the terms &quot;IP address&quot; and &quot;ISP&quot; in the right manner?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IP = internet protocol address ex. 192.168.2.1.</p>

<p>ISP = Internet service provider ex. AT&amp;T, Comcast etc...</p>

<p>So yes, you are using them correctly.</p>
