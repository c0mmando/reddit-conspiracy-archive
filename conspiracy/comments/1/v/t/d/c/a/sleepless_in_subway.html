Still better than working my ass off to go into debt. The best question you can ask yourself is what interests you? Truly what do you love? Work should be through service of what you enjoy doing. Even if it isn&#39;t (r)evolutionary. If it makes you happy day in and day out, and you dedicate your life to it; you&#39;ll surely inspire others. </p>

<p>I really want to make music, or be an actor, not for the money</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a sample life plan:  (1) Save $400.  (2) Get on a Greyhound Bus with one backpack full of your most important possessions.  (3) Get to Seattle.  Minimum wage:  $9.19, with mayor pushing for $15/hr. <a href="http://seattle.cbslocal.com/2013/10/16/seattle-unemployment-down-to-4-7-percent/">Unemployment rate: 4.7 percent</a> (1990s-levels).  Nearby Seattle:  SeaTac, where Subway <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/29/news/economy/minimum-wage-states/">minimum wage is $15.00/hr</a> (4) Sleep in Missions/homeless shelters until you find a job.  Take your first check and buy a used car on Craigslist.  You will live in this car/van for one year.  You will work and save money to buy a GoPro camera, and a roundtrip ticket to either a South American or Southeast Asian country (Why these locations?  Because your savings of one year will stretch far, and get you cheap food &amp; rent for another year).  (5) In a little over one year from now, you will travel to this country with your GoPro camera (and possibly guitar), where you will meet unique cultures and begin making documentaries about music and acting in foreign cultures.  (6) Eventually as you learn about music, acting &amp; documentary filmmaking, you will make a name for yourself and learn screenwriting for your first fiction film project, which will be starring you.  (7)  You will study the careers of independent filmmakers who became successful, possibly launched acting careers on their own scripts (Stallone, Damon, etc.).  (8)  Once your <em>Rocky</em> or <em>Good Will Hunting</em> has gotten you your first financial break, you will continue to make films and study music on the side.</p>

<p>Gah. Puke! I hate that fucker. </p>

<p>Luckily an easy way to shortcircuit the GMO shilling is to just pose the question of whether or not Monsanto should have the right to unilaterally determine what everyone in the world eats, without their knowledge or consent.</p>

<p>Then just point out that GMOs being harmful or not is moot as long as Monsanto is actively attempting to force people to eat their GMOs.</p>

<p>The problem is that almost every element of our lives is dominated by structures of power that are made to tighten indefinitely. The people who have spent lifetimes being little cogs in the machine will not have the reflex to fight until their basic needs are threatened, and by then it&#39;ll be too late.</p>

<p>There really is not much we can do to save the people who will not save themselves, other then to show them the coming storm and let them sort themselves out. Winners will find a way, losers will find something to blame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a good topic but this subreddit just isn&#39;t a good place to get that answered even though it is relevant. You might be able to find similar posts through searching.</p>

<p>Stay informed. Unplug yourself as much as you can. Think for yourself. Talk to anyone who is receptive: inform or encourage those who are curious and get what you can from people who are ahead of you. Figure out where you think the world is headed and do what you need to get through it in the ways you want to survive.</p>

<p>Food is a huge thing, so try to eat unprocessed foods(probably organic), less meat, less refined flours and bad sugars... Eating shit food brings you down and makes you addicted, and I think people being stupid about food and dependent on the grocery store for everything is going to be used as a major control mechanism, if it isn&#39;t already! Water is pretty important too. At the very least, RO filter that shit if you use tap water.</p>

<p>In addition to working on the above, I do not have a car and use busses or my bicycle to get around. Later this year I will probably end up WWOOFing around for a little bit in preparation for using some of my mom&#39;s land or getting my own to get into permaculture and aquaponics. Eventually I&#39;d really like to build an earthship or move into an intentional community or something like that. </p>

<p>Restoring humanity is something else, because right now most of us have to worry about just restoring ourselves. Living a normal american life makes us ill, weak and stupid, so detoxing and withdrawing from that as much as possible is the first step I think. I don&#39;t think humanity will ever be &quot;restored&quot; from where we are now because I don&#39;t think we ever really made it to a good place as a species in the first place. The best we can do is leave something pretty for future archeologists and to help ourselves and our families/friends wake up and prepare as much as we can. Waking up from the american dream is all the restoration we need, and then it is time to do the work. What work needs to be done? Only you can figure out what you need to be doing. </p>

<p>Shit on the spinach.</p>

<p>Blabber to every customer about aliens and the NWO.</p>

<p>Ignore customers orders. They are sheeple and can&#39;t be trusted to make their own decisions. Everybody gets turkey, American cheese, and shit spinach on whole wheat.</p>

<p>Illustrate your ramblings with symbols, leave no surface un-arted. Be creative.</p>

<p>Play the Terrance McKenna lectures over the speakers. If the store does not have built-in speakers, a tape-deck shall work just fine.</p>

<p>Refuse to accept Federal Reserve Notes (dollar bills) as currency, insist that customers pay for their sandwiches in gold dust or Bitcoin. If neither of these currencies are available, a sacrifice is acceptable.</p>

<p>Replace all images of Jared and subway employees with pictures of naked Ayn Rand.</p>

<p>Replace all depictions of the Subway logo with the INFO WARS logo.</p>

<p>Make sure you inform patrons, that their sandwich is made with toxic GMO crops and factory-farmed techo-meat.</p>

<p>Insist all customers must wash <strong>your hands</strong>, before making their sandwich.</p>

<p>Replace all the potato chips with banana chips, your customers are fat and should be eating healthier.</p>

<p>Take a 45 minute mediation break between sandwiches. Lay your meditation mat, on an empty table. Sit upon it, light candles and lead your patrons in the mantra of oneness. Don&#39;t forget the incense.</p>

<p>Seriously, what the fuck did you expect me to write here. Go fuck a goat.</p>
