<p>&lt; Movies as a reference &gt; (includes many topics being discussed here, but since it is a huge list I will try to compile about 10-15 of the top ones to make it easier to see the clearest picture)</p>

<p>1)  Transformers: Age of Extinction, Jupiter Ascending, most marvel movies lately, Devil&#39;s Due, Exodus, Son of Man, Men in Black 3, Prometheus, Battleship, Exodus, Earth to Echo, Guardians of the Galaxy, Godzilla(referencing atom bomb), Chicken Little (mentioned as conditioning children for aliens)</p>

<p>What we are getting at is the rise in movies about an alien invasion or martial law because of an invasion or another event. Also includes movies of biblical prophecy type adaptations. </p>

<p>I typically watch movie trailers to catch which sentences are repeated most, and they include all types of movies. The phrase I hear the most is along the lines of, &quot;Are you prepared?&quot;, &quot;Something is coming&quot;, &quot;Are you ready?&quot;. I just find it odd that the same types of sentences are repeated in so many trailers lately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read up on Wehrner von Braun&#39;s predictions.  He said first there would be terrorists from third world countries that would take over after communism was done being the boogie man, then he said there would be the threat of asteroids then a large alien invasion which would unite the world under one government.  All fake, all so that the elites can place weapons in space to make revolution impossible.    all of this television programming is just making the alien invasion meme more and more solid in people&#39;s minds...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I do believe ET&#39;s are very real so I am biased. I do think they will &quot;fake&quot; it but I still believe former government employees that have long past that warned us we were working with another race.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be interested in this. Unfortunately I think the problem that might arise is that many people on this sub have cut TV out of their media consumption for obvious reasons, so it&#39;s harder to see the trends.</p>

<p>To contribute to the list of speculative potential predictive programming that we&#39;re seeing I&#39;m going to address one particular bit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The points I seem to be noticing most are aliens (alien invasions included)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is one for sure. If you check out <a href="http://www.theparacast.com/podcast/now-playing-october-30-2011-norio-hayakawa/">this interview with researcher Norio Hayakawa</a> he mentions at one part in the interview that some of the people living in the area near Dulce have seen what appear to be holographic projections of UFOs and perhaps aliens as well.</p>

<p>I find it hard to research this stuff well because as I said I don&#39;t watch much television. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just my silent observation: the series The X-Files was, in my opinion, a prime example. </p>

<p>Scully was the book smart, pretty detective who always had an explaination for the seemingly unexplainable phenomena. She was never truly a believer like most people are. Many viewers would have agreed with Scully&#39;s scientific &quot;smart-sounding&quot; conclusions about xfiles. </p>

<p>Mulder, the detective with the balls to go out to solve these xfiles and expose the government coverup is always seen as a bit looney by his far fetched observations. He was usually right too. </p>

<p>There&#39;s always two sides to the ET &amp; UFO phenomena. </p>
