    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s an <em>unconscious</em> conspiracy, as our human psyches evolve toward better and better places.  The things we used to tolerate worldwide were absolutely horrible, and in just a few generations we&#39;ve already come to despise the despots and slave-lords of even just 100 years ago.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll always have the evolutionary remnant (sociopaths) with us, but they fight so hard because they know they are &quot;failed humans&quot; and throwbacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some other examples of groups that &quot;conspired&quot; to protect common people.</p>

<p>The big problem is that these are never pure movements... they have/had a lot of problems.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>European religious reforms that gave spiritual dignity and spiritual freedoms back to individuals</p></li>
<li><p>Those who conspired to generate the Bill of Rights or the French Revolution</p></li>
<li><p>(not an expert here) Temples in east Asia that taught martial arts so that people would be ready to fight when they needed to protect themselves, even though they were not allowed to carry hand weapons</p></li>
<li><p>Many scientific breakthroughs had a &quot;conspiratorial&quot; sense... they were threatening to the status quo (even today, the &quot;academic community&quot; doesn&#39;t like change) and had to be fought for</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;d love to know what the Essenes were thinking when they preserved the Dead Sea Scrolls... too bad we can&#39;t be sure that we actually got to see all of the texts</p></li>
<li><p>You can find small &quot;conspiracies&quot; everywhere as people strive to preserve endangered cultures, such as various remnants of Native American tribes</p></li>
<li><p>The arts are a conspiracy, which is why they are poorly funded.  Teach people to breathe deeply and open their minds and they&#39;ll start to ask questions.  Lots of crap art, but people who take their art/creativity seriously are fighting for a better world.</p></li>
<li><p>Whistleblowers teaming up with journalists, such as Manning / Wikileaks, Snowden / Greenwald, Deep Throat, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t think there has been one organized cabal directing this through history, but there doesn&#39;t need to be.  The human psyche wants to be free, and it&#39;s evolving ever more that way.  It&#39;s enough to keep everyone fighting against the small little animals that want to profit from our capitivity / labor / resources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mines is a bit theatrical. Ever watch Doctor Who? </p>

<p>Imagine someone with a personality same to the Doctors surface personality. </p>

<p>Now make them impossibly rich. Find all government secrets. Run for president and leak on live television the more salacious secrets, like this candidate cheated on his wife with certain person in a certain time, but reveal in a way that it sounds like common knowledge. </p>

<p>When asked to prove, show evidence. </p>

<p>Then up the ante more and more with casual leaks while being a amusing and relatable candidate. Buy all political advertising space and fill it with lame political jokes. </p>

<p>Point out inconsistent political promises, and flip flopping lies by essentially following a candidate around and questioning them. </p>

<p>Be amusingly transparent. Like every single moment on the campaign trail is live streamed by a high quality camera on your shoulder. </p>

<p>While on the toad sing sea shanties. </p>

<p>Once in, disarm all nukes. Pay all military members an extraordinary amount of cash to leave. End military. Reveal everything. I mean everything. In order all evidence full detail, on live web stream. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bold but I don&#39;t think it would work. By the time you start attacking the politicians, you start to make a lot of enemies. You need to be an honest public figure with the evidence to back it up, yes. But you should do it without rustling the feathers of the people in power. Operate under the radar. You need to be able to set the scene to the point where you go all in, in as little time as possible. Shock and awe or as we call it in WoW, burst DPS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.</p>

<p>I even believe this &#39;cabal&#39; believes it is doing good. The path to hell is paved with good intentions, always. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s zionism, well they have a jaded view of people and believe that people are uncivilized animals, which sometimes we are. Take food stamps away in this society and see what happens.. They believe that they can bring in a global civilization of prosperity and will justify whatever means for the end.</p>

<p>Totally evil, but in their mind - totally good. They are very, very disconnected from everyman mentality. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also very interesting when you look at the freemason/illuminati ties to sacred geometry. The square and compass is, in my mind, a double tetrahedron, a sacred symbol. <a href="http://kalarhythms.org/images/sacred-geometry/double-tetrahedron-bw.png">Double tetrahedron</a></p>

<p>Somehow this stuff was passed down throughout history, (IMO) Ancient Egyptian secret schools -&gt; knights templar -&gt; bv illuminati -&gt; cabal we see now.</p>

<p>The &#39;illuminati&#39; used to have to meet in secret to discuss math/geometry/mysteries of ancient civilizations, etc. They used to be the prosecuted.</p>

<p>IMO - thats why the pyramid on the bill and why it says &#39;they approve of our undertaking&#39; they believe they are the last on the chain of something that extends throughout history... The pyramid symbolizing the completion of civilization.</p>

<p>I feel that they have lost the connection to divinity which used to keep the &#39;good&#39; intentions in these cults.</p>

<p>If only they could smoke a little DMT and be reminded who they/we all really are..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mines is a bit theatrical. Ever watch Doctor Who? </p>

<p>Imagine someone with a personality same to the Doctors surface personality. </p>

<p>Now make them impossibly rich. Find all government secrets. Run for president and leak on live television the more salacious secrets, like this candidate cheated on his wife with certain person in a certain time, but reveal in a way that it sounds like common knowledge. </p>

<p>When asked to prove, show evidence. </p>

<p>Then up the ante more and more with casual leaks while being a amusing and relatable candidate. Buy all political advertising space and fill it with lame political jokes. </p>

<p>Point out inconsistent political promises, and flip flopping lies by essentially following a candidate around and questioning them. </p>

<p>Be amusingly transparent. Like every single moment on the campaign trail is live streamed by a high quality camera on your shoulder. </p>

<p>While on the toad sing sea shanties. </p>

<p>Once in, disarm all nukes. Pay all military members an extraordinary amount of cash to leave. End military. Reveal everything. I mean everything. In order all evidence full detail, on live web stream. </p>
