       This is an alt.

      <p>
       For the past few months I've been posting on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       about conspiracies involving the Fed, FEMA shit, and some sketchy politics involving Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a delivery man who delivers goods all over - including to some government buildings. Today I was delivering goods to a small shop at noon when a 40ish year old woman came up to me. She started chatting with me about my work, what I do, where I deliver goods to, the whole shebang. She made a lot of references to how she's "open-minded" and likes to go on Reddit and is a fan of some of the more "off-beat" subreddits. She was smiling a lot and offered me to meet with her at her house "for some tea" after my shift was over. Oh boy, I thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before she left (I thought she was a professional on a lunch break) I asked her where she worked. She told me she worked for the government, but when I asked her where her office was in the building (I know the layout of these buildings pretty well) she gave me the number of a storage room. I checked again with her and she insisted this is where her office is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not take her up with her offer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find this really strange. Should I be worried,

       Of course, maybe even likely.  But she also MAY have been just hitting on him.  You have to admit it's possible.  Our instincts aren't always right.  Ask any physicist.

       I spent a little time thinking about how to make myself invisible on the internet and quickly realized that there's always a chain somewhere. A truly dedicated detective could find me. Now I only use pseudonyms as a kind of buffer for the lazy. Anyone really interested in finding me could do so and there'd be nothing I could do about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so I've resigned myself to living in a Philip K. Dick novel.

       I spent a limited amount of time on the concept of ceasing to exist online, but the largest factor that played into my decision to give up was when I realized that in my entire internet existence, I have done nothing interesting.  It was somewhat depressing, but I sincerely doubt I have to worry about the spooks now.

       The only threat I pose is pithy derision or abject contempt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't feel too bad, though. A lot of people try to "fight the man" in ways that are impotent and counter-productive. Back in the day I used to graffiti banks with slogans that only an economist would understand. I would put stickers about 9/11 Truth on everything and anything. One day I realized that no one cared as much as I did.

       The thing that truly upsets them is non-compliance.

       But, higher probability she's been Scoping out his ASS, on deliveries, and face booked him.  Women say crazy stuff, they say anything to keep the conversation going to meet someone they really like.  He's a delivery guy, so he walks 10 miles a day, and could be in good shape.

       The NSA can already track you right? why would they need to physically contact you. I'm not going to sit here and say things that will just make you feel bad but come back to reality buddy, we need you.

       If i'm not mistaken the government requires all important stuff (arms, bomb, or whatever the fuck) to be carried in specific trucks/trailers with gps and whatnot attached. (they're common, an industry standard. They look like a largish white dome light thats facing skyward)
      </p>
      <p>
       So.. if they had to track them it would be literally as easy as pulling up the tracking website or whatever.

       And I suspect that op is simply an office deliveryman. Not even worth tracking

       Do you really think delivery man knows what he's really delivering? It's not like: "Oh, you must deliver those USB-sticks into CIA HQ and yeah, our partners put some spy hardware inside them". He is not one to blame in that case.

       No, not usually, but in this really unlikely scenario where the CIA or NSA is trying to seduce a delivery guy, they wouldn't need the delivery guy to know...they would already know the contents and destination of the package(s) and just need access to the delivery guy or his vehicle to plant the goods.

       I find it weird (as a government employee) that a delivery guy is able to even enter the buildings/let alone walk around and look at office numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any government office building I've been in, you'll get to the front desk, and that's about it. You'd drop the package there, and they'd call the owner to come pick it up. They don't just let the delivery man walk around the building aimlessly under the guise of delivering a package.
      </p>
      <p>
       What government building were you in? What agency does it belong to? Shit, what city were you in? You gave none of that, so is this just total bullshit, correct? Also, how'd reddit come up?
      </p>
      <p>
       I also find it
       <strong>
        INCREDIBLY
       </strong>
       stupid, to say "shit, I post shit on reddit, and now the CIA is after me in real life. I better post to reddit, and give pretty specific details about it and see what they think! I posted it under a fake account, so I'm totally in the clear." Not at all like the CIA would say "well damn, this story sounds
       <strong>
        JUST
       </strong>
       like what happened with that dude we were after..."

       You absolute lunatic. Why would the government spend money hiring someone to do what you're suggesting just so they can find out about someone that posts on a conspiracy board on reddit? You are not that important. This kind of stuff is reserved for people who are actually a threat to national security.

       It would be your access to government buildings AND conspiracy crap that would flag you for anything. The two mix in what is profiled as an inside path to radical people or as a dangerous lone gunman type. If not merely paranoia, or a mock story to further the obfuscation and misdirection of the intent of the populace of this sub reddit, then it would be likely you are mildly interesting and your profile snagged a look into your habits and interactions. Be more boring and less in the heat of the conspiracy crap or stop having a job that places you as an in building threat...

       I once  inadvertently let the internet know where I was headed that day by seeking a map to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once there  I met a very similar person who pretended to be somewhat retarded at first
      </p>
      <p>
       He   pretended to be just a friendly dumb ass who had no one to talk to. questioned me about my interests and background for roughly 45 minutes at a store.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have encountered such persons before and gave the answers that I thought I would like any investigator to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although he shrouded his questions in bullshit, he was most interested in my opinion on  marijuana sales and growers and whether I knew any.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beware of government spies who you may encounter in public  who pretend to be addled.

       In defense of the "addled", many "mentally ill" people are HIGHLY suspicious of "da guvernment" by nature, simply because they've been marginalized or abused systematically. I had a "paranoid schizophrenic" neighbor who was repeatedly raped. Because she was "delusional", the police wouldn't respond. I reported it to my landlord, when she was seeking my help. She's now dead, of an "overdose". I have suspicions that it was a man she reported as a sex offender, she was not a recreational drug user, but on some heavy psych meds. Either way, her story was one of my main motivations for getting the fuck outta Dodge.  The community didn't respond. It simply didn't care...

       There is literally no reason for the CIA to put a body on you.  Unless it's someone who is personally interested in you, they wouldn't even bother having someone tail you.  They would just turn on the gps in your phone, and monitor your computer to their hearts content.  Hell you probably have a gps tracker in your delivery truck that the company out there to monitor their truck.  And if they REALLY wanted to monitor you using that they could.  All that combined with the Trapwire technology that can track your face from traffic camera to traffic camera if they really wanted to keep eyes on you.  Putting a body on someone is so unnecessary these days, that you would have to either be a potential asset/recruit, or a mastermind with connections.  In which case they would have already taken you in, and would never attempt to alert you to their presence.

       She's trying to get dicked down and you're afraid she works with the CIA? You posting links that you found on the Internet, made by other people, got you in trouble? YOU? Come on mannn. What was her position? What were the off beat subs? Go get some ass, if you're captured it was either now or later. "This is an alt" --- same IP though? Haaaaaa.

       Yeah, redditard, that actually makes sense. They started "following" him from his posting on reddit, and someone figured it was him through telepathy, not through IP tracking...because that's how the Internet works.

       I don't get it. So he made an alternative account to conceal himself from 99% of the people on the Internet that don't know who the fuck he is already? How dramatic. You and him both smell like troll feet.

       "for some tea" at her house, which is why I asked OP if he was referring to weed, or actual tea. Since OP hasn't checked back in, I'm going to state that this was a VERY effective troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I know of several tea houses. Some don't last long, (usually the theme ones), but I had an AMAZING one in my college town. Open late, $2 burgers, the selection of teas was outstanding, and games and both playing and trivia cards at every table.

       I get that there are teshouses around. Very few but they're there. Thing that strikes me as weird is taht she woukd ask him out for a cup of tea. Even if you invite someone to your house its usually for cup of coffee or a drink here in the states.

       Yeah, I do have friends like that, but they wouldn't invite me for a cup of tea because they understand it's not the social norm here. They would usually ask to grab a bite or a drink. It would be like me asking someone "hey, wanna hangout a the comicbook shop." It would be weird because most thats not a thing most people do. And the people that would invite me out for a cup of tea are usually the psuedohippy hipsters who go on about how "green tea has all these, like, anti-oxidants and stuff, way better for you man." Bull, you don't even know what an anti-oxidant is, you hipster loser.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I'm just a cynical asshole. Most of the people I do know chug coffee, but coffee is pretty great. I don't get the energy drink obsession, however. They taste terrible.

       Green tea IS really good for you. It's a milder caffeine. It does contain anti-oxidants, if you prepare it right (you don't use a rolling boiled water, but just before it boils). It's been used safely for THOUSANDS of years. Hell, it makes your skin look AWESOME.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coffee is like blood diamonds. Morally, environmentally, politically, physically BAD. It's addictive as shit, affects the REM cycle and agitation. (It makes your skin look like shit, too! So women who think they're buying organic fair trade bullshit are also the ones slathering "antioxidants" all over their faces... ironically, made from green tea!)

It's more likely she wants to find out more about him, befriend him and see if he is suitable for exploitation - to potentially convince him to carry out some kind of terrorist attack, so that the CIA or whoever can then supply him with a bomb or weapons, and arrest him claiming they stopped a terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA/FBI uses hundreds of such agents, who try to befriend thousands of individual targets, in the hope that they can find a mentally ill extremist who they can convince to carry out a terrorist act.

       I would have assumed she was trying to meet for a quick random blowjob.  It's possible, but having a agent trap you and possibly use you to carry out aggression definitely seems more plausible.

       Beyond the tactic listed above, if the CIA can turn some trusted contributors to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       Yes, but presently there are laws that allow to come to your home, forcibly take you, and never let you know why. What are you going to do about it? What is anyone going to do about it? Nothing. They have done crazy shit, but right now they have written proof that they can, and will, just take you. "Tea" hahaha.

       And if they wanted to study human interactions under the influence of different variables, (such as drugs, sexual propositions, etc,) as they have before, would dragging someone away at gunpoint be productive?

       Implying I meant Guantanamo by "forcibly taking you away" is asinine. Why wouldn't they just distribute it otherwise aside from inviting you for tea. Where is everyone getting he will be drugged from?  The OP hasn't come back, and generally that means "yeah I'm full of shit." Especially with all the talk of "wouldn't you post if you thought you were in danger so people would notice you gone?" --- trolling the Internet. Since conception.

       Implying the only way that the CIA would wish to interact with a citizen is by forcing them off somewhere at gunpoint is stupid. Not only can it be ruled as illogical using solely common sense, but we can look at historical examples wherein they did lure people to safehouses using attractive women. 
Assuming that because they can "forcibly take you away" means that's the only way they interact with citizens is asinine.

       Yep, delivery man with access to government buildings. Not just the delivery entrance. Sounds real. Where are you getting drug experiments from? I never said it was the only way to interact with the general public, so you can stop assuming. "Come have some tea." Sounds American to me. All from posting on reddit and facebook. Easier to trick someone than to convince them they've been tricked. Aka you falling for the troll and instantly denying you've been tricked is a sign of education logic of the federal government. Good luck in life.

       Discussion: if you were being actively targeted, how could one "go public"? We have no real assurances that calls would be connected to live persons, videos actually uploaded, etc. If you were an active target, wouldn't all available electronics be able to be manipulated? If the media is corrupt, how would you know who to approach without getting section 12'd? Or that if you mysteriously stopped posting here, how would anyone know?

       Are you asking me? Well I would probably just find a way to contact Greenwald and go from there. It can't be THAT hard I mean..he IS a journalist. He is someone I would trust with information and he could tell me how best to handle it

       Yeah, I could DM him on Twitter, but how could you go that route without worrying you'd end up like Hastings?

       Edit: I also question the "authenticity" of Greenwald, WikiLeaks etc. Seems like a digital honey pot.

       If you are not a troll then yes it is reasonable to be worried.
They follow people for no reason. Most of the people they go after are innocent. They have a huge budget.
Being a gov deliverer you would get checked out.

      <p>
       It is easy enough to verify in a couple weeks or month when they don't expect it.
Trust your instincts. If it seems unusual after all the time you have done your job then it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have ever watched the documentary The Corporation then you know that corporations routinely set up entire fake offices, staff, family pictures, etc just to get information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the government even tracks their own people, questioning why they opened documents, why they had it open for x length of time.

      <p>

       No, I was more referring to the alleged woman in the story, albeit indirectly. I see where the confusion came from.
