        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is an alt.</p>

<p>For the past few months I&#39;ve been posting on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> about conspiracies involving the Fed, FEMA shit, and some sketchy politics involving Obama. </p>

<p>I am a delivery man who delivers goods all over - including to some government buildings. Today I was delivering goods to a small shop at noon when a 40ish year old woman came up to me. She started chatting with me about my work, what I do, where I deliver goods to, the whole shebang. She made a lot of references to how she&#39;s &quot;open-minded&quot; and likes to go on Reddit and is a fan of some of the more &quot;off-beat&quot; subreddits. She was smiling a lot and offered me to meet with her at her house &quot;for some tea&quot; after my shift was over. Oh boy, I thought.</p>

<p>Before she left (I thought she was a professional on a lunch break) I asked her where she worked. She told me she worked for the government, but when I asked her where her office was in the building (I know the layout of these buildings pretty well) she gave me the number of a storage room. I checked again with her and she insisted this is where her office is.</p>

<p>I did not take her up with her offer.</p>

<p>I find this really strange. Should I be worried, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I spent a little time thinking about how to make myself invisible on the internet and quickly realized that there&#39;s always a chain somewhere. A truly dedicated detective could find me. Now I only use pseudonyms as a kind of buffer for the lazy. Anyone really interested in finding me could do so and there&#39;d be nothing I could do about it.</p>

<p>And so I&#39;ve resigned myself to living in a Philip K. Dick novel.</p>

<p>The spooks will find me if they really want to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same.</p>

<p>The only threat I pose is pithy derision or abject contempt.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t feel too bad, though. A lot of people try to &quot;fight the man&quot; in ways that are impotent and counter-productive. Back in the day I used to graffiti banks with slogans that only an economist would understand. I would put stickers about 9/11 Truth on everything and anything. One day I realized that no one cared as much as I did.</p>

<p>The thing that truly upsets them is non-compliance.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll get their attention only when you cease participating in their scams.</p>

<p>Ironically the defiance of Lucifer is what threatens them most.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it weird (as a government employee) that a delivery guy is able to even enter the buildings/let alone walk around and look at office numbers.</p>

<p>Any government office building I&#39;ve been in, you&#39;ll get to the front desk, and that&#39;s about it. You&#39;d drop the package there, and they&#39;d call the owner to come pick it up. They don&#39;t just let the delivery man walk around the building aimlessly under the guise of delivering a package.</p>

<p>What government building were you in? What agency does it belong to? Shit, what city were you in? You gave none of that, so is this just total bullshit, correct? Also, how&#39;d reddit come up?</p>

<p>I also find it <strong>INCREDIBLY</strong> stupid, to say &quot;shit, I post shit on reddit, and now the CIA is after me in real life. I better post to reddit, and give pretty specific details about it and see what they think! I posted it under a fake account, so I&#39;m totally in the clear.&quot; Not at all like the CIA would say &quot;well damn, this story sounds <strong>JUST</strong> like what happened with that dude we were after...&quot;</p>

Unless it&#39;s someone who is personally interested in you, they wouldn&#39;t even bother having someone tail you.  They would just turn on the gps in your phone, and monitor your computer to their hearts content.  Hell you probably have a gps tracker in your delivery truck that the company out there to monitor their truck.  And if they REALLY wanted to monitor you using that they could.  All that combined with the Trapwire technology that can track your face from traffic camera to traffic camera if they really wanted to keep eyes on you.  Putting a body on someone is so unnecessary these days, that you would have to either be a potential asset/recruit, or a mastermind with connections.  In which case they would have already taken you in, and would never attempt to alert you to their presence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I do have friends like that, but they wouldn&#39;t invite me for a cup of tea because they understand it&#39;s not the social norm here. They would usually ask to grab a bite or a drink. It would be like me asking someone &quot;hey, wanna hangout a the comicbook shop.&quot; It would be weird because most thats not a thing most people do. And the people that would invite me out for a cup of tea are usually the psuedohippy hipsters who go on about how &quot;green tea has all these, like, anti-oxidants and stuff, way better for you man.&quot; Bull, you don&#39;t even know what an anti-oxidant is, you hipster loser.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m just a cynical asshole. Most of the people I do know chug coffee, but coffee is pretty great. I don&#39;t get the energy drink obsession, however. They taste terrible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Green tea IS really good for you. It&#39;s a milder caffeine. It does contain anti-oxidants, if you prepare it right (you don&#39;t use a rolling boiled water, but just before it boils). It&#39;s been used safely for THOUSANDS of years. Hell, it makes your skin look AWESOME. </p>

<p>Coffee is like blood diamonds. Morally, environmentally, politically, physically BAD. It&#39;s addictive as shit, affects the REM cycle and agitation. (It makes your skin look like shit, too! So women who think they&#39;re buying organic fair trade bullshit are also the ones slathering &quot;antioxidants&quot; all over their faces... ironically, made from green tea!) </p>

<p>TL,DR: <em>the hipsters are right, man...</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think anyone was suggesting this woman wants to entrap or arrest him. It&#39;s more likely she wants to find out more about him, befriend him and see if he is suitable for exploitation - to potentially convince him to carry out some kind of terrorist attack, so that the CIA or whoever can then supply him with a bomb or weapons, and arrest him claiming they stopped a terrorist. </p>

<p>The CIA/FBI uses hundreds of such agents, who try to befriend thousands of individual targets, in the hope that they can find a mentally ill extremist who they can convince to carry out a terrorist act.</p>
