    <div class="md"><p>What is frightening about this? Anyone who read Tom Clancy or Bourne novels or Flemming novels knows this stuff already. Spies spy, that&#39;s what they do. You want to know how to fight back? Wuit paying attention to gossip, quit perpetuating stories that involve politician&#39;s affairs or drug mishaps. That is how they use the information they gather, to discredit and dismiss. If you don&#39;t allow personal failing to cloud your judgement about someone you just may get a good politician. Albeit a not so great husband or father. (or whatever)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because yo know stuff already, doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t frightening. I want it to be frightening, I want people to get so worried, they actually do something rather than say &quot;Everybody knows this already...&quot;</p>

<p>I personally do everything you suggest already and more, but then I am not talking about myself [after all I am the OP], I hope to get those interested that do pay attention to so called celebrities more than what matters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes, the logic that would allow Paul Pott in as a politician. Really thought that through, huh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>quit perpetuating stories that involve politician&#39;s affairs or drug mishaps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? It&#39;s their failing, not ours. If I have a &quot;drug mishap&quot; I go to jail. Why do you suggest perpetuating the unlevel playing field?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you don&#39;t allow personal failing to cloud your judgement about someone you just may get a good politician.</p>

<p>No words can cut through that delusion. Keep telling yourself that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason the NSA is an issue is blackmail, threat of public exposure, intellectual property, etc. The reason you ignore stories about drugs/affair is to make it a non-issue, because yes, big surprise, politicians are people too. Instead focus on what the politician was trying to accomplish when the story broke. Many times it will be what is going on elsewhere. Such as this Benghazi, IRS, Obamacare debacle that has been unfolding for the last several years is still trumped by news of corrupt politics in New Jersey, big surprise there. Remember Wiener? Spitzer? All distractions.</p>

<p>The Governor of New York just said that conservatives weren&#39;t welcome in his state, along with gun rights activists and right to lifers. But the major news is still Christie. How do you think the news broke? All the governors, along with most if not all politicians are under surveillance, when they (the power) need a distraction they throw someone to the dogs.</p>

<p>Your never gonna get even with the man, never, so don&#39;t try. It is a waste of time and energy. What you can do is move on and try to improve society around you. That starts by not being a clucking hen about stuff that doesn&#39;t involve you. I&#39;m not saying that the Jersey situation isn&#39;t important, but it isn&#39;t nationally important, not at all. It is a distraction, just like the next time some politician get caught with his willie in a prostitute, its a distraction or power move. Look through the smoke screen.</p>
