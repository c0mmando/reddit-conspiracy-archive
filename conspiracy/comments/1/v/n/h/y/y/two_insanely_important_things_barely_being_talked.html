       The DEA Struck A Deal With Mexico's Most Notorious Drug Cartel

       What gives? There are good stories on the front page regularly, but these are two of the most pressing, truly "conspiratorial" things I've seen in awhile and no one here is paying attention. In the first one we have a highly secretive "trade agreement" which could give an upper hand to blatant corporatism, which is likely to be passed any day now (also added to the latest court of appeals ruling against net neutrality has the potential to stifle free speech on the internet). And then we have a civil defense group rising up against the notorious cartels in Mexico, taking back a few cartel towns, and yet the corrupt government is telling THEM to put down their guns and essentially give the towns back to the cartels.
      </p>
      <p>
       And very little media attention for either story.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty disgusting that you're circlejerking over bumper stickers while ALSO nearly ignoring these stories. Each of which constantly has new developments.

       TPP was talked about quite a bit several months ago, people lost interest. I am doing my best to get up to speed on the Mexico thing, especially the backing of the Sinaloa cartel.  But hell, at this point it's pretty fucking depressing for everyone I think, to watch our government act with impunity on so many different fronts.

       I have to agree with the depressing part. I love this country so much but almost feel trying to focus on the positive and be happy might be the best. Trust me this goes against all I feel but there is 0 accountability anymore.

       I have been doing some investigations myself. The problems with posting articles involving the Mexican Civil Defense groups is that the good ones are all in Spanish. Good thing for us here, I can read them and began to dissect the information regarding the recent news involving the DEA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what I got so far:
If you want sources and stuff, you gonna have to wait.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DEA has cut deals with the Sinaloa Cartel. A high cartel member was extradited to US and was arraigned in Chicago. This member claimed that he was offered immunity along with Chapo Guzman and other high profile Sinaloa Cartel members. THE DEA would receive intel on the operations of other cartels (and money?) while allowing the Sinaloa to continue their 
drug smuggling into Chicago.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more to this involving a CIA connection dealing with Enrique Camarena, a former DEA agent who was kidnapped,tortured and killed. According to some news sources, the Weed Farm he had discovered belonging to the Gudalajara cartel,was being monitored and funded in part by the CIA. The profits were then to be used for arming the Contras in Nicaragua. The Gudalajara Cartel were blamed for the death of Camarena. Either way, a DEA agent was killed for finding out something 
he should have not known. The death of Camarena was interesting in that it helped launch the War on Drugs(i know, needs more sources) and the Red Ribbon Campaign week.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how does this all come back to the Mexican Civil Defense Group?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mexican Civil Defense groups are being formed for the failures of the Mexican governemnt to do anything about the narcotics trade. US agencies have also allowed these Cartels to grow to their current size.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sinaloa Cartel is allied with the Knights Templar, which many Defense groups are fighting against. The Sinaloa Cartel has also hired other paramilitary groups to fight against the Knights Templar.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mexican Civil Defense Groups are fighting of a cartel which is allied to the Sinaloa Cartel. This cartel is protected by the DEA. I would say that the Defense Groups are defending themselves against groups that the US government has given immunity to.

       Thanks for giving me a good place to start.  I have just started digging into this.  I also didn't know that Wachovia was investigated for laundering drug money for the Sinaloa cartel.  They got a slap on the wrist of course.

       I forgot about the banks! Wachovia and HBVA(I think this is a wrong lettering) laundered money. It makes sense why we dont really go after them.

       Agreed, this is a huge issue.  You have a group of villagers who have discovered that the people appointed to protect them are actually in league with the criminals who are preying upon them.  Then they use their God given right to protect themselves.  The federales are offended and kill some folks including a child in an arbitrary manner.  The struggle continues and drug money is huge and federal entities don't take kindly to and disruptions to the flow.  The narcotics must flow.

       There's so much crap going on things are bound to get lost. Remember the "Free Flow of Information Act" which effectively defined anyone other than a member of the dinosaur media as non-journalists, thus restricting the 1st amendment to a state-sponsored clique?

       The problem with anything TPP-related with regards to the rest of reddit is that the few times it has made it to front page the first 500 comments are shill apologists educating the rest of us peons in their lawyerly tones about how normal and businesslike it is. They're not going to let anything TPP get to the front page without loosing an all-out watering down assault on it so that it seems 'boring' and/or 'meh'.

       This is all part of the plan.. Destabilization in Mexico and then Canada and the United States.. This will move us closer to a controlling body of governance for all of "The Homeland" as the NSA likes to call it.

       Things are changing very rapidly. I pray for the souls of Michoacan people fighting not just the cartel but their government backers as well. Nieto is about to start a civil war.

       Who is everyone and what is everything?  You took time out of your day to type out 2 sentences that mean nothing.  Your life is a ticking clock man, and every moment counts.  Do you really want to look back in 40 years and realize that your life is a mosaic of meaningless efforts?

       I'm suggesting that reddit is a series of self-contained echo chambers with little to no substantial dialogue or debate, and the upvote system appeals to the lowest common denominator that succumbs to group identity and gets their opinions from the posts with the most points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upvotes and likes won't change the world but attention does, and it's sad how these topics are just not being covered here. People care more about a few isolated cases of police brutality and don't have the nerve to step back and take a look at the bigger picture. Political cartoons and empty rhetoric are spewed out into a crowd of jerkoffs and substantial news stories are being glossed over and tossed aside.
