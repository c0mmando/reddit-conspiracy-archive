        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I like this sub. In fact, I like it a lot. There are many things said here that I totally disagree with, and its usually met with accusations of being a shill.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never made a post to a sub just to complain about its user base, but frankly I&#39;m sick of seeing this. Its not just directed at me, its directed at <em>anyone and everyone</em> that disagrees. Not everyone that disagrees with you has been paid off, and nobody is out to get you. This is and should be a place of open discourse. Not a place of <strong>this is what I think and if you disagree you are a fucking government shill</strong>. That&#39;s ludicrous.</p>

<p>By accusing everyone that has a different viewpoint, you create a hostile environment. Do you want to cultivate an environment of conversation and logic, or do you want to cultivate an environment of hostility and anger? I prefer the former.</p>

<p>Edit: It seems that someone thinks this thread is directed at them when it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s directed at basically everyone that has ever used the word. Now I&#39;m not a shill, I&#39;m a troll instead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s worse than that. I, too, believe that shill accusations are exponentially overused here, and I could, somewhat, understand conspiratard if they were just reacting in fear to people here questioning things. It goes deeper, though. Some of the moderators over there also moderate a sub called &quot;World of Pancakes&quot;- the only purpose of which is to make fun of an anti-Israeli protestor who was run over by a bulldozer. Many of the visitors to conspiratard may just find it scary that there are conspiracies going on, but their leadership has a disturbing agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aristotle is credited with saying:</p>

<p>&quot;It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.&quot;</p>

<p>To me, that&#39;s what this sub is about. They place it into the realm of tin foil and mitigate the idea of even thinking about malfeasance in the government. Its sad really. Although I cannot say I have not met people in person that exhibit that same viewpoint; they just cannot fathom that its a conspiracy &quot;becasue then the entire government must be keeping a secret.&quot;</p>

<p>All I can retort to that is they must have never worked in a corporate environment. A Group Director never really divulges all they know to the Director, who does the same with their Manager, who then repeats to their Supervisor, then the team lead. </p>

<p>Having said that, they were still educated and intelligent, but then must have been lacking the mental capacity of critical thought. And that right there is conspiratard.</p>

However I agree to call people anything that fits when the counterargument goes something like: &quot;You tinfoil hat idiots...&quot; and then nothing more. Be they shills or just kids, we can do without those.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was me.  I&#39;ll fess up. I’m not too proud to say I may have been wrong :( <em>May have</em> been wrong. We don&#39;t know for sure. OP might not be a shill, but in my defense you have to admit OP was acting like one. Please read the whole thread to see I was not just calling him that because I disagreed with him and was being lazy. We gave him information from credible sources when he wanted us to back up our claims, and he was still calling it bullshit and calling us big jokes. Maybe I should have called him a troll instead, because he was definitely trolling us. This guy is clearly just bitter he lost a debate, and we could back ourselves up. This post is an excessive extent to go to because he may have been proven wrong.</p>

<p>I actually had just been debating a user who was most likely a shill. I think most of us will agree shills do exist on this sub. All this other guy&#39;s account had were comments disputing the facts we presented in this sub, and most of his comments were cheerleading for GMOs. They both used the “peer review” argument in the same fashion so I jumped to a conclusion. I mean, why else come here and try to discredit us because we don’t use mainstream sources? Isn’t the point of this sub to use and analyze alternative sources of information? He was basically insulting us and trying to discredit us for using this sub the way it should be used. What conclusion would you have come to?It&#39;s all very ironic too, because I provided an interview of a peer reviewed professor from Harvard, which is a pretty mainstream source.</p>

<p>I’m sorry I called you a shill, OP. However, I don&#39;t believe it was an inaccurate conclusion to come to based on your actions. I should have just said you were exhibiting the behavior of one, because you were. You weren&#39;t acting rational or reasonable at all. You were the one acting hostile and angry. In fact, I would encourage people to look at how often OP resorts to antagonistic vulgarity and insults in this sub, including the thread in question. Is that any better? Personally, I think that&#39;s <em>much</em> worse. In fact, he rarely seems to have any thought provoking points to make. You might not be a shill, OP, but you are a sore loser. I will be disappointed if I am banned mostly because it will show this sub is now censoring for reasons it shouldn&#39;t. It wasn&#39;t like I was slinging profane or racist insults at him. I try to show restraint and work hard not to insult people, but if they are acting a certain way, I&#39;ll call them on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has nothing to do with you. You aren&#39;t special enough for me to create a passive-aggressive thread about you, friend.</p>

<p>This has to do with <em>exactly what the thread says.</em> Every time I&#39;ve checked this sub for the past several days, there are ad hoc accusations of shillery and nothing to back up why they might think said poster is a shill. It&#39;s rarely a legitimate accusation and it&#39;s almost always used as a straw man. It does nothing to promote conversation.</p>

<p>Also, if I&#39;m being honest, I was really drunk when I was responding to you in that thread. Far too drunk to be able to form a cohesive argument.</p>

<p>No, self-control. It doesn&#39;t do well to get your panties all bunched up while in a disagreement and then start calling somebody names.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well said. Informed dissenting opinions, made in good faith are always welcome. </p>

<p>The truth is though, that there are &quot;visitors&quot; whose interaction with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is not conducted in good faith. These people are not open-minded and not interested in discovering the truth. </p>

<p>They post out of ignorance, malice or because of some wider political agenda. They add nothing whatsoever to this subreddit, and I will continue to call out those who exhibit bad faith behaviours. Everybody else is safe.</p>
