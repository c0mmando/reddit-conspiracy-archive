<pre><code>Stalin was an atheist.

Stalin had millions of people killed.

Therefore, atheism is evil.

<p>This idea is a conspiracy theory. </p>

<p>This conspiracy theory is stupid/incorrect.</p>

<p>Therefore, conspiracy theories are stupid/incorrect. </p>

<p>It would seem that whenever a person uses a form of the phrase &quot;this is a conspiracy theory&quot; in order to discredit the idea, they are using a logical fallacy. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a way of labeling people in order to rationalize away any worries over the possibility that what is presented could be true. A way of distancing oneself from outlandish ideas, for the intention of fitting in with &quot;normal&quot;. </p>

<p>Yet, they are oblivious to the fact that there never was a &quot;normal&quot; to begin with. Only delusion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can respond many ways with regard to the emotional, I&#39;ve tried <del>both</del> many. One way was if met with cynicism, I (to my brother) was equally cynical;</p>

<p>Him- </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Your a fuckin&#39; conspiracy theorist sheep you believe anything a Youtube video says&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me-</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You just resort to that when you got fuck all for a counter-argument&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or when met with cynicism I tried a neutral, reasonable approach;</p>

<p>Him- </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Whatever, you have no proof &amp; it just sounds too ridiculous, your a fuckin&#39; conspiracy theorist.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me-</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Fair enough, but my point wasn&#39;t that I know it to a certainty, just that the official story doesn&#39;t fully add up, and none of us can be certain there was no conspiracy.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However I respond, I usually ignore that they had to just label me personally, &amp; never return with an equal insult, I feel it works better that way to get people to actually listen to &amp; consider your viewpoints.</p>

<p>I&#39;m under the impression though that I may have actually caused them (My family) to question more because back when they didn&#39;t like my opinions, and actually wanted to block websites because they were convinced I was brainwashed (Ironic because they got their news from the MSM only) even though I form my own opinions <strong>based</strong> on research, but then after many conversations &amp; the Boston Bombings they became very sceptical of events related to the US, bear in mind their a tad anti-American (in a sense that they think an entire nation of people they&#39;ve never met are ignorant... irony, &amp; that they hate guns) &amp; I am not, but I am still relatively sceptical of both our governments.</p>

<p>So in my experience if the people you converse with aren&#39;t completely braindead &amp; can hold a civil conversation it&#39;d come as a suprise to both what kind of discussion can be had, if their inclined to write me off as a &quot;Conspiracy Theorist&quot; &amp; responding with politeness doesn&#39;t do anything then they can pretty much fuck off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I try and be sympathetic because I was once in their shoes.  Often it&#39;s the manner in which you present information that dictates it&#39;s propensity to be absorbed; in other words I don&#39;t go deep.  You cannot force a mind open, you will likely encounter equal resistance by forcing information, so I tend to answer questions as factually as possible.  If the discussion leads further, great.  If not - no harm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to suggest people are &quot;coincidence theorists.&quot; This works great for the JFK assassination and 9/11. </p>

<p>Example: <em>So all 4 Black Boxes from 2 planes were completely destroyed but a passport was found in tact? Huh... Only 3 steel-frame skyscrapers are known to have collapsed because of fire and they all came down on 9/11. Huh... The entire eastern seaboard&#39;s defenses were occupied on terror &quot;drills,&quot; causing mass confusion and effectively eliminating any chance for a fighter intercept. Coincidence. Huh... All of the alleged pilots were terrible flying cessnas but successfully hit every target but one in far more complicated aircraft. Ok.</em></p>

<p><em>You sure you aren&#39;t a coincidence theorist?</em></p>

<p>I mean how many coincidences need to pile up before the herd begins asking questions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I give them some of the examples of how I started thinking critically about power dynamics and PR.</p>

<p>When I was young, a gentleman at a cocktail party explained to me a more alternative version of the pearl harbor attacks and the economic reasoning behind US involvement in WWII.  I asked my parents if he was crazy and they told me who he was- a rather prominent person with inside information.</p>

<p>A separate example, I remember hearing a story about Israel dropping a bomb on a house to target a hamas terrorist.  The resulting explosion also killed several women and children.  When I heard the same story on a different news channel, they spun it about how horrible the terrorist was who they killed, and neglected to mention the &quot;collateral damage&quot;.  I realized then that there was a blatant propaganda campaign and that the &quot;news&quot; isn&#39;t there to represent objective reality, but to help you form an opinion which serves their interest.</p>
