       It would seem that whenever a person uses a form of the phrase "this is a conspiracy theory" in order to discredit the idea, they are using a logical fallacy.

       Sadness of the fact that there even exists such a term.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a way of labeling people in order to rationalize away any worries over the possibility that what is presented could be true. A way of distancing oneself from outlandish ideas, for the intention of fitting in with "normal".
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, they are oblivious to the fact that there never was a "normal" to begin with. Only delusion.

       You can respond many ways with regard to the emotional, I've tried
       <del>
        both
       </del>
       many. One way was if met with cynicism, I (to my brother) was equally cynical;
      </p>
      <p>
       Him-
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Your a fuckin' conspiracy theorist sheep you believe anything a Youtube video says"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Me-
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "You just resort to that when you got fuck all for a counter-argument"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Or when met with cynicism I tried a neutral, reasonable approach;
      </p>
      <p>
       Him-
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Whatever, you have no proof &amp; it just sounds too ridiculous, your a fuckin' conspiracy theorist."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Me-
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Fair enough, but my point wasn't that I know it to a certainty, just that the official story doesn't fully add up, and none of us can be certain there was no conspiracy."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       However I respond, I usually ignore that they had to just label me personally, &amp; never return with an equal insult, I feel it works better that way to get people to actually listen to &amp; consider your viewpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm under the impression though that I may have actually caused them (My family) to question more because back when they didn't like my opinions, and actually wanted to block websites because they were convinced I was brainwashed (Ironic because they got their news from the MSM only) even though I form my own opinions
       <strong>
        based
       </strong>
       on research, but then after many conversations &amp; the Boston Bombings they became very sceptical of events related to the US, bear in mind their a tad anti-American (in a sense that they think an entire nation of people they've never met are ignorant... irony, &amp; that they hate guns) &amp; I am not, but I am still relatively sceptical of both our governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in my experience if the people you converse with aren't completely braindead &amp; can hold a civil conversation it'd come as a suprise to both what kind of discussion can be had, if their inclined to write me off as a "Conspiracy Theorist" &amp; responding with politeness doesn't do anything then they can pretty much fuck off.

       It serves it purpose. People ostracize what they do not believe in or understand instead of keeping an open mind.

       But in their defense....when you got a guy running around wiping shit on walls and scream profanities at people in a tin foil hat, along with mentioning things like the government watching them, aliens cover up, etc. people tend to associate anyone who makes those claims is associated with

       Well I try and be sympathetic because I was once in their shoes.  Often it's the manner in which you present information that dictates it's propensity to be absorbed; in other words I don't go deep.  You cannot force a mind open, you will likely encounter equal resistance by forcing information, so I tend to answer questions as factually as possible.  If the discussion leads further, great.  If not - no harm.

       I like to suggest people are "coincidence theorists." This works great for the JFK assassination and 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example:
       <em>
        So all 4 Black Boxes from 2 planes were completely destroyed but a passport was found in tact? Huh... Only 3 steel-frame skyscrapers are known to have collapsed because of fire and they all came down on 9/11. Huh... The entire eastern seaboard's defenses were occupied on terror "drills," causing mass confusion and effectively eliminating any chance for a fighter intercept. Coincidence. Huh... All of the alleged pilots were terrible flying cessnas but successfully hit every target but one in far more complicated aircraft. Ok.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        You sure you aren't a coincidence theorist?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean how many coincidences need to pile up before the herd begins asking questions?

       I try to define myself by saying something like: “I learn as much as I can about a topic, consider conflicting view points, think critcally, and draw my own conclusions. The ability to think for yourself is a special talent, so why not exercise it?” The connotations and definitions of buzzwords can change. It’s harder to redefine a definition. However, I don't believe "conspiracy theorist" should have the negative connotations it does.

       I give them some of the examples of how I started thinking critically about power dynamics and PR.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was young, a gentleman at a cocktail party explained to me a more alternative version of the pearl harbor attacks and the economic reasoning behind US involvement in WWII.  I asked my parents if he was crazy and they told me who he was- a rather prominent person with inside information.
      </p>
      <p>
       A separate example, I remember hearing a story about Israel dropping a bomb on a house to target a hamas terrorist.  The resulting explosion also killed several women and children.  When I heard the same story on a different news channel, they spun it about how horrible the terrorist was who they killed, and neglected to mention the "collateral damage".  I realized then that there was a blatant propaganda campaign and that the "news" isn't there to represent objective reality, but to help you form an opinion which serves their interest.

       I say I'm a conspiracy realist. I think most terrorism is state sponsored, and if you read and look around enough about the deep state and black operations and what not, you will probably come to the same conclusions as me.

       I had this conversation with my sister-in-law at Christmas time.  My sister-in-law sort of rolled her eyes and said, "Oh, I forgot you are one of those "conspiracy theory people".

      <p>
       My immediate thought was "And you're an insufferable cunt."  But instead I said something along the lines of "Look, believe, don't believe what you want.  I just think people need to be aware of the power we've given the government and the media."
