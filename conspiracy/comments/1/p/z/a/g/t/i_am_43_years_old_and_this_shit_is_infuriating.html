        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is my voice, my opinion. I am not fully-informed, but I have a clue or three. And, like most people here who are older than 25, I&#39;m really frustrated by those we derisively refer to as &quot;sheeple.&quot;</p>

<p>For years I have watched Israeli hegemony turn into apartheid. I have seen governments in three countries come and go. I have heard the same accusations leveled at the same positions, the same institutions, and the same people over and over again. Noise. No signal. No intel. Nothing but noise. </p>

<p>Let me give you a kicker: I am an ex-DARPA contractor, primarily tasked with the newest RHIC-EDOM work, mostly with EDOM research. That in itself is nothing freaky. I&#39;m a psychologist with a very keen interest in two things: helping people with PTSD (sandbox vets, mostly) and taking the fear away from schizophrenics. I was initially approached by the DoJ for my work in unconscious/preconscious behavior elements, and (as far as I know) I am one of the only people to have developed a research and experimental paradigm to inferentially isolate and quantify non-conscious precursors of overt action. </p>

<p>I say this only because I crave your indulgence fora few moments. I know my credentials, from aerial photography interpretation to memory dissolution. I want to be understood as genuine, though jam far from expert. </p>

<p>I have never been privy to the &quot;Grand Scheme&quot; but I have been in a (frequently terrifying) position to see the circumstantial evidence as it passed by. I&#39;ve seen TR series planes up close as well as in-flight. I have read documents pertaining to Shanksville that will never see the light of day and which are probably destroyed by now. I have toured and been briefed (vaguely) on the Alaska HAARP array, as well as similar installations across the globe. </p>

<p>I joined this subreddit for reasons of curiosity, seeking validation for my own suspicions, hoping that everyone wasn&#39;t still obsessed with UFOs and Reptile People, seeking common ground with intelligent skeptics and nascent free-thinkers. </p>

<p>I quit DARPA after I saw microwave weapons in action. I used to love testing the Gauss Bike at Livermore, I am still heavily (though privately) invested in prosthetics and exoskeleton development. I will not be involved in RHIC-EDOM again, not even if they resurrect Camp Hero. </p>

<p>If you are interested in anything I have knowledge of, please ask me anything. I&#39;ll ignore any question or comment that would hurt me or my family, I will not entertain questions or comments about ridiculous shit. But if you are interested in the dreary and sometimes freaky world of DoJ research, if be happy to give admittedly vague but entrance-level answers and commentary to anyone who&#39;d like a bit more information. </p>

<p>If not, please accept my thanks for making this subreddit as good as it is, and write me off as a douchebag. I don&#39;t care. :)8</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The TR series is fucking AMAZING. I don&#39;t know much about the tech, but from 3b on they&#39;ve been incredible. Almost silent, no perceptible crew strain at up to 4g, and maneuverable like you wouldn&#39;t believe. </p>

<p>Up close (external: I&#39;ve ever been inside) they are almost unreal. They look like everything I dreamed about as a child. The skin is literally slick like a fish without the slime. Like a snake. The ELF they create on power-up is actually enough to make your head ring and your chest feel sick. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how they work, but I&#39;ve heard all the nuke-powered anti-grav rumors too. Doesn&#39;t seem plausible to me, but at the same time the physical presence of a TR5 made me feel like I was stoned. Really REALLY advanced shit. I wish I knew more. :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It won&#39;t go unanswered because I love and respect skepticism in all its forms. I don&#39;t know what you can&#39;t find out through Google, but I suspect the Gauss Bike at Livermore which I have already mentioned is one of those things that a search engine won&#39;t turn up. A mile-long, circular mag-lev track with what amounts to a hoverbike on it. I rode it twice, and it can apparently hit 200mph, although I never broke 100 on it. Take this info as you will, and remain skeptical please. A healthy bullshit detector, right or wrong, will never hurt you or your intellectual process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of the language used, there is absolutely no proof that this guy is legit. No real evidence to suggest it, either. At least at this point in the comments. (I&#39;m still reading, but not hoping for much.</p>

<p><strong>Anecdote</strong>: I know a woman (friend of a friend) working on her doctorate who says goofy things like &quot;off the chain&quot; pretty frequently. I mean, she&#39;s pretty serious and professional sounding when she talks about her field (something in psychology - I don&#39;t know her well so I don&#39;t know what it is specifically) but in my limited experience that&#39;s been the only time she really sounds professional. So, I mean, it&#39;s <em>possible</em> that the guy could be legit even if he uses silly phrases like &quot;off the chain.&quot;</p>

<p>But it is what it is - a very cool anonymous internet story so far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Commonly referred to as Black Triangles, the TR2 and 3 series are big triangular craft with obvious light identification. They have apex lights on each corner, sometimes running lights along the sides (TR4 and up, I think), and manage to fly almost perfectly silently. Google up Black Triangle UFO or even TR-3b Manta and have a look. These are responsible for more than a couple of supposed UFO sightings, mostly because of the shape and the astonishing way they hover, rotate, and maneuver. I really wish I&#39;d been allowed to see inside one, even just the cockpit (if it has one)...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know, the first real reports of something like the TR series was in 1980. But considering that we we first saw the SR-71 in the late 80s / early 90s when it was definitely performance-ready in the early 1970s leads me to believe that we are probably only going to &quot;officially&quot; know about it when someone capture good video of one in flight.</p>

<p>I saw one in flight in 96, and it was one of the scariest things I&#39;ve ever seen. I literally thought I was seeing an alien spacecraft, it moved so slowly and silently. I&#39;d estimate it was 200&#39; off the ground, and I&#39;ve never seen anything that made me feel fear in such a way. In retrospect, it might have been the ELF field. Whatever the case, I was really shaken by it, and this was several years before I knew what they were. Patents for TR3 series aircraft date back to the late 70s (Teledyne-Ryan, 1977 #244,265), so who knows when we&#39;ll get confirmation?</p>

<p>Cost? Who knows? The first TR was the U2 Dragonlady, obviously, but the Mantas? I have no idea.  have heard that each vehicle is worth over a billion dollars, but I have no reference for that, nor any corroboration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know there are VERY long-term plans (dreams, really) to build an orbital spacecraft-building facillty, and possibly a lunar one, though the lunar base is seriously pipe-dream at least as of the time I left. Without the Earth&#39;s gravitational problem, large craft can be built and launched with much less fuel, theoretically making Martian or Asteroid trips more sensible.</p>

<p>One of my own questions is &quot;Why ain&#39;t we been back on the MOON, son?&quot; I have no idea how to answer that one. But yeah, &quot;spacedocks&quot; are a big theoretical concern right now. The efficiency is off the chain, especially if we get the shuttle tech improved. Or an elevator. Or ballistic flight.</p>

<p>Reverse engineering? I&#39;d LOVE to believe so. I&#39;d love to think that everything from microchips to jet flight was reverse-engineered. I don&#39;t know. I doubt it, but I&#39;d love to find out that it was. That would be so fucking cool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright here we go, I&#39;ll try and make this as short and as detailed as possible. Just so you all know I was completely sober throughout this experience. </p>

<p>Around 11pm late August of 2011 I went outside on my friends balcony on the second floor of his apt complex to have a cigarette. It&#39;s dark, low clouds, nothing out of the ordinary. Except the clouds are moving north extremely fast. Whatever, assumed it was wind. </p>

<p>Then I see a star. Looked exactly like a star, same brightness, size, color. Then it moved, slowly at first, then sped up dramatically and cut into the clouds like butter. As it passed through the clouds it would &quot;stir&quot; them, best way I can describe it, and would leave a path through the clouds where it cut through. </p>

<p>Pretty much shit my pants at this point. The light started traveling in large circles, making quick turns, doubling back, just endless looping through the clouds. Then I started seeing more of them. </p>

<p>They all looked like stars, but stars were impossible to see with the amount of clouds. Stars also don&#39;t cross the entire sky in about 3-5 seconds. </p>

<p>What would appear to be one, would break into two, or three, or four, and fly in formation, cutting through the clouds at very high levels of speed, and eventually disband. </p>

<p>I would at points have 5-10 of these in my direct line of sight, wherever I looked in the sky. </p>

<p>By 1am I decided to go home, my friend didn&#39;t believe me, he has terrible eyes and looked up for a moment, didn&#39;t see anything, then went right back to playing video games. </p>

<p>My home is very near the evergreen state college, extremely good stargazing area, and very dark. I sat on my front porch looking to the north straight ahead, large amount of sky, with very dense forest surrounding me. </p>

<p>Lights still appearing, but now clouds are dispersing. Once the clouds were gone, stars were visible, and what would appear to be a star, would suddenly start moving at very high speeds just a slight moment after I locked my eyes on them. Every single light that started moving would travel the exact same way at this point, would start moving south, going directly over my head, and behind my house out of sight at very very high speeds. There could have been hundreds of them. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m scared, I felt as if they were aware of my presence, and of me watching them, why else would they be moving in such a way? The clouds were gone at this point, and the lights were much more visible to me and were clearly trying to blend in with the night sky as stars. </p>

<p>My best idea is that they were playing with the clouds earlier in the night, swirling them like paint on a canvas. Such an unreal sight, seeing clouds move and be twisted and stirred like that. Never seen clouds move that fast ever before or ever since. </p>

<p>So at this point, it&#39;s about 2am, and I&#39;m freaked out. I go inside, to the second story of my house, and go into my living room with a whole wall of glass looking over the forest facing north east, pretty much directly towards ft lewis miles and miles away.</p>

<p>Not only am I still seeing the lights, but far in the distance I see clouds, and what appears to be massive black triangles slowly turning over in and out of the clouds. I can&#39;t stress how big these were, could have been as long as a football field, or longer, or wider. Absolutely massive. Very very strange aerial maneuvers... They would almost just be floating in the clouds slowly turning over, or pointing their nose straight up and rolling over backwards, very slowly. The most I saw at once was three, all in close proximity with each other, going in and out of dense clouds. Could have been more, but at least three. None of them had any markings, no lights, very sharp edges, like an almost perfect equilateral triangle. </p>

<p>Now it&#39;s about 3am, I have my nose against the big glass windows watching, and the clouds start to get too dense in the distance to see the triangles. </p>

<p>The windows are open, it&#39;s extremely quiet outside, and from the east, one of these triangles flies by, directly in front of me, just barely over my house and the trees. Maybe 75ft above me. Extremely close... I could not have had a better vantage point. There was absolutely no sound. It must have been traveling... I don&#39;t know... 400mph? I&#39;ve never in my life seen something move this fast. It was at least 300ft long, maybe bigger. No markings, flat sides, sharp edges, all black, no lights. </p>

<p>If there is a &quot;top of the line&quot; version of these things, this was it. Unreal technology. It really scared me, and at this point I ran to my couch, curled up, and waited for daylight. </p>

<p>I hope this wasn&#39;t too long of a read. I still don&#39;t really know what to make of it. A friend has said that the lights I saw were &quot;djinn&quot; and that they have been seen for centuries. Any thoughts are welcome. </p>

<p>Edit: words. </p>

<p>I feel if you had seen something as remarkable as what you claim to have seen by this point, that it is extremely strange for you to let it go like that.</p>

<p>Frankly I find it completely unbelievable that you would allow him to blow it off like that. Sounds like the kind of thing that would happen in a movie but never in real life.</p>

<p>Also, no pictures? No video? Why didn&#39;t you have a phone on you? Your story makes no sense to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I do. Holy shit I should have made that part of the OP. I know a LOT about chemtrails. The accusations of wholesale spraying of silver oxide, barium, aluminum etc are accurate, though somewhat overstated. Chemtrailing is real and its purpose IS weather modification. Sadly, this is a case where enthusiasm greatly exceeds intelligence, and the projects (while well-meaning) are woefully short on farsight. Many agricultural and air-quality action groups constantly barrage DARPA with FOI requests, but the truth of it is that it&#39;s all experimentation based on ideas that are 30 years old. They turn a deaf ear because Contracts. Personally, I see great value in Geoengineering - I just think that the current experiments are conducted by morons who can&#39;t accept the danger it poses. </p>

<p>Chemtrails are real. They are what we think they are. They are distributed with the express purpose and intent of modifying weather in a positive and pro social way. They just don&#39;t end up being positive or pro social. </p>

<p>I would encourage everyone interested in chemtrails to continue their research and opposition. The information is out there, and all but the most alarming noise is almost 100% accurate. </p>

<p>Nanotech is obvious and already in use by GMO corps as well as MIC. Same goes for BIO, INFO, and COG. Sewing them together into something useful or pragmatic is something I had hoped the Utah Datacenter would be powerful enough to do, but since that thing is spazzing out three times a week I doubt it has much use at all yet. The four disciplines, three really, are not that compatible due to paradigm. Some are purely physical, some are almost purely theoretical. There are occasional reports of successful nano-human compatibility, and I am particularly interested in the use of nanotech to detect early signs of tissue rejection in heart transplants, but the idea of these four disciplines merging in some significant way is, at least to me, still sci-fi. I don&#39;t doubt that experiments and procedures are underway, but I also don&#39;t doubt that people have been jerking off to this since the 1950s.</p>

<p>I will say that my work with prosthetics has included many attempts to create an interface between nanotech and human physiology, and to some degree this has been successful. At first it was an attempt to give robots tactile awareness, but lately our focus has been on giving amputees tactile awareness via their prosthetics.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what else to say.</p>

<p>Do you think that may be you weren&#39;t privy to the deeper program where they have been successful but and are in the process of refining the tech.  Basically from my research on the outside looking in they figured out out to grow rat brain cells and train them to fly an f22 like 10 years ago now.  They&#39;ve basically taken that and are expanding it to try and give it AI, and then plug it into the Google server farms.</p>

<p>On a normative level you seem to imply that manipulating human consciousness for the benefit of private faction is something that is inherently wrong; your aversion to calling people &quot;sheeple&quot; and your unwillingness to continue with ELF research speaks to this.</p>

<p>In the field of microwave weapons and such is there an active debate over the normative consequences with regards to human autonomy, or is it more &quot;well the monies are there are that&#39;s that&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know, microwave weapons tech is so far ONLY developed in the context of crowd control / riot dispersal. I know of no past or current research to indicate ELF weaponry as described (perhaps) by the Naval Yard Shooter, as the RHIC part of RHIC-EDOM was more or less abandoned in the 90s. I have, however, done significant personal and university-funded research into the various claims of mental and cognitive disruption caused by ELF fields surrounding major power line corridors and other high-energy sources (primarily in Sweden) and there is no doubt in my mind that prolonged ELF exposure is physically as well as psychologically harmful in a serious way. </p>

<p>As far as &quot;we gettin paid, who cares?&quot; goes, yeah that&#39;s the norm. Add that to serious compartmentialization of workflow and you get ignorance and greed in the same pack. </p>

<p>Thanks for endorsing my reason for leaving. Microwave weaponry is something I am absolutely not going to lend my intelligence to. That stuff is terrifying beyond my ability to comprehend. I have seen object as well as human testing, and all I can think about is the fact that there is NO justification for it. It&#39;s absolutely horrific. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That high pitched sound is a by-product of the electronics working. It is caused by nearly all electronics, even low energy devices, and can get louder as components age and deteriorate (Think old CRT TVs and monitors). It&#39;s like the grumblings of an engine, caused just by electronics functioning and vibrating at incredibly high frequencies. They are rarely engineered in such a way as to prevent the noise, as doing so requires more expensive parts and more time engineering. It is deemed unimportant and unnecessary to fix in most cases because only a relatively small number of people can hear this noise. You will notice the noise more often in cheaper electronics, and the absence of it is usually a sign of higher quality build and components. It is also becoming less prevalent as more components are shrunk down onto chips, reducing the number of noisy components.</p>

<p>It drives me nuts, I&#39;ve heard the noise since I was a child. Switching to LCD/LEDs was huge. LED lights are a huge upgrade to the noise of florescent and CFL lights, especially as the latter ages. Power adapters are often big culprits of this noise, they are produced as cheap as possible and usually placed out of the way so nobody cares if they make a lot of noise. I keep my modem in a seperate room though just because the adapter on that one can be heard by 90% of people and is loud enough to be heard from anywhere in the room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How often do people develop revolutionary secret technology in their garage? Years ago I heard a story from a man, who claimed to develop a special frisbee/boomerang device. Apparently it was cut similar to a saw blade, but with the teeth at special angles, so it would fly back to them nomatter how it was thrown. Apparently they tried to patent it and the feds stole the technology. They didn&#39;t have a prototype or anything, but they seemed dead serious.</p>

<p>All this stuff like the TR-3b you are talking about is out there in the public domain from a guy named Edgar Fouche who worked out at Nellis AFB as a tech and later for the NSA/was employed by the DoD for 20-30 years with all his documents published to prove his work history - but - ya know, he goes a little further and talks about aliens and how they have(or had) alien technology out there and had an orbital communications array used for a military space program/remotely controlling an unmanned space ship they have up there to service satellites, I can&#39;t remember what he called it but it was a uniquely memorable program name and &quot;Manta&quot; reminds me of it,  he&#39;s still actively &#39;out there&#39; in the community and willing to talk to people with the right backgrounds.</p>

<p>What is the general mindset like with the people you worked with or directly associated with at work? Is it like basically &quot;science first/immediate work first/forget ideologies while there&quot;? Or do they realize they are involved in some seriously fucked up shit?

    <div class="md"><p>This is double-edged. Yes, agencies and private persons possess the ability and imagination to covertly control behavior, but it&#39;s not that clear-cut nor sinister. Well, okay, it&#39;s that sinister. The ability to &quot;program&quot; people exists, but it&#39;s basically hypnosis and NLP. That&#39;s more or less the reason RHIC was abandoned. I don&#39;t know of anything myself, and I can&#39;t speak to Manchurian Candidate stuff, but I do believe that some of the recent shooting events were staged, if not by LEO then by media. Of course, this staging is mostly in the name of hype and quick bucks rather than any sort of wider agenda. That&#39;s my opinion, at least. Certainly very little seems legit about Sandy Hook and DC Naval Yard, and I have the usual suspicions regarding the state of freedoms in e 9/11 - which I also have reason to believe (as you do) that almost nothing about it is on the level. Especially Shanksville and WTC7</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t actually know anything beyond what you could read on Wikipedia, sorry. The papers and publications by JASON are pretty interesting, but ultimately I don&#39;t think they add up to much concrete. Think-tanks are awesome, and I love the work they do (&quot;work&quot;), but in the end they&#39;re just a bunch of smart guys offering their opinions re policy. When it comes to things like Rand or CATO, I kinda just read them for information as to the current mindset of reasonable rogue scientists and philosophers. There&#39;s nothing inherently incredible about their discussions, but there isn&#39;t anything particularly gripping, either. Personally, I hope that these institutions create a mindset of openness to new ideas and radical thinking in a futuristic sense, but on the whole I&#39;m not sure that they have significant impact of Real World stuff. I&#39;d love to be educated on the subject, though.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on HAARP then? Just having toured the facility is not spectacularly unusual. They give tours and open houses from time to time. I do not believe in the HAARP conspiracy theories, but many people here do, and if you have any insight beyond what the standard explanation in the tour is, I think many people would be very interested. </p>

<p>I was speaking more on behalf of the surveillance blimps, like this one. Given the increase in drone capability, in what capacity are these blimps utilized? Are they used domestically? I&#39;ve heard people theorize that the &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; UFO was just a surveillance blimp moving towards the Mexican border to monitor movements. Weaponized blimps are interesting... you can just bomb the shit out of people and stay hovered right over target until it&#39;s completely eliminated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scientific research is such a fucking pain in the ass. Jockeying for grants, trying to skew results to fit what&#39;s expected, replicating incredibly boring and useless experiments... I was disillusioned by the time I left school in 2000. I wanted to be a shadowy dude doing shadowy things for a shadowy agency. It was stupid and egotistical, but I was plenty able to rationalize it to myself. And the money&#39;s good. But yeah, I&#39;m glad to know that other contractors leave due to ethical consistency. At first you feel like you&#39;ve done something Bad and that the gubberment is gonna trail you forever, but they don&#39;t. They don&#39;t care. They know that a voice in the wilderness is a tree falling with no one around to hear it. Mad props to your friend, and to everyone like him. Some (and only some) of the DoJ shit is too troubling for conscientious persons.</p>

<p>As far as new employment, I am blissfully free of financial obligations and such since removing myself from DARPA. I have plenty of money, I hunt and fish and garden for my food, I have great insurance (somehow), and I don&#39;t fear repercussion. Believe me, if I thought for a moment that I would get in hot water for this kind of post, I never would have done it. The truth is that they simply don&#39;t care. Whether that&#39;s arrogance or realism, whatever. I&#39;m satisfied with my life, they&#39;re satisfied with my relative silence. I don&#39;t know enough to trip any flags, anyway.</p>

Resonance-inducing helmets have been used for decades in academic settings, and they can set the brain to any frequency desired. Much research on &quot;alien abduction phenomena&quot; has taken place at the University of Sudbury on exactly this thing. Even tactile and metasensory stuff can be recreated, that is to say the &quot;feeling that this is absolutely real&quot;. It&#39;s fascinating, but not something I have more than second-hand experience with.</p>

<p>2) the &quot;sounds&quot; are something I am EXTREMELY interested in. I don&#39;t know anything about that, but I follow each new report with growing interest.</p>

<p>3) No zero-point energy in my history, though I sincerely hope there is serious work being done in this field, even theoretically</p>

<p>4) Most I know about ISON is that we were afraid its electrical nature could disrupt worldwide communications and other electronic stuff. To the best of my understanding, none of this is likely. ISON is a fascinating comet in a lot of ways, but not in an Apocalyptic way, I&#39;m afraid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are always reports of inventions that will never be released. There are several cancer treatments (holistic and scientific / Big Pharma) which won&#39;t see the light of day, but I don&#39;t know why. Maybe they aren&#39;t effective enough? Maybe not profitable enough yet? That really IS a conspiracy, imho.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s discuss Shanksville. Were you convinced by the photos? Did you like the story of brave American Citizens attacking the cockpit? Were you moved by the sacrifice, the ingenuity, the heroism?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen aerial photos of the plane landing, evacuating, and several trucks driving off. I have spoken on the telephone to those who responded to the &quot;crash&quot; and I know (quite intimately, though from a photo-interpreter&#39;s perspective) that no plane crashed in that location at that time. I have heard, from quasi-reliable &quot;friends&quot;, that the debris field looked on the ground exactly as I concluded from the pictures. No wreck, no bodies, no luggage, just a gash in the ground with some random bits scattered about as if whoever was in charge couldn&#39;t care less what was realistic. The phone calls are impeachable in a very serious way. The flight recorders undiscovered, though reported to have been found. And worst of all, the insinuation that these passengers, though there were none, acted heroically and without self-preservation instinct in order to bring down this &quot;hijacked&quot; jetliner. The narrative is flawed, the photographs are ridiculous, the testimony is revealing.</p>

<p>It was theater, expressly designed to make the American citizenry whip up into a stiff-egg frenzy of patriotic meringue. I still believe that two aircraft struck WTC 1 and 2 on Sept 11, but I still maintain that the PA and Pentagon hits were bullshit. And I&#39;m certainly not convinced that a pair of airliners brought down those towers.</p>

<p>my friend didn&#39;t believe me, he has terrible eyes and looked up for a moment, didn&#39;t see anything, then went right back to playing video games. </p>

<p>I feel if you had seen something as remarkable as what you claim to have seen by this point, that it is extremely strange for you to let it go like that.</p>

<p>Frankly I find it completely unbelievable that you would allow him to blow it off like that. Sounds like the kind of thing that would happen in a movie but never in real life.</p>

<p>Also, no pictures? No video? Why didn&#39;t you have a phone on you? Your story makes no sense to me.</p>
