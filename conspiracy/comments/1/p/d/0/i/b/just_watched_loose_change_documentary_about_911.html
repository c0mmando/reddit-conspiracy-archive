    <div class="md"><p>Start with this one posted above.  Loose change is old and Dylan and the crew had issues and I think they were mislead in certain regards to intentionally misdirect people.  Other videos like the one above seem to be the biggest and best collection of all the info that lays it out terribly well.</p>

<p>Then, I would like to direct you to <a href="http://www.citizeninvestigationteam.com/nsa.html">this one</a>, as an addendum to it in which has more details about Flt. 77 than needed to be included in the one above.  It&#39;s importance is minor in the scheme of things what with WTC7, but it shows the level of trickery they used on that day to fool people, to me is still makes my jaw drop.  I should do the same to yours, I think.</p>

<p>You&#39;re on the right track though.  There are not many &quot;counter points&quot; other than outright lies and bullshit videos created by people who will NOT address the real facts at all.  They will tug at emotions and wow you with special effects and video editing, and outright confuse the details by mixing real info with false info.</p>

<p>The only good videos people will direct you to will only solidify the argument.  There can be no doubt that Thermate was used.  There can be no doubt they fell at free fall speeds.  There is only one option now to the person who truly has their mind open to all possibilities.  </p>

<p>You are running the machine for a corrupt Gov&#39;t using you and your country to wage war on countries overseas and a war against you at home.  You are the enemy.  The more you know the less power they have.  Get cracking man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Just came across those and what I like about them is it entertains the official myth by taking it as reported and documented in the 9/11 Omission Report, and lining it up with the news reports and other available facts from the day. It very clearly establishes that the official story is lie after lie after omission. Should be food for thought for anyone who still believes the official story.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So, I just finished watching this &quot;documentary&quot; and while I believe it raises a lot of good questions I&#39;m sure there are discrepancies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every single time, I have found the same. It is to be expected, these people work with limited access to crucial information and sometimes they extrapolate in speculation alone which can be induced in error. For example, saying that no plane hit the pentagon or that flight 93 never crashed into the ground.</p>

<p>Mind you that I am not saying that it is a lie, I am just stating that in order to tackle the points correctly you have to first take into account the evidence that you have. There were plane parts and debris discovered on both occasions, regardless of they being planted or not is not the issue, you have to take that into account first as they are evidence nonetheless. Only after you have all of the evidence and situation analyzed you may speculate when something fails to corroborate the evidence and this is one example of what I am talking about:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They found engines and plane parts in the pentagon crash, however the pentagon, being one of the most secure places on earth, has only 4 frames that depict no final conclusion on the identity of the airplane. The FDR they released also fails to back up the scenario of the attack, according to the FDR the airplane was flying higher than it should for it to hit the lampposts on the street. This opens room for the possibility that the FDR was faked and the airplane that hit the pentagon was not the one they reported.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, you should always take what you have into account and see if it can fit with reasonable thought, once you find something that can prove it to be false then you can speculate. This is how a reasonable and concrete analysis should be conducted.</p>

<p>All of this to say that even if you believe or don&#39;t believe on the official story or truth documentaries you must not forget to think for yourself, keep an open mind and reason between what you see, what you know and what is contradictory, and this (for me) has been a big issue with both sides of the story, they both fail sometimes to approach crucial points without aknowledging the counterpoints by speculating too much while ignoring evidence.</p>

<p>As to what I think about all of this is that there are quite a few very important holes in the official story that make me believe they are lying about everything:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pentagon had no recording of the plane, despite having the entire ring perimeter filled with CCTVs, all they had were 4 frames that are inconclusive on the airplane identification</p></li>
<li><p>The commission report refusing to aknowledge the possiblity of use of bombs on 911 under the statement of &quot;no witnesses or evidence&quot; while there was in fact many firemen that clearly stated the existence of bombs inside the towers</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that the ~17% top section of WTC1 (being weakest and lighter than the rest of the building) managed to completely pulverized the entire 83% building left by means of gravity alone defying all common knowledge of physics, it is impossible. Same goes for the other 2 towers.</p></li>
<li><p>There are few airport recordings showing the terrorists, yet not one recording shows any of the victims that boarded the airplanes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And these are just the first that come to my mind.</p>

<p>So to your last question, &quot;counterpoint to this film&quot;, there is only one answer really, it&#39;s you. Wether you accept it, partially or fully, is up to you, and you do best to hear both sides of the story; Debunkers and truthers equally - because sometimes people make mistakes and this might make you also repeat this mistake unless you think for yourself and see the other side with an open mind. If you are stuck at some point or do not understand some things then just ask around and research it.</p>

<p>Also sovereignMan posted a great documentary that I have been looking for quite sometime, it is long but it might bring a new perspective on the 911. I haven&#39;t seen it yet but that doesn&#39;t mean that I will eat everything they say, I am going to watch it, think about what they say and come to my own conclusions or research something that I find confusing/incorrect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not my favorite but they were the first (?). I actually kind of hate youtube videos because it&#39;s really easy to sensationalize anything. They really should have a feature that writes out a transcript. Video is <em>passive</em> media. Text encourages active analysis and thinking. It&#39;s also easier to detect bias. In the end the only things we really know about 9/11 is what <em>didn&#39;t</em> or could <em>not</em> have happened due to a lack of evidence or even physics itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My personal opinion is that <a href="http://www.911missinglinks.com/watch-movie/">9/11 Missing Links</a> is the best as far as the geopolitical reasonings and motives. It starts out as bit of a history lesson that shows a specific pattern of false flag events and how 9/11 fits directly into this pattern and who the perpetrators of this long line of events are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with SovereignMan and bittermanscolon.  I woke up to the 9-11 conspiracy about a year after it happened.  I&#39;ve watched all the documentaries I possibly could and had felt like I knew all there was to know, but a few weeks ago I watched one that I found because of reddit/conspiracy and it changed my perspective once again.</p>

<p>For anyone that has not seen &quot;Where did the Towers Go?&quot;
link:<a href="http://youtu.be/RqbcsU0_RjU">http://youtu.be/RqbcsU0_RjU</a></p>

<p>It is a documentary that shows that it was most likely a directed energy weapon that brought down the twin towers and that a hurricane off the coast of New York may of had something to do with it.
I always thought that the buildings had been brought down in a controlled demolition, but not anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sir, there was unexploded thermitic material found in the dust on 9/11.  There is zero evidence that I&#39;m aware of that would show anything related to some kind of space gun.</p>

<p>K, go with the evidence that is actually usable in a court of law and that wouldn&#39;t get people laughed out of town.  One we have a leg to stand on, the other is not anything usable.  That or show something more than this video as evidence.  It is not.</p>

<p>a counterpoint </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The commission report. Thats the real counter point, everything else is just noise by people on both sides.</p>

<p>The commission report is supposedly the &quot;real&quot; happenings of that day as well as the official account. Because of the &quot;commission report&quot; our politicians used as backing for their actions. once you start going back and forth wuth the nay-sayers, you lose site and it becomes a case of finding out what <em>actually</em> happened rather than getting the point across of &quot;we dont know, but we know its not what they say&quot; which is the true message you should be pressing</p>

<p>break down the &quot;official&quot; story and then the &quot;counterpoints&quot; dont matter. Fires, from jetfuel or otherwise do not melt nor &quot;weaken&quot; steel. the &quot;pancake&quot; affect would still leave the center columns of the building and only the floors would fall....etc etc.</p>

<p>There probably isnt a human alive (except cheney, but hes hardly human) whos knows what actually happened, but we could say for damn sure it didnt happen like we were told.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. A counterpoint would be a website like 911myths. There are other debunking sites as well. Doing plenty of research on the topic however, you will find that there really is no good explanation for the 2.25 seconds of freefall in tower 7, and of course the Israeli connection. I recommend watching 3 things all on youtube. AE911: Experts speak out, War by Deception, and David Chandler&#39;s 3 part series (WTC7 in Freefall).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This &quot;Documentary&quot; is 90% bullshit. Their sources are terrible, they purposely misrepresent data, and at times completely fabricate &quot;facts&quot; to try and prove their point. </p>

<p>Treat none of the garbage they say as fact. With all the crap surrounding 9/11 it&#39;s best to actually look at the scientific and political realities of the situation and base your feelings on that.</p>

<p>Personally I think it was allowed to happen by the US government because of all the &quot;coincidences&quot; that allowed the towers and pentagon to be hit. </p>

<p>In my opinion anything beyond that is PURE speculation. There is not enough scientific evidence or a visible paper trail to suggest the government actually played an active part in the attacks. Additionally, there still remains no unified investigation that is worthy to be called such by the 9/11 truth movement.</p>

<p>As far as I see it, both the Government and the &quot;Truth&quot; movement are lying through their teeth for their own motives. </p>
