<p>I feel like every opportunity shows up </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah. Not yet. The reason why nothing has seemed to happen yet is because we havent been pushed hard enough.</p>

<p>whike i agree all of us, every generation, has repeatedly dropped the ball to stop this negative snowball effect, i do not believe the point has arrived where we will make a forced stand. Something about the millenial generation, we are intelligent. We all know whats going on. Most of us are mentally prepared, and mental preparation trumps material preparation. Anything you hoard can be taken. But your mental preparation for what needs to be done when the time comes, that cant be taken away. Ideas outlive those that harbor them, and they are contagious. More infectious than tyranny and more prevalent than greed. </p>

<p>The idea of freedom is stronger thsn ever in the millenials. We will succeed where our parents failed.</p>

<p>but like i said, the time hasnt come yet, and hopefully it wont need to. But, as in a gane of chess, you dont bring out your big guns till the endgame. First, you set up your opening, read your opponent, try to manipulate the midgame to your favor, and when the opponent makes the wrong move, all the pieces youve set forth come together. Check mate. </p>

<p>All in time dude. In the meantime, enjoy life at its fullest. Keep an eye on things, but live while you can. Live as if you are someones role model. When shtf, people will look up to those who stay positive and are mentally prepared to remain so during tough situations. </p>

<p>All in due time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to add that they may have the money power and everything that entails, but we have the people power. There are way way way way more of us than there are them. We outnumber them a million to one. But to use the people power, we have to organize the people. To organize requires knowledge, and for people to have the knowledge it must first be spread via communication. And that&#39;s what I just did by communicating this. We must all communicate what needs to be communicated to bring the simmer to a boil. It doesn&#39;t work unless EVERYONE is angry. That&#39;s the only way people power will beat the money power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason we cannot change things because every individual that makes up the majority believes that they cannot change anything. </p>

<p>We give these men power to rule over us and so it seems rather silly that we can&#39;t seem to control them but they have seemed to keep us locked in this system where we serve them and can&#39;t speak against them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what OP is saying though. </p>

<p>I feel like no matter what, history repeats itself and nothing changes because human beings are flawed and don&#39;t wish change or for things to really get better. Sure there are individuals who care but the majority just wishes to live and be lazy. They would be equally satisfied if the government did everything about their lives and knew everything about them. They will argue about stupid shit because they want to feel like they have beliefs and opinions. </p>

<p>The people who waste their time trying to change things and inform others, are the ones that end up &quot;wasting their lives&quot; because they didn&#39;t choose to chase money and ignore the horrible reality like the rest of them. If you aren&#39;t a cog in the machine, then you aren&#39;t successful in life. If you speak against them, then you are probably weird and no one wants to side with you. </p>

<p>It&#39;s no one&#39;s job to save the world and that&#39;s the problem. That&#39;s why we try to do it ourselves. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s go for a walk. </p>

<p>The leaves fell hard today and the air is pungent. The farmland all around has been tilled under, the soil needs cover. The trees are shedding, in season, their blanket and cascade softly in the wet night air. </p>

<p>Earlier today, they were crisp and noisy, breaking away and clattering down through the branches.</p>

<p>My feet, walking with purpose, in the rain, crush those leaves as I go and the smell is thick in my nostrils. It&#39;s comforting, honestly. </p>

<p>Vibrant green, to rainbow hues of dark burgundy, stark orange, brightest yellows and they were on the trees for just one Season and they gave me hope in the Spring, shade in the Summer and a quickness in my step as Fall would call for Winter!</p>

<p>I&#39;ll walk with you through the seasons, by my leaving.</p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome to turn me into a stump at your fear of my brittle branches but you&#39;ve got to decide how much life you want to invest in this walk, this death of you!</p>

<p>There are events that shape each of us. Your pain is real. I&#39;m quite old and selfish and want you to live so that you can experience your life in all the Seasons, no matter what!</p>

<p>Sleep well, reddit! Dream better!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Killing yourself is giving up. Please, we need the few informed from the silent majority to stay strong. You, me and a select few are the part of the 99% who see beyond the facade. Many of this elite group of critical thinkers are on reddit, but they can be found elsewhere too.</p>

<p>I would suggest you take a break from the information (reddit, msm, news, etc.) and just reconnect with people in your life. Stop talking to people about the oppression. This is taking you over. Give yourself permission to just take a break. Go talk to someone about how you feel. I was starting to get depressed and bogged down a couple of years ago. The counsellor actually agreed with me - he told me I was one of the few sane people he had met in a long while. </p>

<p>You are not alone - many of us share your despair. We have the internet on our side and things are going to change. The foundations of tradition are crumbling right now. When they start to really change, it will come fast. Stick around to enjoy the outcome. </p>

<p>I agree with you. this society needs to collapse. We can&#39;t build a new one on a crumbling foundation. We need to start from scratch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well...please don&#39;t kill yourself but please, don&#39;t take everything you see on this subreddit to heart...it&#39;s clear that a majority of the posts here are either extremely sensationalised or based on anecdotal &#39;evidence&#39;. The world is no where near as bad as people here make it out to be; people like the ones in this subreddit have existed in every time period in history and in hindsight would you say that those time periods were particularly bad? You would probably look at their alleged conspiracy theories and laugh to yourself at how crazy they are. The same applies here. </p>

<p>Observe, yes, but make your own informed opinions without relying on a website as superficial as reddit to be the base for your ideology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you kill yourself, they win. Somewhere, a box will be checked and an official somewhere will smile. You will then be gone, nothing more than another annoyance dissipated into the ether, your bones destined to become nothing more than dirt.</p>

<p>OR, you can stay alive and live life. Realize your higher destiny. Accept the fact that you were created in the image of God, and as such are owned by no man - whether they claim to rule over your mind or not.</p>

<p>You can accept the fact that the fallen world isn&#39;t perfect and is in fact corrupt, but that there is still joy to be had and purposes to be fulfilled. That you matter, and you do have influence. Your influence might not be over nations but it can be over individuals whose paths cross with yours.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t give up so easily. Don&#39;t put your hope in this world or your faith in men. There&#39;s more to this existence than the hopeless landscape you see on the evening news.</p>

<p>That, my friends, is a temporary illusion meant to demoralize you. Don&#39;t let them win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This happens to me every now and then. Started waking up bit by bit several years ago. Step one was abandoning all mainstream news immediately and forever. Then things like Sandy Hook or Boston happen, and people just go about gup-gup-gupping like blind goldfish. Honestly the average person today would need a fucking bomb to go off in their front yard to wake them. I mean that literally. And yet still too many would see their own blown-in living room windows, a smoldering crater, and sit down to see what CNN says about their brand-new bomb crater.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had several bad spells with this stuff and people on this sub have shared what they do to get past it. At this point the strongest means of fighting back is liberating yourself. </p>

<p>Exercise. Just strengthen your body. You don&#39;t have to run 8 miles a day. Do fifty pushups and some curls. Do 50 tummy crunches. Do ten butt-to-ground squats for your legs and lower back. It&#39;s 15-20 minutes a day. Strengthen your blood with good diet. Practice gardening. You need 10 square feet of dirt. Failing that, growing pots. Make yourself healthy and you&#39;re able to handle the doom and gloom (the real stuff anyway) better mentally, and that&#39;s no joke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please don&#39;t. It is not as depressing if you understand history. What is happening today has happened over and over again in the past. It is cyclical and we are not going through anything our ancestors did not. The future is uncertain but not hopeless. There will be a window of opportunity that will open when the masses see the real problems and search for a savior. This will only happen when things get real bad. The choice of that savior will be key. If they choose badly things will get even worse if they chose wisely we will have a real chance at change.       </p>
