People don&#39;t understand the slow-creep of totalitarianism. Many people envision a violent military coup as a pretext to dictatorship, when in fact many times the most brutal of dictators seized their power within the scope of the law. That is one reason I get reaaally fucking irritated when people on here try and tell me that &quot;I get that the NSA spying is wrong, but it&#39;s legal!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NSA is an important military asset, and I&#39;m not talking about wire taps. The NSA provides reconnaissance satellites and drones for military operations. Without them, troops on the ground would have a grave disadvantage. </p>

<p>The FBI is important for, what else, investigating federal crimes and arresting federal criminals. Without them, many fraud, murder, kidnapping, extortion, smuggling and other crimes would go unpunished as state agencies would be unable to pursue criminals across state lines.</p>

<p>The CIA is an important intelligence gathering agency within the US. Not only do they collect intelligence for security reasons, but they also collect information to help the US fit into global politics. Without the CIA, our embassies would lack knowledge of the countries they&#39;re in, our government would be in the dark on global economy and politics, and our nation as a whole would be largely alienated. </p>

<p>You are being a bit narrow minded. These agencies all have multiple purposes and to dismantle them would be to kick a leg out from under the US. While they all may do things which are questionable at best and unlawful at worst, totally shutting them down would end more than just spying.</p>

<p>Also, why is your text post all in quotes? Are you quoting someone?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand the divergence, but you&#39;re mistaken there.</p>

<p>Many military bases have been shutting down recently. Over thirty US military installations have closed and another twenty will be closing by the end of next year in Germany alone. </p>

<p>As well, those bases actually generate income. Maybe not for the US, but for surrounding areas. In fact, new cities are often built up around military bases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I used to fly as a crypto-linguist on RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft in the greater European theater during the latter years of the Cold War. My primary target of interest was East Germany. The Stasi became monstrously efficient using surveillance to enable their pathological need ‘to know everything’ – their very operating motto. However, <strong>I never imagined that the US would use the Stasi playbook</strong> as the template for its own state sponsored surveillance regime and turning not only its own citizens into virtual persons of interest, but also millions of citizens in the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Do we really want to become subject to and subjects of a secret surveillance state? In a surveillance state everybody is suspicious and laws protecting privacy and citizen sovereignty are regarded as inconvenient truths bypassed in the name of keeping the rest of us safe and secure as justification for the wanton and surreptitious bulk copy collection and unbridled access to vast amounts of data about our lives. Unfortunately, this surveillance regime has now grown into a globe girdling system that has gone far beyond prosecuting terrorism and other international crimes and wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Your Committee faces the challenge of <strong>dealing with a secret hidden shadow surveillance state dissolving the very heart of freedom and liberty</strong> and our respective citizen rights and using this power to expand sovereign-free zones – even when it undermines the very fabric of society, breaks trust between nations and endangers the very mechanisms we use for commerce and trade.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to argue your accusations.</p>

<p>But I will argue the funding of the CIA.</p>

<p>As I said before.. The CIA gathers <em>all</em> intelligence for the United States. Without the CIA we would not know anything on an official level about other nations. Our embassies would be lost in the sauce, our Department of State would have zero insight into foreign relations, our other operations on foreign soil would have zero foundation to work off of. We would have nothing. </p>

<p>So rather than fixing a problem, you want us to entirely demolish  the CIA. Rather than trying to reform, you want it just to stop existing. You want us to be blind, deaf, and dumb to the world around us. You want us to become a hermit state like North Korea, ignorant of the world around us. You would want the future leaders of this nation to make decisions on nothing more faith and suspicion, because that&#39;s all we would have without the CIA constantly, actively collecting, analyzing, and reporting data. </p>

<p>Where do you think we get the information to regulate international trade, relations, cooperation, pretty much anything we do outside our borders? Because the official source, in the military at least, is the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/">CIA World Factbook</a>. An awesome source of international information that we would be without if not for the CIA. </p>
