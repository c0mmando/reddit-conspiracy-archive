       If they control the truth about how the past has played out, then that by nature will render you unable to put current events into historical context. People don't understand the slow-creep of totalitarianism. Many people envision a violent military coup as a pretext to dictatorship, when in fact many times the most brutal of dictators seized their power within the scope of the law. That is one reason I get reaaally fucking irritated when people on here try and tell me that "I get that the NSA spying is wrong, but it's legal!"

       The NSA is an important military asset, and I'm not talking about wire taps. The NSA provides reconnaissance satellites and drones for military operations. Without them, troops on the ground would have a grave disadvantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI is important for, what else, investigating federal crimes and arresting federal criminals. Without them, many fraud, murder, kidnapping, extortion, smuggling and other crimes would go unpunished as state agencies would be unable to pursue criminals across state lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA is an important intelligence gathering agency within the US. Not only do they collect intelligence for security reasons, but they also collect information to help the US fit into global politics. Without the CIA, our embassies would lack knowledge of the countries they're in, our government would be in the dark on global economy and politics, and our nation as a whole would be largely alienated.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are being a bit narrow minded. These agencies all have multiple purposes and to dismantle them would be to kick a leg out from under the US. While they all may do things which are questionable at best and unlawful at worst, totally shutting them down would end more than just spying.

       the three letter agencies all seem to EXCEED their charters from their inception...the cia was "born" under the National Security Act of 1947 by President Truman--the same President Truman who by 1963 was writing an editorial in the Washington Post on 12-22-63 which all but screamed out "the cia DID IT--the cia KILLED JFK"...In fact, some of the last documents Truman ever touched put forward his belief that the cia has outgrown itself from the moment of inception...

       The problem with it being the intelligence arm of the president is that presidents change, and there is data sensitive enough that just cannot be known by people outside of the inner-circle. Wasn't Eisenhower denied access to Area 51? It's kinda like that, unfortunately.

       Right, so I don't understand why they should be totally dismantled. That would mean having no intelligence gathering at all. We would have zero intelligence. Getting rid of these agencies is not the solution.

       Many military bases have been shutting down recently. Over thirty US military installations have closed and another twenty will be closing by the end of next year in Germany alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       As well, those bases actually generate income. Maybe not for the US, but for surrounding areas. In fact, new cities are often built up around military bases.

       "I used to fly as a crypto-linguist on RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft in the greater European theater during the latter years of the Cold War. My primary target of interest was East Germany. The Stasi became monstrously efficient using surveillance to enable their pathological need ‘to know everything’ – their very operating motto. However,
       <strong>
        I never imagined that the US would use the Stasi playbook
       </strong>
       as the template for its own state sponsored surveillance regime and turning not only its own citizens into virtual persons of interest, but also millions of citizens in the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we really want to become subject to and subjects of a secret surveillance state? In a surveillance state everybody is suspicious and laws protecting privacy and citizen sovereignty are regarded as inconvenient truths bypassed in the name of keeping the rest of us safe and secure as justification for the wanton and surreptitious bulk copy collection and unbridled access to vast amounts of data about our lives. Unfortunately, this surveillance regime has now grown into a globe girdling system that has gone far beyond prosecuting terrorism and other international crimes and wrongdoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your Committee faces the challenge of
       <strong>
        dealing with a secret hidden shadow surveillance state dissolving the very heart of freedom and liberty

       No where does he advocate the end of the NSA, CIA, or FBI. In fact, it sounds like he's defending the organizations in their original design of these agencies and criticizing their misuse.

       Again, nothing here is advocating the dissolution of the CIA, NSA, or FBI. To "shatter these agencies into a billion pieces" would be to cripple the US, and not just the federal government. Every state would lose a very big intelligence, law enforcement, and investigations hub.

       Your quotes are entirely unrelated to the end of these agencies.

       why the FUCK should Americans continue funding an "intelligence" agency that LIES like the Devil--and that was involved in KILLING JFK, MLK, and RFK...
      </p>
      <p>
       that's WHY they should close these fucking agencies down...beyond that the CIA is involved in what some are now calling the
       <strong>
        American Holocaust
       </strong>
       --the post-WWII period in which the CIA is implicated in the deaths of up to 15 million people thru their constant funding/training militias and destabilization programs...

       I'm not going to argue your accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I will argue the funding of the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said before.. The CIA gathers
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       intelligence for the United States. Without the CIA we would not know anything on an official level about other nations. Our embassies would be lost in the sauce, our Department of State would have zero insight into foreign relations, our other operations on foreign soil would have zero foundation to work off of. We would have nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So rather than fixing a problem, you want us to entirely demolish  the CIA. Rather than trying to reform, you want it just to stop existing. You want us to be blind, deaf, and dumb to the world around us. You want us to become a hermit state like North Korea, ignorant of the world around us. You would want the future leaders of this nation to make decisions on nothing more faith and suspicion, because that's all we would have without the CIA constantly, actively collecting, analyzing, and reporting data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where do you think we get the information to regulate international trade, relations, cooperation, pretty much anything we do outside our borders? Because the official source, in the military at least, is the
       <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/">
        CIA World Factbook
       </a>
       . An awesome source of international information that we would be without if not for the CIA.

       you obviously agree--yet it seems that being responsible for
       <strong>
        KILLING up to 15 million people
       </strong>
       doesn't bother you--all you want to know is where are these fuckers getting their next BILLION from...
      </p>
      <p>
       it's NOT just me who wants to demolish the fucking cia--JFK said the same fucking thing over 50 years ago...think anything has fucking changed??? NOPE--they still have the same set of Ivy league shitheads profiting off of WARS and Death Machines and "intelligence" contractors...the Dulles, the Bushes--maybe 50 years from now we'll know who was next in line (was his name Dick Cheney?)...

       is it possible that Hoover/FBI was essentially at WAR with the CIA when JFK was whacked? is that why FBI outed GHW Bush in that memo on 11-24-63 ? were the agencies all OUTING each other?

       the three letter agencies all seem to EXCEED their charters from their inception...the cia was "born" under the National Security Act of 1947 by President Truman--the same President Truman who by 1963 was writing an editorial in the Washington Post on 12-22-63 which all but screamed out "the cia DID IT--the cia KILLED JFK"...In fact, some of the last documents Truman ever touched put forward his belief that the cia has outgrown itself from the moment of inception...
