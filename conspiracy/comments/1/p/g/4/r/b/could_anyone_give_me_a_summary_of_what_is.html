    <div class="md"><p>You tube has a very interesting video called &quot;PRIME TIME ONLINE Did you hear that? &quot; A documentary of videos worldwide and theories. I posted it here quite awhile back. It is an older video not compiling the hundreds of new videos that came out after.  I posted the trumpet video in England today also. I am very interested in this subject myself. I have a multitude of theories and no exact answers with proof. Some of the videos are very creepy and the people recording have responses of absolute terror wich I would expect. Check out that video on youtube and let me know what you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has been watched. I&#39;m not quite sure what to think in regards to underground explosions and pressurizing bunkers as the cause to the sounds. It&#39;s an interesting idea though however it did lack actual evidence to these underground cities which I would of liked to see (however I&#39;ll start digging around to find some). The questions I have now are what is the cause? What could these sounds indicate, if anything? And what might we expect to see in the near or foreseeable future? </p>

<p>edit: found evidence of cities. Well, at least strong possibilities of modern ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have pondered the ideas and have studied theories of poles shifting slowly, or a warning of poles about to shift suddenly,tectonic plate movement, solar flare activity, ET vibrational healing frequencies like monks chanting, HAARP and weather mod. sciences, microwave tech. similar to haarp producing sounds that can control the masses, underground construction to prepare for solar flares/nukes/pandemics/tunnels being constructed/military bases and training, Mother Earth crying out for help, anomalies of entering the zero point, or even Earth cycles we as humans have yet to discover due to being a blip on evolutions time scale. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do know that the poles are shifting. Much like how our axis actually wobbles due to the gravitational forces from the objects in the solar system. Of course it&#39;s very slow though. But could it be from disturbances in the magnetic field? There has been record of the sun be at a &quot;high point&quot; in activity in recent years which does have an effect on our planet. Perhaps a weakening of the magnetic field in recent years has caused these sounds to actually appear? I suppose one of the biggest questions on the subject would be to answer is it more likely that these sounds are natural or artificial? Meaning is it from things like the sun or shifts in the tectonic plates? Or from nuclear detonations and underground cities? Would love your input there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly cannot have an answer to your question. I just sit with a wild imagination teeming with ideas.

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps sinkholes? The correlation between the two and the increase of both is strange. But just watching more videos and news reports on it. Gabe Hash youtube channel regularly reports on it. Others as well. There is a direct correlation to sun spot and solar flare activity. Perhaps solar flares speed up the magma core of Earth? We do know solar flares jump start junk DNA and cause strange upgrades. So perhaps that also. Solar Observer has an interesting youtube channel I&#39;ve followed for quite some time. His science shows direct weather extremes where solar flares hit Earth. He superimposes the images and 90% of the time he is right on. Maybe linking that with newly reported sounds would match up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/tj2mg/strange_earth_sounds_coming_from_the_sky_just/">this OP</a> regarding this very subject over a year ago, and some of the links are dead now as a result, but one of the absolute most intriguing things I found is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYGWG2_PB_Q"><em>this</em> right here</a>.  Pay close attention to the <em>very</em> first thing that happens - the first &quot;big&quot; sound you hear - literally within the first ten seconds of the clip.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIoVbbZTe_k">Sound familiar</a>? (pay no attention to the fear mongering titles, btw - just the sounds themselves)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not necessarily saying that all these sounds are some shit TPTB are pulling.  I totally grant that it could very well be something much greater than even them and may or may not come from this planet.  However, the point is that there are some <em>very</em> eerie and undeniable connections and similarities (<em>exact</em> similarities in some cases) that exist between where those types of sounds are coming from in fictional movies and where they&#39;re coming from in real life.  The connections and the sounds are simply <em>way</em> too similar to be ignored or written off as &quot;mere accidents&quot; or &quot;coincidences&quot; alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. Also, nice tie in there with the noise similarity. And as many of us has come to know there&#39;s no such thing as coincidences, ay? But anywho, read the OP. Are the 1% just trying to mess with the rest of us? I really don&#39;t know. This is something (the sounds that is) that is completely knew to me and unfortunately falling into the category of we can&#39;t know with the current evidence and observations. However, theories are huge to have and at least give starting points into further research upon the issue. I just hope it keeps up and will reveal itself more.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Are the 1% just trying to mess with the rest of us?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  They&#39;re definitely not in the game of &quot;just messing&quot; with us.  They&#39;re here about control.  Deep control.  I would say that <em>if</em> these sounds are coming from TPTB, and if they are coordinating the sounds with MSM fear propaganda like the War Of The Worlds movie, then their purpose behind doing all this would seem to be to, like Dr. Carol Rosin mentioned, to stage the final &quot;ultimate&quot; false flag attack against the people of the planet - an &quot;extraterrestrial 911&quot; of sorts - in order to round up and enslave everyone.</p>

<p>If this is what they&#39;re doing, they have to get the population nice and ready and sufficiently indoctrinated and scared <em>first</em> though - so that the people get fooled and believe that the false flag attack that gets staged is actually a <em>real</em> attack and then they&#39;ll start screaming and yelling for big brother to help them...jut like so much of America did after 9/11/2001.  Putting videos and movies out to prep and stir the mind and get it ready for fear do just that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we can&#39;t know with the current evidence and observations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, there&#39;s some information we CAN know just based on what&#39;s been observed so far - not the least of which involves 1) the stark similarities between the sounds in the outside world and the sounds that get presented in MSM &quot;scary alien attack&quot; movies, etc, 2) whistleblower testimony to the effect that TPTB have technology in the &quot;undisclosed sector&quot; that is at least 50-100 years more advanced than what is in the civilian sector, and 3) their tendency to stage false flag after false flag attack without any concern whatsoever about the many lives that those attacks destroy.  All these are already known facts.  Although they don&#39;t, of course, immediately, &quot;prove&quot; what these sounds are all about, they <em>do</em> give us justifiable cause to be VERY much on alert and on the look out for PTB chicanery.  So yeah.  There&#39;s definitely a lot we <em>can</em> know even now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, theories are huge to have and at least give starting points into further research upon the issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There you go, my brother.  You just said it yourself right there.  Very correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just hope it keeps up and will reveal itself more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, the truth will <em>definitely</em> reveal itself sooner or later.  That&#39;s the good news.  The bad news is that the truth that finally reveals itself in <em>this</em> regard might be that TPTB have been planning on killing a shit load of us off for quite a while and then enslaving the rest that live through it.</p>

<p>We can still overcome this as a people even if it <em>were</em> what was found out...but yeah.  One way or the other, sooner or later, the truth will most definitely reveal itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You actually lead me to thinking of another thing. More general than this and going outside of the immediate subject but I&#39;d say as a nation, or really the world at this point is screwed. Nor do I see a probable solution to turn things around. What with the 1% planning things are they are, the governments corrupt, and general population controlled into submission by means of a combination of Brave New World and 1984, we&#39;re effectively at a point of no return. </p>

<p>So of course the question is what do we do? Or even just what can we do? And for now I would say nothing with regards to &quot;fixing&quot; things. At this point, I say we let it crash.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>as a nation, or really the world at this point is screwed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha.  Yeah.  We kind of certainly seem that way.  I wouldn&#39;t in one sense disagree with this feeling.  However, it also seems that we are nearing the end of the American Empire, and <em>many</em> empires have come and gone.  Some lasted longer than others, but after they were gone, the world still kept going, kept turning, kept moving on.  I think even though we might have some seriously rough times ahead of us in the not too distant future, I think overall we as a people will be alright and will hopefully grow and learn from it and move forward as a species.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nor do I see a probable solution to turn things around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, there may very well not be a probable solution <em>for the American Empire</em>.  It may indeed be the end for America.  However, and again, the world will continue forth, and the people of the world will continue moving forward as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What with the 1% planning things are they are, the governments corrupt, and general population controlled into submission by means of a combination of Brave New World and 1984, we&#39;re effectively at a point of no return.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems that way.  I would not disagree.  We indeed seem to be nearing that point of no return.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So of course the question is what do we do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We as a citizenry need to come together as one being, one species, put all our silly, contrived, indoctrinated, manipulated, artificial differences aside, and see each other all as one family.  That will definitely help us see ourselves through the problems that await us.  If we don&#39;t come together as one, then we will have a MUCH more difficult time getting through all of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or even just what can we do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We absolutely CAN simply come together as one.  We really can.  Again, all we need to do is just DO IT.  It&#39;s a matter of willingness and desire, however - not whether we actually can or can&#39;t.  <em>If course</em> we can.  It&#39;s just whether we have the willingness to come together as one and all help one another INDEPENDENT of the crappy PTB that are controlling us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And for now I would say nothing with regards to &quot;fixing&quot; things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think there&#39;s a LOT we can do.  It&#39;s, again, just a matter of whether we&#39;re all willing to come together and DO IT or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At this point, I say we let it crash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that&#39;s definitely one option.  I think it&#39;s going to happen (i.e. crash) one way or the other anyway/sooner or later.  It&#39;s going to happen, and it does seem like this country&#39;s on its way down.  How we as a people HANDLE that and come out of it will depend upon whether we come together as a citizenry or not.  I understand that it looks like most of us will end up being asshole wild animals and will riot and rape and kill and shoot and loot, etc...but I also know that if we DIDN&#39;T do that and we DID help one another, then we would ALL come out of this much, MUCH better as a whole.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let all of our efforts and plans finally come together in the contradiction they have created and implode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That can be one definite way for many of us to learn the error of our ways - yes:  Just let the b.s. we&#39;ve created and that we&#39;ve been complicit in creating just crash right in front of our faces.  I think there are ways that can help us NOT be as s.o.l. as this option, but I wouldn&#39;t doubt if this option is more likely to actually happen than the one I stated above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So then what we can do is prepare for that and prepare to build from the ground up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this...but it would seem that if we have the capability and the capacity to build from the ground up, then we also have the capability and capacity to build BEFORE things hit rock bottom.  We can help each other BEFORE things crash.  Unfortunately, I understand that the human race seems far too ignorant and primitive to act <em>preemptively</em> and help itself BEFORE shit hits the fan. :/</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And to do that we have to educate, to conspire, to converse, and to gather.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely and agreed.  If we were to all do this with one another more BEFORE shtf, then we could be able to even prevent things from crashing in the first place.  It wouldn&#39;t be a crash at that point.  It would simply be a transition from a much less efficient way of doing things and living (i.e. how things are now) to a much better way (i.e. how things would be if we were indeed all working together like you stated above here).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorry for going outside the scope of the sounds thread here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hell no, my brother don&#39;t apologize.  You hit the nail <em>right</em> on the head.  THIS is what&#39;s important, actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But hey, i posted it and its a topic not discussed nearly enough in the right environments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully agree with you on wishing to be able to come together and put our efforts into being preemptive. I wish we could do that. But as you stated to that people are just silly (far too ignorant and primitive). Actually, ignorance I think might be the biggest thing. People really just don&#39;t get it. They don&#39;t see how far we&#39;ve come and how much of a problem we&#39;ve presented ourselves with. Or if they do see it, they don&#39;t want to change anything because they can still maintain their current lifestyle and forget to analyze what could and will happen to it when the situation begins to affect them. And that&#39;s what I mean by crash. Crash is a harsh word indeed but it does get a point across. However, a more accurate description would be for the current state of affairs to start affecting the majority of the population so that they may not continue in their present standard of living to a point in which it&#39;s unmanageable. At that point is where people will begin looking for answers and become active. But as long as we have a roof over our heads, we can feed our families, and even then enjoy luxuries here and there, the public won&#39;t change.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ostrich-with-its-head-in-the-sand, willful ignorance kind of thing.  It will always, ALWAYS come back and bite you in the ass <em>hard</em> sooner or later if you ignore it.</p>

But as long as we have a roof over our heads, we can feed our families, and even then enjoy luxuries here and there, the public won&#39;t change.</p>

<p>Essentially, you&#39;re saying here that difficulty can be a great catalyst for growth, development, and positive change.</p>

<p>Exactly. 
My wish now is that we could get a debate like this in a greater setting. Something in which people can watch, participate, and see that things must be done. But also why they aren&#39;t getting done and what we can do, like coming together in a shared effort, to change things. Long story short, we need to get people outside of you and me, to become like you and me. Meaning people who are fed up, see there is a problem, and want to do something about it.</p>

<p>I would say that doing this is in fact one of the <em>real</em> and most important things one can do.  I try to do this as much as possible myself.  While public speaking might reach more people, the effect is more diffuse and not as focused as can be the effect that one has speaking on a more individual level, so I think doing it that way can be extremely beneficial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that&#39;s the thing right there.  People have to realize that although there is a lot of b.s. out there, all that&#39;s needed is just <em>one</em> authentic example to prove that the phenomenon in question - whatever it might be - <em>does</em>, in fact, exist and is legitimate.</p>

<p>And there are simply <em>so</em> many videos about this phenomenon running amok on the internet that there&#39;s no way they&#39;re <em>all</em> faked or hoaxed.  Not every single one of these people are in on some global internet hoax to post trolling youtube videos online.  Some of the examples ARE real and valid.</p>

<p>Because of this, the phenomenon in general <em>is</em> a real phenomenon.  It <em>is</em>, in fact, actually happening in real time, in real life.</p>

<p>Now what <em>is</em> the sound and where is it coming from?  That&#39;s another question altogether.  I&#39;m not quite sure and I don&#39;t know who <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely happening though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yup, not long ago Chicago local news covered a story on these sounds being heard in a small southern Wisconsin town, they played footage of the noises and the sounds in this particular case were the creepy war of the worlds sounding ones. Tons of residents in the town were calling 911 and they brought in a Geologist/Scientist of some sort from UW Madison and he basically said science has no idea what&#39;s causing these sounds and it is not tectonic related. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I myself didn&#39;t think it was tectonically related either.  Too smooth of a sound.  Doesn&#39;t to any extent sound like even the distant echo of rocks grinding against one another as would be the case if it WAS tectonic.  Plus...you&#39;d <em>definitely</em> feel something IN THE GROUND if it <em>was</em> tectonically oriented - and people for the most part don&#39;t.  They feel &quot;rumbling&quot; in the sky, air, and surrounding atmosphere, but that&#39;s simply because of the vibrational resonance of the deep sound all around - another great indication that it doesn&#39;t come from the ground and is tectonic but is, in fact, something that is coming from above.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a few that are strikingly similar to the sounds in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItD6dQa5ncw">Red State</a> which has led to claims they&#39;re just re-using the sound to make fakes.</p>

<p>A lot of conspiracy theorists, however, will tell you that movies are made about real conspiracies to discredit real phenomena or events.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on the fence about this one until I hear it for myself. It seems like youtube videos from populated areas should be accompanied with hundreds or thousands of people talking about what they heard on the same day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never gave much thought to this, but after watching the  &quot;PRIME TIME ONLINE Did you hear that?&quot; I&#39;m sure that it&#39;s a hoax, and when not simple explanations suffices. This because in most videos birds continue chirping in the background despite the apparent &quot;noise&quot;. If anything animals sense disasters and any disruption in the environment, and would never continue their regular behavior upon an event of such magnititude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do know that the poles are shifting. Much like how our axis actually wobbles due to the gravitational forces from the objects in the solar system. Of course it&#39;s very slow though. But could it be from disturbances in the magnetic field? There has been record of the sun be at a &quot;high point&quot; in activity in recent years which does have an effect on our planet. Perhaps a weakening of the magnetic field in recent years has caused these sounds to actually appear? I suppose one of the biggest questions on the subject would be to answer is it more likely that these sounds are natural or artificial? Meaning is it from things like the sun or shifts in the tectonic plates? Or from nuclear detonations and underground cities? Would love your input there.</p>
