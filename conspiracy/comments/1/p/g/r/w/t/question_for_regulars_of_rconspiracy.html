<p>Real:</p>

<ul>
<li>9/11 (but no thermite or cruise missiles)</li>
<li>JFK</li>
<li>Imposing third world debt and backing the dollar with depleted uranium.  I.e. economic hitman stuff and perpetual war.</li>
<li>Not one world government, but globalist new order (not sure this one bothers me that much though) needs to curb consumerist appetite of US middle class.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>They do soil and rainwater tests. According to them, levels have increased. I haven&#39;t tested it myself because I don&#39;t live in Hawaii and I actually looked into soil and water sampling. It&#39;s more expensive than I care to spend. However, I do have eyes. I know they are spraying something. And if you look at the pathology, it totally fits with what these power elite stooges would do.</p>

<p>Plus, why would these people put so much time, money, energy, and conviction into something so easily disproven?</p>

<p>I woke up to blue skies in Atlanta on Saturday. Then, the spraying started. Tons of it. By 5, it was like the whole city were under a pillow and I watched them add more and more and more until it got to that point. I get that the earth is rotating. I get that the jetstream moves systems. But I observed this intentional and clear goal on Saturday and many other days before it.</p>

<p>One time I woke up and it was really beautiful.  The weather was mild and there wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky.  There were no planes flying through the sky, at least not any that were leaving trails. </p>

<p>But then by 5 PM it was totally cloudy.  It rained even.  WTF?  My eyes weren&#39;t lying.</p>

<p>Atmospheric conditions (pressure, temperature, composition) vary from one point to another. This causes weather, for instance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullcrap. I just had this discussion the other day. These trails turn off on off in a very short time and then stay on for a long time until they stop again. If you&#39;re theory is correct, there are basically invisible walls in the sky and the sky and atmosphere are in constant fluctuation and very liquid in nature. No way these could cut and remain the way they do, and you have not explained it scientifically. You just said sciency words. Why? What pressure, temperature, condition allows for these starts stops? Why do some remain and gather and build to form cloud cover? Science me.</p>

I definitely believe western intelligence helped to aid and abet the Mossad in perpetrating 9/11. If Boston and Sandy Hook are such open and shut cases, release the video, or a still. No gore necessary, just put the suspect at the scene at the time we are being told they did what they did. Just like the Pentagon missile, they won&#39;t. They can&#39;t. The whole sham would collapse.</p>

<p>(edit: I like your question and thread. Not sure why the downvotes are piling up. Just find another thread, shitheads.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I&#39;m saying there was CCTV of at least Boston and Lanza. Show me a frame. Nothing gory. Why would Lanza drive a car his family didn&#39;t own, connected to a drug dealer? Why can we see the limbs and blood but not the bomb drop. Supposedly, it exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. I have doubts that they happened the way we were told. Something happened. I was not convinced that those stories played out the way the media would have us believe. Think, &quot;War of the Worlds.&quot; The media is a very powerful tool as has been determined via Chomsky in &quot;Manufacturing Consent,&quot; and Edward Bernays in &quot;Propaganda.&quot; Very few of us critically consider new information.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I&#39;m sure <em>you&#39;re</em> done.</p>

<p>Can you provide a list of witnesses who saw the cruise missile?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an abridged version of witness accounts of the plane:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Abshire, Marc</strong> - Air Force Lt. Col. Marc Abshire, 40, a speechwriter for Air Force Secretary James Roche, was working on several speeches this morning when he felt the blast of the explosion at the Pentagon. His office is on the D ring, near the eighth corridor, he said. &quot;It shot me back in my chair. There was a huge blast. I could feel the air shock wave of it,&quot; Abshire said. &quot;I didn&#39;t know exactly what it was. It didn&#39;t rumble. It was more of a direct smack. I said, &#39;This isn&#39;t right. Something&#39;s wrong here.&#39;&quot; &quot;We all went out in the hallway. People were yelling &#39;Evacuate! Evacuate!&#39; And we found ourselves on the lawn and looking back on our building. It was very much a surrealistic sort of experience. It&#39;s just definitely not right to see smoke coming out of the Pentagon. It was a very strange sight to see.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Anderson, Steve</strong> - I witnessed the jet hit the Pentagon on September 11. From my office on the 19th floor of the USA TODAY building in Arlington, Va., I have a view of Arlington Cemetery, Crystal City, the Pentagon, National Airport and the Potomac River. ... Shortly after watching the second tragedy, I heard jet engines pass our building, which, being so close to the airport is very common. But I thought the airport was closed. I figured it was a plane coming in for landing. A few moments later, as I was looking down at my desk, the plane caught my eye. It didn&#39;t register at first. I thought to myself that I couldn&#39;t believe the pilot was flying so low. Then it dawned on me what was about to happen. I watched in horror as the plane flew at treetop level, banked slightly to the left, drug it&#39;s wing along the ground and slammed into the west wall of the Pentagon exploding into a giant orange fireball. Then black smoke. Then white smoke. </li>
<li><strong>Anderson, Ted</strong> - Lt. Col. Ted Anderson : &quot;We ran to the end of our building, turned left and saw nothing but huge, billowing black smoke, and a brilliant, brilliant explosion of fire.&quot; (...) One of the Pentagon&#39;s two fire trucks was parked only 50 feet from the crash site, and it was &quot;totally engulfed in flames,&quot; Anderson says. Nearby, tanks full of propane and aviation fuel had begun igniting, and they soon began exploding, one by one. (...) Back in the building again, Anderson said he began &quot;screaming and hollering for people as secondary and third-order explosions started going off. One of them was a fire department car exploding-I think my right eardrum exploded at the same time, and it unequivocally scared the heck out of me.&quot; </li>
<li><strong>Anlauf, Deb &amp; Jeff</strong> - Mrs. Deb Anlauf, resident of Colfax, Wisconsin, was in her 14th floor of the Sheraton Hotel [located 1.6 mile from the explosion], (immediately west of the Navy Annex) when she heard a &quot;loud roar&quot;: Suddenly I saw this plane right outside my window. You felt like you could touch it; it was that close. It was just incredible. &quot;Then it shot straight across from where we are and flew right into the Pentagon. It was just this huge fireball that crashed into the wall (of the Pentagon). When it hit, the whole hotel shook. (...) Jeff didn&#39;t feel the impact of the plane crash as directly as his wife. He was attending an environmental meeting on the second floor of the hotel when the plane struck the Pentagon. About five seconds before the crash, Jeff said he heard the sound of &quot;tin being dropped,&quot; likely as construction workers building an addition to the hotel saw the plane and dropped their building materials. &quot;Then, about 5 seconds later, the whole hotel shook,&quot; Jeff recalled. &quot;I could feel it moving. We said &#39;Oh, my gosh, what&#39;s going on?&#39; &quot;</li>

</blockquote>

<p>Abshire, Marc - Air Force Lt. Col. Marc Abshire....</p>

<p>OK, so this is the first &quot;eye witness&quot; on your list, and it is clear from what he says that he didn&#39;t see &quot;a plane&quot; hit the Pentagon at all - he felt an explosion sitting at his desk. No mention of a plane. </p>

<p>There are many others on your list who similarly fail to mention a plane, so I guess you should abridge your list if you want it to &quot;support your argument&quot;.</p>

<p>Those that do claim to have seen a plane hit the Pentagon - did they make their statements under oath in a court of law? What do we know them, their credibility, their motives? </p>

<p>If a huge airliner really did hit the Pentagon, the physical evidence would be overwhelming. And yet here am I, like many others who have spent far too long searching for the evidence, and I&#39;m not even slightly whelmed.</p>

    <div class="md"><ul>
<li><strong>Battle</strong> - Battle, an office worker at the Pentagon, was standing outside the building and just about to enter when the aircraft struck. &quot;It was coming down head first,&quot; he said. &quot;And when the impact hit, the cars and everything were just shaking.&quot; </li>
<li><strong>Bauer, Gary</strong> - Gary Bauer, a former Presidential candidate, happened to be driving into Washington, D.C. that morning, to a press conference on Capitol Hill. &quot;I was in a massive traffic jam, hadn&#39;t moved more than a hundred yards in twenty minutes. ... I had just passed the closest place the Pentagon is to the exit on 395 . . . when all of a sudden I heard the roar of a jet engine. I looked at the woman sitting in the car next to me. She had this startled look on her face. We were all thinking the same thing. We looked out the front of our windows to try to see the plane, and it wasn&#39;t until a few seconds later that we realized the jet was coming up behind us on that major highway. And it veered to the right into the Pentagon. The blast literally rocked all of our cars. It was an incredible moment.&quot; massnews.com / Amy Contrada / December 2001 </li>
<li><strong>Beans, Michael</strong> - Anger and guilt still sear Lieutenant Colonel Michael Beans who shakes his head ruefully and asks himself why he survived: &quot;Why you, not them? Who made that decision?&quot; (...) Inside the Pentagon, the blast lifted Beans off the floor as he crossed a huge open office toward his desk. &quot;You heard this huge concussion, then the room filled with this real bright light, just like everything was encompassed within this bright light,&quot; said Beans. &quot;As soon as I hit the floor, all the lights went out, there was a small fire starting to burn.&quot; His friends were not so lucky. Not far away on the same floor, Beans&#39; once familiar world had turned into a terrifying maze as well. Opening a door to the outer E-ring corridor, Beans saw waves of fire rolling towards him like surf on a beach. Turning back, he groped slowly back across the room on hands and knees. The sprinkler came on and that kept the smoke and heat down. But it was nervewracking and Beans was alone, listening as the building burned. &quot;It was so quiet,&quot; he recalled. &quot;There was no screaming, nobody saying anything, just nothing.&quot; He thought he might not make it out alive. He thought about his wife, his daughter and son, his 22 years in the army. &quot;I remember taking a couple of breaths there, and I made up my mind: I just can&#39;t go out this way,&quot; he said. Suddenly out of the smoke a man ran by. &quot;I tried to grab him, and I tried to yell at him,&quot; Beans said. But &quot;he just disappeared into the smoke.&quot; Alone again, Beans crawled with his face to the floor. Then the carpet turned to wet tile, and he looked up and saw he was in a corridor. He ran and as the smoke cleared, he saw a guard. Beans discovered later that his head and forearms were burned. He now wears special flesh-colored compression sleeves on his arms. &quot;These burns are going to heal, eventually,&quot; he said. But the memories &quot;will be with me for the rest of my life.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Begala, Paul</strong> - Paul Begala, a Democratic consultant, said he witnessed an explosion near the Pentagon. &quot;It was a huge fireball, a huge, orange fireball,&quot; he said in an interview on his mobile phone. He said another witness told him a helicopter exploded. AP, Washington, 9/12/2001 11:45:33 PM</li>
<li><strong>Bell, Mickey</strong> - Mickey Bell : The jet came in from the south and banked left as it entered the building, narrowly missing the Singleton Electric trailer and the on-site foreman, Mickey Bell. Bell had just left the trailer when he heard a loud noise. The next thing he recalled was picking himself off the floor, where he had been thrown by the blast. Bell, who had been less than 100 feet from the initial impact of the plane, was nearly struck by one of the plane&#39;s wings as it sped by him. In shock, he got into his truck, which had been parked in the trailer compound, and sped away. He wandered around Arlington in his truck and tried to make wireless phone calls. He ended up back at Singleton&#39;s headquarters in Gaithersburg two hours later, according to President Singleton, not remembering much. The full impact of the closeness of the crash wasn&#39;t realized until coworkers noticed damage to Bell&#39;s work vehicle. He had plastic and rivets from an airplane imbedded in its sheet metal, but Bell had no idea what had happened. During Bell&#39;s close call, other Singleton workers, including sub-foreman Greg Cobaugh, were doing other work on the first and third floors. The blast wasn&#39;t very loud to them. They were talking about reports that two planes crashed into the World Trade Center in Manhattan, New York - not considering the noise they heard could be a similar attack. </li>
<li><strong>Benedetto, Richard</strong> - Richard Benedetto, a USA TODAY reporter, was on his way to work, driving on the Highway parrallel to the Pentagon : &quot;It was an American Airlines airplane, I could see it very clearly.(...) I didn&#39;t see the impact. (...) The sound itself sounded more like a thud rather than a bomb (...) rather than a loud bomb explosion it sounded muffled, heavy, very deep. I didn&#39;t see any flaps, it looked like the plane was just in normal flying mode but heading straight down. It was straight. The only thing we saw on the ground outside there was a piece of a ... the tail of a lamp post. (Video)</li>

    <div class="md"><ul>
<li><strong>Biggert, Judy</strong> - Members of Congress have been shuttled to the site to inspect the damage. Rep. Judy Biggert (R-Ill.) made the trip on Thursday. She saw remnants of the airplane. &#39;There was a seat from a plane, there was part of the tail and then there was a part of green metal, I could not tell what it was, a part of the outside of the plane,&#39; she said. &#39;It smelled like it was still burning.&#39;</li>
<li><strong>Birdwell, Brian</strong> - LTC Brian Birdwell. He was just heading back down the hall to his office when the building exploded in front of him. The flash fire was immediate and the smoke was thick. The blast had thrown him down, giving him a concussion. He wanted to head down the hall toward the A ring...but because he couldn&#39;t see anything he had no idea which way to go and he didn&#39;t want to head in the wrong direction. (...) Once they stabilized Brian, they transferred him to George Washington Hospital where...the best, cutting edge burn doctor in the U.S. The doctor told him that had he not gone to Georgetown first, he probably would not have survived because of the jet fuel in his lungs.</li>
<li><strong>Birdwell, Brian</strong> - Down the hall from Yates, Lt. Col. Brian Birdwell, 40, had been at his desk in Room 2E486 since 6:30 a.m. (...) Birdwell walked out to the men&#39;s room in corridor 4, a move that saved his life. He had just taken three or four steps out of the bathroom when the building was rocked. &quot;Bomb!&quot; the Gulf War vet immediately thought as he was knocked down. When he stood up, he realized he was on fire. &quot;Jesus, I&#39;m coming to see you&quot; </li>
<li><strong>Boger, Sean</strong> - Sean Boger, Air Traffic Controller and Pentagon tower chief - &quot;I just looked up and I saw the big nose and the wings of the aircraft coming right at us and I just watched it hit the building.&quot; &quot;It exploded. I fell to the ground and covered my head. I could actually hear the metal going through the building.&quot; The crew, Boger and Spc. Jacqueline Kidd, air traffic controller and training supervisor, prepared for President George W. Bush to arrive from Florida around 12:30 p.m.</li>
<li><strong>Bouchoux, Donald R.</strong> - Donald R. Bouchoux, 53, a retired Naval officer, a Great Falls resident, a Vietnam veteran and former commanding officer of a Navy fighter squadron, was driving west from Tysons Corner to the Pentagon for a 10am meeting. He wrote: At 9:40 a.m. I was driving down Washington Boulevard (Route 27) along the side of the Pentagon when the aircraft crossed about 200 yards [should be more than 150 yards from the impact] in front of me and impacted the side of the building. There was an enormous fireball, followed about two seconds later by debris raining down. The car moved about a foot to the right when the shock wave hit. I had what must have been an emergency oxygen bottle from the airplane go flying down across the front of my Explorer and then a second piece of jagged metal come down on the right side of the car. Washington Post, Sept. 20, 2001 </li>
<li><strong>Bowman, John</strong> - John Bowman, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and a contractor, was in his office in Corridor Two near the main entrance to the south parking lot. &quot;Everything was calm,&#39; Bowman said. &quot;Most people knew it was a bomb. Everyone evacuated smartly. We have a good sprinkling of military people who have been shot at.&quot; </li>
<li><strong>Braman, Chris</strong> - Staff Sgt. Chris Braman : The lawn was littered with twisted pieces of aluminum. He saw one chunk painted with the letter <code>A,&#39;&#39; another with a</code>C.&#39;&#39; It didn&#39;t occur to Braman what the letters signified until a man in the crowd stooped to pick up one of the smaller metal shards. He examined it for a moment, then announced: ``This was a jet.&#39;&#39;</li>

    <div class="md"><ul>
<li><strong>Bright, Mark</strong> - Defense Protective Service officers were the first on the scene of the terrorist attack. One, Mark Bright, actually saw the plane hit the building. He had been manning the guard booth at the Mall Entrance to the building. &quot;I saw the plane at the Navy Annex area,&quot; he said. &quot;I knew it was going to strike the building because it was very, very low -- at the height of the street lights. It knocked a couple down.&quot; The plane would have been seconds from impact -- the annex is only a few hundred yards from the Pentagon. He said he heard the plane &quot;power-up&quot; just before it struck the Pentagon. &quot;As soon as it struck the building I just called in an attack, because I knew it couldn&#39;t be accidental,&quot; Bright said. He jumped into his police cruiser and headed to the area. </li>
<li><strong>Brown, Ervin</strong> - At the Pentagon, employees had heard about or seen footage of the World Trade Centre attack when they felt their own building shake. Ervin Brown, who works at the Pentagon, said he saw pieces of what appeared to be small aircraft on the ground, and the part of the building by the heliport had collapsed.</li>
<li><strong>Brown, Rich</strong> - Pentagon staff raced along a wooden pathway opposite the Pentagon building, all heading towards bridges that would take them across the Potomac River. Grown men ran at full pace. Rich Brown was sitting at his desk and &quot;there was just a huge sound that shook the building for a second or two&quot;. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happened. I assume it&#39;s a co-ordinated terrorist attack.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Burgess, Lisa</strong> - Lisa Burgess, a reporter for the Army newspaper Stars and Stripes, said she was walking in a corridor near the blast site and was thrown to the ground by the force of the blast. </li>
<li><strong>Burgess, Lisa</strong> - Lisa Burgess : Stars and Stripes reporter Lisa Burgess was walking on the Pentagon&#39;s innermost corridor, across the courtyard, when the incident happened. &quot;I heard two loud booms - one large, one smaller, and the shock wave threw me against the wall,&quot; she said.Burgess, reporting by telephone from the scene at about 4 p.m., said that five hours after the blast, still no one was able to get into the building. After the first casualties were removed, no one was brought out of the building, either dead or alive.</li>

    <div class="md"><ul>
<li><strong>Campo</strong> - It was a passenger plane. I think an American Airways plane, Mr Campo said. &quot;I was cutting the grass and it came in screaming over my head. I felt the impact. The whole ground shook and the whole area was full of fire. I could never imagine I would see anything like that here.&quot; </li>
<li><strong>Cissell, James R.</strong> - As former Cincinnatian James R. Cissell sat in traffic on a Virginia interstate by the Pentagon Tuesday morning, he saw the blur of a commercial jet and wondered why it was flying so low. &#39;&#39;Right about the time it was crossing over the highway, it kind of dawned on me what was happening,&#39;&#39; said Cissell, son of Hamilton County Clerk of Courts Jim Cissell. In the next blink of an eye, he realized he had a front-row seat to history, as the plane plowed into the Pentagon, sending a fireball exploding into the air and scattering debris - including a tire rim suspected of belonging to the airplane - past his car. (...) In the next seconds dozens of things flashed through his mind. &#39;&#39;I thought, &#39;This isn&#39;t really happening. That is a big plane.&#39; Then I saw the faces of some of the passengers on board,&#39;&#39; Cissell said. While he remembers seeing the crash, Cissell remembers none of the sounds. &#39;&#39;It came in in a perfectly straight line,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;It didn&#39;t slow down. I want to say it accelerated. It just shot straight in.&#39;&#39;</li>
<li><strong>Cleveland, Allen</strong> - Allen Cleveland of Woodbridge Virginia looked out from a Metro train going to National Airport, to see a jet heading down toward the Pentagon. &quot;I thought, &#39;There&#39;s no landing strip on that side of the subway tracks,&#39; &quot; Before he could process that thought, he saw &quot;a huge mushroom cloud. A lady staThe lady next to me was in absolute hysterics.&quot;&quot; . . a silver pasenger jet, mid sized&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Cleveland, Allen</strong> - Soon after the crash (Within 30 seconds of the crash) I witnessed a military cargo plane (Possibly a C130) fly over the crash site and circle the mushroom cloud. My brother inlaw also witnessed the same plane following the jet while he was on the HOV lanes in Springfield. He said that he saw a jetliner flying low over the tree tops near Seminary RD in Springfield, VA. and soon afterwards a military plane was seen flying right behind it. I think this was also a reason for the false threat of another plane about to crashwhich caused rescuers to have to evacuate for a short time after the initial crash. I have done my research onthis and according to time magazine it took 24 minutes before Norad was supposedly notified about this particuliar jet and fighters were scrambling to intercept at that time. Isn&#39;t it odd how there is Not a single mention of this aircraft in ANY of the articles written about this crash? Also if you had not noticed... There is not a single picture or live footage of the actual jet prior to its crash at the Pentagon. Nor is there any of the one that crashed in Pennsylvania. But if Anyone who rides the metro-rail knows, there are plenty of Video cameras all around National airport at the parking Garages and the high level security buildings found all around Crystal city. (3 of which I have personally found pointed directly towards crystal city which would have given a great line of site shot of that jet prior to the crash as well as any other plane which might have been following it. I personally believe that the government new full well that this was about to happen and they are hiding something a lot bigger than they are willing to let out. I was interviewed at Washingtonpost.com and gave them my full story, but they did not print it as I have told you. I also find it interesting that one of the planes engines in the pennsylvania crash was supposedly found 5 miles prior to the crash site (This information I&#39;m unsure of). The only thing that I&#39;m aware of that might cause that would be a heat seeking missle. A weapon which I am pretty familiar with form Ord.training. I&#39;m not saying that the government new exactly what was about to happen, but I do believe that they are definitely hiding something here. Many of my friends in intelligence have said the same. I work in a Gov. building in DC., but my heart is right there with you and your team. I hope you and those who served with you are doing well. Take care. </li>
<li><strong>Cook, Scott P.</strong> - [We didn&#39;t know what kind of plane had hit the Pentagon, or where it had hit. Later, we were told that] it was a 757 out of Dulles, which had come up the river in back of our building, turned sharply over the Capitol, ran past the White House and the Washington Monument, up the river to Rosslyn, then dropped to treetop level and ran down Washington Boulevard to the Pentagon (...) As we watched the black plume gather strength, less than a minute after the explosion, we saw an odd sight that no one else has yet commented on. Directly in back of the plume, which would place it almost due west from our office, a four-engine propeller plane, which Ray later said resembled a C-130, started a steep decent towards the Pentagon. It was coming from an odd direction (planes don&#39;t go east-west in the area), and it was descending at a much steeper angle than most aircraft. Trailing a thin, diffuse black trail from its engines, the plane reached the Pentagon at a low altitude and made a sharp left turn, passing just north of the plume, and headed straight for the White House. All the while, I was sort of talking at it: &quot;Who the hell are you? Where are you going? You&#39;re not headed for downtown!&quot; Ray and Verle watched it with me, and I was convinced it was another attack. But right over the tidal basin, at an altitude of less than 1000 feet, it made another sharp left turn to the north and climbed rapidly. Soon it was gone, leaving only the thin black trail. </li>
<li><strong>Corley</strong> - &quot;It was striking to me how little of the building was involved in the fire,&quot; said Dr. Corley, who has reviewed the Pentagon report. The fire, he said, &quot;didn&#39;t spread and and trap other people in the building. &quot;While 125 Pentagon workers and 59 passengers and crew members on the plane died, few if any of the workers who died were from outside the immediate impact zone.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Correa, Victor</strong> - LTC Victor Correa work at the Pentagon. (...) LTC Victor Correa&#39;s office, what was the Army&#39;s Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, now the Army G-1, was in the path of the Boeing 757 that crashed into the Pentagon on a sunny fall morning. He was walking over to talk to a co-worker in the next cubicle when he was knocked down by the impact. &quot;I saw a fireball come over my head,&quot; said Correa, an Active Guard Reservist now assigned to Joint Chiefs of Staff, J-5. &quot;The fireball was coming like a wind-cloud of smoke trailing it. I also noticed to my right the windows going out and coming back in. The fireball came in and out quick - the speed of lightning. As it went back, it left a cloud of smoke and started dropping. At that time the fire system went up.&quot; Being knocked down turned out to be a life-saver. (...) &quot;We thought it was some kind of explosion. That somehow someone got in here and planted bombs because we saw these holes.&quot;</li>

    <div class="md"><ul>
<li><strong>Creed, Dan</strong> - He and two colleagues from Oracle software were stopped in a car near the Naval Annex, next to the Pentagon, when they saw the plane dive down and level off. &quot;It was no more than 30 feet off the ground, and it was screaming. It was just screaming. It was nothing more than a guided missile at that point,&quot; Creed said. &quot;I can still see the plane. I can still see it right now. It&#39;s just the most frightening thing in the world, going full speed, going full throttle, its wheels up,&quot; Creed recalls.</li>
<li><strong>Damoose</strong> - Damoose said the worst part was leaving the Pentagon and walking along Fort Meyer Drive, a bike trail, &quot;you could see pieces of the plane.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Dave</strong> - Near the Lincoln Memorial, Dave heard two booms, which sounded like the artillery salutes on the Mall on the Fourth of July, he said. It was likely the noise from a secondary blast at the Pentagon - </li>
<li><strong>Day Wayne T.</strong> - For one employee with Wedge One&#39;s mechanical subcontractor John J. Kirlin Inc., Rockville MD, &quot;lucky&quot; is an understatement. &quot;We had one guy who was standing, looking out the window and saw the plane when it was coming in. He was in front of one of the blast-resistant windows,&quot; says Kirlin President Wayne T. Day, who believes the window structure saved the man&#39;s life. According to Matt Hahr, Kirlin&#39;s senior project manager at the Pentagon, the employee &quot;was thrown about 80 ft down the hall through the air. As he was traveling through the air, he says the ceiling was coming down from the concussion. He got thrown into a closet, the door slammed shut and the fireball went past him,&quot; recounts Hahr. &quot;Jet fuel was on him and it irritated his eyes, but he didn&#39;t get burned. Then the fireball blew over and the sprinklers came on, and he was able to crawl out of the closet and get out of the building through the courtyard.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>DeChiaro, Steve</strong> - Instead of following the streams of people away from the Pentagon, Steve DeChiaro ran toward the smoke. As he reached the west side of the building he saw a light post bent in half. &quot;But when I looked at the site, my brain could not resolve the fact that it was a plane because it only seemed like a small hole in the building,&quot; he said. &quot;No tail. No wings. No nothing.&quot; He followed the emergency crews that had just arrived. He saw people hanging out of windows and others crawling from the demolished area. &quot;These people were covered in what I thought was powder - I don&#39;t know anything about medicine or first aid, I&#39;m an engineer - but it looked like powder,&quot; DeChiaro said. &quot;Only later did I find out that it was their skin.&quot; Civilians and soldiers joined emergency crews who were rushing inside to pull out anyone they could. But shortly after 10 a.m. police yelled at people to get back. &quot;Just as we&#39;re about to open the door, they start screaming, &#39;There&#39;s another inbound plane&#39;, &quot; DeChiaro said. &quot;At that moment, your thoughts are: &#39;I go in the building, I get killed, then I&#39;m no help to anybody.&#39; In hindsight, I think we should have gone back in that building.&quot; For nearly 15 minutes, they stood watching the Pentagon burn and periodically checked the sky for another plane. That plane never reached Washington but fell, instead, in rural Pennsylvania. Teams of two and three eventually were sent back in to find more victims. But as the day grew longer, the flow of the injured stopped.</li>
<li><strong>Defina</strong> - &quot;The only way you could tell that an aircraft was inside was that we saw pieces of the nose gear. The devastation was horrific. It was obvious that some of the victims we found had no time to react. The distance the firefighters had to travel down corridors to reach the fires was a problem. With only a good 25 minutes of air in their SCBA bottles, to save air they left off their face pieces as they walked and took in a lot of smoke,&quot; Captain Defina said. Captain Defina was the shift commander [of an aircraft rescue firefighters crew.]</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I try to use some common sense questions to ferret out the conspiracies that seem plausible. Those questions are:</p>

<p>1) Who benefits?</p>

<p>2) How do they benefit?</p>

<p>3) How is that benefit worth the cost and effort of carrying out the conspiracy?</p>

<p>4) How is the benefit significantly better than the benefit they could derive by applying the same money and resources in a more conventional manner? (It has to be <em>significantly</em> better to overcome the inherent risk in the conspiracy.)</p>

<p>5) How does the conspiracy manage to cover itself up? (Especially relevant when a large number of civilians would have to keep secrets.)</p>

<p>Using those criteria, the most plausible ones are:</p>

<ul>
<li>JFK</li>
<li>Michael Hastings assassination (I firmly believe this was an assassination)</li>
<li>Religion (at this point, the main perpetrators have bought in, too, and very few leverage the power)</li>
<li>9/11</li>
<li>World Bank bullshit</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>On the fence:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Aliens among us</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Most likely implausible:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Chemtrails (too big to keep secret if it&#39;s commercial jets; more plausible if only military but still unconvinced on risk/benefit)</li>
<li>Vaccine bullshit (insufficient benefit compared w/ conventional alternatives)</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people argue against the principal:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Mike Adams reported back in April, whooping cough outbreaks are higher in areas that have a higher percentage of children who took the whooping cough Vaccine! Over-vaccinating weakens the immune system, making children more susceptible to infections with less ability to fight them off. The injections also promote viral adaption, which is responsible for creating vaccine resistant super bugs. In 2010, 77 percent of the over 1,000 people who were infected with Mumps had received the MMR vaccine- a statistic which was conveniently left unreported by the mainstream media. So while the number of outbreaks occurs the medical establishment can recommend more vaccines to try to reduce the numbers, causing a vicious cycle fueled by misinformation and deception.</p>

We looked out the front of our windows to try to see the plane, and it wasn&#39;t until a few seconds later that we realized the jet was coming up behind us on that major highway.

Inside the Pentagon, the blast lifted Beans off the floor as he crossed a huge open office toward his desk. &quot;You heard this huge concussion, then the room filled with this real bright light, just like everything was encompassed within this bright light,&quot; said Beans. &quot;As soon as I hit the floor, all the lights went out, there was a small fire starting to burn.&quot; His friends were not so lucky. Not far away on the same floor, Beans&#39; once familiar world had turned into a terrifying maze as well. Opening a door to the outer E-ring corridor, Beans saw waves of fire rolling towards him like surf on a beach. Turning back, he groped slowly back across the room on hands and knees. The sprinkler came on and that kept the smoke and heat down. But it was nervewracking and Beans was alone, listening as the building burned. &quot;It was so quiet,&quot; he recalled. &quot;There was no screaming, nobody saying anything, just nothing.&quot; He thought he might not make it out alive. He thought about his wife, his daughter and son, his 22 years in the army. &quot;I remember taking a couple of breaths there, and I made up my mind: I just can&#39;t go out this way,&quot; he said. Suddenly out of the smoke a man ran by. &quot;I tried to grab him, and I tried to yell at him,&quot; Beans said. But &quot;he just disappeared into the smoke.&quot; Alone again, Beans crawled with his face to the floor. Then the carpet turned to wet tile, and he looked up and saw he was in a corridor. He ran and as the smoke cleared, he saw a guard. Beans discovered later that his head and forearms were burned. He now wears special flesh-colored compression sleeves on his arms. &quot;These burns are going to heal, eventually,&quot; he said. But the memories &quot;will be with me for the rest of my life.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Begala, Paul</strong> - Paul Begala, a Democratic consultant, said he witnessed an explosion near the Pentagon. &quot;It was a huge fireball, a huge, orange fireball,&quot; he said in an interview on his mobile phone. He said another witness told him a helicopter exploded. AP, Washington, 9/12/2001 11:45:33 PM</li>
<li><strong>Bell, Mickey</strong> - Mickey Bell : The jet came in from the south and banked left as it entered the building, narrowly missing the Singleton Electric trailer and the on-site foreman, Mickey Bell. Bell had just left the trailer when he heard a loud noise. The next thing he recalled was picking himself off the floor, where he had been thrown by the blast. Bell, who had been less than 100 feet from the initial impact of the plane, was nearly struck by one of the plane&#39;s wings as it sped by him. In shock, he got into his truck, which had been parked in the trailer compound, and sped away. He wandered around Arlington in his truck and tried to make wireless phone calls. He ended up back at Singleton&#39;s headquarters in Gaithersburg two hours later, according to President Singleton, not remembering much. The full impact of the closeness of the crash wasn&#39;t realized until coworkers noticed damage to Bell&#39;s work vehicle. He had plastic and rivets from an airplane imbedded in its sheet metal, but Bell had no idea what had happened. During Bell&#39;s close call, other Singleton workers, including sub-foreman Greg Cobaugh, were doing other work on the first and third floors. The blast wasn&#39;t very loud to them. They were talking about reports that two planes crashed into the World Trade Center in Manhattan, New York - not considering the noise they heard could be a similar attack. </li>
<li><strong>Benedetto, Richard</strong> - Richard Benedetto, a USA TODAY reporter, was on his way to work, driving on the Highway parrallel to the Pentagon : &quot;It was an American Airlines airplane, I could see it very clearly.(...) I didn&#39;t see the impact. (...) The sound itself sounded more like a thud rather than a bomb (...) rather than a loud bomb explosion it sounded muffled, heavy, very deep. I didn&#39;t see any flaps, it looked like the plane was just in normal flying mode but heading straight down. It was straight. The only thing we saw on the ground outside there was a piece of a ... the tail of a lamp post. (Video)</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly things sprayed out of planes are the only thing that could affect soil and rainwater.  Who are &quot;they&quot;, anyway?</p>

<p>One time I woke up and it was really beautiful.  The weather was mild and there wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky.  There were no planes flying through the sky, at least not any that were leaving trails. </p>

<p>But then by 5 PM it was totally cloudy.  It rained even.  WTF?  My eyes weren&#39;t lying.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an abridged version of witness accounts of the plane:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Abshire, Marc - Air Force Lt. Col. Marc Abshire....</p>

<p>OK, so this is the first &quot;eye witness&quot; on your list, and it is clear from what he says that he didn&#39;t see &quot;a plane&quot; hit the Pentagon at all - he felt an explosion sitting at his desk. No mention of a plane. </p>

<p>There are many others on your list who similarly fail to mention a plane, so I guess you should abridge your list if you want it to &quot;support your argument&quot;.</p>

<p>Those that do claim to have seen a plane hit the Pentagon - did they make their statements under oath in a court of law? What do we know them, their credibility, their motives? </p>

<p>If a huge airliner really did hit the Pentagon, the physical evidence would be overwhelming. And yet here am I, like many others who have spent far too long searching for the evidence, and I&#39;m not even slightly whelmed.</p>
