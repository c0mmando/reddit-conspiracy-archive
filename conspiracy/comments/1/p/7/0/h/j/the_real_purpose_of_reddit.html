        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am not completely serious about this, but it is more of a thought experiment/exercise. The thing what started the ball rolling is this:</p>

<p>Just what kind of company is Reddit that it doesn&#39;t really care about profitability, and they don&#39;t have plans to change the current state in the near future? Well, my theory gives an answer.</p>

<p>So what if a few years back when Reddit started to get real popular and was still losing money, the government thought, hey, this is an excellent way to keep an eye on mass movements, what people think and feel? So why not help out the company and keep it ads free so it could grow even bigger and more users equals more intelligence? Thus it is possible the government is kicking in money to keep Reddit going, thus the owners don&#39;t have to worry about loses.</p>

<p>What would be the advantage for the government?:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is a really cheap way to follow and monitor the masses, and not just US cictizens in all one place.</li>
<li>It is possible to start movements and influence people as a grass roots movement, even if it is coming from the government.</li>
<li><p>To send secret messages to agents coded in harmless posts.
etc.etc.</p>

<p>So again, the real question is, why the owners are OK with losing money year after year? What kind of capitalist business model is that? Well, if a 3rd party makes up for the loss, the problem disappears....</p></li>

<li>feed these comments into a super computer and you have a data gold mine. people honestly put their feelings down on reddit and it is super revealing so of course they monitor it.</li>
<li>cognitive infiltration, cognitive dissonance, and social engineering are becoming normal now as opposed to being seen as manipulation...reddit is nothing without comments and so we will see a huge rise in conversation boards being infiltrated by shills trolls and stooges</li>

<p>Except employees who get paid, I don&#39;t think anyone else is making money. Reddit is like a soup kitchen selling very good soup below cost. It is hugely popular, but eventually they have to count for the losses...  Now if a 3rd party is putting something into the soup and happy to make up the losses, that explains the business model.  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They can also use Reddit to run certain ideas first. Let&#39;s say what people think of digital money? Well, Reddit loves Bitcoin, so maybe the government will come up with its own... (if bitcoin isn&#39;t their creation, but I already wrote about that)</p>

<p>The point is that as others mentioned social engineering is a new form of mass manipulation and the best part is that you don&#39;t even know you are being manipulated.
   Facebook is another good source on people, but I say because of the anonymity people here share more stories and opinions...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit didn&#39;t start out that way and was actually thinking about this last night while doing the dishes.  They have turned on their initial premise, which was it was user driven.  Look at how reddit has devolved, they killed r/reddit and broke everything down into subreddits.  The subreddits were fine for a while till the mods took over.  The mods than install new rules to be able to remove content and those rules have gotten more and more out of hand while the subs grew.  Now look at the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Politics/wiki/domains#wiki_banned_domains">sites that are band from r/politics</a>.</p>
