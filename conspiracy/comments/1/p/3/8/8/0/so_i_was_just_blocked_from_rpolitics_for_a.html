Let&#39;s think about this without applying your preferred parties rhetoric for a second. We now live in a country where our children and future children are required by law to pay for a service from privately owned insurance companies and said insurance companies now have free reign to charge any amount of money for their services, no regulations, no safeguards for the american people, this is fucking inexcusable.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t try to challenge the validity of my statement by applying labels, i&#39;m not a republican, democrat, conservative, libertarian, liberal or (insert your favorite flavor here)</p>

<p>Bottom line, both the republicans and democrats are fucking idiots and you&#39;re both ruining this nation. You&#39;re allowing a bunch of globalist to trick you into strengthening this plutocracy. I seriously wan&#39;t to cry when i think about the country i&#39;m leaving my future children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it factually incorrect? This is the problem, seemingly nobody understands how obamacare works and they won&#39;t until it&#39;s too late, this is by design. </p>

<p>So what you&#39;re trying to say is i&#39;m incorrect in saying that we are all now required by law to pay for a service from privately owned companies? Because that&#39;s factual. Or are you saying that insurance companies aren&#39;t going to hike prices because of obamacare? Because they already have and most insurance companies have already planned increases for 2014. What about that little baby tax fee for opting out? did you know that&#39;s based on income and is absolutely not affordable if you&#39;re of the middle class.</p>

<p>Would you be mad if i gave you the choice of either shopping at Safeway (knowing there&#39;s collusion between safeway and myself) Or paying a small fine based on your income for not shopping at safeway? Because this is exactly what the government is doing, this is sooooo ridiculously unconstitutional.</p>

<p>That is a fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or are you saying that insurance companies aren&#39;t going to hike prices because of obamacare? Because they already have </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You and I both know that ALL insurance carriers have always increased the cost of their policies year over year.  I&#39;ve been paying for insurance, either subsidized by my employer or by myself as a business owner, for 20 years.  Not a year has gone by where insurance companies have not raised the cost.  So, that has nothing to do with the ACA.</p>

<p>What is factually incorrect is your claim that they can charge whatever they want, without safeguards or regulation.  Completely false.  Premium increases of over 10% year over year MUST be justified.  Even if they get that increase, that stipulation IS a safeguard and a regulation.  Insurance companies also must charge the same people in the same area the same premiums, which is called community standards.  THAT is a safeguard and a regulation.  The act subsidizes people with lower incomes.  THAT is a safeguard.  Medicaid eligibility is expanded, THAT is a safeguard.</p>

<p>And, these are the claims of the ACA, even though much of it isn&#39;t even implemented yet.  But, in order to make your bold assertion that these things are not regulations or safeguards, you&#39;re going to have to tell us how it is you&#39;ve come by this super secret information about why those things I&#39;ve said above are not true.</p>

<p>No, it actually isn&#39;t a fact. Nobody is &quot;required by law&quot; to buy health insurance for themselves under the law. It&#39;s just a tax penalty. Your taxes are a little higher if you don&#39;t buy it. But that penalty is so low that I anticipate a lot of people will just decide to pay the higher taxes than buy health insurance</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They raise taxes on those who don&#39;t buy insurance in order to encourage them to buy insurance. Same reason there are tax credits and income deductibles for going to college. Our complex tax code is used to encourage and discourage all kinds of behavior.</p>

<p>By the way, when the ACA went to the supreme court, the meaning of the provision that creates the tax penalty should be properly viewed as a tax thing or as a fine. It was hotly contested, there is a good argument it&#39;s unconstitutional. Roberts tipped the balance on the decision, and there is also a very good argument that his opinion is even internally inconsistent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess by the same logic, you could argue that you pass all red lights as long as you pay a penalty. </p>

<p>Usually when you break smaller laws in this country, you pay a fine for it. So I don&#39;t see how this is any different other than in terms of pure semantics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, here your analogy breaks down. No action is taken if you fail to obtain health insurance, no criminal record is generated, you don&#39;t get points on your health license - you just pay a fee. </p>

<p>I happen to think levying this fee on 20-somethings is fucking unconscionable, and the worst part of the ACA, but let&#39;s not drift into hyperbole; it&#39;s just a fee or a tax, and it&#39;s not the same as a ticket.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the point.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I have a child, I have a net benefit: I get to claim a deduction.</p></li>
<li><p>If I have health insurance, I also have a net benefit. I have something that helps me pay my medical costs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Flip side:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I don&#39;t have a child, I have no benefit, but I also don&#39;t have any penalty. I don&#39;t pay more taxes because I don&#39;t have a child.</p></li>
<li><p>If I don&#39;t have health insurance, I have negative benefit. First, I&#39;m responsible for all of my medical costs, but I also have to pay a penalty/fine/tax (whatever you want to call it) because I chose not to buy insurance. I&#39;m getting hit twice.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Face it, the only reason the mandate exists is to subsidize the part of the population that was not insurable or prohibitively expensive to insure previously (pre-existing conditions, the elderly, etc.).</p>

<p>If I choose not to buy health insurance because of various reasons, I&#39;m penalized with a tax/fine/whatever because I&#39;m not participating in the subsidization of those people.</p>

<p>If I have no recourse to avoid paying money, either for insurance that I don&#39;t want or as a penalty for that decision, it&#39;s effectively a requirement of the law (ACA).</p>

<p>Further, there are criminal penalties for not paying taxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yeah. I mean, this is why I don&#39;t like it; it&#39;s a half-measure. If it was true single-payer it wouldn&#39;t matter that there was no opt out because it&#39;s a tax. If there was no mandate you could opt out. I guess I just see that you have a choice about <em>who&#39;s</em> robbing you, you can buy a private plan or pay the government a tax; I&#39;m not saying it doesn&#39;t suck, but at least you don&#39;t <em>have</em> to buy into the corrupt insurance industry, you can just get robbed by Uncle Sam. Again, I certainly agree it sucks, but since what I&#39;m pushing for is socialization of health care, which would completely eliminate the HC insurance industry, can you see why I don&#39;t mind the tax penalty part as much as you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason our medical healthcare is so incredibly expensive is not because we need less competition and more regulation. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with welfare because it&#39;s not the feds are the ones left with the tab but the future generations. Money doesn&#39;t come from thin air but is going to come out of someone else&#39;s paycheck. In the US, that money comes from the work of future generations and that&#39;s the most ridiculous idea that exists. </p>

<p>Socialism can always be termed as &quot;infrastructure&quot; but as an idea, it is a system that doesn&#39;t work in reality. People who work hard are left paying the most, while others feed off them. </p>

<p>Competition is amazing for the people and horrible for the big corporations. We need more different choices in our plans according to &quot;what we need&quot; rather than &quot;what you should pay so that everyone else can get healthcare too&quot;.  That&#39;s just more money out of the pockets from the middle class. Finally, the old people currently, who are the baby boomers, have caused enough damage by feeding off others through social security, medicare, etc... and this is just another way in which they can get more. The tab is left for the future generations and that&#39;s just not right. People shouldn&#39;t be born into debt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They shouldn&#39;t be but they are going to be - capitalism creates far more debt that socialism does by default(well, corporate capitalism does). All the isms have problems, I think we should take the best from every system. I don&#39;t care if something is ideologically called &quot;Socialism&quot; or not, I care if it works! The system we have is broken, and it seems to me that a regulated free market is the best way to go, but when the people with the concentrations of wealth are able to hijack the system as they are and you start to have policy based on what works solely for the people at the top, you end up with gouging. From my observations it seems that the free market doesn&#39;t give a fuck if everyone starves, or dies, or lives their lives in crushing poverty and/or debt, so it seems foolish to trust the market to care for things which are essential, or are public resources, such as clean water &amp; air, healthcare, power etc. We can leave the free market in place for luxuries and consumer goods, and we can have hybrid systems with sufficient oversight from uncorrupted governments, but the system has to be incetivized based on results.</p>

<p>This is why I advocate for universal healthcare; because the countries that have it have better outcomes than we do, without patient dumping, or runaway cost increases and the other host of problems we have here. You&#39;re better off in Italy or France or Japan if you get sick, both because you won&#39;t have a medical bankruptcy and because your caer outcome will be better, and that&#39;s a &quot;shame on us&quot; kind of statistic.</p>

<p>I understand but when you try to convince that we take up socialism in all different areas, then it is socialism and you are not just borrowing certain ideas from it.

<p>The rich are profiting from the system but that doesn&#39;t mean the poor needs to abuse the system to make up for it. Both are eating away the country from opposite ends. The solution to the 1% problem is not increasing our current welfare system. </p>

<p>The reason our medical health care is horrible is not because of free markets not caring. Throwing more money into healthcare is not going to solve the actual issues. It is important that we realize what the problems with healthcare before we can actually improve anything. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSjGouBmo0M">This guy does a great job about explaining why the healthcare in US is not so affordable.</a></p>

<p>I am all for accepting socialism ideas in different areas but not as it is. I am more in support of the &quot;unconditional basic income&quot; idea where citizens get enough basic income to ensure that they are not on the streets, that they can afford basic healthcare, and that they can put food on the table. This definitely jumps a bunch of steps ahead from what you are suggesting, but with a libertarian society where free markets run everything and the government merely exists to ensure the rights and well-being of the people are in order. </p>

<p>I would prefer you and everyone else focus on issues that matter and that can actually change things or shake things up/provide real catalyst for mental/societal changes, not irrelevant distractions that they will have no impact on anyway other than further disguising the massive political INDIFFERENCE in America. You are doing nothing but trying to kick at a political football when you discuss OBAMACARE, and it&#39;s a really big waste of your time</p>

<p>And you say &quot;Bush Era&quot; like you think that&#39;s somehow a relevant segmenting of time - this still IS that era - this is our era, and political separation between &quot;left and right&quot; in the US is completely and totally irrelevant because it&#39;s not real. They are all from one criminal family. Between the Ex-CIA Director who siezed power for himself and later passed the throne to his son(while giving his other son/family members the various princedoms) there was a &quot;democrat&quot; who was <em>also</em> involved(like the Bush family) in an <em>actually exposed, actual conspiracy, where people were actually prosecuted</em> to traffic guns/narcotics illegally into and out of the US was Bill Clinton, a guy involved in exactly the same criminal conspiracies. You don&#39;t seem to understand how massively irrelevant the names/parties are, and if you do, then you shouldn&#39;t be leading yourself or others down the road to the entrance to the false political dichotomy where nothing will be accomplished because no thinking will change.</p>

<p>Sorry but that is not how it works.  For one with more people having insurance that itself should bring costs down, plus people would just pay the fine and not get insurance if the price per month is to high. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Required by law&quot; is not really the right phrase. If you buy it your taxes will be lower. If you don&#39;t buy it, your taxes will be higher. But you can totally decide not to buy it and it isn&#39;t &quot;illegal&quot; to choose so.</p>

<p>The tax penalty is only 1% of your annual income, although in a few years it&#39;ll go up to 2.5% or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yeah. I mean, this is why I don&#39;t like it; it&#39;s a half-measure. If it was true single-payer it wouldn&#39;t matter that there was no opt out because it&#39;s a tax. If there was no mandate you could opt out. I guess I just see that you have a choice about <em>who&#39;s</em> robbing you, you can buy a private plan or pay the government a tax; I&#39;m not saying it doesn&#39;t suck, but at least you don&#39;t <em>have</em> to buy into the corrupt insurance industry, you can just get robbed by Uncle Sam. Again, I certainly agree it sucks, but since what I&#39;m pushing for is socialization of health care, which would completely eliminate the HC insurance industry, can you see why I don&#39;t mind the tax penalty part as much as you?</p>
