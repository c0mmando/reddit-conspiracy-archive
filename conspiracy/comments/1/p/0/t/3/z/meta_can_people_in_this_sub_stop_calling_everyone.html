It&#39;s just a way of letting someone know &quot;I will listen yo absolutaly nothing you say, will entertain no discussion, i will not look at your sources, and i will now plug my ears, go fuck yourself&quot; furthermore how many &quot;shills&quot; have you caught on this sub? i mean not just people from other subs disagreeing, but people with 0 day accounts who you know for a fact are being paid. i highly doubt &quot;shills&quot; would bother with a place like this, because they know you would immediately call them out as a shill! at the least it&#39;s a shitty filler word with no meaning behind it, at worst, it discourages discussion completely with a person. If you want to get the truth out to more people, don&#39;t you think reasoned discussions and calm explanations will reap more benefits than going &quot;get out SHILL!!&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh ok. You should make that more clear in your title. </p>

<p>R/conspiracy is more of an anti censorship subreddit. People post deleted stories, news that doesn&#39;t hit mainstream and discuss censorship online and in real life. Censoring peoples words on here would start to contridict what this sub reddit stands for. </p>

<p>If you really want to change the views on this subreddit, your better off contributing to the discussions rather than posting crap like this. You have up/down vote buttons. You should use them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it&#39;s true that buzzwords are tossed about quite a bit, even in Reddit, there are the fair number of shills around. Modern media unfortunately can&#39;t escape them; where there&#39;s news, there&#39;s the internet, and that alone is fertile ground for those with agendas, likely on some corporate payroll, to dive in and start melding perception of readership. I think if someone disagrees, they should make use of the handy-dandy &#39;hide&#39; button and move on. See a post you think a shill put there? Hide it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no i mean reddit accounts you suspect of being shills. the reason i ask for examples is that without them it&#39;s just a generic &quot;them&quot; that&#39;s &quot;out there&quot; to &quot;distract us&quot;. without evidence it&#39;s really just superstition, so you can justify calling people shills because i&#39;ve &quot;seen them&quot;. I really would like examples on the second thing you said, that applies to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. usually when i see something like that it&#39;s on some place like <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> or <a href="/r/gaming">/r/gaming</a> where someone tries to hype their own post or they&#39;re in an argument with someone. i honestl would like to point out some example on this sub, it would be very interesting</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, how about a rule that you can&#39;t call somebody a shill unless you have something to go on besides &quot;You are espousing an opinion which seems pro-establishment or in disagreement with the idea of a conspiracy.&quot;  </p>

<p>If you can prove somebody is a Monsanto employee and they are posting here about how great GMOs are, then sure, call them a shill. But if somebody is just saying that in their opinion the chemtrail conspiracy theory is nonsense, why are they a &quot;shill&quot;? </p>

<p>The sidebar says &quot;This subreddit is a thinking ground, above all else we respect everyone&#39;s opinions. . . This is a forum for free thinking . . . Respect other views and opinions, keep an open mind.&quot;  Don&#39;t you think that just shutting somebody down as a &quot;shill&quot; as soon as they start questioning things or providing evidence to the contrary of something somebody else said is destructive to the ideals espoused in the message in the sidebar?</p>

<p>When people from r/skeptic come over to r/conspiracy, they are often called shills.  We are not shills, we are skeptics.  We are against quack science.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t knee jerk completely believe all GMO studies.  I haven&#39;t read most GMO studies.  But I do think the general consensus of scientists is that the GMO&#39;s currently being used appear safe.  So do a lot of people on r/skeptic</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...ignore the BT cotton reactions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not sure what Bt cotton reactions you are referring too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[you] ignore... ...the more recent finding that microbes in the human gut are in fact impacted by GMOs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Huffington post study was hard to understand, because they misspelled their reference. It took me a while to find the Netherwood paper.  Here is a <a href="http://www.stopogm.net/sites/stopogm.net/files/netherwoodsurvival.pdf">link</a>.  I have never read the Netherwood paper before, but after a little research I think I understand it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s well know that microbes can take up small amounts of DNA from many sources, and this did happen in the Netherwood paper.  However as the paper says:  &quot;Although we found some evidence of preexisting
gene transfer between the GM soya and the human small intestinal
microflora, the bacteria containing the transgene represented a very
small proportion of the microbial population, and there was no indi-
cation that the complete transgene had been transferred to the
prokaryotes. Thus, it is highly unlikely that the gene transfer events
seen in this study would alter gastrointestinal function or pose a risk to
human health.&quot;  Page 208</p>

<p>In other words, nothing bad happened to microbes in the human gut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The BT cotton is basically the scourge of India. Have you seen all the farmer&#39;s committing suicide? There is the socio-economic reason of not passing debt onto the family but the BT cotton has been destroying crops and livestock. In Africa where they were growing GMO corn, everyone was getting sick until they switched back to non-GMO corn, same in Mexico. If I have time I&#39;ll find the video.</p>

<p>As for the the microbes not posing a huge threat now... think about generations of these things becoming more prevalent as an adaptation to the new kind of food. It&#39;s not the first time it&#39;s happened and is a seeming genetic necessity for survival. But, this was supposedly only the first, and singular, study done on humans, according to the article. The reality seems to be similar to drug companies whose drugs turn out to be bad even after their scientists heralded the drugs: The testing is done en masse, without the population&#39;s consent but the population doesn&#39;t make the decisions. I even remember an article claiming that the cafeteria at Monsanto doesn&#39;t serve GMO foods and I&#39;d love to know what&#39;s on the power elites&#39; plates.</p>

<p>This has been discussed on reddit before.  Indian farmers have been committing suicide for many years, and the numbers did not increase with the introduction of GMO cotton.</p>

<p>I also have heard stories like this, but none that were well documented.  However, if you have some good documentation I would like to read it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Much of what you are saying here does not make much sense looking at it from a biochemical outlook.  Have you had courses in biochemistry and microbiology?  If so, I could get into a long discussion on this. Otherwise I will just point out that this is all based on a paper by Netherwood, and Netherwood says it is highly unlikely that the gene transfer events ... would ... pose a risk to human health.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It was alleged that 13 years ago, Monsanto hired a caterer for a Monsanto facility in Britain.  Many food providers in Britain don&#39;t serve GMO food, and supposed this caterer didn&#39;t.  I am not sure if this story is true.  It appears clear that now, all Monsanto cafeterias serve GMO food.  </p>

<li><p>Farmers: You&#39;re right. GM cotton is not the only seed they were using, but that just brings up all sorts of problems with the seed business itself. Do they actually have other viable options? I&#39;m not talking about options being out there, I&#39;m talking about plausibility. And feel free to look at the farmers in America getting just fucked by Monsanto, whether they purchased the seeds or the seeds found their way (they&#39;re not sentient, you know what i mean.) into the fields and then lawsuits, yada yada.</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone getting sick: I&#39;ve only seen videos that either were or were just pretending to be first-hand accounts. So either everyone is lying, there was some random illness at the time that happened to coincide with the crops they were using or it really was because of the GMOs.</p></li>
<li><p>As versed as I am in organic chem and microbio, was pre-med before changing majors, I&#39;m talking about general evolution. If being able to better process the GM foods is an advantage, humans will adapt or die or at least not reproduce. And since a human is basically a warehouse of other organisms, they have to adapt to the new foods as well. Or am I just completely misunderstanding evolutionary processes? Which is fine, I have no problem being wrong, this is just where I&#39;m coming from.</p></li>
<li><p>Cafe: That article is retarded on the basis that it refers to GM crops as &quot;conventional&quot;, if it does mean GM at all. It could just mean crops that use artificial pesticides and other means of growth as opposed to being strictly organic. No where does it actually say that they serve GM foods, hoping we&#39;ll associate &quot;conventional&quot; with &quot;GMO&quot;.</p></li>

<p>I have to admit I am not knowledgeable on all the reasons why Indian farmers commit suicide.  However it doesn&#39;t appear to be due to GMO&#39;s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And feel free to look at the farmers in America getting just fucked by Monsanto,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a complex subject.  My impression is that the farmers being sued by Monsanto deliberately planted GMO crops.  The most famous case is Schmeiser:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Canada_Inc._v._Schmeiser">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Canada_Inc._v._Schmeiser</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m talking about general evolution. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought you were talking about the Netherwood paper.  Let me say that the fish Orange Roughy first started being eaten by people in the 1970&#39;s.  It had 1000&#39;s of proteins in it never eaten by people before.  This could theoretically cause our gut bacteria to evolve in response to Orange Roughy proteins, but I have never heard people worry about this.  This sort of thing could theoretical happen every time humans start eating a new type of fish or any other food.  Now GM soy has a few new proteins not found in soy before, and that theoretically could cause gut bacteria to evolve, but this seems unlikely as the new proteins are not toxic to bacteria.  Meanwhile Orange Roughy has 1,000&#39;s of new proteins, and nobody worries about that.</p>

<p>The Monsanto article says they buy conventional food, they don&#39;t go out of their way to buy GM food or avoid GM food.  It&#39;s generally agreed that most conventional food you buy in a supermarket has GM ingredients.  It&#39;s next to impossible to buy conventional corn, soy, or beet sugar without having some GMO&#39;s mixed in, because most of these crops are GMO&#39;s.</p>

<p>At any rate the claim that Monsanto doesn&#39;t sell GM food is 13 years old and related to one canteen in Britain:
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1f4e58/if_monsantos_gmo_foods_are_actually_safe_then_why/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1f4e58/if_monsantos_gmo_foods_are_actually_safe_then_why/</a></p>

<p>As an overall discussion let me say there is a lot of articles on the Internet claiming GMO&#39;s are bad.  However, this opinion is not held by most scientifically literate people.  There is a scientific consensus that the genetically modified foods currently being produced are safe.  This is supported by multiple groups.</p>

<p>&quot;The American Medical Association, the National Academies of Sciences and the Royal Society of Medicine have stated that no adverse health effects on the human population related to GM food have been reported and/or substantiated in peer-reviewed literature to date&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The European Commission Directorate-General for Research and Innovation has supported GMO safety.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep saying it&#39;s the scientific consensus. I want to know where these statistics are and who funded the scientists&#39; research. Also, the European Commission, American Medical Assoc., Royal whatevers and so on would definitely get a kick-back for supporting GMOs from the companies so I take that with a grain of salt. I can imagine that the anti-gmo crowd doesn&#39;t have the ability to fund scientists who could understandably be bought by the pro-gmo guys. And they have to go where the funding is and if they don&#39;t produce desired results they are likely not to be funded again, ridiculed out of the profession or just blown off by people claiming consensus. See what I&#39;m getting at? Show me the facts you have and we&#39;ll go from there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I was discussing how often you should get a mammogram, I would say the medical consensus is to get a mammogram every 1-2 years from 40 to 50, then a mammogram every year after 50.  Then I would quote a bunch of prominent groups that support this.  </p>

<p>To prove the scientific consensus, I quote a lot of groups that most people with scientific knowledge know and respect.  Now if you don&#39;t know who the Royal Society of Medicine is, it&#39;s hard to respect it.  But you could at least Google it before insulting it by calling it the  &quot;Royal whatevers.&quot;  </p>

<p>Now a common claim on r/conspiracy is that all these prominent groups are being paid off.  No matter what web site I quote,  people can claim the web site is being paid off.  You can also claim that Wikipedia is being paid off, and all the scientific journals are being paid off.  Of course people will also claim I&#39;m being paid off; I must be a shill.</p>

<p>In such a case, you can go to a Cafe Scientifique talk, where we have a science talk and sit around eat and talk science.  I did that, and the talk turned to GMO&#39;s and everyone seemed to be in favor of them.   If you don&#39;t believe any link I send you, you can go out meet scientific people one on one, and see what they say.</p>

<p>Groups like the AMA are funded by dues and sometimes research money from the government.  The RSM says they are funded by donations.  Scientific papers usually quote their funding in the paper.  It&#39;s not clear from the website where the National Academy of Science gets their funding <a href="http://www.nasonline.org/">http://www.nasonline.org/</a>  the European Commission Directorate is presumably funded by the European Union.  Do you think the European Union is being paid off?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God you danced beautifully. You still have yet to provide what I&#39;ve asked for. And seem to have a complete misunderstanding of how power is organized. </p>

<p>You even danced around who funded the scientists. Let me be more clear. If a study was funded by Monsanto, I want to know it was funded by Monsanto. Does that instantly invalidate it? Of course not. It does raise questions as to how the studies were performed, what kind of information about them is available, if this scientist has worked for them before or after, what the conclusions were, and so on. It&#39;s like you completely ignore the concept of results based research. Or, to make that more clear, &quot;[We] have a goal, produce work that supports it.&quot; The corporate world is more concerned with money than the truth. It&#39;s like how this current round of banking bullshit is being played out. Bear Sterns was bought and the company who bought them took on the responsibilities. They projected that the fallout would be something like 28 billion and it was only 13 and about half or more of that could be written off. Companies will set up these funds for when shit fails and the penalties are just the cost of doing business and the cost of doing business is nowhere near their profit margins. Look at BP for example, or any pharmaceutical company who gets slapped with a class action lawsuit. There&#39;s already money set aside for these situations and they really just don&#39;t care. They have investors to please.</p>

<p>So, I ask again. Where are these studies coming from, who is funding it, and how many of the funded studies end up going against their financiers and are still published. Go ahead and dance some more. I&#39;ll be right here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looking back at my last post, you are right. I am not answering the question about who funded the scientists.  Sorry.</p>

<p>When Monsanto (or some other company) introduces a product, they pay for the research.  They tend to do the research in house, and there is a definite conflict of interest.  Ideally they should provide all their data to the government when they present the product, but they may have ways to avoid it.  </p>

<p>My brother does research for a drug company.  They present all data they generate to the government.  I don&#39;t know if Monsanto does.</p>

<p>The tobacco industry is know for doing research and <strong>not</strong> releasing it too the public.  For instance they hid research that showed how addicting tobacco was.   Possibly Monsanto is doing this.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another tobacco industry example:</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth the effort for you to talk a lot about this shill.  But when it comes to actually proving this shill even exists, suddenly you get lazy, and say it&#39;s not worth the effort.  You&#39;re making a lot of claims without real proof.  You are a typical shill.</p>

<p>It is not appropriate to ask users to stop pointing out Shills. Sure people often accuse people of such without verifiable cause, but simply asking people to <strong>stop doing so entirely</strong> will do a disservice</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The OP did not ask people to <strong>entirely</strong> stop calling people shills. The OP said:
&quot;Can people in this sub stop calling <strong>everyone who disagrees with them</strong> a &quot;shill&quot;?&quot;  If you have good proof that someone is a shill you can point it out.  In fact if you have good proof, you <strong>should</strong> point it out.  But if someone disagrees with you, that is a silly reason to call them a shill.  People should stop entirely  calling people shills <strong>when the only evidence is that they disagree.</strong>  People are frequently calling people shills without good proof.</p>
