       On Oct 25-28, 2013 California will be holding a 100+ city, 72-hour, cross agency anti-terrorism drill called Urban Shield.

       I bring this up due to the fact that these training drills have a tenancy to "go-live" via drill hijack and become real-world events. A drill hijack is when they use aspects of a drill to provide cover for a real (planned) event that mimics the general theme of the drill itself giving them "plausible deniability" via "miscommunication" (an out) if they happen to be caught prior to the "point of no return" in the hijacked aspect of the operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 3 major types of drill hijacks.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Event Overlapping Drill - When a scheduled drill, and a similar real world event happen in the same general area at the same time as each-other, with similar overall themes (MSELs).
Example: For the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting event the (overlap) drill hijack was done via a DHS child disaster response course that was being held 20 miles from Sandy Hook Elementary in Bridgeport CT, which was then overlapped with an active shooter drill being held in a neighboring county (Putnam). Both these drills were being held at the exact same time as the SH event.

        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Event Shadowing Drill - When a scheduled drill is held, and shortly after the drill that general area has a real-world event of the same general theme (MSEL) as the drill that was just ran shortly before.
Example: For the Santa Monica shooting event the (shadowed) drill hijack was the anti-terrorism drill that was held in LA the day prior on June 6, 2013 (666) in which the "shooter" John Zawahri was an "off the record" participant of (he thinks he is an official drill participant but really isn't). They then trick John into agreeing to participate in a continuation of the (none-existent) drill hijack the following day in Santa Monica, where he is then framed for a real crime via event overwrite/substitution.

        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Event Foreshadowing Drill - When a drill is scheduled for an area, but before the drill is able to run, a real-world event takes place closely matching the not yet run drills script (MSEL).
Example: For the Boston Bombing event the (foreshadowed) drill hijack was Urban Shield Boston 2013 which was scheduled for June 15-16, 2013. The drill hijack then occurs at the Boston Marathon exactly 2 months before the USB13 drill is to take place resulting in "The real thing happened before we were able to execute", using the exact location (opposite side of the street) with the exact same theme of the previous years Urban Shield drill (Urban Shield Boston 2012).

       Anyways I just bring this all up so people will keep an extra eye on the Cali area during (and shortly after) this drill, in-case something does actually go down. I personally think if something were to happen, it would happen the day following the official drill (Oct 29,2013). I have various reasons to think this but I am not going to go into them right now, but if a real event does take place around this time it will likely involve a large school campus (likely in San Diego) OR a high traffic airport (likely LAX or SFO) with the combined theme of backpack bombs &amp; assault weapons. Anyways stay safe everyone, and hopefully nothing will happen in Cali around this drill, unlike what happened recently in Boston...

       This is a bit too old school. Today, even if 5 or 10 percent of the population knows for a fact that something the government did was illegal, nothing will happen. This goes for industry as well (big industry).
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a hierarchical structure. So if the top of the pyramid does something wrong, why would the immediate lower personnel prosecute?

       It's just something that appears a bit strange, that's all. And GLP is GodLikeProductions. It's just another conspiracy forum that is more active than this one. There's still the same ratio of idiots and assholes, but more traffic (and I think there's a lot fewer shills)

       Maybe an ULF over the state of California to coax out the big one? If there were a disaster for the Obama administration they would swoop in to rescue their dismal approval ratings, and rescue the American people (in front of the cameras of course.)

       This is a bit too old school. Today, even if 5 or 10 percent of the population knows for a fact that something the government did was illegal, nothing will happen. This goes for industry as well (big industry).

       There's a hierarchical structure. So if the top of the pyramid does something wrong, why would the immediate lower personnel prosecute?
