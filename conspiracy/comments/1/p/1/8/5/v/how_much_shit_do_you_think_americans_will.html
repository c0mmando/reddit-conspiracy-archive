    <div class="md"><p>Americans are quite cleverly and effectively controlled by hot button issues. As long as the elite can taint the candidacy of any independent merely by pointing out that he is against a certain popular issue, such as abortion, that candidate will not be elected by those who fanatically support the hot button issue. The candidate can be perfect in every other way, but the hot button issue is used as a &quot;spoiler&quot; for his candidacy by those who manipulate public opinion through the media.</p>

<p>So to answer the question, I don&#39;t think there is anything that Americans won&#39;t tolerate, provided they have their egos massaged on a few key hot-button issues that the media has built up in their minds as all-important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are assuming, naively, that American elections aren&#39;t rigged to begin with...shit will change with this next generation growing older and opening their eyes to the corruption which is the government...I don&#39;t think we need more guns, we just need less complacency and more actively involved members of society...if even 20% of Americans start protesting, the gig is up...the problem I find is that people in America have been so divided on a superficial level that there is no unity, nor desire to help one another. I feel that the internet is changing that, but its all in due time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When those in charge try and use the military against American citizens is the only thing that will wake people up, IMO. The majority of the military would awol and everything would snowball into a revolution. Of course there are those in the armed services that would follow the government blindly, be it because they have nothing else other that what the US has given them or they are just deluded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well not sure of how much more, but as for returning the government back to the people. that will happen when everyone starts to open carry fire arms almost all the time. the cops will back down, the military will back down, and when those two back down, well then I am sure that those in government will see how unprotected we all really are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an American and a veteran I can confidently say that most Americans are lazy, apathetic, piles of crap that will never do anything about any situation that doesn&#39;t directly affect how easily we get our reality TV and how fast we can shove McDonalds in our faces. Keep in mind I am not saying that any other country is better but in this one I have seen cretins with the worst possible traits being elevated and celebrated. The American people deserve to have the government take away all their rights. We deserve to be spied upon and monitored. Nothing that is happening right now, with the government, happened by accident, we let it happen, we gave up the right to be angry about it when we gave up control in favor of complacency. We are sheep that consume propaganda and crap spinning rims; we are sheered, slaughtered and sacrificed at the alter of Corporate greed and we will keep bending over and taking it like a porn star on pain killers because it is easier than getting off our couches, turning off our TVs, walking outside and taking action. You want something to change? Take action. Stop talking about it. </p>

<p>We&#39;re still relatively comfortable over here and think more in terms of self than community in many cases.</p>

<p>If elimination of privacy and public corruption of government hasn&#39;t done it already, then it would have to be something major that impacted all of our creature comforts or basic needs, and it would have to affect a large percentage of the populace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They did.  It&#39;s called the Tea Party and they took over the House in 2010.  Biggest overturn of power in 70 years!  This has so scared the shit out of the establishment Dem/Repub parties that they&#39;ve pulled out all the stops when it comes to vilifying them.  Their message has now reached most Americans and they believe what they hear about the TP is true.  When in reality they&#39;re the patsies for all the establishments greedy, power crazed, business-as-usual, fuck up style of governance we&#39;ve become accustomed to.   </p>
