    <div class="md"><p>And you see, this is part of the problem with humanity and why we keep not only being treated like sheep/cattle, but why we will <em>continue failing</em> over and over again like the sheep/cattle the .01% see us as being.</p>

<p>We are so constantly looking or &quot;revenge&quot; or looking to smash somebody&#39;s head in, when if we spent that time and energy in simply coming together and HELPING EACH OTHER, there would simply be no .01% manipulating us in the first place.  They wouldn&#39;t be able to.  The only reason why they do and they can is because we have continued to buy into the separation manipulation that we&#39;ve been indoctrinated and brain washed with throughout our lives.</p>

<p>The &quot;black v white&quot;, &quot;rich v poor&quot;, &quot;male v female&quot;, &quot;straight v gay&quot;, &quot;etc v etc&quot; dichotomy is all, ALL synthetic and artificially promoted and exaggerated by the .01%.  There may inherently be differences amongst us, but those differences have been so exaggerated all out of proportion by TPTB, and it is why we as a people simply can&#39;t even come together as one and help one another against what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>The second some crazy shit happens and the money gets pulled from the banks or the Fed does some downsizing b.s., then we as a people feel &quot;we&#39;re screwed!  We&#39;re done for!!&quot;</p>

<p>We don&#39;t need the stupid monetary system that we&#39;ve allowed ourselves to be enslaved by in order to LIVE, God dammit.</p>

<p>We need each other.  We need to help each other.  We need to simply live in balance and as one.</p>

<p><strong>When the Last Tree Is Cut Down, the Last Fish Eaten, and the Last Stream Poisoned, You Will Realize That You Cannot Eat Money.</strong></p>

<p>We get confused and flustered if the crazy, stupid complication of our lives gets taken away from us - when it is in fact the simplicity of helping one another survive and thrive and live on this planet healthily that is the best thing that can help us.</p>

<p>Anyway...stupid humans, we are.  Stupid beings.</p>

<p>Rant over...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think a single moment of collapse is at all inevitable.  For 40-50 years there have been continual and numerous hits to public wealth and rights.  There was never a collapse, per se.  There were many &quot;crises&quot; that hurt the public rights and wealth.  Ultimately, we&#39;ll just be working as hard as middle class Chinese are now and with as few rights (edit: and as little income) and no one will have time to understand, let alone try to change, the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look what happened during the Arab Oil Embargo.  Unemployment was at %11 and inflation was also worse than it is now.  A complete loss of faith in the USD is also not a given, and that&#39;s part of why we have such an overwhelming military (and you&#39;re assuming more than couple countries not run by the people who run ours).  Also, look at the benefits to the elite of a total crash (could cost them power, even their lives), vs. that of having us as serfs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What power do we have now?  The military doesn&#39;t need to be formally in charge to be able to quell unrest.  In a crash, debt wouldn&#39;t be erased, but many more people would be unable to pay them, so they&#39;d make less.  But a crash also risks revolution and in a revolution most debt to the wealthy (including domestic national debt) disappears.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure they&#39;re prepared for that possibility, but why would they risk total loss to get a system no more beneficial to them than the current stable one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They own the very concept of money and those in power have more than they and their families can ever use, and the ability to create more at will.   You know why they killed MLK?  It wasn&#39;t the civil rights stance.  It was the crowds he could lead, but moreover, it was the two other topics he spoke constantly about (that our textbooks won&#39;t mention): Vietnam and poverty.  They were afraid of large masses of educated people organized against them; but really it was when he planned a massive march for the poor on DC, that they killed him.  (I mean Johnson hated him, but Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act under little or no pressure)</p>

<p>They&#39;re far past the need for monetary greed; when they take from us, it is more to keep us poor and uneducated.  Now it&#39;s just the desire to consolidate power and ensure they don&#39;t lose it.  Besides, I don&#39;t subscribe to the belief that a crash would lead to an increase in their wealth, in the short term or the long term.  Maybe some of the mid-level players just want more money, but they were only allowed to get that high up because the people with the real power let them, and thus they can be  reigned in if needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, I agree with all that, but it speaks to the point that they need to avoid a situation (a crash) where very large numbers of people suddenly won&#39;t be able to afford food, or material gratification.  Thus it would be smarter to slowly degrade our ability to obtain these things (slowly boiling the frog).</p>

<p>Most Americans have no idea that a 1 income family in 1976, in real terms, made about the same as a two income household today.  The reason they don&#39;t know is that those in power are very careful to choose what news is seen by most people.  One day, we&#39;ll wake up and still not realize that we&#39;re making half what we are now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we need to end fractional reserve banking and use either a gold or silver standard or a constitutional limit on how much money can be printed (William Jennings Bryan was a silver monetarist because it&#39;s harder to manipulate the price of than gold).</p>

<p>But what I really think is that they know not to kill the goose that laid the golden egg.  That&#39;s why I chose Chinese wage as an example; that&#39;s pushing it.  Also, cheaper manufacturing means that they can continue to slowly rob us more as goods get cheaper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive seen this happen firsthand. After hurricane Ike most of Houston and counties adjacent to Harris was without electricity for up to three weeks or more. I was an armed security guard and let me tell you, I learned that it doesn&#39;t take a whole lot to turn 1st world citizens into cavemen. </p>

<p>I was part of a nightly two man detail posted at a hotel equipped with a pair of big ol Detroit Diesel generators and several hundred gallons of diesel cordoned off with portable fencing. Full power provided for police, linemen and emergency workers (that came from as far away as Alaska) with warm showers and hot food and clean beds. There were high powered floodlights surrounding the place, the parking lot loaded with at least a hundred policecars and work trucks, and only two of us with shotguns, body armor, radio and handguns. At the limit of the lighting you could see shapes moving around, guys wanting to steal things. </p>

<p>Sometimes theyd throw rocks to make noise and try to get your attention while another would go try to get away with something. One time they somehow tore the lightbar off a police car. Probably jimmied it during a shift change. This went on for five nights straight. All they needed was some coordination and it would have been like downtown Mogadishu. </p>

Doesn&#39;t it concern you a little bit that Congress is shutting down again, not for something that would be deemed crucial to the American people. Not to mention that this shutdown will be during the weekend in which an Urban Shield terror drill will be run. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1p0g6g/congress_to_shut_down_thursday_fly_to_florida/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1p0g6g/congress_to_shut_down_thursday_fly_to_florida/</a>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so. You can&#39;t really fathom the wealth of the truly elite. The 1% have such vast amounts of wealth. If you took all the money, all the personal net worth of someone who was in the top 10% you might have a pile 6 feet tall. If you took the personal net worth of someone who was in the top 10% of the top 1%, that pile would be as tall as the Eiffel Tower. </p>

<p>But more meaningful than paper currency that is subject to inflation or even complete collapse, you have material wealth such as real estate, factories, agri-businesses, mineral rights, things that are lasting and difficult to wrest from anyone&#39;s control short of a repeat of the French Revolutaion. Even with that scenario, these people exist beyond any allegiance to a country or nation state. They simply pick up and leave for a safer country and carry on as easily as if you or I moved across town. </p>

<p>The very very wealthy right now have to ability to weather any storm.</p>

<p>On the flip-side are the millions who would quickly run out of food. Their jobs would disappear, government subsidies would be gone. Even the upper middle class would quickly succumb to economic realities of lost income streams. Those living on the poverty line or below would be at the mercy of charity and possibly face out-right starvation. One bad winter or a heat wave could kill thousands that could not afford heating or cooling in their homes. </p>

A one world currency that other countries can&#39;t rely on for a big chunk of their economic wealth and to prevent another collapse. </p>

<p>At least, from what I&#39;ve looked up and researched, this is how I think it will unfold. If their ultimate plan follows through, we are heading for some dark times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I say most, I think it will be to around 2 billion. They successfully ruled the world at a time when the population was this low. The powers that be already know that the common folk growing in huge numbers is a problem. It is much easier to divide and rule 2 billion than it is to rule 7.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what all this talk about limited resources is about. Sooner or later the wars on oil will turn into a war on water. Which is why I believe they&#39;re poisoning, polluting and destroying all our fresh water sources. People will be okay with fighting and killing others for water (especially if we can justify it for oil) if it means their survival. </p>

<p>This is why I believe the Bush family has a plot of land sitting over a massive water reserve in South America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are thinking of it wrong, yes the economy will collapse but the &quot;reality builders&quot; (my personal term) will simply create a new economic system with new social norms and conditioning for the &quot;majority&quot; to accept.  Keep in mind these guys have literally trillions of dollars and the best scientists and think tanks at their disposable which have been setting up contingencies and bunkers to steer humanity in their direction very subtly.  So in short yes the current economic system is not sustainable, but they will simply &quot;reboot&quot; into a new one with the assets of the old economic system at their disposal. Mind you there are other factors in play but this is my main argument that what is happening to today is simply the signs of purposeful systematic demolition of our current society and infrastructure.</p>

<p>So, to stick with familiar numbers, this top 1% will eventually have effectively all of the money. The rest of the population will have no choice but to use something else like gold, a new paper currency, or straight up bartering. </p>
