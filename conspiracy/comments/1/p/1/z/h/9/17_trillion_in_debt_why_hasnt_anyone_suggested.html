       I heard him in 08' and also in 12', no one fucking listened. The media shunned him and barely ever gave him face time, and if they did they always painted his views as "radical". The whole thing is a big show and everything is downright corrupt. They didn't want him to even get close because he would have destroyed Obama in a debate and a lot of people would have lost a lot of money... But now, alas, the rich still getting richer.

       it's just crazy that not ONE politician has even suggested this--especially with the "shut down"...it's not like the U.S. Gov't makes money on these bases--but private contractors DO...if you look on wikileaks for info on these bases you will most likely find contracts to build roads, base improvements (water, buildings, shooting ranges)...

       They went from "Let's attack Syria" to "We can't afford to pay our troops if we don't raise the debt ceiling" within a week of each other. This system is a complete illusion and one good puff will blow it away.

       "The people hire the politicians so that the people can:
      </p>
      <pre><code>obtain security without managing it.
obtain action without thinking about it.
inflict theft, injury, and death upon others without having to contemplate either life or death.
avoid responsibility for their own intentions.
obtain the benefits of reality and science without exerting themselves in the discipline of facing or learning either of these things. 
</code></pre>
      <p>
       They give the politicians the power to create and manage a war machine to:
      </p>
      <pre><code>provide for the survival of the nation/womb.
prevent encroachment of anything upon the nation/womb.
destroy the enemy who threatens the nation/womb.
destroy those citizens of their own country who do not conform for the sake of stability of the nation/womb. 
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Politicians hold many quasi-military jobs, the lowest being the police which are soldiers, the attorneys and C.P.A.s next who are spies and saboteurs (licensed), and the judges who shout orders and run the closed union military shop for whatever the market will bear. The generals are industrialists. The "presidential" level of commander-in-chief is shared by the international bankers. The people know that they have created this farce and financed it with their own taxes (consent), but they would rather knuckle under than be the hypocrite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, a nation becomes divided into two very distinct parts, a docile sub-nation [great silent majority] and a political sub-nation. The political sub-nation remains attached to the docile sub-nation, tolerates it, and leaches its substance until it grows strong enough to detach itself and then devour its parent.
System Analysis
In order to make meaningful computerized economic decisions about war, the primary economic flywheel, it is necessary to assign concrete logistical values to each element of the war structure - personnel and material alike.
      </p>
      <p>
       This process begins with a clear and candid description of the subsystems of such a structure.
The Draft (As military service)
Few efforts of human behavior modification are more remarkable or more effective than that of the socio-military institution known as the draft. A primary purpose of a draft or other such institution is to instill, by intimidation, in the young males of a society the uncritical conviction that the government is omnipotent. He is soon taught that a prayer is slow to reverse what a bullet can do in an instant. Thus, a man trained in a religious environment for eighteen years of his life can, by this instrument of the government, be broken down, be purged of his fantasies and delusions in a matter of mere months. Once that conviction is instilled, all else becomes easy to instill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more interesting is the process by which a young man's parents, who purportedly love him, can be induced to send him off to war to his death. Although the scope of this work will not allow this matter to be expanded in full detail, nevertheless, a coarse overview will be possible and can serve to reveal those factors which must be included in some numerical form in a computer analysis of social and war systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       We begin with a tentative definition of the draft.
      </p>
      <pre><code>The draft (selective service, etc.) is an institution of compulsory collective sacrifice and slavery, devised by the middle-aged and elderly for the purpose of pressing the young into doing the public dirty work. It further serves to make the youth as guilty as the elders, thus making criticism of the elders by the youth less likely (Generational Stabilizer). It is marketed and and sold to the public under the label of "patriotic = national" service.

Once a candid economic definition of the draft is achieved, that definition is used to outline the boundaries of a structure called a Human Value System, which in turn is translated into the terms of game theory. The value of such a slave laborer is given in a Table of Human Values, a table broken down into categories by intellect, experience, post-service job demand, etc.

Some of these categories are ordinary and can be tentatively evaluated in terms of the value of certain jobs for which a known fee exists. Some jobs are harder to value because they are unique to the demands of social subversion, for an extreme example: the value of a mother's instruction to her daughter, causing that daughter to put certain behavioral demands upon a future husband ten or fifteen years hence; thus, by suppressing his resistance to a perversion of a government, making it easier for a banking cartel to buy the State of New York in, say, twenty years.

Such a problem leans heavily upon the observations and data of wartime espionage and many types of psychological testing. But crude mathematical models (algorithms, etc.) can be devised, if not to predict, at least to predeterminate these events with maximum certainty. What does not exist by natural cooperation is thus enhanced by calculated compulsion. Human beings are machines, levers which may be grasped and turned, and there is little real difference between automating a society and automating a shoe factory.

These derived values are variable. (It is necessary to use a current Table of Human Values for computer analysis.) These values are given in true measure rather than U.S. dollars, since the latter is unstable, being presently inflated beyond the production of national goods and services so as to give the economy a false kinetic energy ("paper" inductance).

The silver value is stable, it being possible to buy the same amount with a gram of silver today as it could be bought in 1920. Human value measured in silver units changes slightly due to changes in production technology.
Enforcement

Factor I
    As in every social system approach, stability is achieved only by understanding and accounting for human nature (action/reaction patterns). A failure to do so can be, and usually is, disastrous.

    As in other human social schemes, one form or another of intimidation (or incentive) is essential to the success of the draft. Physical principles of action and reaction must be applied to both internal and external subsystems.

    To secure the draft, individual brainwashing/programming and both the family unit and the peer group must be engaged and brought under control. 
Factor II - Father
    The man of the household must be housebroken to ensure that junior will grow up with the right social training and attitudes. The advertising media, etc., are engaged to see to it that father-to-be is pussy-whipped before or by the time he is married. He is taught that he either conforms to the social notch cut out for him or his sex life will be hobbled and his tender companionship will be zero. He is made to see that women demand security more than logical, principled, or honorable behavior.

    By the time his son must go to war, father (with jelly for a backbone) will slam a gun into junior's hand before father will risk the censure of his peers, or make a hypocrite of himself by crossing the investment he has in his own personal opinion or self-esteem. Junior will go to war or father will be embarrassed. So junior will go to war, the true purpose not withstanding. 
Factor III - Mother
    The female element of human society is ruled by emotion first and logic second. In the battle between logic and imagination, imagination always wins, fantasy prevails, maternal instinct dominates so that the child comes first and the future comes second. A woman with a newborn baby is too starry-eyed to see a wealthy man's cannon fodder or a cheap source of slave labor. A woman must, however, be conditioned to accept the transition to "reality" when it comes, or sooner.

    As the transition becomes more difficult to manage, the family unit must be carefully disintegrated, and state-controlled public education and state-operated child-care centers must be become more common and legally enforced so as to begin the detachment of the child from the mother and father at an earlier age. Inoculation of behavioral drugs [Ritalin] can speed the transition for the child (mandatory). Caution: A woman's impulsive anger can override her fear. An irate woman's power must never be underestimated, and her power over a pussy-whipped husband must likewise never be underestimated. It got women the vote in 1920. 
Factor IV - Junior
    The emotional pressure for self-preservation during the time of war and the self-serving attitude of the common herd that have an option to avoid the battlefield - if junior can be persuaded to go - is all of the pressure finally necessary to propel Johnny off to war. Their quiet blackmailings of him are the threats: "No sacrifice, no friends; no glory, no girlfriends." 
Factor V - Sister
    And what about junior's sister? She is given all the good things of life by her father, and taught to expect the same from her future husband regardless of the price. 
Factor VI - Cattle
    Those who will not use their brains are no better off than those who have no brains, and so this mindless school of jelly-fish, father, mother, son, and daughter, become useful beasts of burden or trainers of the same. "

       that is an excerpt from a document called "Silent  Weapons for Quiet Wars" ... there's genuine copies floating about online and a bunch of people trying to say it's all bullshit and  'say' they 'made it up' .... yeah right!
      </p>
      <p>
       Dig up a copy and have a read, it's chilling!  Plus it was written in 1979 so you have many years hindsight to see the "super elite"

       I highly doubt current Democrat and Republican presidential candidates are going to put up a fight against Nestle, but the President cannot privatize public water systems which belong to their respective cities and states. They would have the authority to close military bases, however.

       I think you can admit that the office of the President is much more powerful these days than before but that is off topic.  I do realize change has to come from the ground up but the power of the Veto is strong, if rarely used.

       This is exactly what I'm talking about. Ron Paul advocates stump for smaller government, while tacitly admitting that
       <strong>
        the existing Unitary Executive remaining in tact
       </strong>
       is the only way someone like Paul could run a government diametrically opposed to his viewpoints.

       No way.  The executive orders are madnes, line vetos and signing statements are also dubious in my opinion but an outright refusal to sign a bill into law is how it should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you mean presidential interpretation of law which i don't quite understand myself, i think that steps on the toes of the judicial, of course appointments to the court are suspect but those require approval too don't they?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe that points to another issue of how can a law be passed and signed if the language is so vague as to not be clearly understood.

       Well, as a Canadian who has been waiting for years to see multiple doctors... socialized health care is not always so rosy. I still prefer our system to the US one, but socialized health care has many, many problems.

       Poorly maintained socialized healthcare has many problems, yes. Brunei for example has
       <em>
        terrible
       </em>
       healthcare, even though it costs next to nothing for citizens (no taxes, even). Then there's Japan, which has some of the best healthcare in the world, except that it's under-funded and causes doctors to be paid less than what they deserve and hospitals and clinics to have to downsize or shut down from time to time due to lack of funds.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, you can't lump all socialized medicine into the same category. There are many methods of implementation, some that work extremely well and some that fail miserably. Problems can be overcome, but only if people are willing to work on them.

       Okay so if im understanding correctly: you believe everyone deserves healthcare–i would assume adequate, and effective healthcare–and that a state monopoly on it is the best way to achieve this. I think there are very few who dont want for everyone to have access to healthcare, however the way to achieve that is contended (Seems to me only because of state propaganda, but that it a whole nother topic). My question is: what empirical data do you have that this is achieved  or can ever be achieved in a government run system?

       Youre just naming off countries which have socialized medicine. Im asking for empirical data supporting the idea that having government run healthcare is a better system (ie: keeps more people healthy) than a non government run health care system.

       How is life expectancy a good determinant of a good healthcare system? Maybe everyone hates the healthcare system so much that they take care of themselves so as not to have to deal with it and thus live longer (satirical but still, i think, not illogical)?

       I AM an Australian who HAS BEEN RECEIVING FREE HEALTH CARE FOR OVER 40 YEARS .....
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       it I, and many many other Aussies WOULD BE DEAD!  On one occaision, I received what would have cost a US citizen, literally Millions of dollars, I got for free! (gammaglobulin infusions, 60gms x 12 infusions)
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a fantastically successful system, although people will
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       suggest it can be 'better', on a daily basis, EVERY Aussie KNOWS they WILL BE treated, and dont need to worry at all about "paying" ... the only benefit of having your own insurance, is faster treatment when needing
       <em>
        'elective surgery'
       </em>
       , IF you NEED ANY "immediate" surgery, you WILL get it ....  for Free!
      </p>
      <p>
       I am over 50 and I have yet to see someone left 'untreated' when they seek treatment.  Sure the quality of treatment varies from place to place and time to time, but overall, I wouldn't want to get sick anywhere else!
      </p>
      <p>
       The US has simply spent it's money on 'killingry and destruction' as this post suggests, TPTB have

        NO

       interest in seeing the "sheeple" (their term!) get medical care!  FFS! they want to cull 90% of them right Now!

       Of course it is the person who benefits who thinks that it is good. Do you really think that for the cost of millions to save you it would have not been worth it to save thousands of starving children in Somalia? Why do you think you are above people in the rest of the world? 
It is a matter of efficiency, if you could save 1 person for 10 billion or prevent infant deaths in the entire world which would you choose? Well in Australia it looks like we are choosing the first because of the sole fact that they are Australian. 
And yes you would say it is free because you didn't pay for it, but someone did. Personally I am disgusted at this system. I would rather die than have millions of other peoples money be unwillingly spent so that I could survive.

       Unwillingly?
I have worked in healthcare in the US.  I would willingly spend A LOT more of my tax dollars on healthcare, than to see people (usually young and uninsured) die because of inexpensive and very preventable things like a ruptured intestine or an abscessed tooth. A person may live without a lot of "things", however health is not one of these.

       Sorry im not sure what youre saying/asking. It seems like youre saying 'well, why wouldnt you be a shill? It seems like all you do is say things which i consider shill-like'. Is that accurate?
      </p>
      <p>
       All i did was ask some questions to get a socialist's perspective. I am new to libertarianism and just wanted to get more info on the opposition. Again, im not sure why the government would pay me to advocate their demise–theres probably bureaucrats stupid enough but thats besides the point–so i dont see how saying something you disagree with–especially when yours is the position with government support–makes me a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you can look through my post history and assuredly find plenty of 'non-shill' posts, many of which hit the character-limit, that are things you–as someone interested in conspiracy–would find respectable. Of course, if you want to just say im a shill because i disagree with you, despite some pretty significant counter evidence, well theres not much i can do about that.

       ~40 hours a week for not even two months. Hardly enough to be some all knowing guru. But thats besides the point. I would have done the same thing had i been studying libertarianism for 20 years. I assuredly would have some pretty compelling counter arguments by then but i would have started the same way–with the socratic method.  I strongly recommend checking it out. If youre interested in gaining knowledge/challenging your own beliefs and/or causing others to reconsider theirs, its really the best method (and, arguably, the only effective one).

       Look up the healthcare quality of the various countries he listed and compare them with ours. THEN, compare the costs of their systems to ours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ours is the most expensive in the world and is nowhere near the best.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a great reason why private healthcare doesn't work. Look up the situation in Pittsburgh right now between Highmark and UPMC. It's absurd and both are behaving like children while buying hospitals to build monopolistic statuses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you like the monopolized telecom industry? That's what this is becoming here in Pittsburgh.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is coming from a libertarian myself. I just realize with common sense you really need a hybrid of government and private sector. My main logic is that we will never have a true free market because our politicians are so fucking corrupt, so force the government to adapt as modern countries have.

       Let me just note first off that ive been looking into libertarianism and all that it entails for less than 2 months. I have spent about 8 hours a day on it for those 2 months, but i am still very new. That is why i am asking questions and not claiming anything. In a few more months, i surely will have lots more facts and much more supported positions, but at this point in time it would be foolish to make substantial claims. With that said:
      </p>
      <p>
       What are you referring to as 'their costs'? Are you including taxes? I do know that Canadians pay far more taxes than we (Americans) do and they arent even running around policing the world with a military budget larger than the rest of the world's combined. Also, lets say it is cheaper–it breaks every law of economics that it would be but lets just say it is because i havent had time to look yet–what statistical figures are there that it is allowing more people to get access to their healthcare? Or that the healthcare is good? Of the few Canadians ive talked to on the matter, it is mostly horror stories of getting tossed around between unmotivated doctors or waiting months (or years) for aid. Of course, it would be foolish to base conclusions on a few anecdotes, but they are consistent with the trend of every other government program in history (that i know of) and id be amazed to find that THIS government program actually works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also i want to point out That we already have 'govenment run' healthcare here in the US to an extent. We have a monopoly on doctors in the AMA, inflating prices and preventing people from practicing without a over a decade of training and 'certification'; we have all these FDA regulations bolstering costs, preventing drugs from getting long term testing,  making it far cheaper to create a new, patented drug than to further test a current one for better uses or potential side effects, along with hundreds of other things that i am sure i am not yet even aware of; we have insurance companies lobbying and bribing the government; i have yet to look to deeply but i am sure most of the regulatory agencies are filled to the brim with former corporate healthcare employees; and surely hundreds of other things. The idea that we have anything even in the same galaxy as a 'free market' in helathcare is a fantasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will look into the situations you have listed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your last point however, is confusing to me. You acknowledge that politicians are corrupt. You seem to acknowledge that it is inherent to the system. Yet because they are so corrupt, we have to give them MORE power?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, libertarian is pretty broad term. Would you mind just providing a summary of how you think society would best be run?
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheers!

       When I mentioned costs I mean the total cost of healhcare for each country and even per capita.  Here is an article from October of last year that illustrates it perfectly:
       <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/10/health-costs-how-the-us-compares-with-other-countries.html">
        http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/10/health-costs-how-the-us-compares-with-other-countries.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks like we spend double the international average on healtcare and it eats up almost 18% of our GDP.  And I don't compare to Canada's healthcare, like many stupid Americans do (not calling you dumb I'm just speaking generally), because the Canadian government is almost as conservative as ours and their healthcare is implemented nearly as well as other countries'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of our problem is since our government is coprorate owned they don't regulate what they should.  My friend does research at a UPMC hospital, and the prices they pay to heir suppliers on EVERYTHING is marked up by 1000%.  Now, that's capitalism, and more importantly it shows how much capitalism does not work.  It has been studied and beaten so badly that there is no advantage to our system for average people.  To put it bluntly it fucks us.  Hell, I had an MRI on my knee back last winter which with my insurance cost me over $1,000.  Then, I got rehab on it for about $400 a month ON TOP OF my $200 monhly insurance premium. Let me remind you that this is a High Deductible Plan and that NOTHING was even done to my knee (no surgery or anything).  Why the fuck am I paying for this insurance when it seems like it isn't even doing anything?  hat's how bad this system is.  That's what monopolies controlling the entire thing look like.  What if I didn't have insurance or if I had gone to a non-UPMC rehab center (they try to force their customers to their own facilities or they charge you more in the insurance coverage for the treatment).  Sounds a lot like the telecom industry doesn't it?  And we all know how much the FCC loves those oligopolies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, I acknowledge our politicians are corrupt as hell and the contradict that by wanting single pyaer.  Well, I should say that a NORMAL government would benefit us by implementing universal healthcare, but yeah who knows with our piece of shit government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read a single payer system would actually save the country money overall, but sadly I can't remember how.  I think we would only need a 1-1.5% tax increase.  Well shit, if it would work properly and that be the only thing you pay to healthcare then sign me up.  With taxes, the way I look at it when people always say our taxes are soooo much lower than socialized countries, it's true.  BUT, it's not THAt much cheaper here, and look at what we get with our taxes compared to other countries.  We get war, collapsing infrastructure, dumbed-down education, public transportation, etc.  The other countries get good education THROUGH COLLEGE, healthcare, infrastucture for the 21st century, great public transit, etc.  When I think about moving outta here it seems like a no-brainer.  If I can get this stuff for some higher taxes and work less then that is awesome.  If I stay here I get to work until I die and pay out the ass for EVERYTHING not included in taxes, and everything overall is mediocre at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just try to apply common sense to what I feel is the best system.  A hybrid between libertarianism and socialism.  Government contol the essentials that we need like inrastructure, healthcare, education, etc. but in order for that to work, or our current system to work, they need to end the corrupt military expenditures.  That's the major cause of our downfall is that we spend so much on war and defense spending so that our politicians get some fat checks from their friends.  Yes, that would most likely end up as a problem with universal healthcare as well, which is why we need to revamp so many laws to prevent that along with the absurd CEO pay, the tax system which is overly complicated and terrible, education as they have fucked that royally, transit, and many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, end of my rant.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR; I feel a hybrid system would be perfect, kind of like what our current is meant to be but it actually isn't.  The healthcare stats are there early on and they are not promising.  Everyday while I'm at work I think about and debate which country to move to in a few years, to one that actually respects and cares about its people and not just the ruling rich/elites.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Here's another couple very depressing articles showing stats of our healthcare prices.  Christ, I hope I don't get sick or else I'm fucked.  They make you feel like it's your fault by these prices.

       Youre right in that 8 hours is probably a little high. At least 6 for sure. Id say sundays are at least 8 hours though. I have a pretty repetitive job so i listen to lectures/documentaries/audiobooks. I spent the same amount researching atheism/science for a couple months (documentaries, books, reddit, other online material) then moved over to conspiracy (was so stressed for the first few months  that i was probably upwards of 10 hours a day during those) for about a year and about 2 months ago started getting into libertarian/anarchocapitalism/philosophy/back into science. Stefan Molyneux's  podcasts  make up like 80%+ of my resources (currently making it through 7 or 8 a day at 30-60 min each) but i creep reddit, and other libertarian sources for a couple hours a night as well. I could continue on about why and other stuff but im sure you dont really care–totally understandable and respectable. I will say that i spent the first 20 years of my life feeling a void and realized, thanks to reddit honestly, that knowledge and truth are what im in search of and thus i feel like i have 20 years to catch up on. Im sure its abnormal and probably pretty weird, but thats just the way it is.
  ¯_(ツ)_/¯
      </p>
      <p>
       Not much else i can say to cause you to reconsider that i am a lying troll ; you can look through my post history or something if you want and the trend i described above should be pretty apparent but other than that id sum it up with an oh-well.

       From what I've seen, there are two main reasons why people reject the idea of universal healthcare here; greed, or blind fear of socialism (never mind the socially funded services we already have in place). There could be more, but I haven't seen 'em.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are dozens of other countries on full or partial universal healthcare systems, and though some may not be perfect, the people in those countries are still shocked at how poor our healthcare system is compared to theirs. I remember talking to a friend of mine in Australia once who couldn't fathom why another friend of mine didn't go to the hospital when they had a potentially life threatening condition. I had to explain that homeless people with no insurance and no money don't usually get seen unless they're bleeding to death or something. The Australian friend was completely floored. They were even more shocked to learn how expensive dental care is. Such sentiments are extremely common.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what shocks people the most about it is that most of the developed nations (and even some
       <em>
        developing
       </em>
       nations) operate under some form of socialized medicine. They assume a country as wealthy as the US would have one of the best systems in the world, so they're surprised to find how far behind we're lagging.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's really messed up is that the US government spends a lot more on healthcare right now than most countries with "free" government funded healthcare, and yet we're not as healthy. Switching to universal healthcare would cut down on unnecessary treatments (which are disgustingly common here), and would improve overall health (which would improve labor output of working age citizens) and life expectancy. (If you're wondering, a lot of that healthcare spending that we do here is on old and disabled people, so with universal healthcare we'd end up with less unhealthy old people and less disabled people, thus decreasing the size of by far the most expensive demographic over time).
      </p>
      <p>
       People who are against socialized medicine would have you believe it hardly ever works, but the fact of the matter is that when it's well planned it hardly ever
       <em>
        doesn't

       Oh, and if you want a good example of efficient socialized medicine right here in the US, look at veteran and active duty healthcare. Not perfect, but it works. Since it's government funded, they benefit from keeping people healthy. The opposite is true everywhere else in the US... disease keeps people coming back and putting more money in hospitals' pockets.

       Well seem you to have pretty good tangible support for your belief on the matter, while i –as i said, with only a few months into libertarianism–have come more from the first-principle/philosophical/moral  principles so far. However those are against the state a whole, and not tailored specifically to social programs (i think i could, at this point, make a slightly more compelling case against welfare but probably not as good as i would hope) and thus i really dont, yet, have much datawise to argue with you. I think people took it as sarcasm when i was asking what empirical evidence people had for positives of socialized medicine–i wasnt, i was genuinely inquiring because i just dont know (yet).  If i do come up with some more compelling arguments from effect, id be happy to post back in a few months if youre interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, (im on my phone so i could be wrong) but i dont think you answered my last question: what would your ideal society look like? Also what does libertarianism mean to you? I just ask out of curiousity. This is the first actual debate, for lack of a better term (started this whole thing just to see how well i could argue my position so far), on this type of information so i am just curious what your position is.

       Libertarianism is a mish-mash of good and bad ideas that cater primarily to those who can afford to be "free". They forsake society in favor of individuals, ignoring that most individuals can benefit greatly from a well functioning society. They take self-determination and responsibility to extremes, and leave no room for anybody to ask for help if they need it. It's like the wet dream of every corporate sleaze bag. At least that's what it looks like from the outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for my ideal society, it would be a healthy mix of socialism and capitalism, with every person having at least enough to survive on (with a requirement to have a certain number of hours of paid or volunteer work, or perhaps education as well, logged each week to make sure people aren't just sitting on their asses doing nothing and letting other taxpayers support them), but also the ability to pursue wealth if they so desire. I suppose this high standard of living would be achieved with equally high taxes, but I feel it's worth it to have a society free of poverty and etc. Too much socialism kills motivation to excel, while too much capitalism kills morality and can create much too steep a divide between the rich and poor. Too little socialism hangs the poor out to dry, while too little capitalism makes life dull and innovations slow to progress. In this ideal society the government would be run by the most qualified willing citizens rather than professional politicians, and it wouldn't pay too much more than an average job. Them's the basics, anyway. To come up with a detailed outline it'd take hours, and I don't care to spend so much time on something I have little hope of bringing to fruition.

       No, how about having a free market on healthcare?? Makes way better sense than the take and give system. People have to be accountable for their own lives sometimes.

       I consider healthcare a right, not a privilege to be reserved for the fewer and fewer who can actually
       <em>
        afford
       </em>
       it every year. There's a difference between being accountable for your own life, and being spat on by those who would rather watch you die than let their tax dollars save you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Medical expenses and loss of income due to illness are the #1 causes of people filing bankruptcy. Just what do you think happens when somebody defaults on their medical bills? The hospital says "well, shucks!" and moves on? No. Prices get jacked up over time so that the hospital can stay in business, which in turn causes more people to default on their medical bills. It's a vicious cycle with no end in sight with the current system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the people who end up disabled because they couldn't afford proper medical treatment and got rejected from hospitals due to lack of insurance (which they also couldn't afford). Your tax dollars pay for those people's disability checks for the rest of their lives. Paying for universal healthcare is cheaper in the long run than paying for the people who end up disabled due to lack of healthcare. Unless you'd have disabled people "be accountable for their own lives", too.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you or a loved one ever had to forgo necessary medical treatment because of lack of funds, you would understand the implications of telling somebody to be accountable for their own life when it's clearly impossible for them to afford it. You're telling them that their life is worthless, and that you don't give a shit whether they live or die. Is that really the kind of person you want to be?
      </p>
      <p>
       The healthcare system in this country is a laughing stock to other nations, and a death sentence to the poor here. Something has to give. We can afford it, and it's high time we implemented it. None of this Obamacare bullshit, either.

       You're assuming such a state can exist. The natural progression of human societies is to develop governing bodies. Even the smallest, most remote indigenous tribes have some sort of power structure. Given time small groups will kill each other off or band together, either case pouring resources into the hands of those in power. Provided the leadership operates responsibly for a period such that it maintains the support of the people, it is only a matter of time before the people place too much trust in those leaders and a government is formed.

         I think you can admit that the office of the President is much more powerful these days than before but that is off topic. I do realize change has to come from the ground up but the power of the Veto is strong, if rarely used.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        This is exactly what I'm talking about. Ron Paul advocates stump for smaller government, while tacitly admitting that the existing Unitary Executive remaining in tact is the only way someone like Paul could run a government diametrically opposed to his viewpoints.
       </p>

       U.S. Military presence in 130+ countries--only 190 countries on the planet...
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), passed after the attacks of 11 September 2001, and provides the legal cornerstone for the so-called US "war on terror". Only one brave Congress member opposed it. It allows the US government to wage war at anytime, any place and on anyone deemed a threat to national security – with remarkably little evidence needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the new normal. Statistics provided by Special Operations Command (pdf) indicate that special forces groups were operating in 92 different countries in March 2013. The AUMF premise, no matter how it gets tweaked, is
       <strong>
        enabling a system of eternal warfare
       </strong>
       , a reality that is not only financially untenable for a nation in deep debt, but also ethically indefensible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second,
       <strong>
        the AUMF continues to undermine rule of law
       </strong>
       . There are clear laws that apply to wartime situations or imminent threats, and a broadened AUMF could undermine these further. That the US already broadly categorizes individuals and groups that are loosely or tacitly associated with extremists – in secret and sometimes without evidence – is already setting a dangerous precedent."

       You know that the US is an imperial power? We are living in Pax Americana, once the US petrodollar status/world reserve currency status fades away the bases will close. Until then the US needs to have bases all over the world to impose monetary policy.

       And not a peep about auditing Switzerland, Cayman Islands etc. if we did that rich ppl wouldn't even claim their money. They would be embarrassed by how much they have senselessly hoarded
       <br/>
       Also think auditing trust funds is a good idea. People have a skewed perception of trusts. They think it's some benevolent rich guy helping humanity. Bull shit. It's a way for rich ppl to achieve immortality and steer society from beyond the grave. 
I know these are radical ideas. Even by reddit standards but wtf. Just sayin'

       I think you are confusing the financial audit with the performance audits that the GAO does. The GAO isn't allowed to audit some activities related to monetary policy, since it was felt to undermine its independence in those areas. All of the accounts are subject to audit by the outside accounting firm.

       By moving the money overseas, and thus out of the economy, you're effectively canceling the social contract between man and government. Taxation is what allows governments to operate. If you take money overseas you then are using public facilities, roads, sewer, power lines, infrastructure in general really, all for free. By paying taxes you pay for your share of these amenities as well as the protection of your government's military.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taxes pay for many other things that benefit individuals as well, but the other important thing to consider is the lasting effects of removal of wealth from an economy. By not recirculating wealth into the system it was drawn from, the system is left without the means to continually invest in and build-up the economy. If enough people transfer enough wealth overseas, without that wealth being reinvested into America by foreign powers, then the economy collapses.

       Do you really 'own' money? Your fiat dollars are overblown IOU notes. Go ahead and take them down to your local bank and ask to exchange their value for gold like you're supposed to be able to, see what they tell you.
      </p>
      <p>

       If we cut the spending and brought all or most of the troops home, we could afford to start paying off our debts, have a first class universal healthcare system, and we could extend free education through to the college level. After the debts were paid off we could completely eliminate poverty and homelessness through state funded programs, and even that wouldn't use up all of the tax money we'd have.

      <pre><code>**CHALMERS JOHNSON: Well, I don’t see any way out of it. I think it’s gone too far. 
</code></pre>
      <p>
       I think we are domestically too dependent on the military-industrial complex, that every time — 
I mean, it’s perfectly logical for any Secretary of Defense to try and close military bases that are redundant, that are useless, that are worn out, that go back to the Civil War. 
Any time he tries to do it, you produce an uproar in the surrounding community from newspapers, television, priests, local politicians: save our base.
      </p>
      <pre><code>The two mother hens of the Defense Facilities Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
</code></pre>
      <p>
       the people committed to taking care of our bases are easily Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and Dianne Feinstein of California, the two states with the largest number of military bases, and those two senators would do anything in their power to keep them open. 
This is the insidious way in which the military-industrial complex has penetrated into our democracy and gravely weakened it, produced vested interests in what I call military Keynesianism, the use and manipulation of what is now three-quarters of a trillion dollars of the Defense budget, once you include all the other things that aren’t included in just the single appropriation for the Department of Defense.
      </p>
      <pre><code>This is a — it’s out of control. We depend upon it, we like it, we live off of it. 
</code></pre>
      <p>
       I cannot imagine any President of any party putting together the coalition of forces that could begin to break into these vested interests, any more than a Gorbachev was able to do it in his attempted reforms of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s**

       The UK/EU/1%ers/Banksters want us to be in debt so that we are easily controllable. The US's role is that of military enforcer. We attack the Muslims for the Europeans and the Israelis, and we get the blame for the attack while they profit. The UK used the US to defeat the USSR in the Cold War. The USSR collapsed, and now it is our turn. The goal is too reestablish the UK/EU/Israel as the center of power.

       Just a thought: but because of the way things have seemed to be going - although it would be to our benefit to bring all the troops home from other countries and find some other way to work with those nations, there may be an economic incentive for keeping them there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the world uses the U.S. dollar as its reserve currency, the U.S. receives quite a bit of economic benefit. If the U.S. were to remove it's projected military force from foreign arenas, it would likely speed the replacement of the dollar with some other reserve currency system and impact life here at home.

       The defense contractors have friends in high places. NOTHING will stand in the way of their multi- BILLION dollar gravy train!
Surely you've heard of the 'Industrial Military Complex"

       because the only thing keeping all those inflated dollars created by our massive debt is the threat of the US Military to cut off energy and trade to foreign nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the military backs off the world reserve currency will change to gold or something less devalued and those dollars will come back to the 48 states when foreign holders purchase stock and real estate.

       How much money would it save?
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I think no politician wants to touch that with a ten foot pole because then you'll be "weak on national security" and "against the military."
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing to consider: shrinking the size of the military will affect a lot of young people who have no serious college prospects after high school and choose to go into the military. Were will we employ those people if not in our massive war machine? Manufacturing has been outsourced. Detroit is a wasteland.

       As a retired Marine. It would save billions. I can go into how much you save by cutting foreign local contractors costs on servicing the bases. Let alone fuel cost. I can go on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also yes it would save money on US military personnel. Then they would no longer get extra hazard duty pay. You don't have to lay them off. However that too would be advisable. The taxpayer should not be footing bills to pay for progressing war. It's the same principle that parking meters exist for providing income for parking meter patrol officers. Taxpayers are not in the business of providing monetary support to create unnecessary jobs. It should be limited and light on our pocket books.

       We are talking billions here. That's no chump change which can go to better services here to the local taxpayer. You explain that to those who pay social security and loan it to the government to use on the military. The government can start paying back into the SS Trust fund which is owed 3.5 trillion. Instead of Government officials saying it's too broke to fix. Maybe how about putting in back into VA benefits which they cut because they said there was no money to fund health care of the wounded?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your reasoning of ignoring billions leaves me scratching my head. You must be a politician to think it's trivial suns of money. That is why the debt got so large. No one gives a shit where the money goes down to the last dollar. Do you watch your home finances that way? You need to learn how to budget to stay ahead of debt.

       I'm not a politician. I just question how much of a dent it will make. DoD spending in 2012 was  $707 billion. If we cut the whole thing, it will balance things pretty fast. But I don't know how much of that is for maintaining overseas operations and how much is domestic. That budget includes several intelligence agencies. Also, a

       Nothing will ever make a dent in 16 trillion.  We're just prolonging the collapse.  Everybody I know talks about the welfare cuts, the defunded programs, the debt ceiling increases.  Nobody really understands how much 16 trillion is.  Cutting a couple million in welfare is like taking grains out of a sandbox.  We are totally, irreversibly, and permanently fucked.

       You're assuming such a state can exist. The natural progression of human societies is to develop governing bodies. Even the smallest, most remote indigenous tribes have some sort of power structure. Given time small groups will kill each other off or band together, either case pouring resources into the hands of those in power. Provided the leadership operates responsibly for a period such that it maintains the support of the people, it is only a matter of time before the people place too much trust in those leaders and a government is formed.

       If we don't have a functioning government, another country that does will eventually come in erect their own. Govern yourself if you are able, or be governed by those who can.

       Youre just naming off countries which have socialized medicine. Im asking for empirical data supporting the idea that having government run healthcare is a better system (ie: keeps more people healthy) than a non government run health care system.

       ~40 hours a week for not even two months. Hardly enough to be some all knowing guru. But thats besides the point. I would have done the same thing had i been studying libertarianism for 20 years. I assuredly would have some pretty compelling counter arguments by then but i would have started the same way–with the socratic method.  I strongly recommend checking it out. If youre interested in gaining knowledge/challenging your own beliefs and/or causing others to reconsider theirs, its really the best method (and, arguably, the only effective one).

       Also i am 23, not that that matters.
