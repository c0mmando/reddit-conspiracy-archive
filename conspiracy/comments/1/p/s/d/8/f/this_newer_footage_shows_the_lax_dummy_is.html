       Just thought I'd post it since I see a lot of disinfo and fake conspiracies about LAX being pushed.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I wrote in earlier comments, it wouldn't make sense for them to use a dummy here, or the footage from the previous drill. Too many witnesses in the fire/police force could come forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most obvious "mistakes" in false flags are planted. They always have evidence they can bring forward to disprove conspiracies if the backlash becomes too publicized.

      <p>
       EDIT: as posters have noted, dummy technology is actually good enough to make a dummy that could look this close to a real person. Personally though, I'm still about 90% sure it's a real person.

       Interesting, I didn't realize dummy technology was so advanced.

      <p>
       I guess it could be a dummy then. Really hard to tell. Just doesn't seem to make logical sense for them to use a dummy. We will have to see what new information comes out over the next week.

       Say LA say Hollywood. Fully make-believe event.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is claimed that the victim, Gerardo Hernandez, was killed by a shot to the chest, that, according to the doctor, Dr. David Plurad, of the UCLA Medical center, " Dr. Plurad said he was killed by a round that broke into fragments inside his torso leading to massive bleeding as well as chest and abdominal injuries . “We made every effort to stop the bleeding and get the heart to beat on his own,'” Dr. Plurad said."
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also said that the shooter used an AR-15. This type of rifle uses full metal jacket ammo. I've never seen any hollow point or hydrashock in .22 LR. It is extremely unlikely for a full metal jacket round fired at close range to break into fragments.

       AR15's are chambered in .223 Remington or 5.56mm NATO, not .22LR.  Furthermore .223 and 5.56 are high velocity cartridges rated  @ 3200 FPS, they are devestating to soft targets at close range.  This velocity results in explosive fragmentation w/ total jacket seperation, especially with just typical 55gr FMJ ammo. There is a reason that the M16 was nicknamed "the meat axe" when it was introduced during the Vietnam war.

       You gotta look at the whole picture - it was a dummy that was fake-rushed to toy ambulances by crisis EMT actors.

       that's the sandy hook "footage" of another school. Also you could just google "Steve silva 9/11 witness" and "Steve silva Boston bombing witness." There's others also.

       An eyewitness says he walked past the dead security guard on the floor 6 hours after the shooting, so the guy they rushed to the ambulance can't have been dead, or died.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        "Bates said the airport was in lockdown for more than six hours. When he was eventually led out, Bates walked straight past where the security guard was lying dead on the ground."

       its a bit obnoxious to leave a dead body on the floor for six hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       after taking a few crime scene photos, its the decent thing to do to pick up and take the body away somewhere peaceful.

       to leave it on the floor for that long is theatre.

       It's not being reported as propaganda in New Zealand. It's a common sense comment coming from a woman who lives in a country where guns aren't readily purchasable and which hasn't seen a public shooting since 1997. I'm from Australia, a country that made most firearms incredibly difficult to purchase after a mass shooting in 1996. Since then we've had no mass shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of pro-gun advocates in Australia said at the time that it was part of a government plan to subdue the population and roll out draconian laws. None of those things came to pass. Australia is still a free democracy, and a country where you can go to an airport, movie theatre, school, playground, etc., and not have the slightest fear that someone may pull out an assault rifle and shoot you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a huge shame that so many people in the U.S. feel that their government is trying to harm them and their liberties. The U.S. is supposed to have a government for the people, and by the people, and while I would agree that this might be less true than in the recent past (especially with Citizens vs. United and the freedom given to moneyed interests to lobby for their special interests), it really is sad that people think that the federal government would go so far as to kill it's own citizens or stage a shooting.

       No footage link tho. Doesnt matter because most people on here saw the overhead video hours after it happened including myself. In my opinion I think its highly suspicious to me that they trained for this exact scenarion three weeks before as the cheif admitted on television. I'm not going to be as dumb as most Americans and just believe whatever I see on TV. Whether it was a dummy or not is irrelevent. The fact is they did a drill on this attack prior to it. A SWAT team doesnt just drill for that kind of thing to happen like that. They always do this the same way, get you to focus on the smaller details so you dont see the big picture.

       I agree, the drill is very suspicious, and there are lots of suspicious things, but the "Dummy" seems like a distraction from more likely, and important evidence. I posted the link.

       It makes sense for them to train on that scenario. There was a reddit thread a few weeks ago which posited the exact same thing happening.

       And there's a lot of animosity towards tsa. They're iconic. They're the frontlines of what some see as an encroaching police state. An angry, crazy person is going to direct that energy towards them.

       This whole thing still smells fishy to me, but I just dunno about the dummy. I think he's just dead, which might also explain why the ambulance never rushed off. "Uh, he's dead guys."

       That is the exact same footage I have only seen.  If this is "newer" footage then I'm sure you will be able to link "older" footage.  Despite the fact that this is the only footage I have seen so any other footage would be "newer" to me.

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Minor (green) - Anyone who can walk and is responsive.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Delayed (yellow)  -  Anyone who is likely to survive if simple care is given within hours.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Immediate (red) - Victim may survive if lifesaving measures are implemented immediately.
