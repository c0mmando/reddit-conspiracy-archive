       Im going to be vague on what he does specifically,  only that he's a member of one of their DMATs- Disaster Medical Assistance Teams. He didn't get into the guts of of it but apparently some of the exercise briefings he's been privy to have included scenarios for mass armed uprisings FOLLOWING a regional emergency or operation. He didnt say much else other than hes frightened. The guy has been putting people back together over 15 years and ive never known him to be frightened of anything.

       I feel like there was a post very similar to this like a month ago with someone saying their FEMA uncle from VA or something basically said the same. Either there's some uneasiness within members of FEMA, or some people are full of shit. I wouldn't doubt either one.

       That's exactly what it is. Fear-mongering, for no other purpose other than to garner attention and up votes. We knew for a while our government has been running drills around the country at various times preparing for civil unrest.

       This is very easy to ignore, as we're the first two posts similar to this. Something will happen, eventually. But you're full of shit and looking for attention, or karma. Whichever it may be, it's pathetic.

       That is the thing with all these other posts though, they claim something horrible is going to happen and civil unrest will happen on "x" date. That date comes around and nothing happens. I'm all for being cautious, but i;m not going to take some small anonymous quote as fact. I've just seen it lead to bullshit too often on here. Show us more than something anonymous. Can you prove you have a family member that works for FEMA, it's possible without giving up their identity.

       Not if everyone stands up and realizes that the way to real and TRUE success isn't through massive rioting, but by channeling that civil unrest into a unified coordination amongst all citizens - one that entirely discards and does away with the monetary and governmental systems as they stand, and relies ultimately upon the cooperation of everyone helping each other to live and survive WITHOUT the manipulating, corporate slave masters that are currently in power.

       This would not be enough - not even close - to stop a citizenry united together as one against TPTB.  Anything less than this

       A revolution is going to happen.  Hell, it's
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       happening.  It's just in the process of gaining very slow momentum currently.  It's already happening though.  It's already on its way.  It's already here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's started with the people slowly (
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       slowly, unfortunately) waking up...bit by bit, one by one.  The more continue waking up, the more a sense of solidarity and togetherness will continue to develop.  The more a sense of solidarity and a feeling of togetherness continue to develop, the more likely it will be that the people will not be afraid to organize, coordinate, and eventually stand up and act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The revolution is already here.  The tidal wave has already started.  It's just that - like all tidal waves - you don't feel the peak crest of the wave immediately.  Initially the only thing you will feel will be a very slight swelling of the waters before you.  That slight swelling is an indication though...that the wave is coming.  Maybe it might not be super close.  Maybe that wave might be far away...but it's coming.  And often the further away that wave is, the longer it takes to reach its full crest, the more momentum it will have, and the more impact it will have when it finally
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       land.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rest assured.

       Beautifully written. Indeed it is happening. I need look no farther than myself.. 5 years ago I was CERTAIN that Bush/Cheney were just a bad anomaly, 9/11 was exactly how they said it was, and that Barack was going to show up and set the world toward progress.

       This is it right here.  The change is in
       <em>
        ourselves

       , and we are all feeling it on one level or another/to some extent or another.

      <p>
       Very well-said.  That power to create currency and hold it over the citizenry's head depends greatly upon the citizenry's inability to realize that they (that we) are all part of each other and that we can help one another overcome this manipulation if we but put our differences aside and come together as one.  I realize that we are perhaps nowhere near this understanding as a whole yet, but once it comes and everyone realizes that the true help is not inside our pocket books, but inside our very beings and our ability to help one another
       <em>
        independent

       money, we will begin to grow and prosper as a people on this planet.

       This is not pollyanna psycho-babble that I state here.  It is truth.  It may be truth that might seem far away still, but, as I said above, it's coming and it isn't
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       far away.

       The only armed uprising we would ever have is if they attempt to pass some major new federal firearm ban/confiscations on a national level. I think that we can all agree that even our political "representatives" are not dumb enough to plunge the country into the largest civil war that this planet has ever seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statists would never manage to get our firearms without losing their entire system in the process. And keeping the wheels of the system turning is priority number one.

       "WASHINGTON — The electric grid, as government and private experts describe it, is the glass jaw of American industry. If an adversary lands a knockout blow, they fear, it could black out vast areas of the continent for weeks; interrupt supplies of water, gasoline, diesel fuel and fresh food; shut down communications; and create disruptions of a scale that was only hinted at by Hurricane Sandy and the attacks of Sept. 11.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why thousands of utility workers, business executives, National Guard officers, F.B.I. antiterrorism experts and officials from government agencies in the United States, Canada and Mexico are preparing for an emergency drill in November that will simulate physical attacks and cyberattacks that could take down large sections of the power grid."

       Police states are by their very nature paranoid and psychopathic.   The next Katrina is only a matter of time.   And the dictatorship is having an image problem.   People might not follow orders.   So they are notching up the iron fist,  the use of force.   Which mean that lack of cooperation with them means you will be the enemy.   People will go along with it.   Until they don't.   That until is still a long way off,  if you count the majority of Americans that are still going about their business,  like 75% of the population,  day in,  day out.

       Interpret that however you want but that should be a sign that yes there will be civil unrest.  Its all too easy, zoom out your scope on the news and look at it at a historical point of view.  Great empires have a tendency at falling apart.

       I'm going to canada if this happens. Too many theists over here that will want to create a theocracy if they win. Nothing worth fighting for here, we all know this government is corrupt and useless. Once in canada, I can fly to italy with my italian (by blood) wife and become a citizen instantly (according to Italian law, if we understand it correctly).

       Yes, Italy is corrupt, but it is safer than what was America during a 2nd revolution/civil war. My mane point is simply that I am not going to stick around a die for something that is not worth dying/fighting for. Besides, 
once you become a citizen of an EU state, you have a right to live anywhere in thd EU - so we could easily immigrate to a state with good government, such as Sweden.

       In my opinion, the EU is worse than the US. Id recommend some research on it. The EU is successful as a form of tyranny where the UN is not. Consistently and increasingly, the EU has been stripping the sovereign rights of its members. Theyre farther down the river than we are. But we still dont have the paddles, so its not like we are in a much better state. Just wait for the North American Union and you will see what i mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, america is still the place to be. Id rather fight for freedom here, where there are still millions who understand and value liberty, than to be subject to the state in the EU, where theyve already willingly given up their liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, we are headed down the same path, but we have numbers of likeminded people on our side. The war against tyranny will be won on our land, once again.

       I actually have a lot of family and friends over there (im actually a german citizen), and my opinion is obviously biased with their views and my observations. I didnt mean to offend you or anyone, but this is my opinion. My point was that there are more people per capita in america that will stand for freedom than there are in the EU (again, from my personal experiences and observations, coming from the many conversations on this very topic with residents of the EU). Seeing how member states in the EU are more involved with the centralization of power and authority, that is, the EU drafts legislation and asserts said legislation upon its member states, whether or not they want it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I admit, america is headed down the same path. But like i said, resistance to this kind of centralization of power is greater here than there. Therefore, i choose to believe that america is a better stage in the fight for freedom.
