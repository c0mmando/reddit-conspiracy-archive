       yeah its getting ridiculous, the amount of  straight up censoring is bizarre. I've been posting a lot the last couple of days and its pretty obvious that the mods of
       <a href="/r/politics">

       and
       <a href="/r/worldnews">

       Mods should not have the power to delete comments without leaving a deleted tag.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is dangerous for the platform and I hope the reddit admins take notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1owncx/weekly_rpolitics_round_up_thread/ccwjud6">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1owncx/weekly_rpolitics_round_up_thread/ccwjud6
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That string renders to me as
       <a href="http://i2.minus.com/iWODN9R0Nkx2Z.png">
        this
       </a>
       when logged in and
       <a href="http://i2.minus.com/i0ZlGrGyFAQ8D.png">
        this
       </a>
       when logged out.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, I can still post in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       which means mods can use this power on indvidual comments. What the fuck?

       Expecting the admins to do something about the censorship on reddit is not rational.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is part of the corporate media and you should expect the same kind of censorship you get elsewhere in the corporate media.

       I believe there are some conspiracies in this world that people need to be made aware of. With this basic goal in mind I found a lot of comments and replies in this thread
       <strong>
        disgusting
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the replies and comments were very biased and spiteful. This is not good for out community.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to be more civil than that if people are going to respect and understand us. If we want this subreddit to grow and therefore help people become more aware of what concerns us in this subreddit, then let's try to be professional and unbiased.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know the whole quarrel of this thread but that isn't what this is about.
      </p>
      <p>
       We even have our own rules similar to other subreddits. Let's take
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No abusive/threatening language
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       for example. Do you see how this has been broken in this thread? Let's be civil guys.

       Question: I mod a few private subs, and there's no option to "shadow ban" anyone? I can outright ban, but I think if a shadow ban exists it exists for site-Admin, not for sub-mods.

       I don't think Mods can shadowban people, all they can do is either:
      </p>
      <p>
       1: ban individual from participating (ban user).
      </p>
      <p>
       2: Use Automoderator to immediately delete posts made by the individual, or automatically mark them as 'Spam'.

       Sorry, that is impossible, reddit admin and reddit main subs are at this point fully compromised. How long have you been a reddit user? The changes from the last 2 years have been absurd (at the same rate of growth of the website). Now it has become a corporate/government tool for propaganda (the main subs). Civil unrest organized via the most common social media will soon be history. Reddit has gone to the toilet, Facebook might
       <a href="http://privacysos.org/node/1217">
        block people from posting about protests
       </a>
       , now one only needs to remove the power of twitter and all our social media will become tools for the powerful in this brave new world.

        I removed the top comment because it was inspiring the witch hunt, as evidenced by the comments that came afterward. The fact that it had such a high rating is further evidence of the witch hunt. I have heard of no self-hating mob. You are correct that, taken at face value, the comment might not inspire a witch hunt.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, given the context of that post (notably: being within a post about the NSA), it was overwhelmingly likely to inspire witch-hunting. This is not the appropriate subreddit to rally people against other users of reddit. You will not hunt anyone through this subreddit.
       </p>
       <p>
        You'll notice that the parent comment to this post has not been removed. That is because it is not a witch hunt. Instead, your post to
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        is an attempted witch hunt, especially because you're wrong.
       </p>
       <p>
        If I banned you for your behavior, you'd know. You'd get a message from reddit saying that you'd been banned. I do not toy around when it comes to abuse. You will not abuse in this subreddit.

       Notice how he continues with his sanctimonious fucking attitude accusing me of "abusing" in
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       holy subreddit even though he has admitted that my post was in no way abusive and was removed because of his opinion regarding how it was making other people act.  Jesus.  This piece of shit mod is a prime example of what is killing this whole site.  Report him to the admins.

       The definition of tough guy has to shift thats what i'm saying. Big brutes don't win wars (the typical tough guy), computers, networking, communication lines, food + water supply lines, radiation shielding, water tablets, guns, and properganderists/ hypnotists win wars. ect

       It doesn't mean you should wish death on people. It's not like the guy ran off with your only source of food.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that if you didn't want your comment deleted or account banned or whatever you probably shouldn't be wishing death on people. So that's why not.

       It dosn't mean you shouldn't either. Who are you to judge from a moral high point? 
This mod has clearly been lying/ and scheming to the reddit populace. He's participating in cencorship and downright manipulation of the public hive mind for the benifit of a very few. A crime dosn't necacarily deserve punishment but a punishment would certainly send a big Message.
      </p>

       Too many people are apathetic these days. Violence has become a filthy word in the public lexicon.

       It is not clear the mod has been lying, if anything it is unclear that the OP has been with holding information. Wishing death upon people is grounds for getting your comments removed in almost any subreddit which is why I asked if the OP really wished death on people.

       Mass cencorship is happening wheather we like to admit it or not (in you're case?)..
 Yes i know it's against sub reddit law and he hasn't been kicked. The perception I get from you're tone is one of scorn that someone would wish death on someone. There are tens of thousands who would pull the trigger if under pressure and you're an idiot for believing otherwise.

       Again if the OP didn't want some of his comments removed he shouldn't have wished death on people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could careless if he actually did otherwise.

       This is my perception nothing else. This is NOT difficult to understand.

       If he hadn't tainted his message with pointless wishes of death then I could see the mod not justifying his actions. Which again is why I asked if OP really did or did not wish death on people.

       him if he "wished death upon people".

       people of what is going on. It gives the moderator grounds to

       Please stop twisting the story. I'm not sure where I outright said that he got "banned for wishing death on the mod". Get your story straight please. I'm done talking with you, you show no coherency and you keep wanting to talk about why it's okay to have violence rather than why the dude got banned/had comment removed/whatever it is.

       Stop lying Buckeye, you're not fooling anyone on here.
I wonder why you think you're behaviour is exceptable,
Abused childhood cycle? Maybe you've always been a sell out to the highest bidder no matter their motivations.

       what? lol I have been responding to your messages.  Do you think I'm not a person?  Do you think I respond to everything within two minutes after a post is written?

       Please.  I am a person.  I need more than two minutes to notice that a post exists.  Especially because I'm playing Path of Exile when not responding to you.

       Here's the reply he sent to my account in which he states that my comment was removed not because it was abusive or violated any rules, which he admits it did not, but because in his opinion, my comment was inspiring others to behave badly.  Fuck this stupid piece of shit mod.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That was not the comment that was auto-removed by the moderator. This comment was the one that was autoremoved.
       </p>
       <p>
        I removed the top comment because it was inspiring the witch hunt, as evidenced by the comments that came afterward. The fact that it had such a high rating is further evidence of the witch hunt. I have heard of no self-hating mob. You are correct that, taken at face value, the comment might not inspire a witch hunt.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, given the context of that post (notably: being within a post about the NSA), it was overwhelmingly likely to inspire witch-hunting. This is not the appropriate subreddit to rally people against other users of reddit. You will not hunt anyone through this subreddit.
       </p>
       <p>
        You'll notice that the parent comment to this post has not been removed. That is because it is not a witch hunt. Instead, your post to
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        is an attempted witch hunt, especially because you're wrong.
       </p>
       <p>
        If I banned you for your behavior, you'd know. You'd get a message from reddit saying that you'd been banned. I do not toy around when it comes to abuse. You will not abuse in this subreddit.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Notice how he continues with his sanctimonious fucking attitude accusing me of "abusing" in
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       holy subreddit even though he has admitted that my post was in no way abusive and was removed because of his opinion regarding how it was making other people act.  Jesus.  This piece of shit mod is a prime example of what is killing this whole site.  Report him to the admins.

       I don't think Mods can shadowban people, all they can do is either:
      </p>
      <p>
       1: ban individual from participating (ban user).
      </p>
      <p>
       2: Use Automoderator to immediately delete posts made by the individual, or automatically mark them as 'Spam'.

       Whatever dude, you also replied to my comment with a slightly different angle.
You've just shown you believe what the r/politics mod is saying ie you're already biased :p. I say OP was banned for headline.
