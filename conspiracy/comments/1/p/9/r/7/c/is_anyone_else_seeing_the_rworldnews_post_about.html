       That post has been given flair by the mods so folks can see why it was taken down. Clearly, this post violates the editorialized title rule. What folks have to understand is that reading the sidebar of a subreddit and following the rules that are listed will prevent you from having your post removed once it has been reported by a user or spotted independently by a moderator. I have hear people say, "yeah but if a post got a lot of upvotes it should stay" but that sort of makes the mods look like they are playing favorite and I think consistency is the only real way to prevent that. We all want to make sure the mods don't play favorites right? So if a post breaks the rules, it's got to go.

       Generally, if the title is created by the user it is automatically considered an editorialized. I don't know for sure, I don't mod over there. That's how we operated in r/politics until we wised up and just said "no user created titles" so that we could avoid the somewhat fair criticism you levy on the WorldNews mods.

       As you know, those automatically generated titles are editorialized, too.  Let's look at CNN.  "NSA snooping:  it's complicated," and "Obamacare numbers: not what it seems" are obviously editorial.  Political and/or corporate infomercials.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as you know, these kinds of rules are really just saying, "We only accept bias from the political/corporate media."

       A commitment to freedom of speech and a recognition of the unintended consequences of enforcing a rule with no due regard to its impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as someone else has said on this sub, editorialising is already done by news organisations. A rule that permits their editorialisations but  no one else's will have unintended consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you asked why people editorialise? Maybe they are bias but maybe it is a controversial story that has emotions running high.  Maybe they need greater leeway? Do you allow free speech in such circumstances or clamp down? And what is the opportunity cost of removing their submission? What is lost from the aubreddit in-terms of debate and discussion? Also, what is lost from the wider community (and the sub-Reddit) when some stories are seen to be deleted more than others?  People notice.

       The sign of a badly written/applied rule is one that had numerous unintended consequences. "I was only following orders"   Is not good enough .

       Finally., I would hope that just disagreeing with the post is insufficient enough reason to have it deleted. However, a lot of people feel this is happening on both
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/worldnews">

       I don't want you to jump to any conclusions. I'm sorry if there were any misunderstandings. I'm not a mod there, and I don't think the rule, as written, is very good either.

       Generally, if the title is created by the user it is automatically considered an editorialized. I don't know for sure, I don't mod over there. That's how we operated in r/politics until we wised up and just said "no user created titles" so that we could avoid the somewhat fair criticism you levy on the WorldNews mods.
