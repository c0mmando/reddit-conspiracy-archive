       Am I the only one that notices that Russell Brand's "revolution" response has been edited out? It used to be in the videos but now it's gone from at least 15 that I've looked at.
      </p>
      <p>
       "You don't believe in democracy. You want a revolution, don't you?" @3:16 here:

      <p>
       It's claimed it's the "full interview" but Brand's response used to be, "I do want a revolution!" or something like that.

       The sad part is that people don't realize the world will never function properly based on the ideals of only one economic theory, Brand is calling for the redistribution of wealth (socialism) because the money being filtered to only a small percentage of Americans is money that has been acquired illegally. He's obviously not promoting a regime of socialism, he's promoting one aspect of socialism which can help fix the current state of affairs.

       He's advocating change, balance, a move from greed and towards equality.  He says may times he doesn't know how to do it, but in any event he did use the word socialist.  I also agree he is playing right into the hands of his handlers, but his intentions are genuine.

       Aye, I see nothing fundamentally incompatible with say the Texas Nationalist Movement (texnat.org) and what Brand seems to be championing.  We both want to be out from under the yolk of a system that no longer cares about us and is actively working against us.  If a group of people want to set up a marxist system that specifically works for the people, I see nothing wrong with that.  And in a world where breakaway nations become more common, I hope that the New Republic of Texas and Marx-Brandia can be allies and have good intentions and even a trade system between us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marxists aren't enemies, nationalists aren't enemies, the real enemies are the hyper-bureaucratic governments that no longer serve the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vermont for example has many left wing secessionist movements that are on very friendly terms with right wing anarchocapitalist movements, proving a person can be civil to another person in this day and age but there is a constant push to view political preferences as sporting teams to root for and hate all who are different.  That's all rubbish, and the more people understand that, the more united we'll ever be.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I really think there's nothing wrong with Marxism or socialism, it's just not my cup of tea.  The problem is when other people tell me how I'm supposed to live through the tyranny of a mob majority or heaven forbid, I tell other people how they should live.

       I get the connection, but there were many, many other factors that contributed the rise of Nazi Germany, most notably the debt payments placed on them after WW1.  Hitler was voted in democratically, but would you attack democracy in the light as you (probably jokingly) did nationalism and socialism?  There's nothing wrong either the political aspects, just preference.  I think socialism and democracy doesn't work very well, so I'm of the "leave me alone" nationalist persuasion.  An asshole dictator will take control no matter the underlying political system that proceeded him, as we see practically everywhere on earth today to varying degrees.

       Yeah, you are right, we all see each other as adversaries; there is little sense of national unification anymore. I think Capitalism is partially to blame, a system which makes us competitors can also make us seem to be adversaries to one another.

       I can definitely see the logic in that, however I would argue that the US (or anywhere else on Earth) hasn't had actual capitalism in quite some time.  If you have heavy regulation and control via selectively vicious taxation, then you really have instead of a free market a market that exists at the whims of a centrally controlled committee.  This in and of itself isn't necessarily a broken way of doing things, it's even very popular through Europe.  However the current implementation in the US is half assed as no law passes our government without becoming completely middle of the road, an epic compromise which accomplishes neither the goals of right wing or left wing politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, that's what I would offer to be the main blame.  I hate that a crazy right wing nut popularized the notion and thus "poisoning the well" so to speak, but the US really is a self-fulfilling mediocracy machine.  A completely faulty market system in place that creates and sustains 5% ultra wealthy citizens with an increasingly poorer and poorer middle and lower class is a symptom I would think.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I would see as a legitimate solution (in the US at least) would be to dismantle the federal government and restore control back to the states.  This would let independent states realign themselves in more receptive and functional federal systems that wouldn't be engineered to be at each other's throats constantly like we see now.  The Republic of Texas would be a bastion of libertarians with slight inclinations towards nationalism (like the historical Republic of Texas from days past) concerning issues like military protection and trade protection.  States like California could band together with other more left wing states and cut out Alabama's dependence on California welfare and have a California centric federal government of their own.  In the end I think everyone could win.  Left wing citizens would enjoy their left wing lifestyle while no one would mess with Texas.  Instead of sending a big chunk of money to the current US federal government and then begging for it back in order not to go bankrupt, the states could invest in themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Socialist State of California and a Republic of Texas would be a force to be reckoned with when replacing the US government and here's why I think this:  The only thing that would ever bring Cal and Texas together would be trade agreements.  As someone born in Texas, I've never cared about the left wing life of someone in California and I expect the feeling is mutual.  If instead of me and my socialist doppleganger in California being conditioned to hate each other's guts, what if I enjoyed great California technology while California enjoyed some good ole Texas beef?  It would be a less combative world.  And if any other country decided to attack what they thought would be a weaker former-US region, I'm positive the allied forces of Texas, California, The Plainslands, the United Gulf Regions etc would be just as effective as the US government.  Why?  Because none of us would be deployed overseas doing God knows what.
      </p>
      <p>
       With your feelings on capitalism I'm guessing that you're of a left leaning persuasion (and more power to you), but I would highly encourage you to check out a free ebook from the Texas Nationalist website (
       <a href="http://texnat.org/index.php/intro-to-texas-independence/read-the-book">
        http://texnat.org/index.php/intro-to-texas-independence/read-the-book
       </a>
       ).  I think socialists and other left wing leaners would find it interesting because of a chapter discussing the public shaming of words describing parties and affiliations in the past that are (I would say purposefully) misunderstood today.  No one felt this effect more than socialists, though the book itself speaks largely on the word 'nationalists' and dispels any negativity incorrectly associated with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dream on with this and I really hope the US dissolves and reforms stronger in the ways I mentioned previously.  But there's fierce opposition to many that derive their fortune from a centrally controlled US federal government and they sadly are in charge of our armies, state guards and other people with lots of guns and bullets with "screw you civilian" written on them.

       Good to see someone after my own heart! It's a big planet and diversity of forms of government can only strengthen our species. We can differ on what we want to try first and still agree that we need to  try something. It doesn't matter if my neighbor's ideals are incompatible with mine, as long as people are free to choose for themselves.

       He did use the word 'socialist.'
      </p>
      <p>
       When asked what Brand thinks a revolution should be, he responded, "A socialistic egalitarian system based on a massive redistribution of wealth, heavy taxation of corporations, and massive responsibility for energy companies and others exploiting the environment."
      </p>
      <p>
       He is calling for more centralization, if anything. The only thing that I agree with you on is that his intentions are genuine.

       In your heart. Brand's revolution seems to have two major parts - one in consciousness, one in politics, and the latter seems less important and less attainable.
      </p>
      <p>
       So treat people well, and see people with compassion, not as problems. Show others the benefit of seeing the world this way, and you'll already be fighting revolution 1.

       I don't want to seem discriminatory, but I'm starting to feel that most of the posters on this sub have a very sensationalist americana style view of everything. It's not either one extreme or the other like in Hollywood movies. I personally find Brand's ranting a bit incoherent and grandiose, although largely agreeable. You guys are really turning it into revolution? He uses the world revolution to mean social reform. You seem to take it to mean "Let's change the entire world tomorrow". My advice is to read some history books, you know, unless some of you guys think the history books were written by Jews or the Illuminati or some crap. Trust me, these ideologies have come and gone and there's nothing knew in Brand's rant. It's a form of neo-Marxism (and Marxism isn't a slur). I don't think his level of socialism is sane, but clearly closing the class discrepancy is a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Addition: While I am finding Russel Brand more respectable, celebrities are typically not the best place to go for politics. I'm only saying that because
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and conspiracy theorists in general attach far too much importance to pop media and celebrities. I take it that's because those types aren't very knowledgeable of very much beyond that.

       I think there's some real truth to what you're saying (though lately Brand has been quite grandiose, but also very coherent, if open-ended.) At the same time, things work on various levels. What people say on Reddit, or even what Brand says in interviews, isn't necessarily a direct line to their brains - a lot of it is rhetoric, meant to shape opinion and worldview in a certain way. I don't think the people will unite this year and flip their respective governments over to make room for a utopia - but at the same time, if they focus only on the oppressive nature of the present political and social power structure, and assume they have no recourse, then hope is dead, and in a way, so is humanity in all but a few outliers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brand has currently found his 15 minutes of fame, and in that window, he is standing on his soapbox, trying to influence contemporary thought with what he believes will make a positive difference. For what he's said so far, I'm finding I agree with him: Basically his message is one of compassion, cooperation and stewardship. Almost all of us knew already that these things are positive and improve things for ourselves and others - but there seems to be a certain societal structure that strips that away, tells us "greed is good" and that we should all just get what we can and once we have enough, keep getting more as long as the getting's good. If someone doesn't have enough and they're trying to get some of yours, to hell with them, and so on. I don't expect a seismic shift in overall human thought or anything, but if this "revolution" can even instill the thought in some 3-5% of the English world that it's ok and even cool to be kinder to one another, to work together for a greater good, and to think outside the box about problems we thought were too big to tackle, then I still think that would be very positive, and possibly quite profound indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You never know who the next great person of our time could be - be they an engineer, politician, activist, etc - but if they just keep their heads down and punch the clock at their jobs instead of trying to solve the real problems, then we'll never know, and neither will they.

Then check into googles brain implant microchips. Then sign up for any forced advertisements and privacy invasion technologies you can think of.

       Oh I like him a lot, I'm really excited he's gonna be on JRE, but there's no denying what he openly says. He might not say he's a Marxist but he sure talks and walks like one.  Labeling is only denigrating when you don't own your beliefs.

       literally hundreds of millions of Americans and Russians would disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       from wiki:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Metallica has become one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time, and is credited as one of the "big four" of thrash metal, along with Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth.[149] The band has sold more than 110 million records worldwide, including a RIAA-certified 66 million and Nielsen SoundScan-reported 53,642,000 in the United States, making them the best-selling act in thrash metal genre of all time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Greg Prato of Allmusic said Metallica "expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions", calling the band "easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the '80s, responsible for bringing the music back to Earth."
       </p>
       <p>
        Jonathan Davis of Korn respects Metallica as his favorite band and comments, "I love that they've done things their own way and they've persevered over the years and they're still relevant to this day. I think they're one of the greatest bands ever."
       </p>
       <p>
        Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said Metallica has been the biggest influence on the band stating, "they really changed my life when I was 16 years old—I'd never heard anything that heavy"
       </p>
       <p>
        Vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn of Machine Head said that when creating the band's 2007 album, The Blackening, "What we mean is an album that has the power, influence and epic grandeur of that album Master of Puppets—and the staying power—a timeless record like that".
       </p>
       <p>
        M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold stated touring with Metallica was the band's career highlight, and said, "Selling tons of records and playing huge shows will never compare to meeting your idols Metallica."
       </p>
       <p>
        Metallica was ranked by MTV as the third "Greatest Heavy Metal Band in History",[156] was listed fifth on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock,[168] and was number one on VH1's 20 Greatest Metal Bands list.[169] Master of Puppets was ranked number 167 on Rolling Stone's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and Metallica was number 252.[170] Master of Puppets was named in Q Magazine's "50 Heaviest Albums of All Time",[171] ranked number one on IGN's "Top 25 Metal Albums",[172] and number one on the Metal-rules.com's "Top 100 Heavy Metal Albums" list.[173] The song "Enter Sandman" was ranked number 399 on Rolling Stone's "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".
       </p>
       <p>
        On March 7, 1999, Metallica was inducted into the San Francisco Walk of Fame. The mayor of San Francisco, Willie Brown, proclaimed the day "Official Metallica Day"
       </p>
       <p>
        Metallica was awarded the MTV Icon award in 2003, and a concert was held paying tribute to the band with artists performing Metallica songs. Performances included Sum 41 with a medley of "For Whom the Bell Tolls", "Enter Sandman", and "Master of Puppets". Staind covered "Nothing Else Matters", Avril Lavigne played "Fuel", hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg performed
        <strong>
         "Sad but True"
        </strong>
        (the one i quoted), Korn played "One", and Limp Bizkit performed a rendition of "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)".

       thats actually the definition of being successful in the entertainment biz. see; your arrogance blinds you from seeing the reality. people decide what's good, society decides what's good. it's not up to you at all. being one of the best bands by MTV, Rolling Stone, and Q mag standards makes you fucking good. getting a day named after you in one of America's biggest cities makes you fucking good.  and if that doesnt then nothing does. who do you like, Journey? now hear me out, i hate Justin Bieber, but millions of people like him, he must be good to them right? which means objectively he's good, but not my taste. see how that works? not my taste, but still talented.. ya know? are you getting it yet? stop being a petulant child about this.
       <em>
        wah, my music taste is way better than yourzzz, listen to what i like.
       </em>
       shut the fuck up dude. be an adult, we all like different things, there is no score on "being good".  it's all about connecting to your fans you dimwit.

       no, its not. again, you dont get to make that choice lol. thats what your thick head aint getting bud. society exists, other people exist, and when you get to the top of the lists, you get to claim you're talented. thats the definition of being the best at something. being at the top, getting the most fans. and for people like you who dont like them? fuck you, theyre doing
       <em>
        just fine

       False.  Maybe 1% of Socialists would argue that now.  Marx probably wouldn't even argue that now.  His prediction of what would happen was a small part of his writings whereas he mostly focused on a critique of capitalism.

       Bolshevik socialism/communism was a bastardization.

       Capitalisism and socialism both use centralized government to a certain extent.  "Free market" capitalism is a myth.

       Yeah, and when did he die?  How many Socialists today agree with Lenin's version of Socialism?  He's a
       <em>
        Bolshevik Socialist
       </em>
       which was always a bastardized version of socialism.  Heck, Lenin and the Bolsheviks were funded by Wall St. Jewish bankers.

       There were a lot of sincere regular people that sought change and revolution based on Socialist ideology.  And there are a lot of good ideas that are "Socialistic" (like socialized heath care, education, and pensions, etc.--and nationalization of certain industries--like oil, water distribution, utilities).
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think Socialism has been co-opted.   And it's not very useful to divide everything into Socialism or Capitalism anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm not sure Marx was funded by the elite or working for them, Jewish or otherwise--even though I see this alleged a lot.  His criticism of capitalism is very good, imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       But who knows.  I need more facts about it.

       Yes.  We can create a peaceful Democratic one world government whose power comes up from We the People of the World from the bottom up, instead of a one world government whose power comes from the elites from the top down.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is what we must strive for, and the source of the power makes all the difference.  It is clear which world Brand is striving for.  Don't let your fear of Socialist Authoritarians blind you to what he is truly advocating.

       I think you may have missed the rhetoric, and/or the rhetorical nature of the question. Also, warning people of Socialist Authorities and reigning oligarchy's that you claim "we all stand against" while speaking to people as if you are the only one well informed of these facts is funny to me. (not intended to be disrespectful or create an argument)  Lastly, as you speak from one standpoint, and still advocate a good type of "one world government" makes you a living breathing oxymoron, or if you're a bot, an oxymoron bot.

       Y'know... we need a word for a form of society where people are actually concerned with the general wellbeing of everything around them. Can't use the words social or community in the title because we've been scared off by such language already. There has to be some sort of "hierarchical entity" based on merit and actions, logically, but this small body of people shouldn't be able to fuck everything up for everyone else... I think is what he's saying...

       You're thinking of meritocracy and (although you said to avoid this term) socialism. I think the two ideas in tandem would work really well. I guess the best example would be European countries like Luxembourg, Norway, France. Of course there are already issues arising with it, but I think these kind of issues are just unavoidable.

       I was thinking about a meritocracy, spot on, and a form of socialism that didn't fall into the normal traps of those on top being ultra powerful, like communism is usually played. Which isn't a bad thing if they're uncorrupt and caring folk but even then I would think it should be more of a duty than a desired position to grab and abuse power from. Absolute power corrupts absolutely so there would have to be someone watching the watchers watching the watchers sort of situation. Probably there would have be complete and unfiltered transparency but then you'd still have to deal with other countries not playing by those rules and using such information for their own personal gain. And then you end up at a singular world power so as to avoid such instances. But as for those essentially running the world, they would have to be propped up by the populace instead of running things in the current "out for myself" fashion that we've become so accustomed to them doing. But how would that be possible? Make it an impermanent job that only meets up when necessary to do something? It would essentially have to be a non-government and more of a... blank. What fills in the blank? The best and brightest just have meetings every now and then?

       To the point of the video being edited, yes it does appear that they took out his answer agreeing that he does want a revolution, but that could have been his publicist or agent or lawyer who asked for that to happen so that if anything illegal happens and the perpetrators use Brand's name as a reason he won't get in trouble.

       Not necessarily but with how litigious our society is these days you'd find plenty of lawyers willing to say that Russell Brand saying that was "a call to action" and the easily influenced dumb public did what they were told.  It's not at all a strong case but it's a case any publicist would rather not have to deal with.

       Explain?  This sort of thing happens all the time.  When Gabby Giffords was shot immediately the media pointed fingers at Sarah Palin for using Cross Hairs in one of her online sites and having them aimed at Giffords' district.  There was an outcry that this could have been a reason for the shooting or at least part of the reason.  It certainly wasn't, but that didn't stop the speculation.  It is a publicist's job to insulate their client from this sort of thing.  It would make perfect sense for someone working for Brand to look at him saying "I want a revolution" and say "hmmm that might not go over too well if somebody does something stupid after seeing this."  This is what publicists are paid to do.

       Here are several explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
       One doesn't start a revolution by stating "I think there should be a revolution."
      </p>
      <p>
       If a revolution occurred moments after Brand's statement, no rational person could say "Brand started the revolution."

      <p>
       If there were a revolution, we'd all have more pressing matters than Russel Brands previous statements.

       Your conjecture, therefore, seems ridiculous or apologist. Not trying to be insulting, but I'm on pain meds at the moment, and am unable to be very eloquent. You deserve better.

       I get what you are saying but we live in a time where when you buy a package of pepperoni the little packet that keeps it fresh has a tag saying "do not eat this" on it.  McDonald's got sued because a woman burned herself with hot coffee and didn't realize the coffee would be that hot and so she won the suit. In the legal world things don't need to make sense. Certainly Brand wouldn't be responsible for any "revolution" but publicists, lawyers, and agents are super protective of their clients because of how irrational the legal system is.

       She had third degree burns?  Of course she did... HOT coffee is supposed to be hot so when you spill it on yourself you should expect to be burned.  That shouldn't be the person who served you the coffee's responsibility to remind you that hot coffee is hot.  I'm not an apologist.  Apologist on what behalf?  Most of my posts are supporting Brand.  I just don't see how taking out him saying "Yeah I want a revolution" would be done by anyone but his people (or at least at the request/complicity of his people).  Just because those exact words are deleted doesn't change the message of what he is saying.  Am I to believe that the public is so stupid that if they don't directly hear Brand say the word "revolution" they will miss the entire point of everything he is saying?

       Well water is pretty much brought to a boil in order to brew coffee.  Before that lawsuit coffee was routinely served around 170 degrees F and nobody ever complained.  Maybe the real issue should have been that she shouldn't have been driving while drinking coffee.  Why is the responsibility not placed on consumer in this instance and that's acceptable to you.  If you can accept that McDonalds is held responsible for some lady fumbling her coffee onto herself while driving you should be able to accept that Russell Brand (or anybody) could be held responsible (not necessarily legally but in the court of public opinion much the way Sarah Palin was when Loughner shot Gabbie Giffords) for actions taken by a random person after something he says/does.  It isn't outside of possible as this sort of thing has literally happened before.  And also the idea of an actual revolution is irrelevant.  Somebody could just throw a brick thru a storefront window and say he is "starting a revolution" and that'd be enough.  Then the news can say that he posted shit on his facebook and reddit about Russell Brand's most recent interview on the BBC about how he wanted a revolution and suddenly Russell Brand is connected to some idiot's crime.  This is exactly what happened to Sarah Palin.

       Give me a break.  This is ridiculous.  No lawyer or publicist is going to be worried about legal liability.  That's just silly.

       If anything being "censored" was part of the PR campaign.

       It's very similar to the idea that no publicity is bad publicity.  Or how stars "accidentally" have sex tapes get released or embarrassing moments released.

       Controversy sells.  I smell a contrived controversy in this instance.

       Close.  They took it out to

       so that people like us would be discussing it.

       Not to sure about brand in this interview,  I usually enjoy listening to his interviews,  but this time he seemed to struggle and repeat himself with his responses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any person can notice deficiencies in the world and in government,  but it takes bravery and intelligence to try and fix those deficiencies. Brand is merely pointing out that the world's state is poorer than we can make it,  which is 100% true. But for a real revolution (change) to happen we need some sort of catalyst,  not some man pointing out the facts,  as you will.

       The problem isn't the government, it's the people filling those seats.  The founders created a beautiful framework of seats to fill, we've just filled them with corrupt egomaniacal middle men for the the oligarchy.

       If we clean house and make sure that social programs are structured smartly so that we're merely using them for our collective healthcare and pension needs, and not to create a dependent class then the egalitarian socialist democracy that Brand talks about can work.

       The thing that you aren't taking into account is that people are still being extorted by the state to pay for 'smartly structured' social programs.  The problem is most definitely the government; it is inherently immoral.  You want to live in a Scandinavia clone, be my guest and I hope it makes you happy.

       I don't know what immoral actions you are referring to, and it's besides my point. If you hold the idea government is inherently immoral, it's absurd to subject yourself to one and then complain about it online.
      </p>
      <p>
       This country was always the imperial warmongering for-profit enterprise it is now, so I don't know what you think will change. And if you wonder why you can't maintain the 'quality of life' you are looking for outside of a state, or at least the USA, maybe that's because those places don't have 'exorting social schemes'.

       Did you even read my response? It's not that I don't know that there are immoral actions, it's that they are besides my point. And with the taxes stuff too. And yet you complain about the quality of life outside the system. You don't understand your own contradiciton.

       I think a point Russel is making is that eventually you are going to be forced off your ass and will be demanding something different whether you think you will or not. The economic system of the U.S will not go on forever that's just simple math. The longer we kick the can/act as if everything is ok, the more we are fucking over the future and in reality our own short term future as amazing things could be done around the world in a single generation.

       No. The problem is society, not the politicians. The people in this country are greedy, cowardly, full of lies, and lacking in nobility and respect. The government merely reflects that filth.

       No the problem arises from greed and need.  Banks can buy out anyone, especially in an economic time when the majority of Americans are struggling to make ends meet.  Most people are willing to take the easy "bribe" way out, then to have to continue struggling in an economy that forces both spouses to work for next to nothing.  Why should two parents be forced to work just to bring in the minimum needs?  Why do people who have jobs still need welfare?  It isn't the people, it is the forced slavery of our economic system created by the filthy rich to control everyone in the world.  Also politics are becoming a thing of royalty.  If you are not born into it, then your not aloud in.  The Bushes, the Clintons, the Kennedy's, and it just goes on and on.  Most politicians are born into money, very few come from respectable back grounds.

       The problem isn't that more government is bad, the problem is that the government no longer represent the people. Remember its supposed to be a
       <strong>
        government for the people by the people
       </strong>
       . Instead what we have is a government by the super wealthy for the super wealthy. Almost all our congressmen are bought and paid for and there are few that didn't come from wealth to begin with.

The credit and currency of the United States is controlled by a clique of private banks, from whom Congress must borrow funds to meet the needs of the budget. These powers must be seized and nationalized, and the Treasury restored from the pathetic tradition of Federal borrowing for bailouts and war to the proud tradition of Federal lending for production.

       The 1% Wall St Sales Tax is much more effective and beneficial for American families. If you want to tackle Wall St or the Oligarchical structure, this hits them hard. The annual Wall St. turnover is in the quadrillions, the money would goto free health care, education, federal infrastructure, heavy industry (jobs), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, you will see more monetary benefit for the average working class person, if you do a 1% Wall St Sales Tax.

       Look man, I know you think this is the best thing, but it is clear you have a lot more to learn. Please read into some other ideas so that you have atleast an opposing view.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world economic output is about 60 trillion. 1% of 1Quad is 10 trillion. Money doesn't just magically appear and is worth something. These people are immune to taxation anyways, the taxes that exist somehow don't cover them- more of them wont either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the taxation in the US already brings in over 10,000 per person. If that isn't enough for all of the welfare in the world, I don't know what will.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people in the middle class no longer had 25% of their money seized they would be a lot better off than if a rich person got taxed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The money that comes from taxes isn't going to go towards what you think it should. It is going to go toward militarization, spying, and control.

       1 They are not immune to taxation if you implement and enforce a 1% Wall St turnover tax. You are approaching from a position of weakness. Laws can be passed.

       2 It doesn't matter what the world economic output is. They are indeed creating money magically. You don't understand what the derivative market is (clearly). They are placing bets, upon bets, upon bets. The derivative market has hundreds of layers of betting, based on the initial security.

         What is wrong with people making investments on futures? The only issue is that the FDIC is guaranteeing these things, and we are on the hook. If you want to eliminate fraudulant securities then look no further to than the 40+ billion a month the Federal Reserve is buying. If you want an actually decent economy you want people "betting" on investments and the insurance on those investments- those are market signals that any entrepreneur can use as a guideline for his investments and business plans in the future. This system is completely broken due to the monetary policy of lie, steal, inflate, and defraud.

       </li>
       <li>

         Why? Why is there trillions of dollars already and that doesn't work? Is it perhaps that the concept that a corrupt government will actually use that money for supposedly beneficial things isn't actually their goal? What good would another trillion do? Start another war? Or even if the US government had 10 trillion? They would just use it to put police in every house that inspected your asshole for bombs when you were trying to take a morning dump. An ever more powerful government is not the panacea.

       yes, basically every major economist would give you a number between 1 quadrillion and 6 quadrillion. its common knowledge. the exact number is hard to determine because of the nature of derivatives, but again, that is the general estimate.

       yes. its on the wall st turnover. you short a stock, 1%. place a bet on a derivative? 1%. buy or sell a stock? 1% etc..

       Let us say that I get paid 1000 dollars by my employer for a weeks work.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the employer removes the money from their account and sends it to the pay roll service so my pay is now .99 * 1000 = 990
      </p>
      <p>
       The payroll service then transfers it to my credit union so my pay is now .99 * 990 = 980.10
      </p>
      <p>
       Using a debit card I take out 500.00 which actually is only .99 * 500 = 495.
      </p>

       i think you are misunderstanding the concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       the 1% is a Wall Street Tax. It has nothing at all to do with your payroll, pay cheques, debit card uses, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, every time a business, corporation, individual (with a 1 million dollar personal exclusion), makes a stock trade on the market, they are charged 1%.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you sell 50 shares, 1% goes into the government coffers to pay for education, universal health care, infrastructure projects, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes if you short a block of shares, or buy derivatives, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are completely misunderstanding the concept. Check out againstausterity.org

       I can't take a person seriously that doesn't see the benefit of a truly public central bank that uses debt free fiat to fund the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nationalizing the banks is a much needed reform.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I agree that eliminating the income and payroll taxes for most people is good.

       Look at the rankings of the happiest nations in the world. They are topped by rich, Scandanavian welfare states with the highest levels of income equality, and free health care and education.
      </p>
      <p>
       However... that may require a rich country to pull off. When everyone's rich, everyone's happy. No one really wants the infamous brokenness of the Soviet Union, and that's the hard part. It's not that socialist systems can't work, but they're just tools and don't work for everything.

       I don't think he has super specific ideas, but, he knows what we are doing now is wrong. He is pointing out red flags of a system that is broken and taking the planet with it. You are making it out that he literally is asking for more government programs and that just isn't true.

       But we live in an industrialized and technologically advanced world.  Without some counterbalance, powerful forces would further consolidate their power and enslave us all (which has pretty much happened because they were able to control governments).
      </p>
      <p>
       So what counterbalance would you have, if not government, to stop these powerful forces from enslaving us?

       Free market laissez faire capitalism or even anarchism or libertarianism are code words for letting the international mafia enslave us.

       He blames the society that was created by the elites for his drug use and his dream for a socialist egalitarian society is just rubbish, we are not all equal so why should let's say a jam maker make as much as a Brain Surgeon.
He also doesn't seem to realize that he is probably in the top 2% of the population in terms of wealth, I wonder how he'd feel if his wealth was redistributed between everyone in England.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree with some points that he makes, like planning for the future, the huge disparity of wealth and how voting has become largely irrelevant/ineffective.

       Russell brand always has to demonstrate how much dictionary reading he's done in the last week... It doesn't add any strength to his arguments. He just manages to express pretty basic ideas with a broader lexicon than you'd expect from the people who share his ideas, and therefore more superficially convincing.

       At first I resented your point, because I like the use of a broader lexicon and in general think it leads to better understanding . . . but I agree that Brand is a slick rhetorician and his hiding behind some vague ideas.  I can tell you disagree with things like "socialism" and whereas I"m more inclined to like socialist ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he's incredibly vague and I don't trust the agenda he's selling and you're right that his clever use of words combined with his vague message is suspicious.

       You've worded my annoyance in a more palatable manner for this sub... That's what I mean. He is masquerading his ignorance and political apathy with criticisms so obvious and old-hat that they don't need mentioning again. He brings nothing new to the table but simply repackages.

       He is not saying that voting doesn't put people in office or that he abstains from voting because "what's one vote matter?"  He is saying that voting doesn't matter because when your choices are 2 candidates both bought by the same special interests you are going to end up with the same result.  The system is set up to offer social differences between candidates (maybe one is pro gay marriage and one is anti) and this is often enough to distract people into voting based on that alone, but when you do that you are taking your eye off the ball.  I'm not saying that Russell Brand is the answer, has the answer, or even really wants to find the answer, but I do think that what he is doing is good and he seems sincere about it so I'm not going to just shrug him off as some "rich phony actor."  We can't start thinking that just because somebody made a lot of money they can't care about poor people or the struggles of a middle class family in a shrinking middle class.

       Hes hating on capitalism, granted capitalism is broken on the wall street level but thats the governments fault for being so easily corruptible.
      </p>
      <p>
       His heart seems to be in the right place but to me if you boil down his message it is, dont vote, eat the rich, profit is bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I run a business I sell at a 100% mark up if possible.  Thats what it takes to make rent, pay electric, fund payroll, and keep inventory and put my kid in private school.  I work hard as fuck to keep my prices as low as possible while maintaing a good margin.  Then I have to listen to some guy preech to me about how evil profit is while his job is basically dicking around in front of a camera for millions.  Until he gives away 80% of his money spare me the faux compassion.

       I dont think hes a bad guy, id say this is just misguided.

       He's young and just at the start of his spiritual and philosophical journey in this direction, he of course doesn't perfectly articulate the faults of the current world and the benefits of his ideal world.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he talks about the obscenity of profits he's not talking about small businesses like yours where you have hard working people who want to make a small amount of profit to enrich their lives and sustain their business.
      </p>
      <p>
       What he is talking about is the system we have in place that allows megacorporations such as Walmart and others to create a world where we use slave labor in Asia to create a bunch of useless junk which other corporations market to the people as needs which they sell at insane margins to line the pockets of a greedy few at the top while paying their workers in the US fuckall, forcing them onto foodstamps and medicaid, which in turn the middle class must foot the bill to pay for, despite the megacorporations having plenty to pay for it themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't fall into the trap of equating yourself with the Walmarts and Apple's of the world.  You are not them, and you are not the poison of capitalism he speaks of.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said capitalism is quite evil when there is insufficient or inappropriate regulation in place to keep its greedy nature in check.  Just as socialism is quite evil when there is insufficient oversight and democratic checks and balances to keep its authoritarian nature in check.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until humanity elevates spiritually and philisophically as a whole to the point where people are willing to work for humanity as a whole and not for their own selfish needs, we will need capitalism to incentivise labor and entrepenuership.  But until we reach our higher level we will also need a strong, democratically based, government to keep that capitalist system from returning to its feudalist roots.
      </p>
      <p>
       For now we need both socialism and capitalism, but we need to root out the corruption that has weakened both and made them work only for 1% of the population to the detriment of the rest of humanity and the only home we've got.

       Well I see what you are saying but for one thing you don't have to listen to him.  Nobody does.  Secondly, his job may be pretty meaningless but unfortunately part of capitalism is letting market determine the value of any given job/product.  Our market as determined that his job is one of the most valuable jobs on the planet.  We can't fault him for making money doing what he is apparently good at doing (though this is subjective).  I don't think what he is doing is hating on capitalism so much as hating on the idea that capitalism has somehow turned into a system where corporations can buy politicians and insulate themselves from the same problems that a person making 50k a year faces.  The easily corruptible government is precisely what he is talking about doing away with by not voting for the candidates who are beholden to these corporations - basically waiting for a third party candidate.

       The only reason he is allowed on television is because he is rich. I'm glad he's taking those opportunities to inform the sheople. It's becoming more obvious every day voting doesn't work the way it should. Republican/Democrat are the same entity.

       Well it's interesting that he's spent the past 2 years criticizing these people despite his alleged intimate relations with them.  We shouldn't attack his message just because he was allowed inside of that circle and now criticizes it from within.  If anything we need more like him.

       2 It doesn't matter what the world economic output is. They are indeed creating money magically. You don't understand what the derivative market is (clearly). They are placing bets, upon bets, upon bets. The derivative market has hundreds of layers of betting, based on the initial security.

       3 Again, the money gained from a Wall St Sales Tax goes to health care, jobs, education and a  high wage, FDR/New Deal style economy. You cannot be a weakling and give up at the very start and concede,  "oh, the money will never goto those things". Sign a law, pass a bill..

       Also, please stop with the random attacks clearly based on nothing. Makes you look like a teenager, new to the internet, who enjoys random pointless, time wasting attacks on people you don't know, just because of your inherent narcissism towards general society or in this case, a random stranger, who you have a minor, petty beef with.

       There were a lot of sincere regular people that sought change and revolution based on Socialist ideology.  And there are a lot of good ideas that are "Socialistic" (like socialized heath care, education, and pensions, etc.--and nationalization of certain industries--like oil, water distribution, utilities).
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think Socialism has been co-opted.   And it's not very useful to divide everything into Socialism or Capitalism anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm not sure Marx was funded by the elite or working for them, Jewish or otherwise--even though I see this alleged a lot.  His criticism of capitalism is very good, imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       But who knows.  I need more facts about it.
