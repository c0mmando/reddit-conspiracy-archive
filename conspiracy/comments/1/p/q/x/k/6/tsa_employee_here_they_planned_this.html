       This is a throwaway, but I want to tell you all, they planned this to arm TSA.  They have been telling us for months to get certified and to use one of their "ranges" by the airport if you want to get certified.  I didn't know what it was all about but when I got there, they told us "within 4 months (back in Sept) you will be allowed to carry and arrest, as well as search and seize property."  When I asked "how?" the guy at the range just said "I don't know how you're gonna get your gun, but you can thank DHS for it" and walked away.  That's the only answer I got.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then this happens.  I won't say which airport I work at, only that I know for certain that we planned this to gain the power to carry guns, and once that happens, well, I don't even know how people will react.  The official story is that there are home-grown cells of "radicals" that want to hurt us.  I don't know what else to do but to warn you guys, this has ALL been planned since at least September.
I won't be returning to work on Monday, and I will be in hiding for a while.  This is scary.

       Interesting. About 6 months ago, I went to my local pistol range and the first six lanes were occupied by TSA agents receiving training from a uniformed DHS cop.

       Oh come on, why would you need any proof? 
We all know that uniformed DHS cops would train TSA agents to use guns about six months before a false flag attack. 
And they would do it in "local" (public) pistol ranges, because the government does not have any private weapons ranges and there would be absolutely nothing suspicious about a uniformed DHS cop training a bunch of TSA agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       See? Makes total sense. No reason whatsoever to doubt this story.

       The TSA is responsible for Air Marshals. It seems likely that they are seeking a range for Air Marshals.

       There are also a number of other armed TSA staff (including many members of their VIPR teams).

       It's a complex system that involves stringing letters together into these things called
       <em>
        words
       </em>
       .  When you create enough of these
       <em>
        words
       </em>
       they form something called
       <em>
        sentences

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Words and sentences become a basis for communication.

       Unfair?  Fuck off with that.  Your base judgments are meaningless.  You jumped into a string of comments and threw this comment:
      </p>
      <p>
       "It means his delusions have taken over to the point where he can't even string together coherent comments"
      </p>
      <p>
       For a guy with 15 posts on that account (six of them in this thread, by the way), you are pretty comfortable calling people out.  I almost took you seriously for a second, so I guess you have that going for you, but based on what I have seen from you, with an extremely limited post count but a pretty casual and comfortable way of posting like an asshole from the beginning of your history, I think we both know that you are posting from a duplicate account and that makes you a coward.

       I'm doing it with every post.  You could have prevented your intellectual rape by not assuming that you could just drop a half assed insult on a guy who you knew nothing about, instead you played the troll role and got yourself into an exchange that you are still trying to find your place in by making moronic generalities.  Please let us continue this conversation for days, because I am enjoying your attempts to find something that you think gives you some sort of leverage in an argument that you started with the sole purpose of antagonism.  And can't finish.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you are relying on general "loon" descriptions is like candy to me, because you completely avoided my reference to the fact that you haven't bothered to address the subject of this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       You aren't here to debate or discuss.  You are here to try to anger people, and you aren't good at it.  At all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Might as well lick my boots.  You really aren't serving any other purpose.

       While I agree with the premise of the OP's statement, one part strikes me as curious: why is he going into hiding "for a while." And why is it scary for him? While I can understand the implications of an armed TSA (I am hearing Nazi party songs in my head and seeing visions of brown-shirts), I do not understand why the OP would react this way. If he is part of the organization, then he should benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless he feels that TSA/NSA surveillance is so deep that they would
       <em>
        disappear
       </em>
       him once he shows up to his shift on Monday, I can only see this post as a capitalization on current events, and a sensationalized mess. The last time I flew, the TSA guards were still pimply idiots with no pretense of any sort of paramilitarism.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: All of the OP's information looks to have come straight from the Infowars article:

       This isn't circumstantial evidence at all. For all we know OP is an anti TSA writer that just wants to get more people to believe in this narrative so he can sell more stories, or get more clicks on his website.

       Nobody is taking his Reddit testimony to the UN. Just read it and file it along with all the other "what-ifs" you come across. If they pile up, you have a pattern. That pattern is circumstantial evidence.

       Nope. You can't file this testimony under what-ifs because this is not how you collect evidence. This is precisely how misinformation gets passed around, and this is how people like the LAX shooter get confused into doing terrible things.

       You're talking about empirical evidence. In this case, there is none. Before the big disclosure happens, a lot of things that really, truly are happening will remain hidden from empirical view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because something can't be proven conclusively doesn't mean it's true. This reductionist mindset that prevails on Reddit simply doesn't work for this stuff.

       LAX gift store employee here, this is a throwaway, but I want to tell you all, they planned this to arm gift shop employees. They have been telling us for months to get certified and to use one of their "ranges" by the airport if you want to get certified. I didn't know what it was all about but when I got there, they told us "within 4 months (back in Sept) you will be allowed to carry and arrest, as well as search and seize property." When I asked "how?" the guy at the range just said "I don't know how you're gonna get your gun, but you can thank DHS for it" and walked away. That's the only answer I got.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then this happens. I won't say which gift shop I work at, only that I know for certain that we planned this to gain the power to carry guns, and once that happens, well, I don't even know how people will react. The official story is that there are home-grown cells of "radicals" that want to hurt us. I don't know what else to do but to warn you guys, this has ALL been planned since at least September. I won't be returning to work on Monday, and I will be in hiding for a while. This is scary.

       Frequent LAX flyer here. They have been trying to arm us passengers who are stuck waiting in 2-3 hour long security lines with firearms as well, so I can confirm that the pretzel cart vendor's confirmation of the gift shop employee's confirmation of the TSA agent's assertion is, in fact, the truth. If you're still in denial about the state of our nation, then YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.

       So instead of having a shooting event at LAX to allow the TSA to have guns, why didn't they simply issue the TSA guns?  Americans already let them set up their checkpoints and their body scanners.  There was a bit of protest but that was quick to go silent.  I'm pretty sure the majority of Americans wouldn't even bat an eye if they heard the TSA was now going to be certified to carry guns.  Most Americans don't give a shit about "minor infringements of their rights" if they think it will add to their security.  Not to mention there were police and FBI headquartered in this airport so it is the worst airport to do something like this at if you are trying to make a case for giving the TSA guns.  Guns were already on scene.

       Out of the blue, it might make people nervous. Now, it seems totally justified. It's similar to the TSA's very existence - without 9/11, the TSA would seem creepy and unnecessary.

       I think if anything this would help an argument for having a tsa screening point at the main entrance of airports as well.  There were already plenty of armed personnel on scene so tsa having guns wouldn't have made much of a difference at this airport.

       I appreciate you coming forward, and I suspect this is true.  However, in order to avoid the label of tin foil hat wearer I feel that we need more to go on.  You have told us a story, a believable story, but nonetheless this is not solid evidence.

       I would be so much more inclined to believe this if more than one person died. I doubt one death will result in this massive overhaul of a government agency because with how many people travel through LAX, it really is a stretch to think that the ONLY death that's ever occurred on the premises of an on-duty TSA employee would lead to the public's blind acceptance of new policies.

       Yah but what he is saying is nonsense. First of all, the ranges are open to all agencies, it's not to be confused with them planning to army he TSA. In order to have armed agents they would have to select employees with a much stricter hiring process. They can't just train existing employees how to shoot and then arm them, that's not how it works.

       They can pick the cream of the crop to arm and leave the others unarmed.  Two levels of TSA.  Doesn't have to be an all or nothing deal.

       The Federal regulations for government employees who carry guns are quite extensive.  TSA employees don't go through nearly that sort of screening and training.

       Here is an American perspective.  Most of our police are armed and armored.  For example, they carry Glock .40cal sidearms, drive cars with armor, carry AR-15 rifles, .308cal rifles, and shotguns in their cars, have electronic road controlling devices in their cars, and often wear bullet-proof vests.
      </p>
      <p>
       The TSA agents wear plain clothes and are not armed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a mad-man had attacked three cops, the cultural belief is that one or two cops might have fired back and "won" the encounter.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy left a neat note stating he was out to kill "cops and TSA agents", so we are informed that he equated them in his mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, and here is the tear-jerker part, the TSA agents are unarmed.  So by lumping them in with cops, who are armed, the killer was going after the unarmed and defenseless civil servant.  But, wait, do we not ask this civil servant, this "TSA agent" to protect us from armed terrorists?  So they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       like a police
       <sup>
        *
       </sup>
       and therefore we
       <em>
        owe it to these civil servants
       </em>
       to arm them so they can defend themselves.  It is unjust  that we put them in harm's way without a weapon for each of them to defend  him or herself in the line of duty.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the thinking is that the TSA high-ups picked a low-down agent that they needed to "frag" (i.e., rub out, kill), and then stage a false psycho incident in which a "Conspiracy Theorists" confronts a TSA agent because he was out to kill "cops and TSA agents."  Then
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       can change the status of TSA from unarmed to heavily armed and armored, without yet arousing much suspicion from the farmers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <sup>
        *
       </sup>
       (although a
       <em>
        posse commitatus
       </em>
       under our law, and so, not a legal police in reality)

       OP do you think this will also expand the VIPR teams program and expand the possibility of other types of transportation "security" like, say, your own vehicle, toll booths, or other such things?

       basically, the masons run law enforcement. cops, fbi, etc. they dont always do a perfect job and they have their own agenda, but they do at least believe in the principles this nation was founded on (they founded it) and they HATE tyranny, so much so that they will sometimes work around those principles to keep america safe from those actors and agents of tyranny in the world who are always seeking to use our own constitution against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       ok now that is understood. the tsa is being transformed into a parallel law enforcement agency. you may have seen the 'explosives detection/k9 tsa cars' patrolling streets in your town. eventually, jurisdiction over the streets will be transferred from the police to the tsa. when that happens, you can fully expect "papers please" and search and siezures everywhere you go, and I mean EVERYWHERE.
      </p>
      <p>
       the masons and police are aware this is coming, which is why they have been acquiring militarized equipment. they are preparing for war, not against you, but against the tsa. you may not like the police, that is fine. but please understand that the tsa is not on your side or the side of liberty. you don't have to pick sides in what is coming, but please just recognize the tsa is really really bad.

       Ooh now that you mentioning, arming rubes is a really worrisome sign.  The rube losers are the ones they put up front to deal with the masses.  The rube losers take the big losses so the second line responds on an alert status.  I hadn't realize that the TSA thing means we're in the end game, down to a knight and a king or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       The front line of the tyrant army appears to be the second line.  The practical front line is made up not of tyrants, but of those in the thrall of the tyrants.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like this all the way back, so that it is not clear whether the Rothschilds are the tyrants or just the (N-1)th layer of rube loser.  That is, perhaps we have seen past a curtain, perhaps we only imagine so.

       In particular, the Rothschilds are not Jews, but Khazars.  Regardless, if you research the WWII Thyssen Corporation, you will find that there were elite Jews who collaborated with the Nazis to perpetrate the

      <p>

       traditional islam is opposed to masonry. i do not know if the saudi royals really strictly adhere to that form of islam or just support it because it supports their ends. you are correct on the other items. could be any or all of the above as a diffuse channel of funds utilizing useful idiots who make their heads talk for money. in reality you only need direct control over a handful of directors (media and corporate) and editors (news and fiction) with a steady stream of cash and you can shift the zeitgeist this way and that.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: i would not trust the catholic church now or ever, no matter how reformed or populist they appear to be under people like francis.
