<p>I tried to spark a conversation on a video in this Sub after lurking for a long time - I have never seen a post downvoted so quickly or strategically, i was being civil trying to prompt open discussion. </p>

<p>So is <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> purely anti-Obama or was there another reason? </p>

<p>Edit: 1:47 AM
If you can write a clear and concise argument for any political subject, without using weasel words, or vulgarity I would love to read it - Pro / Con / Neutral - I just like to hear opinions and shit like that (Yes I am a hypocrite when it comes to vulgarity) </p>

<p>Edit: 1:57 AM

    <div class="md"><p>It was enough to get Clinton impeached. Everybody lies, I get that, but what matters is what he is lying about and how often he is lying. I&#39;m not talking about the number of times he masturbates or whether he smokes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDbTaWpwoc">Here is video evidence of him lying to the American people.</a></p>

<p>So you think it is ok for the President of the United States of America to lie to the American people? On a regular basis? About how he would use his authority as President? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if he changed his position on gay marriage to get elected, but he was supposed to bring in a more transparent government. Then why is he cracking down on whistleblowers? If he is supposed to have studied constitutional law, then how can he allow the erosion of our civil liberties? </p>

<p>The best case scenario for him is that he is completely impotent or incompetent, but he is not an idiot, he is smart and he knows what he&#39;s doing. Even if he is not 100% in control he isn&#39;t fighting for the American people. That is plenty enough for me.</p>

<p>Now don&#39;t waste your time trying to refute any of this comment. Don&#39;t believe me, I don&#39;t care. I&#39;d just like to know something. Why do I have to go and find evidence for you? Do you know what Google is? How about Youtube? </p>

<p>Let me explain how it works for you. When you are curious about a particular subject and you would like to become better informed on said subject there are a few easy steps you can take. First, find a platform to execute your investigation, (like Google.) Then, enter the name of the subject that you would like to learn more about into the search bar. After performing the search there will be vast amounts of information from trustworthy and untrustworthy sources for you to examine. </p>

<p>Even better than Google is Youtube. Did you know people actually make videos showing their own investigations about certain things, the conclusions that they have drawn, and the sources where their information came from? Technology is crazy! What&#39;s next, movies with naked people that you can masturbate to?</p>

<p>Ok maybe I&#39;m being a little harsh, but you have to understand where I&#39;m coming from here. I voted for Obama twice. I donated to his campaign in 2008. I believed every word he said. But now I know that he is no different than any other corrupt politician. If you want to keep believing in him that is fine, but if you want to know the truth then SEARCH for it.</p>

<p>See you state your opinion, give examples of what causes major distress for you, and what is a small trivial issue.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In response to &quot;cracking down on whistle blowers&quot;</p>

<p>I would consider that maybe the knowledge gap between a potential president and acting president has some correlation between campaign promises and actual in office actions. That knowledge gap is fairly large. </p>

There should be an independent investigation into the information released by Edward Snowden while he is in protective custody, and if it is true that we are spying on American citizens, I will put a stop it and those responsible will be held accountable.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would not presume to speak for others.  But in this case I&#39;ll go out on a limb.  I would say 30-40 percent of the people on this sub, and probably 80-90 percent of the true conspiracy theorists on this sub are anti both parties in equal measure.  </p>

<p>Generally, the two party system is viewed as a giant pro-wrestling match where all the participants get on stage and put on a show for the people.  Nobody is actually trying to change the country for the better.  Politicians are more like termites, competing for their chance to gnaw away at a little more wood than the other politicians. Ultimately, they are all on the same team, allied against the American people.</p>

<p>Are they &quot;anti-Obama&quot;?  well that depends.  I suppose in one sense, yes.  But if the question carries the additional baggage that to be &quot;anti-Obama&quot; one is by necessity &quot;pro-[the republican guy]&quot;  Then no.  The whole two party &quot;choice&quot; thing is just social manipulation.</p>

<p>For years when people have tried to get a feel for my political views, I have said &quot;I think republicans have done more damage than democrats in the last ten years.&quot;  But now I can&#39;t say that anymore.  Of course, when I was saying that it was only because a republicans had been in the white house for more of those years.  Now that a Democrat has been in the white house for more of those years I guess I will have to start saying that I think democrats have done more damage than republicans.</p>

<p>p.s.  I followed the link to your other post.  I didn&#39;t know about 4.6b being added to the Veteran&#39;s Administration for mental health professionals.  That&#39;s downright scary given that we had a recent thread that said that they are now sending letters out to former military personnel, and will be revoking gun rights contingent on a mental health evaluation.  I never really thought about a system of &quot;compartmentalized&quot; gun control.  But that does seem like a decently nefarious idea to control guns without declaring war on all the citizens at once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say this sub is &#39;anti-Obama&#39; per se.</p>

<p>I am displeased with centralized control structures in general these days. Obama heads one of the biggest central control structures. It also happens to be one of the most violent. Obama is merely a puppet that will be discarded in time.</p>

<p>If you clap for a puppet that&#39;s fine. But I see it as a waste of time.</p>

<p>Plus the system for which he works is violent.</p>

<p>In my view, there&#39;s little redeeming about Obama&#39;s &#39;public life.&#39;</p>

<li><p>Shill Complaints: Anyone calling someone a &quot;shill&quot; is a instant red flag for me. Mostly because it&#39;s counter-productive name calling that isn&#39;t needed in any discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>9/11 will always be a big deal here. To their credit, the 9/11 attacks did deserve a better investigation</p></li>
<li><p>Monsanto has a deservedly bad reputation. I&#39;m not against all GMO&#39;s but they have done some sketchy stuff. Also them being so close to the FDA is embarrassing. </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Inside Job/False Flag Terrorism&quot; Of course the uninformed speculation get&#39;s a little crazy, however false flag attacks have been used throughout modern history to maintain/grab control. That doesn&#39;t mean every news story is one though. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t pretend to represent everyone here, but I don&#39;t like Obama because he has done very little to bring the troops home. (As I would interpret as ending the war on terror.) </p>

<p>He hasn&#39;t demanded more oversight on NSA spying or his drone program. (Not saying he should get rid of them, but they seem to ask like lawless rogue agencies if you ask me.) </p>

<p>To me, Obama never fights for the people he voted for. He &quot;compromises&quot; with the GOP and ends up with less than he started with. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the Republicans are any better, they just currently don&#39;t hold the presidency. When that changes rest assured I won&#39;t hesitate to talk about the same issues. </p>

<p>At first I thought Obama was a victim of deadlock, then I thought he was just a foolish compromiser, now I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the lobbyists calling the shots. Normally that would be a reason to abolish him on the blame, but Obama specifically campaigned on &quot;change&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you&#39;re not allowed to write anything good about Obama here. When &quot;Obamacare&quot; turns out to be better than the system that replaces it, no one here will refer to it by that name anymore, as they won&#39;t allow anything positive to be attached to his name.</p>

<p>Basically people here generally have very black and white views on the world. Perhaps they&#39;re all Sith? ;-)</p>
