       (repost) So a quick start - I kept seeing "Elisa Lam posts" all over r/conspiracy and havent rlly looked into it or knew who sure was or what happened,
my first video on the girl was the surveillance video posted early &amp; thought it was just plain creepy, but also I wanted to no more...no particular reason. 
The first page that I was brought to was the Link'din Page for an "Elisa Lam" That fit her description.
      </p>
      <p>
       (
       <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/elisa-lam/23/a67/41b">
        http://www.linkedin.com/pub/elisa-lam/23/a67/41b
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       2 things caught my eye on her employment 'rap sheet'
   1)Fidelity Investments PCAOB Related Party Standard 
  &amp;
    2) Ernst &amp; Young
June 2013 – August 2013 (3 months)
[Notice the dates are after her death, she was found dead way before this. If this is Elisa Lam, maybe she was already hired and put it in for future reference]
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         During her time at Fidelity Investments, Elisa Lam though it was necessary to add that during her employent she;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Supported the preparation of related party listings and transactions for the implementation of the new PCAOB Related Party Standard
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Assisted in the monthly close process for two Fidelity banks by recording journal entries and preparing account reconciliations
• Performed a review of the Accounting Shared Drive access, and as a result, removed 91 employees who no longer needed access
• Worked on a project with three other interns to improve the communication and collaboration within the Corporate Accounting function
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So i conducted a search for these two companies and the hotel, to see if their was any weird connections, which led me to this man..again a Linkedin Portfolio..
       <a href="http://sa.linkedin.com/pub/farrukh-malik/33/6bb/398">
        http://sa.linkedin.com/pub/farrukh-malik/33/6bb/398
       </a>
       - a man named,  Farrukh Malik, and then the weirdest most unexpected thing happened...
      </p>
      <p>
       Under his name was,
      </p>
      <p>
       HR Consultant at PMDC - Bin Laden Group ...what the fuck?
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked up to this weird company and found some information.. a very suspicious site...notice how none of the links work...
       <a href="http://www.worldreport-ind.com/saudiarabia1/binladin.htm">
        http://www.worldreport-ind.com/saudiarabia1/binladin.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <pre><code>    - "The Project Management and Development Company (PMDC), 
                                  *bought by the ""Influential Binl Laden Group"" in 1991.

      <p>
       They PMDC's
       <strong>

       <strong>

       </strong>
       ( link for an interview on link
       <sup>
        )
       </sup>
      </p>
      <pre><code>             A brief description of PMDC; 
 "The services the company offers cover the whole spectrum from planning and design to marketing and development.

      <p>
       So After I saw this I had to search this "Influential Bin Laden Group", I mean, what the fuck?!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is when I found

       The site seems like a blog of some sort. An Article on CIA bank rolls and such...
      </p>
      <p>
       a paragraph in the article was worth noting -
    + "Al-Queda seems to derive their funding from the Saudi (?CIA?) bankrolls, thus Al-queda's ultra-right fundamentalist Wahhabist Sunni Islamist outlook tends to predominate their recruitment strategy. Any potential religious/ethnic divisions amongst Muslim peoples are always inflamed and expanded by trusty Al-Queda.   Ironically it was wealthy Sunni Wahhabist Saudi

       (no doubt influenced by GW Bush's petroligarch family friends in Saudi's influential Bin Laden group) who was most outspoken in issuing a Fatwa against the successful Hezbollah..
      </p>
      <p>
       Did I discover what the "image" of Bin Laden is? 
A conglomerate corporation that funds Al-Quada, as if, their leader?
   If not, never the less;
 the Bin Laden Group is something to keep searching..
 and what does that chick have to do with all this, Elisa Lam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, any input?

       You have more or less discovered the connections between warmongering families.  The Bushes and the Bin Ladens are Defense contractors, who collaborate to fund insurgents to overthrow the parts of the world not controlled by the Rothschild world banks.

       No its not like that. Oil is a natural resource.  Banks own companies who manufacture and produce oil from the ground for the world to consume.  The money used to build this infrastructure never leaves the banker's hands.  Holding companies will install and manufacture the required assets and topple regimes who will not pay the bankers interest on the loans they used to finance the companies in their countries.  The banks will also topple regimes (under the guise of National Security) who believe that they should control the oil for their own people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example Iran in the 1950s thought the American oil companies controlling of 50% of their oil economy was  ludicrous.  And their leader nationalized the oil pipelines for the Iranian people. The CIA overthrew that government and installed a puppet.  Who in return gave control of the oil to American companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same thing is happening in Syria right now...  Assad plans to keep natural gaslines for the country of Syria.  England and the USA (and its partners like Saudi Arabia) want to give it to Rothchilds, and Builderburg Group (Zionists).  Russia and China are both vitally invested in their own plans for the pipeline. And thus are starting a revolution of their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr - oil is a commodity, something for banks to own. There's only partnerships between oil and banking.

       The bin laden group is one of the largest developers in the world due to their relationship with the saudi royal family. It's very similar to Halliburton/kbr. The bush family is involved in intelligence and oil, and have a close relationship with the house of saud and thus with the bin ladens. As far as aq being sunni extremists and thus linked closely with all these same groups- yup. Aq is used to fight the shiite groups like hezbollah in the countries on the checklist- iran, lebanon and syria.

       They probably removed the post because linking to peoples' linkedin pages is a violation of reddit's TOS, specifically the "no personal information" rule.

       Also, the bin Laden family is enormous, incredibly wealthy and powerful. They have connections with the Saudi Royal family, the Bush family and their war-profiteer front The Carlyle Group.

       The immediate problem I see is that you're looking at the profile for the wrong Elisa Lam. Aside from the getting a job long after Elisa died there's also the fact that the profile you're linking to is a woman living in Boston and educated in Boston and Hong Kong respectively. So how exactly does this "Fit her description"? Do you just mean "It's an asian lady?"

       You ended up at a known multinational. There's even a wiki article on the company. It's not a secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       Osama was a rich kid from a really fucking powerful family. Why is it surprising that his relatives have business ventures? It's not like this company was the only source of money they had, and it's absolutely not like Osama was hurting for financial backing (again, rich family. They hardly needed to do anything dodgy with companies they owned to slip him something under the table).
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that is guessing, though. What's to say that this company has any more interest in promoting or funding terrorism than VW does promoting Nazis?
