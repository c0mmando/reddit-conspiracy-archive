<p>Plus, what was with the mannequin CPR looking doll/TSA agent being wheeled down to the ambulance?  If it was just a dead body, why wheel it down in public like that?  Don&#39;t they put bodies in body bags then a coroner van?  Why showboat his supposed body like that, then strap him to a gurney and put him in an ambulance if he was dead?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we should focus on the big picture as much as possible.  Too much navel-gazing paranoia is distracting.  Lots of peoples hate conspiracies because it makes them feel weird to think that way.  Whatever.  Best defense is to do research and know what you&#39;re talking about.  Other best defense is to have an open mind and not accept shit just because it feels validating or because it is interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enh maybe.  But compared to the NSA, drones, etc, people dying or being tortured, down votes don&#39;t bother me.  I still feel like if I have something compelling to say I can get my voice heard here, that&#39;s all I need.  If the day comes that it isn&#39;t possible, I&#39;ll need to find a new way.  That&#39;s it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.  Let&#39;s say it was a body.  He wasn&#39;t conscious or moving.  No paramedic was actively trying to keep him alive.  I&#39;m gonna say that he was dead.  So then why the unnecessarily long <em>visible</em> trip to the ambulance?  The ambulance didn&#39;t leave immediately with any sort of urgency.  I don&#39;t recall this protocol being used at Sandy Hook.  0_o</p>

<p>Yeah, because that will stop a bot.  This sub really really needs to understand how reddit voting and CSS works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it won&#39;t stop a bot because bots don&#39;t need the visible button to do anything, as long as the code function is still there.  As with RES, no matter where the button is, I can just press Z and it will downvote the post/comment.  CSS is moderator set style sheet that only affects what the subreddit looks like to the user, it affects no true functionality of reddit and if it did the admins would be quick to ban.  Hiding the downvote button using CSS only works to stop casual downvoting, any human that understands a bit about reddit and any bot won&#39;t actually be stopped.  </p>
