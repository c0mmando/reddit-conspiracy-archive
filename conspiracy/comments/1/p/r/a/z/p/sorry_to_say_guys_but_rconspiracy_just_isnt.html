        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The amount of posts I have physically witnessed being deleted from the  front page of this subredddit over the last HOUR regarding the LAX shootings have been astonishing. The one of TSA worker saying this was all planned another about Gun Ranges specifically for TSA agents; I could list a few more but that&#39;s beside the point. The mods have obviously been compromised/co-erced into deleting these posts and its not just here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> either. <a href="/r/Politics">/r/Politics</a>, <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and I&#39;m sure plenty more have all had the same thing happening. Whatever is happening for these posts to have been deleted on a forum designed to talk about this sort of stuff on a website that is designed to be an incarnation of the 1st amendment (with regards to everyone saying what  they please on whatever topic they please) I can pretty safely say is a lot bigger than most of you guys think.</p>

<p>Be ready guys, this is the silence(ing) before the storm...</p>

<p>EDIT: My post wasn&#39;t meant as a &#39;lets bash the mods and content&#39; of conspiracy. I was merely bringing attention to what i had seen OVER A FEW HOURS on this sub, hence my concern. One of the posts i have described has indeed been put back on the site but is no longer anywhere near the front page as it was and needs to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;Sorry for the removal. Automoderator doesn&#39;t like brand new accounts. I have approved the post manually.&#39;</p>

<p>Posted by Flytape on the post - <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1pqxk6/tsa_employee_here_they_planned_this/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1pqxk6/tsa_employee_here_they_planned_this/</a></p>

<p>It was removed by a bot hence from the front page of the sub, that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about. Surely its not ALL new redditors that it deletes posts for otherwise its just ridiculous. Some of the outed shills from recent have posted on new accounts and not had any ramifications. And the one about the gun ranges for the TSA HAS actually been removed, just searched for it so unless you can produce it then my points are still valid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of the whole &quot;fukushima amnesia&quot; post storm a few days ago. I&#39;ve only looked at /r/ conspiracy for a half hour today and was able to find the information being described as &quot;disappeared&quot;.</p>

<p>This seems more like a contrived shit storm. I&#39;ve noticed that there&#39;s been a large volume of complaints on this sub trying to attack the moderators, content and users. There have been many posts accusing this sub of cow-towing to TPTB. And even more posts are describing this sub of being diluted or losing users.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m quite sure this is only a personal paradigm. The sub hasn&#39;t changed much in the way of content for a long time now. Users are MORE frequently participating in discussions.</p>

<p>As to the reason why shit sometimes gets deleted? Fuck if I know. But grabbing pitchforks isn&#39;t helping your &quot;cause&quot; at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like everyone keeps saying, it was the Automod that did it. If you have a new account you&#39;re going to have a hard time posting almost anything in this sub for 3 days. I deleted an old account and made a new one and had  these exact same problems. It sucks, but it&#39;s not censorship and with the attacks this sub gets it is a necessary evil. The mods actually do a pretty good job here, contrary to popular belief. I&#39;ve never seen them delete anything that didn&#39;t need to be and there definitely aren&#39;t the strict rules here like every other sub. You can post pretty much anything, even things that aren&#39;t really conspiracy related if you know that everyone here would be interested and they don&#39;t get taken down. Every other sub if you even post a title incorrectly it&#39;s removed. I have never seen the mods out of control here, despite all the shit that people talk about them.</p>

I recomnend you go back to your like minded imbeciles, so you can circle jerk about all the times you&#39;ve been wrong, and will continue to be wrong.  We don&#39;t need your type of obstructionist bullshit here.  Nor do we welcome such utter morons into the fold.</p>
