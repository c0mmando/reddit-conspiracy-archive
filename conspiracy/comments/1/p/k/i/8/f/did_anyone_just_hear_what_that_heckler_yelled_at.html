       They were yelling about global warming.
      </p>
      <p>
       (full "article")
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Several noisy protesters interrupted President Obama’s health care reform rally in Boston on Wednesday afternoon, stopping the commander in chief’s speech dead in its tracks.
       </p>
       <p>
        The demonstrators shouted for Mr. Obama to “stop the pipeline” and to confront climate change, referencing the controversial Keystone XL pipeline project which the president must personally approve or deny.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pausing for a few moments, Mr. Obama then attempted to make light of the situation.
       </p>
       <p>
        “We’re talking about health care today … That is the wrong rally,” he said with a smile, telling the crowd he is in Boston to talk health care, not global warming.
       </p>
       <p>
        “We had the climate change rally back in the summer. This is the health care rally,” he added.
       </p>

       Which supports my theory that hecklers are often planted like the fainters.  Not like they are disagreeing too much with the president here and he was able to look magnanimous and lighthearted.

       What?! Dude the Keystone pipeline is a big thing and those protesters are most likely legit. Of course they're going to do that at the health care rally so people will actually hear/listen to them that normally might not. It's a good strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because Obama might be quick on his feat with responding doesn't mean the hecklers are staged.

       All the more reason the hecklers could be staged. NO ONE gets into the audience at an Obama event without rigorous pre-approval and vetting. They know exactly who is in the crowd. 
It's no different than those professional protesters who always miraculously have a sign in the House gallery then get arrested and thrown out, only to repeat this same feat the next month and say "oh I guess security didn't recognize me with the 10 morning news shows I did last week about getting dragged out of the House derpety derp"

       Ok, so allow me to rephrase.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every Obama event I've attempted to attend, I was pre-screened out and barred, because I refused to join the mailing list to get my required invitation. SEEEEEEEEEEEMS like vetting to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last time Joe Biden visited my college, I wanted to attend. They announced the event THE MORNING of the event to the campus at large, then offered tickets. Then when you get there to ask for tickets, oh, sorry, they were all claimed two weeks ago. Were you on the mailing list?

Perhaps the 'fainters' were placed for two reasons.
1.) To improve public image
2.) To implant suspicion about the validity of protesting

       Agreed, they vent the feelings of the populace, but in an easily deflected manner.  While climate change is important, it's a weak logical link to the pipeline, and isn't a legal concern.  What they
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       have brought up, was the money trail and conflicts of interest in the use of the public's government for private business.  High profile, weak logic events are the theme of the new millennium in MSM.

       Fuck global warming how about now having toxic sludge shipped long distance through our country. I like clean water

       Edit - And yes this was probably a plant, but it certainly was not some scheme to trick you into thinking fossil fuel consumption can't go on forever. Reality should do that just fine....

       Don't forget that the "toxic sludge" is an utter joke in every way!

       It actually takes far more energy to mine and process and ship than it provides for the end-point user. A very good deal more.

       It's basically the Koch brothers' method of spending a dime for every penny they make...though THEY don't pay that price at all--us taxpayers do.

       Do not kid yourself. The Keystone protests are another example of rent-a-mob. People are being manipulated on this just like everything else. The Rockefeller/Saudis and globalists are the most likely ones trying to stop the Keystone. Many people have confirmed that the Keystone will have very little impact on increasing GHG's, and the pipeline is safer environmentally than shipping by rail. Something does not add up.

       It still won't be good environmentally. It takes resources, trucks and deforestation to build pipelines. I think the protesters don't want want either the pipeline or moving by truck. They want lower hydrocarbons and 20% of America to have solar panels.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the knee-jerk reaction is, "That so extreme. Those environmentalist need to be realistic," but honestly, it's not
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       extreme. It is actually possible. Stop bailing out banks, you could subsidize solar panels, provide a real single payer health care system, build real high speed trains and in general, make society better for the poor and middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's an extreme stance, but the green hippies have to be that extreme, just to get maybe an 1/8 of what they ask for. And even with that, what they ask for...it isn't even unachievable. We're just led to think it is so big oil can keep selling us car, petrol and propane.

       Great post!

       Just the first $700 million bailout could have paid for the installation of over 40,000 high-end renewable energy systems (at $20,000 per). If net metering and resale to power companies is figured in that's over 100,000 homes that could be producing ALL of the energy they use (through solar). If wind or micro-hydro is substituted that number goes WAY up.
      </p>
      <p>
       200,000 (est) Americans could have been both energy-independent AND selling power back to other Americans--OR 14,000 Americans could have gotten a free ride through college...but they used it to cover these assholes' gambling debts instead.

       The amount of the bailout, $800 billion, was also the exact number cited by NASA they projected a manned Mars mission mounted in 2007 would have cost. 
Rather than bailout the banks, we could have had a US Flag planted on Mars surrounded by American astronaut footsteps by now, which seems like a much more valuable and inspiring investment to me.

       keep in mind the sea levels rising is also linked to the trash soup mass that is 1 mile deep and larger than the United States of America in the Pacific Ocean.  Also keep in mind that another formed closer to Asia in their ocean current.  Water displacement principle applies as well, add in thousands of super tankers as well, Military fleets and all the publics boats you will see a signifance in ocean levels correlated to this centuries economic development.  (stuff that my professor talks about however you wont find it in any US textbook.)

       I don't think you understand what the "patch" is. It's a misnomer - that's why you don't see it on satellite images. It's just a region where very very tiny amounts of plastics are found in higher concentrations than usual, and of course garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless of course you're trying to tell me that there's continuous patch of garbage and plastic that magically dissapeared from satellite images.

       Not in the trench, all that stuff that accumulates happens to float.  of course there is stuff that sinks.  Im not saying that its a density of a rock in the ocean however the currents keep a lot of stuff in a general area.
