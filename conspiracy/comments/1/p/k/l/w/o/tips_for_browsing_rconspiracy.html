<li><p>Don&#39;t bother arguing with shills or trying to reveal them... it is a very frustrating use of time and energy.  You may intellectually corner them, but you can never win, since they always have more inane lines they can copy and paste at you.</p></li>

They say &quot;the revolution won&#39;t be televised,&quot; well it sure as hell won&#39;t be on Reddit either.  The powers which control our infrastructure are really good at preventing clear public revolutions from manifesting, and I&#39;m counting <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as part of the public here.  They cannot, however, prevent the revolutions from occurring in our minds, and in our real communities.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t bother arguing with shills or trying to reveal them....</p>

<p>hell with that, what fun would it then? I mean nothing gets crappy stuff off the front page like deflating a shills point of view....lets take the obmacare post that was front page...As soon as I pointed out that arguing over an insurance scam, instead of correcting the problem, that being an insurance scam middle man industry that is coddled by the NWO Zionist central bankers is the problem, and that &quot;you&quot; don&#39;t have health care, you have a scam instead of a skilled labor that is billed based on time labor and materials...well as soon as that was pointed out, it suddenly left the front and slid off...</p>

<p>lets keep in mind, when you come here, glp,lop,ATS and any of the other crappy nsa tavistock stratfor websites, well lets just keep in mind that&#39;s who&#39;s in charge...</p>

<p>I think of this as an excellent way to directly address the enemy and let them know right where I stand...It also allows them to know right where I am, so if they should feel inclined they can come pick me up...</p>

<p>So really it&#39;s a win win</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it&#39;s a real person you are arguing with, then the argument can be great!</p>

<p>I just had a really bad experience arguing with a serious paid shill, <a href="http://consciouslifenews.com/paid-internet-shill-shadowy-groups-manipulate-internet-opinion-debate/">who was pretty much like this guy.</a></p>

<p>It was around the time of the Boston Bombing, and the guy was operating in an optimized way to fuck up any meaningful discovery that might take place in this subreddit.  Didn&#39;t feel like I was beating the enemy, it felt like I was wasting energy fighting either some paid script copy-paster or a bot.</p>
