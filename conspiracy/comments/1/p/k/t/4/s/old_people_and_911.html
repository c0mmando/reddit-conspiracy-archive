       Nothing crazy here, but I run a gym, and occasionally over hear peoples conversations and sometimes get asked my opinions.  During the day time its mostly old people in there, and today one came and asked me if I though jet fuel burned hot enough to melt steel.  Me and his two buddies ended up talking for a good while about the possibilities of conspiracy associated with 9/11. As i was at work, I could only give small bits of my opinion as it really wasn't my place to spill my guts on my views of that day. It was just amazing to hear all these senior citizens guys talk about how they are sure there is more to it then we were told.  For some reason I always assumed most old people just swallowed the pills the MSM and the government gave out.  It was pretty encouraging and uplifting to hear, so I figured i would share with yall.

       Well, of course not! It was covered up at the highest levels in one of the biggest criminal moves a president (LBJ) has EVER made. Sickening.

       The only people to tell the truth about it, two Israeli pilots, were jailed for 18 years...just because they were

       Even fewer know about the "Bromberg Massacre"--the event that took place from July to September 1940 in which 58,000 ethnic Germans who lived in the Danzig corridor were slaughtered by Jewish Polish partisans. It was the "real" reason for the invasion of Poland. Once the invasion was announced 5,800 Germans alone were killed that weekend.

       I was in a mostly white women's day spa / hair salon and you should hear how many older women think the govt is behind 9/11. The younger women were kind of listening real hard &amp; positively chiming in, but It is awesome to see it start to pour out.

       Don't confuse 911 truth with the government. It was carried out by a few traitors like Bush,  Cheney,  rumsfeld, and Tenet, using Mossad to carry it out. They didn't and couldn't trust the US government to do it. Too likely someone, or many someones would tell. Few Americans would participate in the murder of thousands of innocent Americans. That is why they used Mossad.

       A good pop-culture example of just such a Compartmentalized Black-op in an otherwise bad movie was the cyberattack from Live Free or Die Hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the hard parts of the multi-faceted attack were farmed out to hackers around the world who, for all they knew, were working on a programming puzzle, but they were just building the pieces without ever seeing or even being aware the bigger puzzle existed...and once those were finished and collected, they killed those hackers to erase the traces.

       I believe the only "contract" was a verbal one between Bush and Sharon. The NSA does electronic spying, not ops, so they weren't involved. Even the CIA had only a few people at the very top who knew.

       If you think W. sat in on the planning, I'm afraid you have a ways to go still in your research. If the attacks had not been planned from within (or at the very least in conjuction with) the NSA they would have intercepted the communications &amp; sounded the alarms. I assure you they are involved in much more than we are lead to believe. The fact of the matter is information control is their game. Intelligence gathering is just step one. I imagine it going something like this: Mossad - Instigation &amp; Financing; NSA - Planning &amp; Oversight; CIA - Operations

       Yes. Bush knew though he was incapable of planning himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       No. You forget that Americans have some loyalty. Why do you think we know the names Manning and Snowden. If more than a few people at the top had known they would have told.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in 2001 NSA was not the traitor organization it is today. It was focused out, not in. Still it does not do ops.

       For me, that is so strange to hear as I can't recall being around any group of people that were not mostly anti-gov or at least cynical of it.  This includes Feds and military, young and old, dems and reps.
      </p>

       One of my peeves with this sub is the idea that being anti-gov is unique rather than the vast majority (since America's foundation).   But perhaps just by the chance of the people I am around.

       As an old person let me advise you not to be surprised by old people who have accepted the truth. And once we do we remember so many other lies than younger people do. Also old people are usually retired so we don't need to keep our mouths shut to keep a job. We can become very radical.

       I totally agree with this.  I have thought that before and don't think many people really do.  I'm sure if you talked to some in Somalia, Syria, or even Iraq and Afghanistan, they would totally trade for a government does even the most shady of shit that us consp people accuse them of.  It would to them seem a hell of a lot better than the chaos that has filled those countries.

       You got my upvote but just wanted to say that I'm
       <em>
        old
       </em>
       by just about any standard you want to use and I spent 2002 to 2010 talking to anyone I could about how the official story of 9/11 was hogwash.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stopped when I realised hardly anyone was listening and the doc said my blood pressure was creeping into the danger zone. Since then my BP is 120/90 but I still drink a bit too much.

       Iran and Syria signed a mutual defense pact together in 2007, Israel and the US needs to castrate Syria before doing anything to Iran.

      <p>
       otherwise two million people with guns could be mobilized, and the only way to stop a two million man army is nukes, that would look very bad on TV. the world would likely impose immediate sanctions on Israel and the US.

       It's pretty much publicly accepted among the older generations that the official Kennedy assassination story is a crock of shit. Nobody will bat an eye or think you're nuts if you tell them you don't believe the government's official explanation.

       Took em long enough! Just kidding, it's great to see people question things like that, especially at an age where many people perceive you as close-minded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of sad in a way though. I remember September 11, 2001 very clearly and I can still recall hearing on that very day that there's no way jet fuel would melt steel, physically impossible. Some people were speculating that maybe there were bombs planted in the tower, but all talk of that was quickly drowned out. MSM is great at burying facts and not asking tough questions. It's clear who they serve.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm hopeful and excited for more leaks. It would be a great thing for people all over the world if we actually heard the truth. Like, game changing information. I can't help but grin just thinking about what might happen!

       My grandmother, probably like a lot of other grandmothers, is always saying, "You should or shouldn't do this or that ...I saw it on the news/read it in the paper."
       <em>
        However
       </em>
       , she's very wary of "official" reports/conclusions made on certain events; 9/11 is one of those events. She doesn't pretend to know any of the "why's," but she knows some of the "how's" just don't add up. Plus, this is all before she ever logged onto the Internet (she got an iPad a little over a year ago). 
I'm not trying to say my grandmother is a genius and independently put the pieces together or anything. However, I
       <em>
        am
       </em>
       saying that, yes, senior citizens know that if it sounds like a duck, but doesn't look like a duck —it

        might

       not be a duck.

       The ones I'm around sure do. Every time I go into the front room, Fox is on at super high volume, all of them glued to it as if it's life or death. Seeing this, while saddening, is understandable. Like I said, this is from my own experience, which is why it's refreshing to read OP's story.

       And for the record, jet fuel burns somewhere between 800-1200℉, while steel begins to melt at around 2500℉...

       Well it seems like a matter of science and not so much conspiracy. Either it can or it can't melt steel. So, can it or not?

       Well I think that the implications of said question of science that are conspiracy.  But from what I have read it cannot burn hot enough to melt steel.  Sadly I don't have any jet fuel I can light up and try myself.

       First of all, the towers fell from the bottom. In my opinion, jet fuel could not of burned all the way to the bottom and burn huge metal girders from one single airplane. There is simply not enough to make a skyscraper that big just fall straight down. Then happen again to the other building. Oh, lets not forget building number 7. WTF??

       So I was letting you know that your assumption of him not having a scientific background was completely incorrect.  I guess you're still not really understanding the point of this post was...The point was about how older generations in fact do question the government opposed to what I had assumed of them accepting whatever the government said.  It wasn't really a 9/11 post, rather just 9/11 is what facilitated the conversation, with the conversation itself being the point of the post, not so much the details of it. Thank you again though for making incorrect assumptions. Hope this helps you understand what I was posting about.

       Alright I guess you could read that sentence in that way, but to be totally honest that was a really poorly written and confusing. Grammatically that sentence has a dangling parameter that it isn't clear to which subject it applies  Also why you would give only one subject a parameter in a argument but none to the other is a very odd comparison.  Sort of like "Mexicans and Haitians in 8th grade don't like eggs."  Also while we are arguing semantics here you just said "You assume incorrectly as well"  The "as well" is you agreeing to the fact that you assumed incorrectly, however you wouldn't have assumed incorrectly if your original statement was intended as you now claim it to be. So unless your most recent statement has also been written in a very poor manner, you have completely nullified your statement of me assuming incorrectly, as you agree here in your latest statement to my assumption as it pertains to your original statement.

       I totally agree with this.  I have thought that before and don't think many people really do.  I'm sure if you talked to some in Somalia, Syria, or even Iraq and Afghanistan, they would totally trade for a government does even the most shady of shit that us consp people accuse them of.  It would to them seem a hell of a lot better than the chaos that has filled those countries.
