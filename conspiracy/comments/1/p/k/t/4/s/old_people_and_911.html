During the day time its mostly old people in there, and today one came and asked me if I though jet fuel burned hot enough to melt steel.  Me and his two buddies ended up talking for a good while about the possibilities of conspiracy associated with 9/11. As i was at work, I could only give small bits of my opinion as it really wasn&#39;t my place to spill my guts on my views of that day. It was just amazing to hear all these senior citizens guys talk about how they are sure there is more to it then we were told.  For some reason I always assumed most old people just swallowed the pills the MSM and the government gave out.  It was pretty encouraging and uplifting to hear, so I figured i would share with yall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, of course not! It was covered up at the highest levels in one of the biggest criminal moves a president (LBJ) has EVER made. Sickening.</p>

<p>The only people to tell the truth about it, two Israeli pilots, were jailed for 18 years...just because they were <em>silly</em> enough to think that Israel was the US&#39; ally. Hahaha, yeah RIGHT.</p>

<p>Even fewer know about the &quot;Bromberg Massacre&quot;--the event that took place from July to September 1940 in which 58,000 ethnic Germans who lived in the Danzig corridor were slaughtered by Jewish Polish partisans. It was the &quot;real&quot; reason for the invasion of Poland. Once the invasion was announced 5,800 Germans alone were killed that weekend. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t read about THAT one in school I&#39;d bet, hmmm?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t confuse 911 truth with the government. It was carried out by a few traitors like Bush,  Cheney,  rumsfeld, and Tenet, using Mossad to carry it out. They didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t trust the US government to do it. Too likely someone, or many someones would tell. Few Americans would participate in the murder of thousands of innocent Americans. That is why they used Mossad.</p>

<p>All the hard parts of the multi-faceted attack were farmed out to hackers around the world who, for all they knew, were working on a programming puzzle, but they were just building the pieces without ever seeing or even being aware the bigger puzzle existed...and once those were finished and collected, they killed those hackers to erase the traces. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the only &quot;contract&quot; was a verbal one between Bush and Sharon. The NSA does electronic spying, not ops, so they weren&#39;t involved. Even the CIA had only a few people at the very top who knew.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think W. sat in on the planning, I&#39;m afraid you have a ways to go still in your research. If the attacks had not been planned from within (or at the very least in conjuction with) the NSA they would have intercepted the communications &amp; sounded the alarms. I assure you they are involved in much more than we are lead to believe. The fact of the matter is information control is their game. Intelligence gathering is just step one. I imagine it going something like this: Mossad - Instigation &amp; Financing; NSA - Planning &amp; Oversight; CIA - Operations</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Bush knew though he was incapable of planning himself.</p>

<p>No. You forget that Americans have some loyalty. Why do you think we know the names Manning and Snowden. If more than a few people at the top had known they would have told.</p>

<p>And in 2001 NSA was not the traitor organization it is today. It was focused out, not in. Still it does not do ops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Took em long enough! Just kidding, it&#39;s great to see people question things like that, especially at an age where many people perceive you as close-minded.</p>

<p>Kind of sad in a way though. I remember September 11, 2001 very clearly and I can still recall hearing on that very day that there&#39;s no way jet fuel would melt steel, physically impossible. Some people were speculating that maybe there were bombs planted in the tower, but all talk of that was quickly drowned out. MSM is great at burying facts and not asking tough questions. It&#39;s clear who they serve.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hopeful and excited for more leaks. It would be a great thing for people all over the world if we actually heard the truth. Like, game changing information. I can&#39;t help but grin just thinking about what might happen!</p>

<p>thats what they did to the JFK affair, careful propaganda over decades to turn an obvious conspiracy into a lone gunman thing.</p>

<p>everybody believed LHO was not alone back then, now its cannon (at least to keep your job) to go along with the MSM version.</p>

<em>However</em>, she&#39;s very wary of &quot;official&quot; reports/conclusions made on certain events; 9/11 is one of those events. She doesn&#39;t pretend to know any of the &quot;why&#39;s,&quot; but she knows some of the &quot;how&#39;s&quot; just don&#39;t add up. Plus, this is all before she ever logged onto the Internet (she got an iPad a little over a year ago). 
I&#39;m not trying to say my grandmother is a genius and independently put the pieces together or anything. However, I <em>am</em> saying that, yes, senior citizens know that if it sounds like a duck, but doesn&#39;t look like a duck —it <em>might</em> not be a duck. </p>

I guess you&#39;re still not really understanding the point of this post was...The point was about how older generations in fact do question the government opposed to what I had assumed of them accepting whatever the government said.  It wasn&#39;t really a 9/11 post, rather just 9/11 is what facilitated the conversation, with the conversation itself being the point of the post, not so much the details of it.

    <div class="md"><p>Alright I guess you could read that sentence in that way, but to be totally honest that was a really poorly written and confusing. Grammatically that sentence has a dangling parameter that it isn&#39;t clear to which subject it applies  Also why you would give only one subject a parameter in a argument but none to the other is a very odd comparison.  Sort of like &quot;Mexicans and Haitians in 8th grade don&#39;t like eggs.&quot;  Also while we are arguing semantics here you just said &quot;You assume incorrectly as well&quot;  The &quot;as well&quot; is you agreeing to the fact that you assumed incorrectly, however you wouldn&#39;t have assumed incorrectly if your original statement was intended as you now claim it to be. So unless your most recent statement has also been written in a very poor manner, you have completely nullified your statement of me assuming incorrectly, as you agree here in your latest statement to my assumption as it pertains to your original statement.</p>
