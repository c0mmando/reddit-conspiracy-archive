       Dude, that happens all the time, and unless my town of 4,000 people is some secret government project, I'm pretty sure that that the contamination is legitimate.

       Usually, they just issue a boil order.  The water isn't usually completely off limits.  You are just supposed to boil the water before drinking it in order to kill the bacteria.

       It could have been a fluoride influx. This happened at least 3 times before, once at a school. I can link if you can't locate sources immediately. Basically, sometimes the system "malfunctions" (believe what you want, I am slightly suspicious of this) and your water will have 100-300 ppm fluoride.

       This happened to a town near me also, local paper reported of residents falling ill and some pets even died, not sure how much is required to kill though. Dosage was 3x the "recommended" limit.

       Got a source? I'm hoping this is in addition to the ones I already know about. It's a pretty solid case against fluoridation if enough "accidents" occur. After a while, healthy teeth isn't a good enough argument to fluoridate.

       Says it was actually 20 times over the limit at 30 mg/L instead of maximum safe level 1.5, persons also do not have civil rights to claim damages against public potable water supply

       Why is it odd that a municipal water company would do regular testing of its water, and if the test results show elevated levels of bacteria, that they would tell people not to drink it until the problem is addressed and test results return normal?

       Right, because shutting off everyone's water is exactly what TPTB need to get people to sit quietly and do as they're told...

       Oh, wait... no, that would be keeping status quo going while continuing to slowly rot their brains via lowering education standards, less nutritious food, and more drivel on TV.

       Kill a bunch of people? That's not going to go over well. It won't do TPTB any good.

       They're far better off to keep people fat, dumb, and lazy. Look at how much more wealth the wealthy have gained in the last 20-ish years while the mensch all got poorer, fatter, dumber, and lazier.

       Kill the ones they know will revolt against them, the ones that are awake, and the unbelievers of their will. The rest will become their pet goats to do their bidding. The ultimate slave race.

       Ask them, not me. I don't have the answers for why they do what they do or how they go about it. 
Why did the blow up three WTCs? Why did they go to war with other countries? Why do they spray chemicals in the air? Why do they dig large tunnels underground? Why do they use so much symbolism? Ask them or do some critical thinking on your own. Quit relying on other people to ask your futile questions to unless you're being genuinely concerned and want to be informed/add some constructive thoughts.

       Why? You're the one asserting that turning off the water is part of someone's grand plan. If you're making that assertion, then you should be able to back it up with rational thought, wouldn't you think?

       I did. I suggested that shutting off peoples' water would have a negative impact on the plans and goals of TPTB to increase their power-base and backed it up with a logical argument why I said that.
