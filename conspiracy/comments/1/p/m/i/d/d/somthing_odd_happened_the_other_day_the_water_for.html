<p>Why? You&#39;re the one asserting that turning off the water is part of someone&#39;s grand plan. If you&#39;re making that assertion, then you should be able to back it up with rational thought, wouldn&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>I did. I suggested that shutting off peoples&#39; water would have a negative impact on the plans and goals of TPTB to increase their power-base and backed it up with a logical argument why I said that.</p>
