    <div class="md"><p>Well the creation of this post is more of a results of seeing things around here over the last few weeks. I just referenced a recent post of mine that showed a fine example of what I was talking about going on. I should have pointed that out, my fault.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an architect, nor am I an engineer. But I know of plenty out there who could sit you down and explain to you step by step why the truther ideas are fundamentally and scientifically invalid as hypothesis.</p>

<p>I feel these things haven&#39;t warranted any further study because there has been nothing legitimate or tangible that has come forward in any means to warrant said further study.</p>

<p>With that being said you express yourself carefully and intelligently and I just thought someone should commend you for it. I&#39;m pretty broke but <a href="http://imgur.com/5AlhVg0">here you go</a>. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, I agree. However, this was an investigation into an event. It was not an experiment run on a scientific hypothesis on its way to becoming a theory. It was an investigation to get to the bottom of what happened during a major polarizing event. Very different things.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see further study too. But there were a few in the past where nothing new was found out, and truthers just declared it bunk because it had nothing new in it. I feel like that would just happen again if something new were done.</p>

<p>I understand I&#39;m making an assumption but again, a scientific hypothesis formulated from an idea that may become a theory if enough evidence is gathered is one thing, getting to the bottom of what happened in a major polarizing event is another thing. Only one of these things is continually experimented with in continuing study. The other is a &#39;closed book&#39; unless something comes along and the book needs to be opened again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was trying to point out the difference between a scientific theory and a terrorist attack, and why the scientific investigation and inquiry involved in both differs greatly. I think you&#39;d be hard pressed to find anyone that disagrees with what you said regarding the flow of money in most fields of science.</p>

<p>With that said, there has been a lot of investigation done into 9/11. A lot of additional scientific inquiry <em>did</em> happen as a result of conspiracy theories. There are whole channels dedicated to looking at truther ideas and explaining why they are fundamentally wrong. RKOwens on youtube comes to mind. Simply suggesting there &quot;are questions&quot; when no good questions can not be raised does not mean additional scientific investigation or any means of investigation is warranted.</p>

<p>They tend to re-open a cold case murder file if new evidence comes to light. The difference here of course, we know why 9/11 happened, we know what happened and how and we have no new enlightening evidence driving forward a new investigation.</p>

<p>With that being said, I think you&#39;d be hard pressed to find any single open minded person out there, myself included, who would be against &quot;re-investigating&quot; 9/11. The problem is you won&#39;t create the social drive needed to get such an investigation rolling unless you actually have something tangible. </p>

<p>In the spirt of not sounding generalized and to provide 1 quick example I hear of often: claims of nanothermite traces make you look ridiculous to anyone who works in the demolition industry and any layman who understands what thermite is, how it works and reacts and what its remnants after use consist of. This was the equivalent of saying &quot;we found flakes of rust and plastic in the debris. we must re-open the 9/11 investigation&quot;. What I mean by that is, that is what was actually &quot;found&quot;. Because the same thing happens to sort of attribute to some kinds of thermite (not nanothermite) residues (metal), the truthers labelled it a find. This is the kind of bad science that makes people look silly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F3xMOoPoYk">9/11 WTC-chips are not paint and produce a thermite reaction - Dr. James Millette is wrong</a> - <strong>includes video of thermitic reaction in alleged &quot;paint chips&quot;</strong> at about 13:00.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/13951747/Active-Thermitic-Material-Discovered-in-Dust-from-the-911-World-Trade-Center-Catastrophe">Harrit&#39;s paper</a></p>

<p>Note that, in spite of the claim that Millette reproduced Harrit&#39;s tests he in fact did not. As explained in the video, Harrit used chips that were cut and testing was done on the interior that was free of surface contaminates. Millette did not.</p>

<p>Now, don&#39;t worry about proving it me or anyone else here, just try to prove to yourself how Harrit&#39;s paper is &quot;bad science&quot; and Millette&#39;s is &quot;good&quot;. I&#39;m betting you can&#39;t do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem here, is you&#39;re going to run into my personal cognitive bias. We all have a cognitive bias that will point us in one direction or another. You&#39;re asking me to list what three arguments would best support a theory that I disagree with on a fundamental level. I feel like I could, if I tried, but my cognitive bias would be involved in my reasoning rational or otherwise. So my points would probably end up sounding unfair to a &quot;believer&quot;, for example.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t ask a fundamentalist creationist &quot;List us the three best arguments you have observed <em>in support</em> of the evolutionary theory&quot; because the answers I get I would likely consider half witted and immediately move towards attempting to construe his points as misconceptions and then attempt to invalidate his fundamental understanding of evolution.</p>

<p>I feel like you may be seeking to take this approach with me. The problem though, is unlike a fundamentalist creationist, I actually <em>have</em> some knowledge about what I&#39;m talking about. I profess that I am a layman however, not an engineer, architect or likewise. This isn&#39;t a challenge to debate.</p>

<p>Regarding conspiracy theories I &quot;believe&quot; in:
I do not fundamentally &quot;believe&quot; any conspiracy theory is factual. I find many of them very interesting and plausible, but I do not believe them to be factual due to lack of evidence in some cases, bad reasoning in others. But, if I were to list some things I personally think is wrong with the world today, that could possibly be the part of one conspiracy or another, I would list the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The illegality of drug use. The Simple fact that drug use is fundamentally considered a criminal issue instead of a medical issue in many western nations.</p></li>
<li><p>Coupled with the illegality of drug use, the imprisonment in America of more people per-capita than pretty much anywhere else in the world, all because of drug habits (one could argue a drug smuggler isn&#39;t there for a habit, but yes, he is there because he&#39;s filling the demand created by the habits of others).</p></li>
<li><p>The private prison &quot;system&quot; in the United States. Prison systems should be run by the government, <em>not</em> by private corporations taking government money and pocketing the difference (that&#39;s really a rough explanation of the money handling involved. There is also investment in private corporations, you can invest in a prison corporation).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I feel like these three points tie together and is a means of corruption in our society today that needs to be fixed. God dammit Obama fix it. :(</p>

<p>I used to think some other things like the very idea of money and stuff like that was fundamentally wrong and leading to our collapse until I started <em>learning</em> about economics and how shit works.</p>

<p>I used to consider myself a Zeitgeist follower at one point in my life as well. I moved away from that over a period of time. I used to be all about the &quot;resource based economy&quot; thing and how we need to get it going yesterday. But yeah that&#39;s not how the economy actually works. We might be able to achieve a resource based economy in a few hundred years <em>or</em> with a <em>global revolution</em> of some kind, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the biggest stretch you managed to make was a few soft imbalances in society.  Basically you didn&#39;t manage to note a single conspiracy. Then I really wonder what you are doing in this subreddit.. </p>

<p>Are you here to discuss?  What? Evidence?  </p>

<p>I asked you for three arguments of 9/11 to judge your knowledge, objectiveness, openness, and sincereness. Is there nothing you even find suspicious about 9/11?  And are you open to the idea that the conspiracy <em>may</em> be true, even though you don&#39;t see it proven?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with (a lot of) conspiracy ideas, fluoride, chem trails, haarp, anti vaccination, anti gmo is the fundamental lack of scientific understanding in the involved relevant fields to those ideas it takes in order to think they are anything factual. I really don&#39;t mean to lump a bunch of conspiracies together. I&#39;m not one of those people that just thinks &quot;they&#39;re all crazy&quot;. I find that shallow. What I&#39;m pointing out is this is an issue I have consistently run into. Thus far, no conspiracy theories have convinced me. But I am open minded. This is a sort of life journey I&#39;ve been meaning to make into a youtube series but have been rather complacent in how to approach it and do it properly without pissing off the wrong person so to speak. </p>

<p>You&#39;re setting yourself up for a tightly framed world. Factual is the truth, it has nothing to do with what is proven. What we can prove depends on human, personal and situational limitations. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>fundamental lack of scientific understanding in the involved relevant fields to those ideas it takes in order to think they are anything factual.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again you keep blaming <em>others</em> as an argument against theories. It has nothing to do with objective evaluation. In any open discussion you will have a distribution of IQ from ~70-150, with corresponding quality of arguments. That is <em>your</em> problem to handle, not a problem of the truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a sort of life journey I&#39;ve been meaning to make into a youtube series </p>

<p>What should this series be about, in a few words? </p>

<p>You seem very keen to discuss in broad and general terms. But to dig into hard 9/11 evidence you are quite reluctant?  Share your choice of three best supporting arguments..  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I don&#39;t start to question someone unless they&#39;re trying to spread an idea I think is irrational around to the general public, like with a radio show for example, or a youtube channel. If you&#39;re making claims and telling the general public to open their eyes, you should welcome rational thinking and requests for evidence and debate with open arms. Thats how the process works man.</p>

<p>Some people are legitimately just out there to make fun of you for thinking something is true. Some of us are legitimately looking for a debate on the subject. Some of us feel the debate is worth our time -- and if you can convince us, then you&#39;re onto something. Some of us are just dicks and don&#39;t feel the debate is worth the time so they resort to name calling.</p>

<p>It goes both ways. I&#39;ve been called a shill for pointing out why something was wrong with multiple sources. Felt pretty shitty. I know what you mean. But that&#39;s people and society man. Lots of idiots in that thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because rational thinkers come from a place of true objectivity and are able to entertain ideas without demanding proof, and are able to come to conclusions based on multiple sources of information, including ideas alone. They can entertain possibilities without voiding all options until proven otherwise. They are the ones who say &quot;these things are likely to exist but we cannot know for sure given eg1 eg2 eg3&quot;. A rational thinker is a very rare thing indeed.</p>

<p>Most self-proclaimed skeptics, however, maintain a null belief set, basically stating that nothing exists until proven to exist. Constricting that view further is that the level of proof is usually defined by a skeptic as whatever the mainstream scientific consensus is at that time. The typical skeptic is a very common and generally arrogant breed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. Thanks for all your help. This has forwarded me as a person. I never realized if I just questioned everything around me equally regardless of foundations in evidence that everything would make sense. Its all soo clear now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not very good with this sarcasm thing. I&#39;ll just respond with the whole idea of an &#39;official version&#39; of anything is purely an idea propped up by conspiracy theorists. There is no &quot;official version&quot; of evolution for example, unless you&#39;re a fundamentalist creationist maybe.</p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;re going to tack me with that label, I&#39;d appreciate some references. I also think if you were a little more understanding and approachable with me you&#39;d find someone open to debate, not someone being a naysayer just because nanana boo boo.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Actually, I equate fundamentalist creationism with most official versions of things questioned by &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; and the theory of evolution with a &#39;conspiracy theory&#39;. So, your example is completely backwards. In fact, a few years ago I coined the term &quot;9/11 fundamentalist&quot;. The Bible, Torah &amp; Quran are the equivalents of the 9/11 Commission Report and the final NIST report on WTC7. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t have to look far to find proof of my assertion. In your own words from another comment regarding 9/11 in this thread:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was <em>an investigation to get to the bottom of what happened</em> during a major polarizing event.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That simple, non-skeptical assumption colors every subsequent thought you have concerning 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Personally, in order to be convinced that a conspiracy is plausible, those putting forth the conspiracy have to demonstrate a few things:</p>

<p>1) Someone benefits from the conspiracy in a tangible way.</p>

<p>2) That someone has the financial means and authority to pull off the conspiracy.</p>

<p>3) The benefit of the conspiracy significantly outweighs the cost and effort required to implement it.</p>

<p>4) The benefit of the conspiracy significantly outweighs any similar benefit that could be obtained via more conventional, less risky means.</p>

<p>5) The perpetrators of the conspiracy have the means to secure the silence and complicity of all civilians that would have to be complicit to make the conspiracy work.</p>

<p>Some of the &quot;regular&quot; theories here meet the criteria. Many don&#39;t. It&#39;s fun to ask those questions in different ways and watch theorists who haven&#39;t thought through their theories very well stumble on them.</p>
