<p>In the context of a social paradigm that depends on unlimited resources, yes. </p>

<p>But if we choose a new paradigm, there&#39;s enough for everyone to live. Living doesn&#39;t mean a McMansion and a Ferrari, there&#39;s more to life than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree/disagree.. The system will eventually change. For the better, who knows. But nothing will happen until shit hits the fan and shit is very close to the fan..Americans (like me) are so far from unity in a traditional sense. We all care about celebrity gossip or main stream bullshit issues and ourselves.. Many americans have no hobbies or opinions for themselves anymore. I dont think we are going to have a revolution but probably some kind of civil war..i really wish i knew.. All i can say is our culture is destroyed, we as people lost all power, and everybody is manipulated into whatever shit the authority tells us to be concerned about - ie texting &amp; driving (which i can tell u isnt so bad since im doing it now lol), internet security, terroists, grand theft auto, bullying...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, there&#39;s a grace period right now. It&#39;s so you can stock up and beat all the people that are sitting and watching the show.</p>

<p>World politics has become a soap opera and millions are deeply invested in this telenovela. As you pointed out. </p>

<p>The saddest part is that we have Americanized (westernized; for you proper twats) a lot of the world. So many people that live outside the US, live our lifestyle too. </p>

<p>And our culture isn&#39;t destroyed. I mean, if you look at what&#39;s widely accepted culture, that&#39;s destroyed. </p>

<p>But, the artist/indy movement has actually sparked a clique of well informed, creatively cultured, and self-aware individuals.  However, there&#39;s a blurring line where this artsy clique has ruined culture. Labels take the art community concepts and twist them. Similar to what you&#39;ve seen in mainstream rock/hiphop with Miley Cyrus and others.</p>

<p>And seriously, societal rules are killing me. Generally, most people don&#39;t understand that it&#39;s all just an idea that only holds weight when people prescribe to the idea. If the majority actually were honest with eachother about what they desired, then you&#39;d have more efficiency. But, as you mentioned, people don&#39;t own their desires, so that&#39;s why I don&#39;t think a fix will ever occur. </p>

<p>Perhaps a new society, but that just goes into theoretics and personal beliefs about spirituality, etc.</p>

Never had any accidents or even a close call due to texting and I&#39;ve been doing it since I started getting comfortable with driving.</p>

<p>However, my mom looks at her phone while she&#39;s going around corners and shit. She&#39;s always worried about reading and answering her texts the second they come. That&#39;s scary and stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s immensely dangerous as it is. The number of car accidents per day are too damn high as it is, and you know what everyone thinks? &quot;Naah, it won&#39;t happen to me because I am an expert driver and I know what I am doing.&quot;</p>

<p>This kind of mindset is why we really need self-driving cars because it doesn&#39;t matter how safe you feel driving or how skilled you think you are, people like you have got into accidents for doing the same thing. So the whole... &quot;I will learn it when it happens to me&quot; is a silly notion. </p>

<p>Is your text more important than someone&#39;s life? I don&#39;t care about how likely you think it is to happen because if you ask people who have committed accidental manslaughter with their vehicles, they will most likely tell you the same thing about how they felt before they got into the accident. When you pick up your phone to text, you are accepting that the extra risk of killing someone is worth that text you want to make. And it is not up to you to make that call about the worth of someone else&#39;s life. </p>

<p>Driving a car is a freedom for those who are responsible. It can instantly turn into a weapon and so it should be driven with consideration of that fact. </p>

<p>There is no conspiracy against wearing seatbelts and no conspiracy about &quot;don&#39;t get distracted while you drive&quot; because those are well researched and found to be dangerous. To ignore all supporting science because &quot;you feel you have mastered this skill and aren&#39;t like others&quot; is not a sufficient reason to risk someone else&#39;s life over it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not what I said or meant.</p>

<p>I know how dangerous it can be but it isn&#39;t always. I don&#39;t text when its dangerous and it isn&#39;t always dangerous. If you&#39;re in town, yes. Behind someone, yep. Lots of oncoming traffic, yep. It&#39;s about judgement which obviously isn&#39;t too keen amongst many people and I&#39;m not saying mine is top notch because it isn&#39;t but I&#39;m not an idiot.</p>

<p>As long as it works, I&#39;m all for self-driving cars although that could come with a whole load of shit and I don&#39;t see it happening on a wide scale anytime at all in the near future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know you have ideas on how to properly do it but my claim is that people right before an accident, also claim those things about their ability to drive. You might be comfortable driving while texting on long rides and later incorporate it in dangerous situations too because you feel more comfortable with the idea and feel more in control with the concept of multi-tasking while driving. I just don&#39;t see what the benefit of such a risky is in this case. To kill boredom?</p>

<p>It&#39;s already happening. There are cars that have driven on their own and haven&#39;t got into any accidents. I am not sure what issues come with it, other than people not willing to give up it because they enjoy driving too much. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are going to see the collapse, but not the re-birth. Maybe the next generation (optimistically) will see new political paradigms, and learn to respect their fellow man. We won&#39;t be getting any of that. It&#39;s going to take quite some time. We&#39;re living in the midst of the collapse currently, and we are definitely approaching the main conflict plot-point of this global crappy-action-movie. However these sort of paradigm/conciousness shifts can not happen overnight.</p>

<p>I can see clearly now how the events of 9/11 we&#39;re a catalyst both for tyrannous elite to assume more control over the population, as well as contribute (with propaganda) to at least somewhat unite neighbour with neighbour against a &#39;common enemy&#39; (as it were).</p>

<p>Of course, the whole event involves huge coverups, inside men, propaganda, and lies, and is standard operating neo-con/pre-facist procedure. But what i want to know is what kind of &#39;event&#39; could possibly serve as a catalyst in the opposite direction?</p>

<p>What sort of major, world-shocking, &#39;event&#39; could possibly happen that would immediately contribute to the same sort of &#39;indoctrination&#39; and unity of the masses, but for the greater moral good of our species?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure there is one. It&#39;s easy to rally people around something to hate, but not so much around something to love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve given this idea a fair amount of thought in recent times. I believe we&#39;re at a point of no return. Given, if the people actually came together a turn around would be likely. However they won&#39;t I believe. As stated in previous comments there needs to be a shit hits the fan moment. Or to define this &quot;crash&quot; in a more specific manner would be for the current state of affairs to start affecting the majority of the population so that they may not continue in their present standard of living to a point in which it&#39;s unmanageable. Upon that happening there will be a rise in action. </p>

<p>In regards to a US civil war, the people vs. the gov&#39;t, I would look to the Midwest (plain states). Here is how I see a situation unfolding. So say we have some farmer who knows damn well how to use a gun and the police come to take him out. Here he has 1. home advantage. 2. a visible line of sight to intruders. 3. a stockpile of weapons and ammo he has accumulated through out the years. These things don&#39;t certify a victory. How ever they do present a case in which there would be heavy losses for intruders. So because of that typical raid options would be out of the question in typical military tactics hold true. Not gonna give up 5 soldiers for one farmer. With this, they would employ other tactics. Simplest, blow the guy up. However these tactics cannot be done quitely like a raid and thus would garner attention. And much like we see new fighters in middle eastern countries arising from one drone strike, we would see the same over here. So then at this point you have greater numbers of people rising up against the gov&#39;t. This then creates the problem for the gov&#39;t of killing its own citizens. You take this to the extreme (gov&#39;t vs all citizens and winning) then you have no more citizens to govern. And even if it doesnt approach said extreme then you have heavy losses by both sides and ultimately would still be unwise for the gov&#39;t. </p>

<p>Ultimately what this illustrates is that we the people have a much greater strength then we realize. That our gov&#39;t simply cannot wipe us out. Again look at how things have been going in the middle east. And because of these things, we ought to bear arms and be ready for the worst because we as a people can most definitely win. You give me 5 hunters in the woods versus a force unfamiliar with the territory and Ill take that any day. Again I don&#39;t believe the gov&#39;t would be able to engage in mass attacks of bombs because of reasons stated above. Thus fighting would be ground forces and hand to hand so to speak. What better way to illustrate the success of our position then looking at the beginning of our country? A small force of Americans taking out the British with the very same hand to hand options as we would have. </p>

<p>In conclusion, if civil war does come, then be prepared and know that the odds are with you.</p>
