       Just realize that. So, I think it's really cutesy and nice that people want to try and
       <em>
        stop corruption
       </em>
       . Or
       <em>
        fix
       </em>
       the system/
       <em>
        take back our govt
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       No. Wake up to reality, get prepared with supplies, and keep on spreading the word.
      </p>
      <p>
       This may seem pessimistic, but it's just cold reality. If you don't agree  then good for you. Be unprepared.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, seriously, try to cut down the whole "fix" this system bulshit. It's not happening through the broken system. Ever.

       The cold reality is that the we're quickly reaching the carrying capacity of the planet. The wealthy, who are privy to real data, know it and are looting the lower classes in preparation.

      <p>
       We're all on the Titanic, we just hit the iceberg, and there aren't enough lifeboats. The first class passengers, having curried favor via generous tips, are getting the real story from the captain and crew and spots in the lifeboats. The rest of the passengers are told that all is well and are being distracted on the lower decks with music and free booze.

       Except that we're not. There is enough room and enough food being made. There was a study published by a cal. university that worlds current food production could feed 11 billion people. The issje is that the food is mostly in "modern" nations and mostly wasted. You're just supporting Agenda 21 with this bullshit.

       I'm not sure what Agenda 21 or who funded that study, but unless the University of California is going to squat and shit us 90M bbls of oil daily, when the Saudis can no longer do so, I think that 11 billion people is a stretch.

       I understand your point.  But, are wildfires the analogy you wanted?

       Wildfires aren't the end, they are required for a new beginning.  They burn themselves out as they hit critical mass.

       So, yeah, shit's spreading all over but it can't sustain itself forever.  Perhaps the period of destruction is what you're referring to about prepping, that it will soon be timr to start anew whether one wants to or not?

       I'm not even religious and I just realized that Barack Obama is basically the anti-christ. So smooth with his words that everyone around the whole world wanted him to be the president, he got a Nobel Peace Prize even. But it's becoming obvious to anyone that wants to look that he's straight up deceptive and evil.

       Look at what this government does in other lands. There will be no revolution. One may start, but they would destroy, distort and derail it lightning quick. And if people weren't killing each other enough, they would do it and CNN would have yakking heads on standby to hush and cow the citizenry with stories of gore and treachery carried out by americans on americans.

       I agree/disagree.. The system will eventually change. For the better, who knows. But nothing will happen until shit hits the fan and shit is very close to the fan..Americans (like me) are so far from unity in a traditional sense. We all care about celebrity gossip or main stream bullshit issues and ourselves.. Many americans have no hobbies or opinions for themselves anymore. I dont think we are going to have a revolution but probably some kind of civil war..i really wish i knew.. All i can say is our culture is destroyed, we as people lost all power, and everybody is manipulated into whatever shit the authority tells us to be concerned about - ie texting &amp; driving (which i can tell u isnt so bad since im doing it now lol), internet security, terroists, grand theft auto, bullying...

       Yeah, there's a grace period right now. It's so you can stock up and beat all the people that are sitting and watching the show.
      </p>
      <p>
       World politics has become a soap opera and millions are deeply invested in this telenovela. As you pointed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The saddest part is that we have Americanized (westernized; for you proper twats) a lot of the world. So many people that live outside the US, live our lifestyle too.
      </p>
      <p>
       And our culture isn't destroyed. I mean, if you look at what's widely accepted culture, that's destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, the artist/indy movement has actually sparked a clique of well informed, creatively cultured, and self-aware individuals.  However, there's a blurring line where this artsy clique has ruined culture. Labels take the art community concepts and twist them. Similar to what you've seen in mainstream rock/hiphop with Miley Cyrus and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       And seriously, societal rules are killing me. Generally, most people don't understand that it's all just an idea that only holds weight when people prescribe to the idea. If the majority actually were honest with eachother about what they desired, then you'd have more efficiency. But, as you mentioned, people don't own their desires, so that's why I don't think a fix will ever occur.
      </p>

       Perhaps a new society, but that just goes into theoretics and personal beliefs about spirituality, etc.

       Its obviously smart not to text and drive, and not a ploy to take away any rights, but i took his slightly-immature point of meaning that there is huge emphasis on marketing campaigns for things like that example, when there is a lot worse going on both domestically and abroad.

       I dont think its a conspiracy i think its just handing more power to police to pull people over. Its Obviously dangerous if you irresponsible but you could also say the blasting music causes a vocal distraction. The point isnt if its dangerous the point is let us do what we want and be responsible For our own repercussions. Thats freedom to me.

       Also what about the driver that's entering an address onto a GPS.

       Its a cognitive, visual, and motor distraction. You take your hands off the wheel to hold the phone and text, take your eyes off the road to look at what you're typing, and you're thinking about what to say instead of focusing on what could happen. And I believe the average is 4 seconds for the average time you're not focused while texting.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr it is very distracting and the most common way to get into an accident.

       It depends on the situation and how conscientious you are. I do it all the time when I
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       it's safe like when there's nobody in front of me and I have a good stretch of straight road where I can sense the car changing direction yet even then I have my phone up near my face so I can still see the road. Never had any accidents or even a close call due to texting and I've been doing it since I started getting comfortable with driving.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, my mom looks at her phone while she's going around corners and shit. She's always worried about reading and answering her texts the second they come. That's scary and stupid.

       It's immensely dangerous as it is. The number of car accidents per day are too damn high as it is, and you know what everyone thinks? "Naah, it won't happen to me because I am an expert driver and I know what I am doing."
      </p>
      <p>
       This kind of mindset is why we really need self-driving cars because it doesn't matter how safe you feel driving or how skilled you think you are, people like you have got into accidents for doing the same thing. So the whole... "I will learn it when it happens to me" is a silly notion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is your text more important than someone's life? I don't care about how likely you think it is to happen because if you ask people who have committed accidental manslaughter with their vehicles, they will most likely tell you the same thing about how they felt before they got into the accident. When you pick up your phone to text, you are accepting that the extra risk of killing someone is worth that text you want to make. And it is not up to you to make that call about the worth of someone else's life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Driving a car is a freedom for those who are responsible. It can instantly turn into a weapon and so it should be driven with consideration of that fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no conspiracy against wearing seatbelts and no conspiracy about "don't get distracted while you drive" because those are well researched and found to be dangerous. To ignore all supporting science because "you feel you have mastered this skill and aren't like others" is not a sufficient reason to risk someone else's life over it.

       I know you have ideas on how to properly do it but my claim is that people right before an accident, also claim those things about their ability to drive. You might be comfortable driving while texting on long rides and later incorporate it in dangerous situations too because you feel more comfortable with the idea and feel more in control with the concept of multi-tasking while driving. I just don't see what the benefit of such a risky is in this case. To kill boredom?

      <p>
       It's already happening. There are cars that have driven on their own and haven't got into any accidents. I am not sure what issues come with it, other than people not willing to give up it because they enjoy driving too much.

       We are going to see the collapse, but not the re-birth. Maybe the next generation (optimistically) will see new political paradigms, and learn to respect their fellow man. We won't be getting any of that. It's going to take quite some time. We're living in the midst of the collapse currently, and we are definitely approaching the main conflict plot-point of this global crappy-action-movie. However these sort of paradigm/conciousness shifts can not happen overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see clearly now how the events of 9/11 we're a catalyst both for tyrannous elite to assume more control over the population, as well as contribute (with propaganda) to at least somewhat unite neighbour with neighbour against a 'common enemy' (as it were).
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the whole event involves huge coverups, inside men, propaganda, and lies, and is standard operating neo-con/pre-facist procedure. But what i want to know is what kind of 'event' could possibly serve as a catalyst in the opposite direction?
      </p>
      <p>
       What sort of major, world-shocking, 'event' could possibly happen that would immediately contribute to the same sort of 'indoctrination' and unity of the masses, but for the greater moral good of our species?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure there is one. It's easy to rally people around something to hate, but not so much around something to love.

       I've given this idea a fair amount of thought in recent times. I believe we're at a point of no return. Given, if the people actually came together a turn around would be likely. However they won't I believe. As stated in previous comments there needs to be a shit hits the fan moment. Or to define this "crash" in a more specific manner would be for the current state of affairs to start affecting the majority of the population so that they may not continue in their present standard of living to a point in which it's unmanageable. Upon that happening there will be a rise in action.
      </p>

       In regards to a US civil war, the people vs. the gov't, I would look to the Midwest (plain states). Here is how I see a situation unfolding. So say we have some farmer who knows damn well how to use a gun and the police come to take him out. Here he has 1. home advantage. 2. a visible line of sight to intruders. 3. a stockpile of weapons and ammo he has accumulated through out the years. These things don't certify a victory. How ever they do present a case in which there would be heavy losses for intruders. So because of that typical raid options would be out of the question in typical military tactics hold true. Not gonna give up 5 soldiers for one farmer. With this, they would employ other tactics. Simplest, blow the guy up. However these tactics cannot be done quitely like a raid and thus would garner attention. And much like we see new fighters in middle eastern countries arising from one drone strike, we would see the same over here. So then at this point you have greater numbers of people rising up against the gov't. This then creates the problem for the gov't of killing its own citizens. You take this to the extreme (gov't vs all citizens and winning) then you have no more citizens to govern. And even if it doesnt approach said extreme then you have heavy losses by both sides and ultimately would still be unwise for the gov't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately what this illustrates is that we the people have a much greater strength then we realize. That our gov't simply cannot wipe us out. Again look at how things have been going in the middle east. And because of these things, we ought to bear arms and be ready for the worst because we as a people can most definitely win. You give me 5 hunters in the woods versus a force unfamiliar with the territory and Ill take that any day. Again I don't believe the gov't would be able to engage in mass attacks of bombs because of reasons stated above. Thus fighting would be ground forces and hand to hand so to speak. What better way to illustrate the success of our position then looking at the beginning of our country? A small force of Americans taking out the British with the very same hand to hand options as we would have.
      </p>
      <p>
       In conclusion, if civil war does come, then be prepared and know that the odds are with you.

       I'm not saying that's likely to happen. But I am not from USA, and I wonder: Waht would happen in USA in case of a civil war, knowing that a great percentage of the population is heavily armed?

       Shit would go nuts, but the thing is that even if the population is armed, if there's no cohesive group that rebels, you end up like Syria but worse. The united states military is more powerful than any in history, they could shut down cells very easily.

       Once we burn it down guess who'se Phoenix will rise from the ashes?  Lemme give you a hint.  Take a look at the Hunger Games cover.  Because that's Agenda 21's endgame right there.

       No the only time it can't be fixed is when all of humanity ceases to exist. Otherwise it will b fixed through some sort of revolution. History always shows such. Whether it's fixed to what you, myself or others want to see is all relevant. It will be fixed however, but probably not what I want at least.
