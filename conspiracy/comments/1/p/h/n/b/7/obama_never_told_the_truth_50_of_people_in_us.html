       I've been seeing a lot of links lately acting almost
       <em>
        shocked
       </em>
       that Obama pulled a Bush. You serious? In 2007 I could've told you, in fact, I did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, everyone seems shocked about the cancer causes. They're everywhere. Reality is, thanks to Dow/Monsanto/America, cancer will be prevalent in 50% of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, your food is poison. All of it. If it's not a naturally occurring item, then it shouldn't be consumed on a regular basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, stop acting so shocked that you've been lied to and fucking realize that your life is being stolen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, mad downvotes will ensue. But i'm tired of playing your fucking game reddit. Fuck your shit. If I don't act like a complete fuck wad (overexplanation, providing unnecessary links, etc), then you're disregarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, fuck that. Fuck your tendencies to pester the shit out of people for not agreeing with your opinion and making them provide facts that are widely avaliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck all you lazy people that react to someone of higher knowledge with hostility instead of opening a tab and simply using your browser.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah. /rant over.

      <p>
       edit: Sorry for oversaying fuck.. :)

      <p>
       Edit 2: For those wondering why I won't provide links, ask yourself if you'd realize with a link anyway.

       Rule from their playbook:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        19   Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs. This is perhaps a variant of the “play dumb” rule. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by. In order to completely avoid discussing issues it may require you to categorically deny and be critical of media or books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are acceptable, or even deny that statements made by government or other authorities have any meaning or relevance.

       Well to be fair, at some point in time it is likely that truer words were spoken. Do you have a citation to back up your assertion?

       is from 2011 so how do we know the words spoken then are not truer than the words just spoken?

       The promise the forums have, is that an open, honest environment of self-improvement and critical skepticism is what is most important for development of understanding and consciousness. We need to have open, honest debate and argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that between all the shills and the idiots, very few people are interested in having a genuine debate. The shills purposefully argue insignificant or strawmen points (or simply engage in long-winded character assasinations). While the idiots won't listen to any sources that don't come from fox or cnn (even if they are well respected classical books like
       <em>
        The Republic
       </em>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember about 2 years ago Reddit had significantly more genuine conversation. Sure it was also a bit more childish back then (with all the rage memes and whatnot) but the dialogue in the comments where genuine. Over time the level of discourse has greatly declined, partly due to the influx of "mainstream" users, but I believe that the "mainstream" users also attracted many shills. Too many uninitiated are on reddit now, they can't risk illuminating millions of people.

       The farther the message goes and the more people it reaches, the bigger the threat to the status quo. I can only see this escalating even more as the site/sub grows. But as I've said before, it's not hard for the initiated to separate the genuinely curious from the shills.

       Up voted for your passion, though I believe your anger is misdirected. The enemy uses egotism to corrupt those who have eyes to see and ears to hear. Try not to feed your ego as insulting rants are on the same vibration level as the sheep who you're so mad at for being asleep. An attitude like that can actually be worse than staying asleep, as it lends credence to painting "conspiracy theorists" (the elect) as with a nasty color. Truth doesn't need to insult people. Truth speaks for itself and stands on its own. Love is the only way to break through to the hearts of your adversaries. Mean messages like that will only be used to destroy the reputations of us "good guys."

       Thank you for this reminder. I would be really worried about my ego, except I had an episode a year ago where my ego died. No joke. I've read you cant revive it if that happens. Idk, I hope I'm misinformed, but good advice either way.

       You may have diminished your ego or gotten rid of it for a time but I don't believe you can get rid of it entirely. At least not in this plain of existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ego is your sense of self, without it you would go around walking into walls and babbling to trees never bathing or doing anything of importance.

       I would disagree.  You can become free of the ego.  Check out the dude eckhart tolle, he went through a spontaneous permanent ego death experience and wrote many books about how to rid yourself of the ego.  You essentially just have to silence that narration that's constantly going on in your head, the little conversation your always having with yourself.

       Does that conversation with yourself not also include the "voice" you are hearing when you read things? So basically just inner monologue in its entirety needs to be silenced, correct?

       This is what acid did for me. Inner monologue entirely gone. I was so happy and saw existence as divinity. Fuck I wish I could be there all the time.

       Meditation does as well, and it's more...permanent I guess?  Just practice observing your bodily sensations, allow your mind to just absorb into the sensations (the feeling of your shirt against your skin, the air across your face, even sounds, smells etc).  And the key is to find the perfect balance between effort and non effort, rest your attention on the object of your meditation,  don't forcefully hold it there.  A good tip is if your eyebrows are becoming furrowed, your trying to hard.  It takes quite awhile to see significant results, but if you keep with it they will be there.

       In The Wooden Bowl the author describes meditation, at its essence, to be simply the ability to sit still and count your outbreaths 4 at a time without allowing any other thoughts to interrupt you. If a stray thought interrupts, you stop and start over. After a while you can bring your mind to nothingness with no lead up, and all the background noise fades away. Great book.

       There's a lot of different techniques.  I personally find mantra type meditation that uses verbalization and counting to not be that effective.  But that's just me, everybody responds differently, you just gotta find a technique that works for you.

       "Try to understand the ego. Analyze it, dissect it, watch it, observe it, from as many angles as possible. And don't be in a hurry to sacrifice it, otherwise the greatest egoist is born: the person who thinks he is humble, the person who thinks that he has no ego.

       I would disagree, having read his books and watched a lot of his stuff, I think I'm a pretty good judge of people.  Of any of the "spiritual" teachers out there, Alan watts, ram dass, osho, etc, I've always felt eckhart tolle was the most genuine.  But check him out for yourself, then decide.

       Yeah checked him out. Tolle is endorsed by Oprah and she is a media queen. Osho on the other hand was poisoned by the Reagan administration and Reagan was the devil.

       I don't think tolle is in it for the money, Oprah just liked his book and promoted it, and I think he just sees the spreading of his ideas as a good thing.  Osho on the other hand I do think was pretty attached to his wealth.  Do more research into both of them.  Osho had followers like giving him rolls Royce's and shit.  Tolle quit his job at a university after his whole "shift" happened and went willingly homeless for a few years before he wrote his book and it ended up selling a lot and making him money.

       I think you might be talking about your egoic needs... your ego is actually a good thing, but your egoic needs are approval, security and control... if you don't need to control anything, if you don't need anyone's approval and if you don't need security - then you are free of the ego, but you still have one. In fact, it is good to have a strong ego - it can be very helpful in life... the stronger the ego, the weaker its needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Breaking free of egoic needs is not easy. It can take many years of meditation. I think perhaps some people are incapable of it - although it is not necessarily their fault. Some people are lucky and seem to be relatively free of certain egoic needs. If you are free, then that is great - but if you think you are, then it might be your ego setting a trap... For instance, by telling people that you are free of your ego, you might just be trying to impress them (approval) and assert your dominance over your ego (control) - so you could be convincing yourself that you are free of your ego in order to satisfy an egoic need... and the worst thing is, you might be completely unaware that you still have these needs (this is called "denial" or "unconsciousness"). I'm not saying that this is what is happening with you, I'm just making the point that the ego is a pernicious li'l bastard and it knows just how to creep in under the radar and fool you in order to satisfy its needs. I hope this makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       But really, what I wanted to comment on was your post - which is great, but I was just thinking about cancer and all its causes, and it occurred to me that all these things that cause cancer don't really cause cancer... what really causes cancer is that our bodies are in horrible condition due to all the shit we do to them - so we are prone to stupid shit like cancer (which would never happen in a healthy body). But this leads into your point about all the food we are eating being shit. And I might not be completely correct because there are probably some things that will even give a healthy body cancer.

       Don't worry you definitely have your ego still. Unless you've totally fallen into a catatonic state, or become schizophrenic oblivious to your surroundings, rambling incoherently and shitting and pissing yourself, or are brain dead from an accident, or are in a perpetual transcendental meditative state, you still have your ego.

       I figured. It's just that, due to my experimentations with hallucinogens, I get this phenomenon of blending with my environment. As if, I don't exist, but Im floating with my environment and conforming to the energy in my surroundings. Naturally, I can turn it off with focus, but I can also turn it back on with meditating. Drugs, they need more research about this stuff.

       Can someone please show me credible evidence of this "poisoning" of our food? And the cancer argument for that matter concerning GMOs...  I mean actual studies. No opinion / radically and scientifically ignorant sites. I have yet to see an actual good argument that outweighs the positives in genetically modified crops.

       <p>
        in the 20 years since GMO crops first came on the market, studies have found that they have led to higher pesticide use, and no meaningful improvement in flavor, nutrition, yield or water requirements. Instead, what they've created are plants that are engineered to withstand massive dosing of toxic herbicides, and plants that function as living pesticide factories. Monsanto's Bt. corn, for example, is actually registered with the EPA as a pesticide.

       Rice is a staple in most impoverished nations even though it has low nutritional value. Because of this a sweedish scienticed produced a strain of GMO rice with vitamine A (IIRC) and prevented blindness and death in millions.

       Look I'll agree that GMOs like BT are troubiling because we don't know how it affects us. But to lump all GMOs together is detrimental to your argument. Instead of banning GMO's we should force companies to lable the strain, and inform the public about what each strain is, and let people make the choice.

       The only failure about golden rice was the anti-GMO ignorance. How is producing rice rich in vitamin A a threat? We have been genetically modifying plants for years. Tell me how inserting a gene in rice allowing it to convert into vitamin A is not helpful.

       The failure was it would take over 100 cups of rice a day to get enough Vitamin A to stop blindness. Ironically, there's already charities out there giving Vit A supplements preventing blindness.

       Not all kinds of GMOs have been proven to be bad. GMO just means it is genetically modified and the modifications themselves are different for different foods.
      </p>
      <p>
       GMO studies are few because not much interest is there for such a research because it is only going to prevent big corporations from making more profit. Either ways, I hope someone presents you with research for the ones we do know.

       One of the best posts on reddit period. This man speaks the truth! I was in the Military and on base 3 days on 1 day off, I was forced to eat garbage Fried foods/bread/ anything in a typical store. I got Diangosed with Chrons disease and medically discharged. guess what? I cured it in less than a week by going on a raw Food organic diet, I ate all greens veggies and meats, I've been doing it ever since and those days of shitting blood are long gone, I will eat processed food once a week? thats it, fuck eating poison and fuck what the doctors say that I have a incurable disease, fuck westernized medicine and fuck all those pills, most everyone we know is sick in some god damn fucking way. and I aint going back to eating typical americanized shit. I never felt so good and looked so ripped in my god damn life, Ladies love my abs (stopped eating shit carbs and abs poped out) I feel healthy as anyone too. life is good fuck the current westernized system, freedom of choice, fuck organic regulations, okay I am done.

       Problem is I feel like that constantly for the last five years and everyday I meet a stupid that does not grasp any of it. There is no hint that can help them even if I try different approaches. I might stop soon to be concern for the ones that never want to listen.

       I couldn't have put it better myself, stay positive. Project love, not anger, truth, not manipulated lies. Fight for what is right, present the truth and those ready for it will see it. 
I have.. And still do feel the same as you, sometimes angry, unhopeful, but I try to remind myself that feeling this way won't help me or anybody else. 
No matter what it may look like, keep fighting the good fight, truth will grow like wildfire, exponential growth, we just have to keep our heads up and fight the good fight.

        Well, fuck that. Fuck your tendencies to pester the shit out of people for not agreeing with your opinion and making them provide facts that are widely avaliable.

       This.   the amount of people who ask for a source that says exactly what you think is uncanny. are we just parrots or are we "critical thinkers"?
      </p>
      <p>
       i mean, i understand if someone makes a statement like "Well, obama DOES arm alqueda", which leads someone to ask  "source?". though lazy, this would still be ok in my book.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if i just typed out a paragraph long comment that hits on several points, names or events of things I have read and amassed over the years and then critically produce my own opinion based on the facts ive read, and you ask for a source expect a big fuck you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I, nor any other real reddit user (ones here for discussion and knowledge) are here to prove anything to anyone. Dont believe me? Have fun wallowing in your ignorance. Disagree? great, lets pass some links around and hopefully shift both our views closer to the truth.

       Because you seem to imply that they'll somehow not get cancer if they eat a healthier diet, when at most it just reduces their chances by a few percent (still a good thing)

       Two, that once you have cancer your diet is going to have some form of significant effect to the point of curing it, which is

       I'm vegan about 80% of the time. When I crave cheese, fish and sometimes fowl (chicken or turkey), I eat it. After you've abstained from all animal products for a period of time you can accurately judge what your body wants vs. what it's addicted to. I tell people, be a vegetarian but cheat if you feel like it. You'll be better off than the vast majority of people health wise and you'll have a minimum of suffering and annoyance. There's no sense in being draconian about it. Vegetarianism should be thought of as a general rule rather than a law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing to consider is food quality regardless of dietary practice.

       Hotpockets, processed dinners, anything HFCS-riddled, soda pop, pastries, or anything with aspertame. Fast-food is really good, too. Also, chuckwagons and lunchables from the gas station can hit the spot when in a pinch - don't forget the beetus juice to wash it down. Hehe.

       Aren't increased cancer rates also due to people living to advanced ages as well?  I'm not at all disagreeing with your thoughts on food and GMO's and fluoride and cell phones and wireless routers and any other source you want to attribute to this cancerous cancer, just throwing a little advocacy from the devil.

       People weren't dropping dead at 40. The increase you hear about is due to kids making it past childhood. A standard deviation would be far more useful in that statistic but it doesn't sound as impressive.

       Also, people back then just died of cancer. There was virtually nothing that could be done for them.
      </p>

       Cancer was practically a death sentence up until the 1970s. "The Big C".

       Wild claims? just good USA and health and this nation is terribly sick and no one knows why. Oh lets just all go on cancer walks and wait for the National Cancer association to tell us how to cure cancer because a multi billion dollar organization is worth trusting, oh and how about the FDA half those fucks are huge stock holders in monsonto. USA is a joke, The internet is freedom, Trust and love one another and find the turth online, there are people like me who has first hand experience curing diseases its just fucking hard getting people to listen when I am not a god damn doctor.

       One of your colleges posted a link supporting the fact that just below half of americans will eventually get cancer, but also discredits your claim that it's all caused by GMOs and Obama.

       President of National Cancer Program approximates 41% of Americans will get cancer (08').
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm thinking that the uncertainty has grown since 2011 and fuku. So it's probably something in the realm of 41% +/- 10%

       I'm still a little skeptical because I've never heard about that news outlet, so I went to the actual
       <a href="http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/pcp/annualReports/pcp08-09rpt/PCP_Report_08-09_508.pdf">
        report.

       and although it does say that 41% (don't fudge that number for sensationalism) americans will get cancer
       <em>
        in their lifes
       </em>
       it does also say that a large number of this is because of lifestyle changes, increased lifespan, and five other contributers other than the over use of pesticides.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to note that it mentioned 40 out of 1,400 chemicals allowed by the EPA are possible carsogenic. That is troubiling, so again thank you for sharring that.

       I fear that those numbers given to us by the alphabet regulators have been fugged. Interestingly, if you listen to
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7E9SUwlooE">
        this video
       </a>
       from IMF whistleblower Karen Hudes, you'll notice that the numbers arent always what they seem. If you don't have enough time, basically, she was a lawyer for the IMF bank that got fired for reporting that the numbers were being manipulated.

       The burden of proof is on you actually. You're the one that has a problem with the views presented. This isn't an official debate, it's a forum for discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I believe that cannabis oil can cure (and prevent) many types of ailments including cancer. Studies support this conclusion, more every day. My wife thinks that this view is overboard but I think it's perfectly rational. I think that cannabis oil has anti-stress and anti-inflammation effects that ameliorate cancer and other ailments. It's not up to me to prove it to her though. If she think it's bullshit, and she does, then it's up to her to pursue that if she is particularly concerned with the idea. I'm not concerned that she disbelieves me. I have done my own research and the onus was on me to do so, for myself.

       No. That is not how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof lies with someone who is making a claim, and is not upon anyone else to disprove. The inability to disprove a claim does not render that claim valid, nor give it any credence whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's a discussion wouldn't you want the proof that comes along with the claims presented in the OP?

       Again, this is not some official debate class where we're vying for a first prize trophy nor is it a court of law. It's a discussion forum. You may adhere to arbitrary debate rules but no one else has to.

       There's no way to definitively prove why almost half of us will probably get cancer. We're discussing why that could be so, conjecturing with some support of indirect evidence. You don't need a weatherman to know it's raining.

       Great post OP!
      </p>
      <p>
       Like another guy said..you're preaching to the choir my man. It's gone on too long and gathered life and kinetic energy on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate to say it...but I truly feel that America is
       <em>
        fucked
       </em>
       beyond any attempts to "fix" the issues. It's like what seeing the Roman Empire in its death throes must have looked like.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just hope that after (insert major, major disaster here) my 9-mo-old son will be able to be a helpful force for good in whatever America becomes. It's tough to imagine what will happen...but safe to say that it will probably involve nuclear blackmail, a detonation somewhere...or just all-out civil war.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not looking all that good.

At this point, I feel as if there's no convincing you, because you're too caught up in your own circlejerk. For all the skepticism this sub promotes, you're being very harsh, which is very ironic considering the alternative narrative this sub presents. What goes unrealized is that the narrative of current events is a two way street, meaning that for any claim to work for me, or anyone who appreciates a healthy dose of skepticism, needs a modicum of evidence that supports

        your
       </em>
       narrative or any other narrative.

       So in parting I say this to you: Go drop some acid or smoke a bowl and pretend like you've got a brain.

       Wow. Okay. As if drinking isn't as harmful? What's with the attacks? The point of my post was to avoid this exact type of conversation. Where's it getting anyone besides frazzled? This constant need to provide evidence for information that's readily been on this sub for the past 4 years is kinda redundant for me.

       I wasn't making a statement about smoking, I was making a statement about you. And as if you didn't know you were being condescending in your last reply, but the moment I retort it's all "whoa man calm down."

       Pfffff.

       Let me
       <em>
        cite
       </em>
       something for you: "But i'm tired of playing your fucking game reddit. Fuck your shit." As if this thread wasn't meant to stir people up. The bombastic language is clearly indicative of trying to rile people up. That's a basic 101 argument for you there.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm sorry that some people haven't visited this sub for four years. Some people need convincing. I know your type, the type that just sucks in all the information that they
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to hear and turning a blind eye to the rest. You're just like the people you critique for not disregarding what
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       have to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps there are people who do their best to be as unbiased as human nature permits, perhaps these people go to their sub, and perhaps when they see you dribble out these wild claims they tend not to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're doing is fear-mongering and it's not convincing me or anyone with a brain.

       Good. Cause science is majorly flawed. It's become a wasteland due to the current control paradigm. To be a "scientist" in the American, collegiate sense, is to practically ignore all aspects of spirituality and submit to epiphenomenalism and the other dogmas of the liberal doctorate society. So, thank you for your compliment.

       Wasn't this specified to industrialized cities? I honestly don't know. I vaguely remember this from class, but basically the meat was bad in the city. That's all I know about that. But, currently, arsenic, lead, and at times human feces are a common addictive in meats in the market. Not to mention hormones, steroids, live condition of the animals, etc.

       The way it's worded, it's a bit confusing what he's actually saying. Let's be objective here.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a verbatim quote from the OP:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        your food is poison. All of it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Bit of a wide range to say is poison. Doesn't specify anything except that anything not natural is bad. It's like a click bait news headline FFS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, he still has no idea what he's talking about. He's essentially blaming ALL GMO's with a blanket statement that says they're bad to be consumed on a regular basis. That's as fallacal as it gets.

       It's a rant that he is making and not necessarily a scientifically validated position that he is arguing.

       My personal view on this is that some GMO can be bad and otherwise, can be good. I am not asking to ban it but they should be labeled.

       I know exactly what he said, I think you're the one who's confused. Here, let me help you:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        your food is poison. All of it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Blanket statement on all of our food. Okay.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If it's not a naturally occurring item, then it shouldn't be consumed on a regular basis.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Refines it a bit, but still blanketing over many things. Hell, I can name off a few non-naturally occurring items that are 100% safe to be consumed on a regular basis (. Don't be pedantic now, it was word vomit and didn't actually bring any facts to the table. What is he even talking about? GMO's? Processed food in general? The biggest refinement he has there is, once again:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        your food is poison. All of it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        You're a fucking moron.
       </strong>
       He didn't think about what he was saying at all and contributed nothing by blanketing things and never really clarifying.

       I agree but it is just a rant. If OP had claimed that he believed those things and all those have supportive evidences then I would have argued against it. Not disagreeing with you but rather that OP did claim it was a rant.

       I'm vegan about 80% of the time. When I crave cheese, fish and sometimes fowl (chicken or turkey), I eat it. After you've abstained from all animal products for a period of time you can accurately judge what your body wants vs. what it's addicted to. I tell people, be a vegetarian but cheat if you feel like it. You'll be better off than the vast majority of people health wise and you'll have a minimum of suffering and annoyance. There's no sense in being draconian about it. Vegetarianism should be thought of as a general rule rather than a law.
      </p>

       Another thing to consider is food quality regardless of dietary practice.
