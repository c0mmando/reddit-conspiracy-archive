<p>Also, everyone seems shocked about the cancer causes. They&#39;re everywhere. Reality is, thanks to Dow/Monsanto/America, cancer will be prevalent in 50% of the population. </p>

<p>Lastly, your food is poison. All of it. If it&#39;s not a naturally occurring item, then it shouldn&#39;t be consumed on a regular basis. </p>

<p>All in all, stop acting so shocked that you&#39;ve been lied to and fucking realize that your life is being stolen. </p>

<p>Sure, mad downvotes will ensue. But i&#39;m tired of playing your fucking game reddit. Fuck your shit. If I don&#39;t act like a complete fuck wad (overexplanation, providing unnecessary links, etc), then you&#39;re disregarded.</p>

<p>Well, fuck that. Fuck your tendencies to pester the shit out of people for not agreeing with your opinion and making them provide facts that are widely avaliable. </p>

<p>Fuck all you lazy people that react to someone of higher knowledge with hostility instead of opening a tab and simply using your browser. </p>

<p>Yeah. /rant over. </p>

<p>edit: Sorry for oversaying fuck.. :)</p>

<p>Edit 2: For those wondering why I won&#39;t provide links, ask yourself if you&#39;d realize with a link anyway.</p>

<ul>
<li>19   Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs. This is perhaps a variant of the “play dumb” rule. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by. In order to completely avoid discussing issues it may require you to categorically deny and be critical of media or books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are acceptable, or even deny that statements made by government or other authorities have any meaning or relevance.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>The promise the forums have, is that an open, honest environment of self-improvement and critical skepticism is what is most important for development of understanding and consciousness. We need to have open, honest debate and argument. </p>

<p>The problem is that between all the shills and the idiots, very few people are interested in having a genuine debate. The shills purposefully argue insignificant or strawmen points (or simply engage in long-winded character assasinations). While the idiots won&#39;t listen to any sources that don&#39;t come from fox or cnn (even if they are well respected classical books like <em>The Republic</em>).</p>

<p>I remember about 2 years ago Reddit had significantly more genuine conversation. Sure it was also a bit more childish back then (with all the rage memes and whatnot) but the dialogue in the comments where genuine. Over time the level of discourse has greatly declined, partly due to the influx of &quot;mainstream&quot; users, but I believe that the &quot;mainstream&quot; users also attracted many shills. Too many uninitiated are on reddit now, they can&#39;t risk illuminating millions of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Up voted for your passion, though I believe your anger is misdirected. The enemy uses egotism to corrupt those who have eyes to see and ears to hear. Try not to feed your ego as insulting rants are on the same vibration level as the sheep who you&#39;re so mad at for being asleep. An attitude like that can actually be worse than staying asleep, as it lends credence to painting &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; (the elect) as with a nasty color. Truth doesn&#39;t need to insult people. Truth speaks for itself and stands on its own. Love is the only way to break through to the hearts of your adversaries. Mean messages like that will only be used to destroy the reputations of us &quot;good guys.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meditation does as well, and it&#39;s more...permanent I guess?  Just practice observing your bodily sensations, allow your mind to just absorb into the sensations (the feeling of your shirt against your skin, the air across your face, even sounds, smells etc).  And the key is to find the perfect balance between effort and non effort, rest your attention on the object of your meditation,  don&#39;t forcefully hold it there.  A good tip is if your eyebrows are becoming furrowed, your trying to hard.  It takes quite awhile to see significant results, but if you keep with it they will be there.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In The Wooden Bowl the author describes meditation, at its essence, to be simply the ability to sit still and count your outbreaths 4 at a time without allowing any other thoughts to interrupt you. If a stray thought interrupts, you stop and start over. After a while you can bring your mind to nothingness with no lead up, and all the background noise fades away. Great book.</p>

And don&#39;t be in a hurry to sacrifice it, otherwise the greatest egoist is born: the person who thinks he is humble, the person who thinks that he has no ego. &quot; Echkart Tolle may fall into this category. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you might be talking about your egoic needs... your ego is actually a good thing, but your egoic needs are approval, security and control... if you don&#39;t need to control anything, if you don&#39;t need anyone&#39;s approval and if you don&#39;t need security - then you are free of the ego, but you still have one. In fact, it is good to have a strong ego - it can be very helpful in life... the stronger the ego, the weaker its needs. </p>

<p>Breaking free of egoic needs is not easy. It can take many years of meditation. I think perhaps some people are incapable of it - although it is not necessarily their fault. Some people are lucky and seem to be relatively free of certain egoic needs. If you are free, then that is great - but if you think you are, then it might be your ego setting a trap... For instance, by telling people that you are free of your ego, you might just be trying to impress them (approval) and assert your dominance over your ego (control) - so you could be convincing yourself that you are free of your ego in order to satisfy an egoic need... and the worst thing is, you might be completely unaware that you still have these needs (this is called &quot;denial&quot; or &quot;unconsciousness&quot;). I&#39;m not saying that this is what is happening with you, I&#39;m just making the point that the ego is a pernicious li&#39;l bastard and it knows just how to creep in under the radar and fool you in order to satisfy its needs. I hope this makes sense. </p>

<p>But really, what I wanted to comment on was your post - which is great, but I was just thinking about cancer and all its causes, and it occurred to me that all these things that cause cancer don&#39;t really cause cancer... what really causes cancer is that our bodies are in horrible condition due to all the shit we do to them - so we are prone to stupid shit like cancer (which would never happen in a healthy body). But this leads into your point about all the food we are eating being shit. And I might not be completely correct because there are probably some things that will even give a healthy body cancer. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>in the 20 years since GMO crops first came on the market, studies have found that they have led to higher pesticide use, and no meaningful improvement in flavor, nutrition, yield or water requirements. Instead, what they&#39;ve created are plants that are engineered to withstand massive dosing of toxic herbicides, and plants that function as living pesticide factories. Monsanto&#39;s Bt. corn, for example, is actually registered with the EPA as a pesticide.</p>

<p>But i&#39;m tired of playing your fucking game reddit. Fuck your shit. If I don&#39;t act like a complete fuck wad (overexplanation, providing unnecessary links, etc), then you&#39;re disregarded.</p>

<p>Well, fuck that. Fuck your tendencies to pester the shit out of people for not agreeing with your opinion and making them provide facts that are widely avaliable.</p>

<p>Fuck all you lazy people that react to someone of higher knowledge with hostility instead of opening a tab and simply using your browser. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This.   the amount of people who ask for a source that says exactly what you think is uncanny. are we just parrots or are we &quot;critical thinkers&quot;?</p>

<p>i mean, i understand if someone makes a statement like &quot;Well, obama DOES arm alqueda&quot;, which leads someone to ask  &quot;source?&quot;. though lazy, this would still be ok in my book. </p>

<p>However, if i just typed out a paragraph long comment that hits on several points, names or events of things I have read and amassed over the years and then critically produce my own opinion based on the facts ive read, and you ask for a source expect a big fuck you. </p>

<p>I, nor any other real reddit user (ones here for discussion and knowledge) are here to prove anything to anyone. Dont believe me? Have fun wallowing in your ignorance. Disagree? great, lets pass some links around and hopefully shift both our views closer to the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m vegan about 80% of the time. When I crave cheese, fish and sometimes fowl (chicken or turkey), I eat it. After you&#39;ve abstained from all animal products for a period of time you can accurately judge what your body wants vs. what it&#39;s addicted to. I tell people, be a vegetarian but cheat if you feel like it. You&#39;ll be better off than the vast majority of people health wise and you&#39;ll have a minimum of suffering and annoyance. There&#39;s no sense in being draconian about it. Vegetarianism should be thought of as a general rule rather than a law.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still a little skeptical because I&#39;ve never heard about that news outlet, so I went to the actual <a href="http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/pcp/annualReports/pcp08-09rpt/PCP_Report_08-09_508.pdf">report.</a> and although it does say that 41% (don&#39;t fudge that number for sensationalism) americans will get cancer <em>in their lifes</em> it does also say that a large number of this is because of lifestyle changes, increased lifespan, and five other contributers other than the over use of pesticides.   </p>

<p>It is important to note that it mentioned 40 out of 1,400 chemicals allowed by the EPA are possible carsogenic. That is troubiling, so again thank you for sharring that.  </p>

<p>For example, I believe that cannabis oil can cure (and prevent) many types of ailments including cancer. Studies support this conclusion, more every day. My wife thinks that this view is overboard but I think it&#39;s perfectly rational. I think that cannabis oil has anti-stress and anti-inflammation effects that ameliorate cancer and other ailments. It&#39;s not up to me to prove it to her though. If she think it&#39;s bullshit, and she does, then it&#39;s up to her to pursue that if she is particularly concerned with the idea. I&#39;m not concerned that she disbelieves me. I have done my own research and the onus was on me to do so, for myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. That is not how it works.</p>

<p>The burden of proof lies with someone who is making a claim, and is not upon anyone else to disprove. The inability to disprove a claim does not render that claim valid, nor give it any credence whatsoever.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s a discussion wouldn&#39;t you want the proof that comes along with the claims presented in the OP?</p>

<p>Again, this is not some official debate class where we&#39;re vying for a first prize trophy nor is it a court of law. It&#39;s a discussion forum. You may adhere to arbitrary debate rules but no one else has to.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way to definitively prove why almost half of us will probably get cancer. We&#39;re discussing why that could be so, conjecturing with some support of indirect evidence. You don&#39;t need a weatherman to know it&#39;s raining.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post OP!</p>

<p>Like another guy said..you&#39;re preaching to the choir my man. It&#39;s gone on too long and gathered life and kinetic energy on its own. </p>

<p>I hate to say it...but I truly feel that America is <em>fucked</em> beyond any attempts to &quot;fix&quot; the issues. It&#39;s like what seeing the Roman Empire in its death throes must have looked like.</p>

<p>I just hope that after (insert major, major disaster here) my 9-mo-old son will be able to be a helpful force for good in whatever America becomes. It&#39;s tough to imagine what will happen...but safe to say that it will probably involve nuclear blackmail, a detonation somewhere...or just all-out civil war.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not looking all that good.</p>

<p>Says everyone you&#39;re trying to convince. 
At this point, I feel as if there&#39;s no convincing you, because you&#39;re too caught up in your own circlejerk. For all the skepticism this sub promotes, you&#39;re being very harsh, which is very ironic considering the alternative narrative this sub presents. What goes unrealized is that the narrative of current events is a two way street, meaning that for any claim to work for me, or anyone who appreciates a healthy dose of skepticism, needs a modicum of evidence that supports <em>your</em> narrative or any other narrative. </p>

<p>Pfffff.</p>

<p>Let me <em>cite</em> something for you: &quot;But i&#39;m tired of playing your fucking game reddit. Fuck your shit.&quot; As if this thread wasn&#39;t meant to stir people up. The bombastic language is clearly indicative of trying to rile people up. That&#39;s a basic 101 argument for you there.</p>

You&#39;re just like the people you critique for not disregarding what <em>you</em> have to say.</p>

<p>Perhaps there are people who do their best to be as unbiased as human nature permits, perhaps these people go to their sub, and perhaps when they see you dribble out these wild claims they tend not to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way it&#39;s worded, it&#39;s a bit confusing what he&#39;s actually saying. Let&#39;s be objective here. </p>

<p>This is a verbatim quote from the OP:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>your food is poison. All of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bit of a wide range to say is poison. Doesn&#39;t specify anything except that anything not natural is bad. It&#39;s like a click bait news headline FFS.</p>

<p>Regardless, he still has no idea what he&#39;s talking about. He&#39;s essentially blaming ALL GMO&#39;s with a blanket statement that says they&#39;re bad to be consumed on a regular basis. That&#39;s as fallacal as it gets.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a rant that he is making and not necessarily a scientifically validated position that he is arguing. </p>

<p>My personal view on this is that some GMO can be bad and otherwise, can be good. I am not asking to ban it but they should be labeled. </p>

<p>Blanket statement on all of our food. Okay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it&#39;s not a naturally occurring item, then it shouldn&#39;t be consumed on a regular basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Refines it a bit, but still blanketing over many things. Hell, I can name off a few non-naturally occurring items that are 100% safe to be consumed on a regular basis (. Don&#39;t be pedantic now, it was word vomit and didn&#39;t actually bring any facts to the table. What is he even talking about? GMO&#39;s? Processed food in general? The biggest refinement he has there is, once again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>your food is poison. All of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>You&#39;re a fucking moron.</strong> He didn&#39;t think about what he was saying at all and contributed nothing by blanketing things and never really clarifying. </p>

After you&#39;ve abstained from all animal products for a period of time you can accurately judge what your body wants vs. what it&#39;s addicted to. I tell people, be a vegetarian but cheat if you feel like it. You&#39;ll be better off than the vast majority of people health wise and you&#39;ll have a minimum of suffering and annoyance. There&#39;s no sense in being draconian about it. Vegetarianism should be thought of as a general rule rather than a law.</p>
