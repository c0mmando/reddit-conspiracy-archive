<p>What they want is for news stories pertaining to politics to up voted and discussed, not opinion pieces. Thats certainly an interesting angle for the sub to go in.

<p>The longest serving tenured mod can remove all other mods.</p>

<p>If third parties are involved it&#39;s via one of two mechanism.</p>

<p>Firstly, third aprties contact mods directly and payola occurds (reddit admins don&#39;t like this. Think Ian Chong, Saydrah, and Cinsere.)</p>

<p>Or, secondly, the admins have involement with third parties (both internal and external) who then issue marching orders to mods of the largest subs. Perhaps emplying them as contractors with NDA&#39;s involved?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having influence over what millions of people see, hear, and believe, is <em>always</em> profitable. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t see why the extremely wealthy would want to control such an influence, especially when dealing with a subject like politics? If you control the information available, you control the conversation. Add control of the upvotes (what the supposed majority believes to be true), and voila; you are literally controlling, to a degree, the mind of those who read it. There&#39;s a reason the same power users from digg are now power users on reddit. There&#39;s a reason 6 or so corporations control every TV network, film studio, record company, radio show, and billboard across the nation. </p>

<p>They&#39;re literally controlling your mind. Only when you see that everything, and I mean everything you see on TV, hear on the radio, read on msm, and even MANY conspiracy related sites are there for the sole purpose of manipulating your thoughts, will these things have less of an effect on your thought process. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One point. Stiffle Dissent. we watched <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> go from lame duck to being filled with constant post about government corruption, crimes, lies and greed. </p>

<p>Why do you think they really moved <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> off the front page links and buried all the political subs deep in the side bar links? Politics was getting huge anti-american government traffic and feeding subs like this one with lots of traffic. </p>

<p>Ever since the move and side links change this sub alone has definitely showed a decrease in post by those recently awakened by the constant bombardment of american corruption / police state post on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. </p>

<p>Reddit is not a free media or free forum. The NSA/CIA has its hands all over Reddit. Hell, They probably know what you type before you hit enter. </p>

<p>Anyone remember when the Reddit co-founder (month or three ago) was exposed for meeting with the FEDS and then blew it off as a &quot;casual friendly encounter&quot; like he just fucking sat down and had tea and biscuits with the NSA while talking about football.</p>

<p>Thats such bullshit. Reddit sold out. Say the wrong thing here and you are on a permanent list.  Dont think for a second that the FEDS dont have a list of online activist - Their Addresses - Their Phone Numbers - GPS Locations - Contacts - Bank Accounts stored away in some database. </p>

<p>If anything the ever constant &quot;suicides&quot; of activist, scientist and truthers should be a constant reminder of the real danger that we live in. </p>

<p>The Federal Government will go to any means necessary to silent and censor information that someone deems a threat to National Security - A code word for cover-up. </p>

<p>Stay anonymous , stay hidden and stay irrelevant or you will find yourself face down in a ditch only after you watch your entire family be murdered by professional tax-funded hitmen. </p>

<p>The Federal Government has chosen its enemy - Its We The People. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t think for a second anyone reading this isn&#39;t already on that list. If you change your behavior because of the knowledge that they are watching, they win. </p>

<p>Moreover, the fact that &quot;everyone knows&quot; they are watching means that if they want you, they have you. They can fabricate charges and it&#39;s your word against the entire shadow government and it&#39;s information apparatus, who&#39;s going to believe you? </p>

<p>PIMA and VA knew what was going down.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ptsny/dear_internet_vigilantes_and_lynch_mobs/c3sc3dq">VA talks about it here</a> in relation to <a href="http://imgur.com/a/S08Jt">this</a> string of comments turning into this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ps8j6/here_is_the_police_report_with_the_details_of/">barren wasteland</a>.</p>

<p>PIMA went after the NY inner circle (<a href="http://imgur.com/a/fIo2Z">the &quot;big time&quot; mods who know Alexis IRL</a>) and they used Davack to bring him on as a mod of creepshots to quell CP raids and then let SA eat him alive with the predditors tumblr.</p>

<p>In essence, if you are a power mod who turns on the inside cabals of reddit then you will be destroyed by having your personal info spread on the site until news articles are written about you and you lose your job and recieve death threats. </p>

<p>Project Panda was a goon raid job wherein CP was raided to subreddits set up by goons (r/preteengirls as an example) for weeks, and then emails went out to media outlets about all of the &quot;CP on reddit&quot;. </p>

<p>When the PR shit storm hit, both VA and PIMA were thrown to the dogs; the &quot;problematic free speech subs&quot; were closed, and reddit inc moved on. but not before some of us older folks caught wind of the bullshit and backed it all up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The flooding of CP worked too. My frontpage always had creepy posts of teenage girls, and if I commented saying anything about how fucked up it was that there were so many upvotes, I got completely decimated by several different posters and the downvotes were PLENTY. It got to the point where I was 100% in favour of censorship because the CP was giving reddit a terrible reputation and seeing those links on the FRONT PAGE made me feel like a creep by proxy.</p>

<p>If that was a calculated strategy to censor reddit, it was very intelligent and deceptive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> was hijacked long ago by pretty lousy people. They block all sites they don&#39;t agree with as a collective mindhive. Which really is only a few circle jerking posters with privileges. </p>

<p>It&#39;s ironic how they mimic political parties and get people in to positions of authority to control things. I&#39;m sure there are paid for trolls working here like other SM sites.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/propaganda/">http://www.reddit.com/r/propaganda/</a></p>

<p>etc...</p>

<p>Probably the best thing to do is start another section called <a href="/r/polidics">/r/polidics</a> or the like and contribute there. Just do what they are doing to take over and reverse it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how they can sleep with themselves. I couldn&#39;t. </p>

<p>You know why they veil everything they do? Because they know exactly what would happen if their malfeasance was exposed. They know no one would use the platform. So they trick users, lie, and ban anyone who is in the know that opposes their agenda. Ever wonder why the admins allowed the predditors tumblr to spread (Chen sourced his hit piece from the predditors tumblr) even though mods informed them of it&#39;s existence 18 hours before Chen got his grubby hands on the info???</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ptsny/dear_internet_vigilantes_and_lynch_mobs/c3sc3dq">VA knew and they threw him to the dogs to save face for corporate, using SA as a stupid plaything in the process.</a>.</p>

<p>No one is saying the reddit admins who use the metaspehre to monetize are not intelligent or hard working, I&#39;m just saying they&#39;re fucking evil.</p>

<p>It&#39;s disgusting.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t think for a second anyone reading this isn&#39;t already on that list. If you change your behavior because of the knowledge that they are watching, they win. </p>

<p>Moreover, the fact that &quot;everyone knows&quot; they are watching means that if they want you, they have you. They can fabricate charges and it&#39;s your word against the entire shadow government and it&#39;s information apparatus, who&#39;s going to believe you? </p>
