       Actually,
       <a href="/r/politics">

       removing partisan sources from all sides is not a "conspiracy."
      </p>
      <p>
       What they want is for news stories pertaining to politics to up voted and discussed, not opinion pieces. Thats certainly an interesting angle for the sub to go in. Without Huffington Post and Mother Jones to make up everyone's minds for them,
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       might just explode.

       Alright, I was just trying to avoid anything from escalating that could evolve into the conspiracy vs conspiratard brigade level. I understand that they are seeing all of this but even so letting them know by a message will do no harm and with some luck it will even help.

       I am confused as to who is telling them not to answer. They claim that if they do they will be "booted out" as mods, so does that mean it is the Reddit administration? And surely the Reddit staff have no reason to censor anything unless they were being directed by a 3rd party. So who is the 3rd party?

       Reddit admins can order mods to do things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The longest serving tenured mod can remove all other mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       If third parties are involved it's via one of two mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, third aprties contact mods directly and payola occurds (reddit admins don't like this. Think Ian Chong, Saydrah, and Cinsere.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, secondly, the admins have involement with third parties (both internal and external) who then issue marching orders to mods of the largest subs. Perhaps emplying them as contractors with NDA's involved?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows.

       It's quite profitable, it's just that if the community learned of how profitable and why, it'd be toast, like digg, in under a week.

       Having influence over what millions of people see, hear, and believe, is
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       profitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't see why the extremely wealthy would want to control such an influence, especially when dealing with a subject like politics? If you control the information available, you control the conversation. Add control of the upvotes (what the supposed majority believes to be true), and voila; you are literally controlling, to a degree, the mind of those who read it. There's a reason the same power users from digg are now power users on reddit. There's a reason 6 or so corporations control every TV network, film studio, record company, radio show, and billboard across the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're literally controlling your mind. Only when you see that everything, and I mean everything you see on TV, hear on the radio, read on msm, and even MANY conspiracy related sites are there for the sole purpose of manipulating your thoughts, will these things have less of an effect on your thought process.

       He's talking out of his ass: "Having influence over what millions of people see, hear, and believe, is always profitable." No, it's not. Lots of popular, influential media have lost money and gone out of business. He absolutely has no idea what he's talking about.

       All "money" is nothing but an idea. Its intrinsic value is nill, and when "you" and your friends can create it from thin air it is just a tool. Why is reddit valued at such a high dollar amount, when so unprofitable? Billions even!
      </p>

       It's to keep the influence reddit and other media has on the mind in the hands of those who control the money.

       If the domains are banned for manipulating things then the admins don't clarify how the manipulation happens, either through not revealing how sites can game reddit, or through embarrasment. maybe that is what the mod is referring to.

       go from lame duck to being filled with constant post about government corruption, crimes, lies and greed.

       <a href="/r/politics">

       off the front page links and buried all the political subs deep in the side bar links? Politics was getting huge anti-american government traffic and feeding subs like this one with lots of traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since the move and side links change this sub alone has definitely showed a decrease in post by those recently awakened by the constant bombardment of american corruption / police state post on

       Anyone remember when the Reddit co-founder (month or three ago) was exposed for meeting with the FEDS and then blew it off as a "casual friendly encounter" like he just fucking sat down and had tea and biscuits with the NSA while talking about football.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats such bullshit. Reddit sold out. Say the wrong thing here and you are on a permanent list.  Dont think for a second that the FEDS dont have a list of online activist - Their Addresses - Their Phone Numbers - GPS Locations - Contacts - Bank Accounts stored away in some database.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything the ever constant "suicides" of activist, scientist and truthers should be a constant reminder of the real danger that we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Federal Government will go to any means necessary to silent and censor information that someone deems a threat to National Security - A code word for cover-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay anonymous , stay hidden and stay irrelevant or you will find yourself face down in a ditch only after you watch your entire family be murdered by professional tax-funded hitmen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Federal Government has chosen its enemy - Its We The People.

       Don't think for a second anyone reading this isn't already on that list. If you change your behavior because of the knowledge that they are watching, they win.

      <p>
       Moreover, the fact that "everyone knows" they are watching means that if they want you, they have you. They can fabricate charges and it's your word against the entire shadow government and it's information apparatus, who's going to believe you?

       The last time people tried to oust the reddit corruption they got fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       PIMA and VA knew what was going down.
      </p>

       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ptsny/dear_internet_vigilantes_and_lynch_mobs/c3sc3dq">
        VA talks about it here
       </a>
       in relation to
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/S08Jt">
        this
       </a>
       string of comments turning into this
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ps8j6/here_is_the_police_report_with_the_details_of/">
        barren wasteland
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       PIMA went after the NY inner circle (
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/fIo2Z">
        the "big time" mods who know Alexis IRL
       </a>
       ) and they used Davack to bring him on as a mod of creepshots to quell CP raids and then let SA eat him alive with the predditors tumblr.
      </p>
      <p>
       In essence, if you are a power mod who turns on the inside cabals of reddit then you will be destroyed by having your personal info spread on the site until news articles are written about you and you lose your job and recieve death threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Project Panda was a goon raid job wherein CP was raided to subreddits set up by goons (r/preteengirls as an example) for weeks, and then emails went out to media outlets about all of the "CP on reddit".
      </p>
      <p>
       When the PR shit storm hit, both VA and PIMA were thrown to the dogs; the "problematic free speech subs" were closed, and reddit inc moved on. but not before some of us older folks caught wind of the bullshit and backed it all up.

       The flooding of CP worked too. My frontpage always had creepy posts of teenage girls, and if I commented saying anything about how fucked up it was that there were so many upvotes, I got completely decimated by several different posters and the downvotes were PLENTY. It got to the point where I was 100% in favour of censorship because the CP was giving reddit a terrible reputation and seeing those links on the FRONT PAGE made me feel like a creep by proxy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that was a calculated strategy to censor reddit, it was very intelligent and deceptive.

       Politics is over run with far left posts constantly.  I tend to be a socially liberal guy.  but my god there were no counter points.  I feel less of the blog spam is a good thing, because you can simply make a self post and put it there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that everyday on the front page it was a daily show clip and crooksandliars.com (which also had the daily show clips).  I am waiting to see how this plays out, cause
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       just became an echo chamber where people only read headlines and didn't view the links.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the Daily kos would be front page, but the article it links to would not move up.  that always ticked me off.

       I went from FARK to Alternet to Reddit. I feel Fark was more damaged by the banner ads and subdivisions than any agenda. But damaged it was. The loss of Boobies hurt it too. Those of us in a site during its' "wild west" period are frustrated by the taming that follows...much as we might be frustrated by how our country has gotten all milquetoast and submissive in our lifetimes.

       It kills me how some veiled actors are literally grinding the free flow of information to a halt.

       Multiple perspectives on a given issue provide the tools necessary to escape the perils of media bias. Reddit and sites like it must be protected from those who seek to contort the medium for their own ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       To protect aggregates is to always expose this type of censorship when it occurs. Force those who forsake their sworn duty in the furtherance of personal satisfaction to answer for their sordid deeds in the most public of forums.

       was hijacked long ago by pretty lousy people. They block all sites they don't agree with as a collective mindhive. Which really is only a few circle jerking posters with privileges.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ironic how they mimic political parties and get people in to positions of authority to control things. I'm sure there are paid for trolls working here like other SM sites.

       You know why they veil everything they do? Because they know exactly what would happen if their malfeasance was exposed. They know no one would use the platform. So they trick users, lie, and ban anyone who is in the know that opposes their agenda. Ever wonder why the admins allowed the predditors tumblr to spread (Chen sourced his hit piece from the predditors tumblr) even though mods informed them of it's existence 18 hours before Chen got his grubby hands on the info???

       EDIT: Also, I find it interesting that a site which used to claim the users drove the community now vests authority with anonymous cabals with no community check on their decisionmaking.

       Yup. When those whom a country is at war with is kept secret from it's citizens, that country is at war with those citizens.

        Say the wrong thing here and you are on a permanent list. Dont think for a second that the FEDS dont have a list of online activist - Their Addresses - Their Phone Numbers - GPS Locations - Contacts - Bank Accounts stored away in some database.

       Don't think for a second anyone reading this isn't already on that list. If you change your behavior because of the knowledge that they are watching, they win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, the fact that "everyone knows" they are watching means that if they want you, they have you. They can fabricate charges and it's your word against the entire shadow government and it's information apparatus, who's going to believe you?

       See, the point is to

       We're all going to die eventually. I'd rather stand for truth and die a little early than live in silence.

       People need to start thinking about future generations again. That used to be a thing, people used to work hard and sacrifice a lot for future generations.
