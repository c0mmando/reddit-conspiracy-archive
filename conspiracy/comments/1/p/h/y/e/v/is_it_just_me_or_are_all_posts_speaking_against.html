    <div class="md"><p>If you drive a car, you need insurance or you&#39;re fined for not having it because in the event of an accident, someone needs to pay those bills.

<p>What happens when you have no insurance, hit the emergency room and rack up a huge bill? Who gets stuck with that cost? If you declare bankruptcy or flat out refuse to pay it, it&#39;s not you, it&#39;s the taxpayers.</p>

<p>So, I repeat, unless you&#39;re a supermiraclehuman and will never need health care, in the event that you do, I&#39;d rather not pay your bills. Suck it up, get insurance, stay healthy and away from bankruptcy. Everybody wins (except people who hate Obamacare because, Obama).</p>

<p>You need car insurance if you get into an accident, which I agree, is optional as you can take a bus, walk, hitch rides, etc.</p>

<p>As a human being <em>you will get sick and use your health insurance at some point in your life.</em> It is inevitable. It will happen and you cannot avoid it. So no, it&#39;s not invalid, it only furthers my point.</p>

Why am I being forced to be $350 + in the hole every month now, because of someone else?</p>

<p>I, my priorities, myself, come before anyone else. Why do i need to endanger myself financially for the sake of others?
It is NOT IN MY PERSONAL BEST INTEREST TO PAY INTO THIS.

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, once you as a people are paying for everyone&#39;s health care, then you go full retard with telling them how to live.  I can&#39;t get on board with that.</p>

<p>Naturally what will follow from a single payer system will be complete bans on smoking, drinking (didn&#39;t we try that?), coffee, etc, etc.  Because after all, it will be good for the people since we&#39;re now paying to keep them healthy.</p>

<p>Just something else to think about... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a HUGE thing about Obamacare that no one is mentioning at all- and it&#39;s very scary to me. The fact that the &#39;navigators&#39;- the people setting up your obamacare and answering the phones, have ALL of your personal information and also are supposed to ask you for it (social sec #, etc) yet, unlike licensed insurance agents, they have had NO background checks NOR need be licensed~ any ex convict could be hired, any weirdo or scam artist will have my social security number, and won&#39;t they have my medical information too?</p>

<p>The medical information thing also really scares me - does not this obamacare thing open up a whole new can of worms with our personal information getting out? This is what brought up the point with me: <a href="http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2013/10/01/aca-navigators-should-be-required-to-get-background-checks/">http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2013/10/01/aca-navigators-should-be-required-to-get-background-checks/</a></p>

<p>I worked for the U.S. Census Bureau in 2010 as an enumerator. I had to pass an fbi background check because they didnt want exconvicts to handle personally identifiable information. now, i agree, we should allow exconvicts jobs. But to handle such PII as social security numbers, etc, i dont think so. </p>

Wellpoint is part of the NWO screw you in the ass team, they are the ones that benefit from this, not the people.</p>

<p>A real leader would remove the insurance industry in it&#39;s entirety and used apportioned taxation to create a doctors liability insurance fund that would be used by doctors to defend themselves in liability cases. The fund would cover the payment of losses to liability.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what the insurance industry is, a scam built on fear...fear that the doc will cut off the wrong leg, and heck maybe he did, so you sue, you sue and win, get your judgment and now the doc has huge liability, which gets passed on to you which creates the entire scam...ITS ABOUT FEAR...and the ZIONIST CENTRAL BANKERS that control the manipulation of your mind that are the reason we have an insurance scam ,and not health care</p>
