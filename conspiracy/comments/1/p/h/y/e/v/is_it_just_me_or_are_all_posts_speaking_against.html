       I don't see many posts talking about the negatives of Obamacare but only the positives. I want an unbiased understanding of it but it seems impossible when all the posts getting upvoted are pro-Obamacare.

       Have an upvote while I get a downvote because I say Obamacare is horrendous.
The sheep will learn one day, or maybe they won't because they are so complacent.
I'm surprised there hasn't been uprising yet with all of the news of dropped plans, insurance hikes, massive deductibles, fines for not being able to afford the affordable care act, etc etc.

       How is it "horrendous" when it hasn't been fully implemented yet? It may end up being that in the end, but isn't it a bit premature to call it a failure? (disregarding the website rollout hiccups)

       If you drive a car, you need insurance or you're fined for not having it because in the event of an accident, someone needs to pay those bills. Unless you're a super miracle human who has never nor will ever need health care in your life, health insurance should be treated no differently. Eventually you're going to get sick.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens when you have no insurance, hit the emergency room and rack up a huge bill? Who gets stuck with that cost? If you declare bankruptcy or flat out refuse to pay it, it's not you, it's the taxpayers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I repeat, unless you're a supermiraclehuman and will never need health care, in the event that you do, I'd rather not pay your bills. Suck it up, get insurance, stay healthy and away from bankruptcy. Everybody wins (except people who hate Obamacare because, Obama).

       The car insurance argument is invalid, I can choose to not drive and seek alternatives. Hell, in some cases you can get tax breaks for NOT driving.

       You need car insurance if you get into an accident, which I agree, is optional as you can take a bus, walk, hitch rides, etc.

       As a human being
       <em>
        you will get sick and use your health insurance at some point in your life.

       It is inevitable. It will happen and you cannot avoid it. So no, it's not invalid, it only furthers my point.

       So, there are people out there that I don't know, and are in a life or death situation in need of healthcare.
Why is this my problem? Why do I have to put $350 + of my priorities per month to pay for someone I don't fucking know?
Why am I being forced to be $350 + in the hole every month now, because of someone else?

       Perhaps you do, since in 10 months I have lost two full time positions due to one company closing their doors because of this, and the other having a 60% reduction in payroll because of this.
Oh and about those skyrocketing premiums? Can't tell me it isn't happening as my last position was in finance, I personally watched the company go from $9500 per month to $26250 per month.
Want to see some hour cuts come?
But hey, as long as those life or death people are saved then who the fuck am I? Who the fuck are people just like I am?

       Quickly go buy that insurance you have been demanded to purchase. Obama knows you best.

       I want single payer . I want health care to be a basic right that every member of society can have and not worry about going broke over it. Non essential health care can stay in the private sector and rich(er) people can have that if they want.

       I want it to be one way or the other in all of american politics.  This half assed crony capitalism, where its capitalism for the poor and communism for the rich is not working.  I either want an entirely free market/no government healthcare or a 100% socialist healthcare. Same with our government structure
 100% free market volunteerism, or 100% socialism.

       I agree but I favor the socialist view to health care. As an economist (in training), I believe that once basic needs like health are met, the rest of the market becomes more efficient in the long run. This is just my opinion though

       In my opinion, once you as a people are paying for everyone's health care, then you go full retard with telling them how to live.  I can't get on board with that.

       Naturally what will follow from a single payer system will be complete bans on smoking, drinking (didn't we try that?), coffee, etc, etc.  Because after all, it will be good for the people since we're now paying to keep them healthy.

       That's why our mindset should be changed about that first. We should consider our freedoms as more important than security and other benefits.

       That means people should be allowed to do things as long as they are held responsible for the consequences of their actions and they don't harm anyone else. Everything should be build on that idea.

       Calling them liberal implies they have principles.  They are on the Blue team, which means they are authoritarian when the Blue team is winning, and rebellious when the red team is winning, and they are all spineless, idealess jellyfish if no one tells them what to think.

       As a test, someone should post 2 articles of the same news story about Obamacare. One that has a positive spin and one that has a negative spin.  A week later, post the results and comments of both stories with an analysis of both the up/down votes, the comments, and the best unbiased, fact based assessment of the actual story. 
It's time to get smart, people.  Expose the system through the system.

       There is a HUGE thing about Obamacare that no one is mentioning at all- and it's very scary to me. The fact that the 'navigators'- the people setting up your obamacare and answering the phones, have ALL of your personal information and also are supposed to ask you for it (social sec #, etc) yet, unlike licensed insurance agents, they have had NO background checks NOR need be licensed~ any ex convict could be hired, any weirdo or scam artist will have my social security number, and won't they have my medical information too?
      </p>
      <p>
       The medical information thing also really scares me - does not this obamacare thing open up a whole new can of worms with our personal information getting out? This is what brought up the point with me:

       I worked for the U.S. Census Bureau in 2010 as an enumerator. I had to pass an fbi background check because they didnt want exconvicts to handle personally identifiable information. now, i agree, we should allow exconvicts jobs. But to handle such PII as social security numbers, etc, i dont think so.

       I think there is ample evidence of this, but also consider that "Obama" did an AMA in the weeks before the election, no doubt his team kept a watchful eye on the site, and given our current knowledge of NSA activities there is little room for doubt that the NSA doesn't also "influence" sites such as Reddit to the best of their capability, which is exceedingly vast.

       no I'll call you manipulative or one who does not understand the problem, or one who feels different parts of an elephant but does not see that he is standing in front of an elephant....On the surface, affordable health care sounds great, and it should be....there is no health care, there is an institutionalized insurance scam that is in place of health care....Obamacare, instead of addressing the real issue....why has an occupation that consists of time labor and materials been turned into a middleman scam? instead appeases the scam and those who run in THE INSURANCE SCAM INDUSTRY...So all statements and facts presented by the Obama administration are simply "nice talk" for low iq people who like the sound of things that soud good, but really don't understand jack shit. Wellpoint is part of the NWO screw you in the ass team, they are the ones that benefit from this, not the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       A real leader would remove the insurance industry in it's entirety and used apportioned taxation to create a doctors liability insurance fund that would be used by doctors to defend themselves in liability cases. The fund would cover the payment of losses to liability.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what the insurance industry is, a scam built on fear...fear that the doc will cut off the wrong leg, and heck maybe he did, so you sue, you sue and win, get your judgment and now the doc has huge liability, which gets passed on to you which creates the entire scam...ITS ABOUT FEAR...and the ZIONIST CENTRAL BANKERS that control the manipulation of your mind that are the reason we have an insurance scam ,and not health care

       It's not a perfect system but it's a hell of a lot better than what we had before. Perhaps if the GOP were willing to work with Obama instead of spending our tax-dollars working to obstruct everything he does, we would have gotten a better package like they do in other countries.
