        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>do you honestly think that after 50 years the American press is going to tell you the TRUTH???</p>

<p>there may be journalists who tried--but in the end it is the editors &amp; publishers decision what to print.</p>

<p>we know from Russ Tice that the editors just run to the government to get approval--so QUIT watching American media--it&#39;s PROPAGANDA.</p>

<p>there is a reason &quot;The Men Who Killed Kennedy&quot; was made in England.</p>

<p>there is a reason &quot;The Dark Side of JFK&quot; was published in Europe.</p>

<p>the TRUTH cuts too deep. the TRUTH shakes the walls at the the three letter agencies.</p>

<p>the TRUTH will NOT be revealed on cnn or cbs or abc...</p>

<p>29 Rare &amp; Out-of-Print Books (free pdf) by Robert Morrow: 29 books FREE!!! My favorite so far is How JFK Was Killed by Joachin Joestin (who also wrote The Dark Side of LBJ)...also includes a list of over 1,000 books on the JFK Assassination...President Hoover&#39;s writings on the CIA... <a href="https://app.box.com/s/8b408e6999f8799dfd0a">https://app.box.com/s/8b408e6999f8799dfd0a</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;On Bullshit&#39; is a playful book written by a philosophy professor. It&#39;s a very good basic introduction into the concept of bullshit. Interestingly it dove-tails very nicely with psychopathy. Frankfurt didn&#39;t intend this, but it lays out how psychopath&#39;s bullshit people rather cleanly. I still use it as my basic model for sniffing people out.</p>

<p>There are still excellent sources of news and commentary.</p>

<p>Excellent interviews  - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX6n861Gu6Q">and i recommend watching this great interview by Chris Hedges who proposes solutions to the oncoming neo-fuedalist state and the implementation of global capitalism.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always recommend talking to people 35 years or older (40-70 years old even better) who lived in Communist Soviet Union after the death of Stalin. </p>

<p>Make them feel SAFE that you are open to hear about </p>

<p>&quot;How it really was &amp; that you want to hear what they feel, not what they think you want to hear.&quot; </p>

<p>Ask about housing,homeless, how much they paid in utilities (pennies in comparison) equality amongst the sexes, coworkers &amp; bosses, vacation time, healthcare, strength of community.&quot; </p>

<p>You will be amazed about how much they loved living under communism.</p>

<p>People under 35 only remember capitalism in Russia so their opinion is just like most Americans.... &quot;They love it!!!&quot; because they don&#39;t have anything to compare it to.</p>

<p>why EXPOSE yourself to all those commercials???</p>

<p>tv has also managed to take a 60 minute football game and make it 3+ hours--are you watching a football game--or are you watching commercials with a football game in between??? even a 48 minute basketball game is 3 hours!!! furthermore--even when you think you are watching football/basketball there are always ads popping up or in the background...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes--there is some stuff that is rewarding--but WHY pay into the system? the system has been a con job--they have NOT bothered to tell us who killed JFK...reporters have DIED trying to answer that...reporters have been harassed looking too deep into it...</p>

<p><strong>Dorothy Kilgallen</strong> was killed after talking to Jack Ruby...<strong>Michael Hastings</strong> DIED looking into the CIA/JSOC...<strong>Jeremy Scahill</strong> gets harassed making his 2013 documentary &quot;Dirty Wars&quot; about JSOC...Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald, Bradley Manning, Barrett Brown have all faced serious consequences for getting us information that is only put into the MSM reluctantly--after it can no longer be ignored...Russ Tice, Susan Lindauer, Thomas Drake all paid prices too...Yet the MSM just goes on and on IGNORING the big questions, FAILING to ask them--hoping we forget.</p>

<p><strong>the american media have blocked out any serious questions--they have sold us out and are NOT part of the solution</strong>...</p>

<p>the <strong>WHOLE entire NSA story would be DEAD--never even discussed if it wasn&#39;t for Snowden &amp; Greenwald</strong>...</p>

<p>please think about it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I have thought about it. I went without cable for a few years, I personally would rather have that as one of my options than having to seek out other means. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really watch news on TV other than local, it&#39;s not too hard to have cable, and get outside the mindless bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>cable also costs 50-100+ bucks a month...i still have 400 vhs tapes that i bought for $1 each...i still order vhs tapes on amazon sometimes--i found a portishead vhs for one cent (new)...of course it was $3 to ship...but fuck the system...i have found 25 cent jazz albums...dollar used books...but why would you pay $600-1200+a year to these media companies? </p>
