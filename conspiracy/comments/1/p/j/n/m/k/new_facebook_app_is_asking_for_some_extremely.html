        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have an Android, and my Facebook app is requiring me to update before I&#39;m allowed to continue using it. </p>

<p>Reading through the app permissions, however, there&#39;s an alarming number of highly suspect ones. For instance: </p>

<p><strong>Services that cost you money</strong><br/>
NEW: DIRECTLY CALL PHONE NUMBERS<br/>
&quot;Allows the app to call phone numbers without your intervention. This may result in unexpected charges or calls. Note that this doesn&#39;t allow the app to call emergency numbers. Malicious apps may cost you money by making calls without your confirmation.&quot;  </p>

<p>(So is it admitting that it is a malicious app? But it goes on...)</p>

<p><strong>Hardware controls</strong><br/>
RECORD AUDIO<br/>
&quot;Allows the app to record audio with the microphone. This permission allows the app to record audio at any time without your confirmation.&quot; </p>

<p>TAKE PICTURES AND VIDEOS<br/>
&quot;Allows the app to take pictures and videos with the camera. This permission allows the app to use the camera at any time without your confirmation.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Your accounts</strong><br/>
CREATE ACCOUNTS AND SET PASSWORDS<br/>
&quot;Allows the app to use the account authenticator capabilities of the Account Manager, including creating accounts and getting and setting their passwords. </p>

<p><strong>Your personal information</strong><br/>
MODIFY YOUR CONTACTS<br/>
&quot;Allows the app to modify the data about your contacts stored on your phone, including the frequency with which you&#39;ve called, e mailed, or communicated in other ways with specific contacts. This permission allows apps to delete contact data.&quot; </p>

<p>WRITE CALL LOG<br/>
&quot;Allows the app to modify your phone&#39;s call log, including data about incoming and outgoing calls. Malicious apps may use this to erase or modify your call log.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Default</strong><br/>
NEW: MODIFY BATTERY STATISTICS<br/>
&quot;Allows the app to modify collected battery statistics. Not for use by normal apps.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Network communication</strong><br/>
NEW: DOWNLOAD FILES WITHOUT NOTIFICATION<br/>
&quot;Allows the app to download files through the download manager without any notification being shown to the user.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Your accounts</strong><br/>
FIND ACCOUNTS ON THE DEVICE<br/>
&quot;Allows the app to get the list of accounts known by the phone. This may include any accounts created by applications you have installed.&quot;</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t all of them, believe it or not, but they&#39;re the most suspicious. Make sure you read these before updating! There&#39;s no reason that justifies Facebook needing these permissions!  </p>

<p>I also seem to be unable to actually delete/remove the app from my device. I can remove it from the folder I had it in, but not my phone itself. </p>

It&#39;s tough since society makes it almost impossible to function without one, as most of your history (photos, conversations, etc.) are stored there, and since it means you&#39;re getting cut off from your friends and what they&#39;re up to... but I&#39;m also thinking I might try an alternate route of &quot;deleting&quot; the account.</p>

<p>Granted, i still have my facebook but its been dismantled long ago (thank god i was smart enough to not use my real name when i created an account years ago). these days, it serves as my personal blog. only person i communicate with that i wouldnt normally is another liberty-minded friend from my home town.</p>

<p>Version 1.9.10 (though I haven&#39;t updated) </p>

<p>&quot;This app can access the following on your phone:</p>

<p>Your personal information - modify your contacts, read call log, read your contacts, write call log.<br/>
Your location - approximate (network-based) location, precise (GPS) location.<br/>
Network communication - full network access.<br/>
Your accounts - add or remove accounts, create accounts and set passwords.<br/>
Storage - modify or delete the contents of your USB storage.<br/>
Phone calls - read phone status and identity.<br/>
Hardware controls - record audio, take pictures and videos.<br/>
System tools - prevent phone from sleeping, toggle sync on and off.<br/>
Network communication - receive data from Internet, view network connections, view Wi-Fi connections.<br/>
Development tools - test access to protected storage.<br/>
Your accounts - find accounts on the device.<br/>
Hardware controls - control vibration.<br/>
System tools - install shortcuts, read sync settings.&quot;  </p>

<p>That&#39;s all I can find. If you can tell me how to find the other information you&#39;re looking for, I&#39;ll try to find out as far as I&#39;m comfortable. I&#39;m not installing those updates just to have someone online believe me. </p>
