       I have an Android, and my Facebook app is requiring me to update before I'm allowed to continue using it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reading through the app permissions, however, there's an alarming number of highly suspect ones. For instance:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services that cost you money
       </strong>
       <br/>
       NEW: DIRECTLY CALL PHONE NUMBERS
       <br/>
       "Allows the app to call phone numbers without your intervention. This may result in unexpected charges or calls. Note that this doesn't allow the app to call emergency numbers. Malicious apps may cost you money by making calls without your confirmation."
      </p>
      <p>
       (So is it admitting that it is a malicious app? But it goes on...)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Hardware controls
       </strong>
       <br/>
       RECORD AUDIO
       <br/>
       "Allows the app to record audio with the microphone. This permission allows the app to record audio at any time without your confirmation."
      </p>
      <p>
       TAKE PICTURES AND VIDEOS
       <br/>
       "Allows the app to take pictures and videos with the camera. This permission allows the app to use the camera at any time without your confirmation."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Your accounts
       </strong>
       <br/>
       CREATE ACCOUNTS AND SET PASSWORDS
       <br/>
       "Allows the app to use the account authenticator capabilities of the Account Manager, including creating accounts and getting and setting their passwords.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Your personal information
       </strong>
       <br/>
       MODIFY YOUR CONTACTS
       <br/>
       "Allows the app to modify the data about your contacts stored on your phone, including the frequency with which you've called, e mailed, or communicated in other ways with specific contacts. This permission allows apps to delete contact data."
      </p>
      <p>
       WRITE CALL LOG
       <br/>
       "Allows the app to modify your phone's call log, including data about incoming and outgoing calls. Malicious apps may use this to erase or modify your call log."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Default
       </strong>
       <br/>
       NEW: MODIFY BATTERY STATISTICS
       <br/>
       "Allows the app to modify collected battery statistics. Not for use by normal apps."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Network communication
       </strong>
       <br/>
       NEW: DOWNLOAD FILES WITHOUT NOTIFICATION
       <br/>
       "Allows the app to download files through the download manager without any notification being shown to the user."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Your accounts
       </strong>
       <br/>
       FIND ACCOUNTS ON THE DEVICE
       <br/>
       "Allows the app to get the list of accounts known by the phone. This may include any accounts created by applications you have installed."
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't all of them, believe it or not, but they're the most suspicious. Make sure you read these before updating! There's no reason that justifies Facebook needing these permissions!
      </p>
      <p>
       I also seem to be unable to actually delete/remove the app from my device. I can remove it from the folder I had it in, but not my phone itself.

       I'm thinking it might be time to do that soon. It's tough since society makes it almost impossible to function without one, as most of your history (photos, conversations, etc.) are stored there, and since it means you're getting cut off from your friends and what they're up to... but I'm also thinking I might try an alternate route of "deleting" the account.

       I have a few friends who have gotten rid of their account, and they, too, seem to live without it just fine. I'm sure I can, also. I feel just a bit lazy, I guess, since I know it would require a few different things were I to go without it. I'd be out of touch with a number of people, but them's the breaks.

       So a little while ago I opened the FB app on my Android-based phone and it showed me a little pop-up with my mobile phone number in it and asked me if I'd like to link it to my FB account.
      </p>
      <p>
       I uninstalled that shit immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, it's still a Google-based ("do no evil", right, LOL) operating system so I'm fucked either way, right?

       I just read the entire data use policy and and statement of rights &amp; responsibilities on my Facebook app (I have the iphone) and I didn't see anything resembling what you posted. Is this just on the Android app or am I looking in the wrong place?

       I'm not entirely sure. On my phone, Facebook wouldn't load, prompting me that I had to update the app in order to continue using it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I clicked on the button to do so, it took me to the Play Store (Android market), and when I clicked update, it popped up a list of these new permissions it said the app needed. That's where all this was listed.

       Not surprised CIA-backed Facebook wants access to anyone you've called and can take pictures/audio surveillance. I'd take my phone in for a factory reset just to get Facebook app off, fortunately I uninstalled mine long ago.

       I was able to get the app off my phone, but I found out that apparently those permissions had been running for a while anyway, even though I never agreed to them...

       This has been going on for over a year now. If you sign up for a FB account you did agree. Also FYI every time FB updates or changes their format they also reset your privacy settings and can change or ammend their app permissions or contract of user services agreement.  Cancel it if this bothers you. Or continue to freely give away all of your information.

       I don't know how to find that info. I'm in the Play Store, and when I hit "update" I'm warned about these new permissions that I need to agree to before it will update.

       When I click settings, it says build is 4.4.21, but this might be for the Play Store and not Facebook.
