       Notice the amount of posts calling against labels on GMO food packaging.  Also, the massive upvoting of posts glorifying Monsanto, declaring GMOs as "safe" and same as selective cross-breeding, which is false, is overwhelming.  This sudden influx of corporatism and blatant calls of curtailing consumer information rights is very new to

       This site has grown far worse than the way Digg was when the mass exodus to Reddit occurred. The worst part about it is that with Reddit, the sell-out is being done in stealth to prevent us from realizing that we're being played for fools.

       Digg didn't have subreddits. It was all just mashed together in to basically 6 categories. Once part of it fell, it all fell. Reddit at least has subreddits so there are ways to escape the censorship, at least for a while.

       I know what you're talking about. I just can't make any sense of it. How is not using the only tools we have to reach out to others a solution? How is clicking a button that you MUST click to continue the service giving up?

       What is to be credited to you? You said it's time to stop using these devices because they are owned and monitored by the very people we're struggling against, right? I reitirated that, but mentioned how stupid that is.  You plan on educating everyone you know face to face on a daily basis? No, ofcourse not. We still need these tools to counter act the mis/disinformation TPTB churn out constantly.

       nothing is inherently unsafe about GMO foods.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are ways to create unsafe foods using GMO technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is a TOOL. it may be used for great good or great evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       do not denigrate a TOOL. denigrate poor uses of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: this whole situation is a perfect example of how well meaning causes (information about food and how it is prepared and grown) gets subverted into completely ineffective "solutions." people hate monsanto and people want more information about GMO. this is a good thing. i agree. but all of these people are supporting a "solution" which is completely irrelevant to those concerns! putting a sticker or label on food that says it is GMO and nothing more detailed (which is what is proposed by the labeling initiative) doesn't solve the problems. in fact, it would serve to reduce information about GMO and their effectiveness! if either of those groups want to truly achieve their desires, they would work towards revoking Monsanto's corporate charter and work to increase detailed information on health and nutritional labels. however, currently both groups are being lulled into thinking they are helping by supporting GMO labeling.

       There is literally no benefit to using gmo. Organic farming is the only farming worth having.

        in the 20 years since GMO crops first came on the market, studies have found that they have led to higher pesticide use, and no meaningful improvement in flavor, nutrition, yield or water requirements. Instead, what they've created are plants that are engineered to withstand massive dosing of toxic herbicides, and plants that function as living pesticide factories. Monsanto's Bt. corn, for example, is actually registered with the EPA as a pesticide.

       So far the TOOL's primary function has been to increasingly monopolize agriculture for the sake of profit.

       so you are afraid because you do not understand it fully and worry people doing it also do not understand it fully.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is still not a reason to label GMOs as there could very well (and there certainly are) people who DO understand how it works and are more than capable of producing many beneficial GMOs.
      </p>
      <p>
       what you should advocate is education about GMO technology.

       saying something is GMO has nothing to do with telling you anything about what is in it.

       adding something to a nutrition label which says what genes were used DOES.

       yeah see that's ignorance. there is EVERY possibility GMO food could be extremely beneficial as there is it could be extremely detrimental.

       this proves you do not know ANYTHING about GMO.

      <p>
       we are hardly the first generation to eat them. and they are in a wide array of food products already.

       and you also do not know how to read if you think i am advocating not putting detailed information about them on nutrition labels.

       but, simply putting a large sticker on a box that says GMO is completely unhelpful and adds no information.

       lol i'm not offended. i am just pointing out that your position is one of ignorance. you state over and over you are uninterested in even learning more about them and just 'don't want them.'
      </p>
      <p>
       it offends me not that you are dumb, but that people like you are advocating something which will increase ignorance for many millions of people who may not have the same attitudes as you. it is fascism.
      </p>
      <p>
       the solution is not to say things are GMO or not. the solution is to add a section to the nutritonal label which details genetic alteration within any substances used in the preparation and growing of the food.
      </p>
      <p>
       then, you can look at the back and if there are things listed (even when they will eventually say "genes added to increase visual acuity" or something else beneficial) simply refuse to read on and make your ignorant decision to not buy the product.
      </p>
      <p>
       don't kid yourself into thinking that all GMO would be labeled anyways. read up on how the FDA and USDA does its due diligence (hint, they don't really).
      </p>
      <p>
       my solution and ideas keep us all much more informed and intelligent than your line of ignorant thought.

       no im not kidding do you understand that every item in grocery stores in america has GMO in it? we are not another country our entire food supply is riddled with the things.
      </p>
      <p>
       the only thing labeling food as GMO will accomplish is that some of the food will be labeled which has GMO and some WONT (any company with enough money to lobby congress and get themselves exemption from the labeling laws, which WILL happen)
      </p>
      <p>
       so, putting labels will only make you THINK you know more. it won't actually give you any new information and you will STILL be eating GMO food.

       There is already a good deal of skepticism directed at GMO's and the motives of their manufacturers - and skepticism is healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And labeling GMO's as such "creating ignorance"? I'm afraid I don't follow your logic there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Labeling controversial products as such gives consumers a measure of choice - they can vote with their dollars. If the GMO manufacturers wish to peddle their wares, they should make a concerted effort to establish safety, and then educate the consumers - who will then happily buy their products.

       no i don't. they should be treated EXACTLY the same as any other food product and subject to no worse scrutiny. doing so would ONLY serve to create fear. (why are we scrutinizing this differently and more?)

      <p>
       if you do not think the current food safety standards are sophisticated enough to take GMO food and potential hazards from them into account, then we need to revise those standards and continue to apply the same (now updated) set to all food products.

        Just as the heavy use of antibiotics contributed to the rise of drug-resistant supergerms, American farmers‚Äô near-ubiquitous use of the weedkiller Roundup has led to the rapid growth of tenacious new superweeds.
       </p>
       <p>
        To fight them, Mr. Anderson and farmers throughout the East, Midwest and South are being forced to spray fields with more toxic herbicides, pull weeds by hand and return to more labor-intensive methods like regular plowing.
       </p>
       <p>
        ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre back to where we were 20 years ago,‚Äù said Mr. Anderson, who will plow about one-third of his 3,000 acres of soybean fields this spring, more than he has in years. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to find out what works.‚Äù

        Farm experts say that such efforts could lead to higher food prices, lower crop yields, rising farm costs and more pollution of land and water.

       Do you think Monsanto INTENDED to create

        Super Pigweed

       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Crops cross-pollinate. Animals (like salmon) that are SUPPOSED to be sterile become fertile - get loose, and can change whole species, affecting their predators and their prey.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever heard of "Killer Bees"? No, that wasn't a GMO experiment, but like rats and cats being introduced to isolated islands, unintended consequences can be devastating.
      </p>
      <p>
       With GMOs, the potential for irreversible damage is mind boggling, and no, I do NOT trust monopolistic mega-corporations or the little politicians and bureaucrats that they keep tucked comfortably in their pockets with that kind of power.

       oh you're right, it creates a choice...
      </p>
      <p>
       people against certain GMOs will be way less likely to actually learn the differences in others offered and instead choose to remain ignorant of the benefits offered because they see a label that says "GMO" and to them that means bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       combined with how we teach everyone to think in this country, (black box thought, input always gives same output for very generalized functions) we would worsen willful ignorance by a large factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       labeling something GMO does nothing other than tell someone "do not bother looking into any specifics about how this food was grown, harvested, or prepared or consider any potential benefits which may be offered by its genetic alteration. instead, file this under the same category with every other GMO in your brain."
      </p>
      <p>
       whether for each person that means GOOD or BAD is completely arbitrary. but, it certainly increases and encourages ignorance.

       I would argue GMO is bad.  Only because it is a slippery slope, and it won't be long before all food is GMO, then if we find out there are long term genetic problems associated with them, say, increased rates of cancer, we can all think back to the moment when we
       <em>
        chose
       </em>
       GMO foods, because they were labelled as such.  Much better than going ignorantly.

       edit: also for a conspiracy board, don't we all agree we will end up eating totally GMO food anyways? this is why we should push for detailed information about them added to health and nutritional labels and NOT get subverted into thinking we "solved the problem" by putting a big fucking sticker on the box of them that says "GMO" (you know, that sticker we know just won't happen to apply to monsantos products....)

       Well I do agree that they shouldn't just have a GMO sticker on it and that's it, of course there should be detailed information on the packaging, just like any other food product.  As long as it's labelled somewhere so others can do their due dilligence when shopping.

       i just hate how the current movement will (if passed) make people feel like the situation has been handled. instead, the movement needs to be educated about what to push for specifically, and frankly, become less biased against GMO. because there is a huge potential for making some really fucking cool food which could be enormously beneficial for humans and the environment.

       If GMO was more open source and not proprietary like Monsantosoft people would be more trusting. Why should we take anyone's word for it that what they say they put in our foods' genes is good for us or harmless? I'll stick to co-op grown heirloom organics, thank you very much.

       you should put information about growing processes, fertilizers, pesticides, and genetic alteration all on the health label. singling out in a large button-fashion a specific tool used in the preparation of a food is stereotypical and unhelpful information. some GMO are good, some are bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       do you think we should put a label on all foods grown with pesticide? "GROWN WITH PESTICIDE" and then neglect to add any details about what sort?

       that is what is being attempted with the GMO labeling initiatives.

       Despite your perceptions of ignorance of the masses, people will use information, especially when they have had some education about a subject.  There hasn't been much education about GMO because it's still a relatively new concept in it's modern incarnation.

       Assuming that Monsanto and its TPTB shareholders have our best interests at heart, we simply do not understand DNA well enough to use it for anything good. Whoever thought experimenting with the public would be beneficial was sorely mistaken. I'm inclined to believe that this was done on purpose to harm everybody who eats GMO foods. Vote with your wallet, buy local and organic where possible. If monsatan doesn't have money they can't fund these paranoid operations. They are afraid of us, and they better be, because their days as a profitable racket are numbered.

       actually if you look at popular posts here...say 1500 + overall in 5 hours, then check r/all.  You will see posts in the same range but not r/conspiracy.  I havent done this alot but something I have noticed.  It is like we need 2 to 1 in order to make it these days.  I suggest saying fuck reddit and enjoy this community while it lasts.  This too will be torn apart eventually.

       Look at the proposed laws of only 'credible news' getting a pass from the White House. It looks like it's being implemented early before it's been passed. Many people still think it's unreasonable to suggest the US would restrict content critical of its behaviour but we already have examples. China has it's own firewall, Iran restricts social media, Turkey took stuff down in the protests and the list goes on, including how hard drives were destroyed at the Guardian or how journalists homes in the US were raised to confiscate documents.
      </p>

       It's already happening and it's been happening for a while. Desperate times call for desperate measures and as you see the awareness spread about how politics is a lie, you'll see that the clamp down will get much more intense. Watch and keep your eyes open, you've seen it and you will continue to see it get worse.

       True enough. The great thing about Reddit is that every subreddit has its own subculture. They're not
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       compromised, but certainly the default subreddits which share a bunch of the same users as mods are.

       Again this has nothing to do with 'right wing' 'left wing' this purely an authoritarian takeover of all the subs and an attempt to push out any anti-establishment voices from the 'left' or 'right', period.

       Yup.  GMO's and Monsanto business policies are perhaps the most heavily shilled topics on Reddit, along with fracking.  In case you guys don't know, the sub
       <a href="/r/GMOmyths">
        /r/GMOmyths
       </a>
       is a voting brigade sub through which many GMO shill accounts organize.
       <a href="/u/JF_Queeny">
        /u/JF_Queeny

       ,
       <a href="/u/firemylasers">
        /u/firemylasers
       </a>
       , and
       <a href="/u/scuderia">
        /u/scuderia
       </a>
       along with many other accounts organize their thread voting/spamming from this sub.  There was previously a list of 20 or so usernames associated with the sub floating around Reddit but the admins started threatening anyone who posted it with permanent site wide bans.

       . I remember one day about a month or two ago when a dozens of police misconduct videos got front pages in one day, many with 3000+ net up votes and thousands of comments on each. Then suddenly, within an hour 95% of the posts were disappeared and then all these videos showing how nice and great police can be took their place. It was so blatant and ridiculous it still pisses me off now just thinking about it.

       I'm pretty sure there haven't been enough long term studies to truly undetstand the effects of GMO's and whether or not they safe at this time. Seriously, source checking and research method course need to be a staple in education now a days as you can't trust anything you see without fact checking it.

       Seriously? Automated counter arguments? Just look at some of the top posts on the GMO topics in the major subreddits. The people arguing against labeling often respond directly in debates. Your accusations are completely unfounded.

       there's nothing wrong with GMO's they have saved millions of lives but there is something wrong when one company has a monopoly on the industry and tries to patent plants.

       Did you know that in Victorian times, the colour green was really fashionable. It was everywhere, from wall papers to carpets, until they found out that it contained lead that killed quite a few people. However before that, it was deemed safe. Same with Heroin in children's medicine and real coke in coca cola, formaldehyde in shampoos, cigarettes for sore throats, x-rays for fun etc. All safe as houses before they found out they actually weren't. See where I'm coming from?

       you must be really stupid to not understand GMO's. that's why im against labeling them people are too stupid to understand what GMO means and how its done so they freak out and say they are monster plants and will irradiate your whole family.

       yeah i don't support this argument because the same EXACT one has been used to keep drugs illegal and fuel the drug war around the world for many decades now.

       nice try though.

       edit: also for a conspiracy board, don't we all agree we will end up eating totally GMO food anyways? this is why we should push for detailed information about them added to health and nutritional labels and NOT get subverted into thinking we "solved the problem" by putting a big fucking sticker on the box of them that says "GMO" (you know, that sticker we know just won't happen to apply to monsantos products....)
