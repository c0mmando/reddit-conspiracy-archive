        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I may get a lot of hate for this, but I feel it needs to be said.</p>

<p>Our greatest asset here is our ability to ask the right questions. Thus, we need to ask if the LAX shooter really was just a crazy conspiracy theorist. </p>

<p>We talk often of revolution, and of stockpiling your guns and ammo. We never talk about having a steady hand, or the kind of damage taking in all this knowledge can do to a man.</p>

<p>So tonight, I just came here to say, think twice before you pick up that gun. The snail&#39;s pace of change can be maddening, but if you&#39;re thinking of going Rambo on some cops or DHS officials, you&#39;re not going to change a damn thing for the better at this point. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t throw your life away, my friends. Talk to us. Talk to your family. Don&#39;t ever take the first shot. We don&#39;t need any more corpses in the morgue. </p>

<p>If it ever turns out to be true that one of you ends up as one of those mass shooters, I will not cheer you on. I will weep for you.</p>

<p>EDIT: Since a lot of you can&#39;t really read between the lines, I was merely framing the recent incident in a way to convey a message: That any violent act as of this point will only have the same net result as these false flags. We must not unduly wind ourselves up. We are in the business of telling people that they have been living a lie. How can that not carry the risk of pushing someone over the edge? It can be an emotionally and psychologically traumatizing event. We need to recognize that. We need to provide each other with support to prevent any of us from going off the deep end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the points you are making but just make sure that we don&#39;t turn this into &quot;we are never to use guns against them&quot;. Taking up arms against them can be the answer when all other possibilities have been exhausted. </p>

<p>If the guy at LAX was in fact a conspiracy theorist, then he is not a smart one because I don&#39;t think anyone thinks the biggest issue this country is facing is the TSA. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, I agree with your point and we should not pick up guns in frustration and without much thought behind it... because that&#39;s exactly what they would want us to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>...I clicked the link. It had an image macro with unsourced text. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem with your proposed system of doing things- let&#39;s say someone posts that Abe Lincoln quote about not believing quotes on the internet. Under your system you could claim that he really said that, and then put the burden on me to track the source of that quote down. Well, obviously that will be very difficult since it doesn&#39;t exist. And it&#39;s not an argument that it does exist, simply that I can&#39;t prove that it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Now, you post a quote attributed to Ghandi- what if it doesn&#39;t exist? I should go on a goose-chase across the internet trying to verify a statement you made? Why don&#39;t you just begin the process with the evidence you have, the way that claims always work? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the need to source things, and I don&#39;t disagree with it on one level.  However, there comes a time when working that way alone would force you to have to &quot;source the source&quot;, since there is much that can be (and does get) very corrupted in its interpretation, etc.  Working like this exclusively can lead to and ultimately create an &quot;infinite loop of un-verifiability&quot; where sources get continually questioned ad nauseum.  As such, critical thinking is of paramount importance.  Sourcing is important enough, but it should not be called upon as being so important as to cause you to preemptively invalidate what is said simply because you might not be familiar with the material itself.</p>

<p>It would seem to me you did.  Your first statement called into question the validity of the Gandhi-attributed statement itself.</p>

<p>While they may not be considered &quot;obvious&quot; to some, Gandhi quotes are not too difficult to verify.</p>

<p>R/atheism, we need to have a talk.  Please, PLEASE don&#39;t bomb any churches.  I know you may want to, but please just know that there are people that love you, and this is not the right way to handle your hatred of religion.</p>

<p>R/Gaming, a word please.  I know you like GTAV, but PLEASE if you&#39;re thinking about running over  a prostitute and taking her money, just please come talk to me first so I can talk you down.</p>

<p>R/AWW- we know you love cats, but if you are having any thoughts about murdering all the dogs in your neighborbood, I&#39;d like ot personally ask you to not do that.</p>

<p>Do you not see what you just did?  This is not helpful.  The media is trying to equate conspiracy theorists with violence and that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;ve done here.  It&#39;s a false characterization and is both dismissive and misrepresentative.</p>

<p>Black people- if you&#39;re thinking of stealing our cars and raping our women, I&#39;d ask you please to not do that.</p>

<p>That&#39;s really scummy.</p>

<p>and i wanted to point out that we can transcend the need for any kind of weapons via our other faculties (e.g. cell phone cameras and non-violent flash mobs). an arms race between the rich and the poor might not be such a good idea.</p>

<p>the quote was illustrating the destructive spiral of violence. guns are a self-fulfilling prophecy. by treating others as a threat, our social cohesion breaks down, which forces desperate people to become dangerous. i could have also said:</p>

<p>&quot;i need a gun to protect my extra food from my marauding neighbors. my neighbors are marauding because they&#39;re hungry.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I prefer to use cameras and non violence. I would like to live in a wold where there were zero violence. I just feel like you&#39;re arguing with me because I said that they&#39;re useful when it comes to defending yourself and then you&#39;re taking it to a whole different level. You just don&#39;t understand what i&#39;m saying or you&#39;re not getting the whole message i&#39;m trying to get across.</p>

<p>I never said it was right to impose, threaten, or enable yourself to become bad because of a gun. You&#39;re assuming. People use other means to do the same thing guns do. People do suck, not guns. The people who do not suck have the right to not get punished because of people who suck.</p>

<p>If you take my whole comment in context from a middle ground, peace seeking standpoint in your mind instead of taking the gun comment out of context, you&#39;d understand that i&#39;m putting a community where people grow food and help strengthen nature before I even mentioned guns. I could write a huge wall of text for probably days about the things I put before any weapons. You don&#39;t have the time to read about it because normal non violent, non conflict seeking people already understand this.</p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that weapons being present has and will prevent violence. The best sword is a sword sheathed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to argue with you on guns and how they should just simply go away. Guns exsist; they&#39;re going to exsist; it sucks; they&#39;re best used as a last resort, and only for defense. It is very disappointing when people are aggressive with violence and use guns. It&#39;s also disappointing when people argue over something because someone took something the wrong way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely the latter. Because the person who places ideology above personal safety is also placing it above community safety. The person who dies for their ideology is gratified in death while the perpetrator survives to find another victim. There were pacifist societies once... they didn&#39;t defend themselves nor their neighbors,  nor their children, nor their elderly. They were at peace in life and at peace with death.</p>

<p>Killing or maiming the perp not only saves yourself, it keeps your community alive (directly) and prevents or strongly discourages future attacks from the same perp. The most selfless thing to do is also the most self-preserving. To die without a fight satisfies your emotion at the cost of your family/neighborhood. And your community will have lost a good member while gaining a new predator. </p>

A singular, average citizen can only have a limited number of rounds (ultimately dwarfed by that of modern military&#39;s) after which their firearm becomes a club. The average citizen does not benefit from resupplies like governments can provide either.  Also, a firearm can be used as a beneficial tool outside of defense. Can that be said of the nuke or viruses? </p>

<p>so there really isn&#39;t a fundamental difference? where do you draw the line for nukes? how about non-nuclear explosives? poison gas? viruses? just tell me the most poisonous/explosive/pathogenic you would be willing to accept.</p>

<p>sure. nukes can be used for drilling or moving asteroids, while viruses are important laboratory reagents.</p>

<p>The average citizen does not have the means nor the need to drill or redirect asteroids. Nor do they have the means or need to use virus in laboratories.  So try to be a bit realistic.</p>

<p>Now firearms can feed a person (believe it or not). but you might be saying; &quot;what if they stock pile ammo?&quot; To which I might ask;&quot;How much of it can they carry and still be considered a threat so great that they cannot be dealt with by government or law enforcement?&quot;  I hope you see where I am going with this.  The point I am making is that a firearm can be utilized as a tool by the average citizen, where the nuke or virus has no application to said same average citizen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>just tell me the most poisonous/explosive/pathogenic you would be willing to accept.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is an all or nothing thing huh? Well, perhaps we should start with what should be acceptable for military&#39;s to have and use?  They are by far the biggest culprits of using such things.  Unfortunately all these things are out there, like Pandora&#39;s box, there is no putting them away. So, my approach would be to focus on changing the mentality that makes it easy for a military to bomb innocents or an individual to perpetrate a mass shooting.  Not to vilify a thing which, left alone, does nothing. As I said before; vilifying a thing is silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you just going to keep asking me the same question over and over again? I thought I explained this, or do you not read my responses?  You must not. I will try and simplify this for you since you seem to be having some sort of issue with my statements, so here goes:</p>

<p>A firearm is a tool because it has a use outside of war and one doesn&#39;t need specialized education to operate one. Nukes, biological/chemical weapons, and certain high explosives have absolutely no use by the average citizen outside of war.  Therefor, due to their highly specialized nature, cannot be considered tools. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why you can&#39;t seem to wrap your head around this concept or why you&#39;re so adamant about lumping firearms with highly specialized military WMDs. Why are you so insistent on lumping it all together?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry OP, but the hatchet-men and the lap-dog media are quickly spinning the LAX incident to paint an image where &quot;conspiracy theorists are terrorists&quot;, and you are feeding their agenda by implying that &quot;we&quot; may share some of the blame for what happened.</p>

<p>Pardon me, but <strong>Bull.Fucking.Shit.</strong></p>

<p>I take NO responsibility for what anyone else does. None.</p>

<p>I am no more culpable for what happened in LA than I am for the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or the slaughter in Iraq, or for NSA spying, or for the extrajudicial executions of American citizens via drone strike. </p>

<p>If anything, I am more culpable in the latter, as I am an American citizen, and these thing were carried out &quot;in my name&quot;, whether I liked it or not.</p>

<p>&quot;We&quot; are not a &quot;group&quot;. We are random people who observe, examine and comment. &quot;We&quot; have no &quot;agenda&quot;, no &quot;leadership&quot;, and we do not subscribe to any dogma or set or principles.</p>

<p>The pen truly is mightier than the sword. </p>

<p>Do lunatics wielding bombs and bullets present any <em>credible threat</em> to &quot;them&quot;? Hell no. They use these types of events to EXPAND their power. And in this case, they have targeted <strong>us</strong> - those that DARE to speak our minds and question the illusion that is dangled before our eyes.</p>

<p>This is a battle for the mind - and they rightly perceive that the winds are blowing in an unfavorable direction. This accusation - spinning so called &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; as &quot;terrorists&quot; - as unstable, potentially VIOLENT people that must be reigned-in has ONE intent, and that is to <strong>SHUT YOU UP</strong>: To cower you into silence out of FEAR of being labeled as a &quot;threat&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Don&#39;t fall for it.</strong></p>

<p>It is human nature that, left unchecked, power, will ALWAYS devolve into corruption and tyranny. <strong>ALWAYS</strong>. It is our right and our DUTY as human beings and as citizens to monitor and scrutinize those that pretend to serve our interests, and to raise the alarm when we see that things are amiss. </p>

<p>We owe it to our selves and our posterity.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong>: The threat is not to the people, but to those who intend to rule, and the weapons they fear are <em>not</em> bombs or bullets, but words, and the ideas that words convey.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let them cower you into silence.</p>

<p>Violent protest is necessary for change, but violence targeted at people is wasted. Instead target your violence at the SYSTEMS of oppression: the most popular and successful revolutionaries in recent history did just that. Ghandi and Mandela both seriously fucked up the systems of oppression in their societies, by vastly different means.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t forget that Mandela&#39;s greatest success, the culmination of his revolution, was his public desire for reconciliation. A crusade that began with him blowing shit up, was only eventually won through an act of immense personal peacemaking. </p>

<p>Your right to bear arms exists to protect you from violent oppression - from the state ever taking the gloves off and saying &quot;fuck it, you disagree and we shoot you.&quot; Not so that you may wage solitary wars against some poor, stupid sheep working for TSA.</p>

<p>Please remember this: the revolution needs you alive, and fighting against the systems that oppose us - not the people.</p>

<p>Perhaps you feel personally culpable. &quot;We&quot; do not. Perhaps YOU do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not saying we (or you, or I, however the fuck you want me to frame the statement) bear responsibility for the crime. However, it is inherently common on this sub (not &quot;we&quot;) to make calls for action. These rallying cries are combined with a large amount of fear. People who have recently awoken to the way the world works may find themselves in a psychologically vulnerable state. These factors combined are conducive to irrational action. It&#39;s not direct cause and effect, it is not complicity, or an excuse, but to ignore that is irresponsible of &quot;us&quot; or &quot;me&quot; or &quot;you&quot; or &quot;them&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we must start taking responsibility for the actions of individuals who are not smart enough or emotionally/mentally unstable enough to pull off a maneuver like LAX or Sandyhook?  </p>

<p>I also don&#39;t like the implication that a &quot;call for action&quot; means killing innocents or that those calling for action can&#39;t tell between the innocent, the cogs in the system, and those making the calls for the system.</p>

<p>Your original post only serves to associate the subscribers of this and similar subs with the idiots who try and pull off mass killings.  Way to lump us all together...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t deserve any hate for this post, but I just want to say that there seem to be three kinds of spree killings and terror attacks: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>those motivated racial/religious/political motives without mental illness. </p></li>
<li><p>Those motivated by depression and rage without psychosis or delusions.</p></li>
<li><p>Those where psychosis/delusions/schizophrenia is involved.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For types 1 and 2, your message maybe makes sense. For type three however, man, if it&#39;s not one type of delusion, it&#39;ll be another. There&#39;s no point in telling a violent schizophrenic to not be a violent schizophrenic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is something else very important that a lot of the survivalists here should keep in mind.</p>

<p>Most of you are civilians.  That means that in most cases, your lack of discipline, and overabundance of ego, will likely prevent you from being able to take orders.  I&#39;m not talking about the scenario where your boss tells you to do something at work here, either.  I&#39;m talking about a scenario where you either do as you are told, or lives get lost; and if the enemy don&#39;t shoot you as a result, then whoever gave you said orders will.</p>

<p>I am a civilian myself.  I used to run Capture the Flag games in <em>World of Warcraft</em>, where we had ten people per team.  I actually had to come up with tactics that assumed nobody else was helping me or following orders, because I was often in a situation where nobody would.  They were too busy farming kills in mid-field; they didn&#39;t care about winning.  It was only when I had already won a couple of consecutive matches with maybe two other people helping me, that they started realising I knew what I was doing, and began to fall into line.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the Black Bloc at protests.  They are the same.  Unco-ordinated, undisciplined, disorganised angry teenagers; poorly armed, who just want to smash things.  The police, by contrast, are in riot gear with reinforced plastic shields, and have at least a certain amount of training in phalanx tactics.  They might be slobbering, subhuman, psychopathic pigs, yes; but they <strong><em>are</em></strong> trained.  Out of those two groups, if it seriously comes down to the wire, guess who&#39;s winning?</p>

<p>Whether I condone violence against the American government or not in moral terms, I absolutely do not in tactical terms.  The civilian public would not have a prayer.  It would be one of the largest and most one-sided massacres in human history.</p>

<p>Keep that firmly in mind, Americans.  You are not winning a violent revolution, at this point.  If survival is something you have in mind, then you should not even remotely consider the idea.  The government is now far too well dug in.  If you had wanted to try that, you probably should have done so at the end of the 80s.  </p>

<p>Waco established precedent for the suspension of Posse Comitatus, and that was when the window of opportunity really closed.  If you try it now, the government will hit you with literally everything it has at its&#39; disposal.</p>

<p>This is too true but doesn&#39;t make armed resistance impossible.  As you said, tactics and training.  Now if we could get people away from their beloved distractions then maybe we could teach those to people with the passion and drive to give a hand in applying them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP seems like clever disinfo. A lot of signs are pointing to the guy having had nothing to do with conspiracy theorists - fuck, some reported camo, some TSA clothing, others dark clothing. It&#39;s so discombobulated, and in my opinion a staged event, that again, it had nothing to do with us or people that represent our believes. And in any case, inaction results in passivity. Lord knows we can&#39;t affect change through the system that&#39;s designed and used against us. It&#39;s like trying to play football with baseball rules on a basketball court.</p>

<p>Noone should even be entertaining that we need to &quot;put down our guns&quot;. Take a step back, and you will see it strongly smells of disinfo/redirecting. There is no good change coming. Look around. Look at the passed 100 years. Even look since the internet was invented. <strong>There is no good change coming</strong>. Maybe we need more people to &quot;go off the deep end&quot;. Maybe it would inspire people to get off their asses and tangibly affect the world and the course of human events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t illogical to speculate that the marathon bombing was carried out by a member of the Patriot movement. It was on Patriot&#39;s Day. The same day of the massacre at Waco. The same day McVeigh chose to retaliate by blowing up the OKC federal building. I&#39;ve met Joe Levin- he&#39;s really not an evil illuminati guy. </p>

<p>They&#39;re civil rights advocates, like you said. They may go overboard in some cases, but they&#39;ve legitimately fought a lot of flat-out hate groups (KKK, WAR, etc) that had been calling themselves &quot;Patriots.&quot; I don&#39;t know what your vision of the Patriot movement is, but it gets frustrating when Klansmen are using that label. It does muddy the waters. </p>

<p>I completely agree with you. But do you know of a single conspiracy theorist group that promotes violence? I don&#39;t. Not even Alex Jones, and he&#39;s a pretty big gun advocate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones does promote violence through subliminal messaging realized through logical induction, in my opinion. </p>

<p>This clip, for instance:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1ck1rw_E1E">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1ck1rw_E1E</a></p>

<p>Listen to his logical leaps, starting at 11:28. &quot;Resisting the globalist occupation is called terrorism... &quot; &#39;... they call resisting it terrorism... &#39;</p>

<p>Clip of Obama talking (being used as evidence to support the above claim): &quot;Anytime bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror.&quot;</p>

<p>Reducing these statements to boolean values, resisting the globalist occupation must be equal to using bombs to target innocent civilians (according to Jones). </p>

<p>Anyway, I don&#39;t believe this makes his followers violent. I believe this makes his followers targets, whenever the government decides it&#39;s fit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought this post was going to be about whether or not it&#39;s even worth wasting breath over this incident. I understand we&#39;re news hungry, but not every recent shooting (or any as far as I&#39;ve seen) is a government plot.</p>

<p>There are no actors at the LAX shooting.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no MK-Ultra brainwashing of the shooter.</p>

<p>That wasn&#39;t a dummy we saw being wheelchaired off the scene. It was a wounded/dead TSA officer.</p>

<p>Doing drills for airport shooters doesn&#39;t mean this was staged. The officer that said that wanted commendation for their timely preparedness.</p>

<p>Calling the shooter a conspiracy theorist doesn&#39;t invalidate real evidence. But when we cling so tightly to the idea that Big Brother is planning every single event that makes it onto the news, we&#39;re being just as closed-minded as everyone else.</p>

<p>Go ahead and disagree with me if you have some evidence, but I think this LAX event has no conspiracy behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree with you here.  As much as I want to investigate the truth behind things and determine whether they at least knew something about Boston before the fact, automatically assuming the gov&#39;t is behind every single violent event we see go down is damaging.  Why?  Because we have the power.  The power of our perception and how we view the world determines how much power we subconsciously give to an entity.  I&#39;m not saying their hands are clean by any means.  9/11 was a sham.  But, what is OUR true goal here?  To prove ourselves and delusions right once the gov&#39;t tries to take our guns?  Or do we want to find an internal peace and realize that we create peace within and by our relationships and sense of community.  I feel like it&#39;s too easy to get caught up in the whole paranoid delusion aspect of things and not rising above the lower vibration of fear.  This is not where we are suppose to dwell.  We have infinite power to impact our own microcosm.  If we allow them to destroy the sanctity of our mind and sovereign spirit then explain to me how that will help our cause?  It won&#39;t.  Peace must be sought.  Nobody can give it to except yourself once you realize that it means more than being proven right that the gov&#39;t is against us.  It is.  That&#39;s obvious.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. We are a community here. And I think one with a call to action. We could just log in and run our mouths about things, but that&#39;s just spinning our wheels. </p>

<p>I think there should be more discussion of what our next move should be. We&#39;ve all been enlightened to the distraction of the media; we don&#39;t need to spend anymore time talking about that. It&#39;s like learning pre-calc and then never moving onto calculus because you spend the rest of your life drilling the old, familiar problems, patting yourself on the back for how good you are at them.</p>

In all honesty does anyone actually think they can change something by picking up their &quot;sacred&quot; gun? Do you know what happens to people like the LAX shooter? We put them in the far reaches of our memory, probably never to come up again. No one will remember them, nobody really remembers protest.

    <div class="md"><p>How many times has violence resulted in (now not the term by definition) failed states? You think the U.S or Russia were stable? Perhaps for a time. But both countries, even though not considered 3rd world, are a large mess. Well, Russia was at least in a far worst off state. Take for example Canada. A country that gained its independence through democracy and peace. Sure, we&#39;re still barely tied to the monarchy but they don&#39;t control us so yeah, we&#39;re pretty independent. </p>

<p>So, careful what I preach? I preach the route that leads to less death, to less physical destruction. I believe protest by sit ins which has been proven historically to be effective is the best way to accomplish something. Dialogue is what needs to happen. I think his name is Bernie Sanders? Perhaps the only socialist in the white house which is important because he is a voice. Yes, only a singular voice but he got elected and if more like minded people actually tried to get into the mainstream then perhaps something could be achieved.    </p>

<p>What the States needs more than anything are independents. For to long this broken 2 party system has ruined your country. Elected independents will bring change, not today, not tomorrow, not next year, but, in time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there are exceptions like Canada that prove there are other ways to affect change. Though Canada has had its share of internal violence in its history, so it can&#39;t be held as a beacon of how it is best done. Many of the countries formed throughout history were formed by one sort of violence or another.  Those that weren&#39;t, are exceptions.</p>

<p>I too would like to see positive change happen without innocent bloodshed or horrific collateral damage, but from where I sit in the states, I don&#39;t see any factors lining up to make that possible.  The entrenched powers are not going to relinquish control based on popular sentiment or peaceful protest.  That is why they control the spin machine.</p>

<p>I whole-heartedly agree that the two party system is a joke in the US and only serves to hamper what was supposed to be a democratically elected representative republic.  But here, there is little if any success in changing the machine from within.  My theory on why that is is because we are not educated in the US. Taught, indoctrinated, instructed, but education does not focus on critical, independent thinking.  Which is exactly what we need to have an informed, voting populace which in turn is the only way to change the system from within. </p>

<p>So the &quot;change happens through democracy&quot; only applies to countries with informed voting bases. That is why I counseled you to be careful what you preach. Thanks for taking the time to read my response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who has worked on the ground during Canadian elections, it&#39;s hard. Especially with older folk who are so gung-ho on voting the way  their fathers voted or they vote a certain way because as you say, they&#39;ve been brought up a certain way. Which is extremely annoying.   </p>

<p>Yet, I personally respect how people vote and I think to myself, &quot;If there aren&#39;t any mishaps during the voting process then the will of the people has been put to a fair vote.&quot; Yes your voting system (same with mine) is distorted but, there is still a vote, there are still people who vote. Regardless of the turnout, everyone has that opportunity to go out and vote.    </p>

<p>Maybe, it&#39;s because I&#39;m studying political science and history that I have such faith in the intuition or maybe I&#39;m an optimist. But, you missed what I&#39;m advocating in your situation. Independents. Those are the key to actual change, representatives that are not accountable to anyone but the people who put them there (In theory). Would I want that kind of thing in Canada? No not really and believe it or not our history isn&#39;t violent as it is cruel and racist. That&#39;s besides the point though.      </p>

<p>Take for example France. Yes HUGE ass revolution. But, how many revolutions did it take after that to finally get to where we are? France is an extremely troubled country by the looks of it. Those countries that fought in bloodshed are just as broken as anything else.  I would never say that Canada is a beacon of hope, I know we aren&#39;t but we are as you said an exception and I&#39;m sure there are various other exceptions.    </p>

<p>What needs to happen is the same exact thing that happened during the Civil Rights movement (without the riots). Find a message. One that everyone can get behind. Get people who won&#39;t be seen as communists or hippies or bums or lazy people and project your message. This takes work and it is a process. I think the thing that went wrong with the Occupy movement is the fact that people were thought to be lazy bums who had nothing better to do. Don&#39;t be belligerent be peaceful and do not on any circumstance aggravate police.       </p>

<p>That has to be one of the worst things you can do. If at all possible ignore police officers do not curse them out, do not go near them, do not talk back in a manner which would anger them. Do not play their game.   </p>

<p>Honestly I love conversations that aren&#39;t mean hearted or terribly pretentious. I know the way I talk can come off that way but, that&#39;s what happens when you get put into an academic environment -.-</p>

<p>And what if the police decide to initiate violence?  This has been the case more and more often here in the states.  This then brings up the question of when is it justified to defend oneself and their fellow citizens against the government?  And what response to such police initiation is appropriate? I rarely ever heard these questions brought up among activists yet it is becoming more relevant the more police are militarized.</p>

<p>During the civil rights movement the police were not equipped nearly as well with both gear and tactics. Many Occupy protests learned that first hand.  And I must agree that the Occupy movement were not unified enough to gain ground.  Part of the problem there was the idea that there should be no leaders of it. This to me says that no one in the states wants to be that kind of target, which shows how the people view government response to leaders of social movements.</p>

<p>I understand your optimism, being a polisci/history student, but remember that many of those institutions you have faith in were established after bloody violence. Wasn&#39;t it Jefferson who said &quot;the tree of liberty must be renewed from time to time by the blood of patriots and tyrants&quot;?  I think he new power systems get entrenched and sometimes must be violently removed.  He probably would of been horrified by intelligent/informed the average voter is today as well.</p>

<p>But those same &quot;founding fathers&quot; who so violently established the US also built in internal mechanisms so that such violence wouldn&#39;t be necessary (though still possible). With the affluence of big money, those mechanisms are becoming less reliable and our representatives less representative of the people who vote for them. So my faith is not as solid as your own.</p>

<p>And honestly, I too enjoy conversations that don&#39;t deteriorate into name-calling or penis-measuring contests. ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Brilliant question. It would be silly of me to say &quot;we can&#39;t go based on what ifs&quot; because as you said this is becoming more of a real thing. I personally have not been to a protest but, I know there are videos that show police brutality. What I&#39;d like to see is if there was something that warranted the violence. There&#39;s two sides to every coin. That&#39;s just my opinion to keep this ground of all fairness.    </p>

<p>Video cameras are becoming more and more handy and have popped up way more frequently, perhaps too frequently. I want to point your attention to this video:    </p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151761060621969&amp;amp;set=vb.712316968&amp;amp;type=2&amp;amp;theater">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151761060621969&amp;amp;set=vb.712316968&amp;amp;type=2&amp;amp;theater</a>    </p>

<p>Camera phones are out to the point of being obnoxious, the guys instigated the fight with the officer but, the officer is shown to be the bad guy when the aggressor is arrested. Having lived in that province and being familiar with this issue I can tell you that this protest is a failed protest in numerous ways. (Check out the N.B fracking protests)   </p>

<p>So, camera phones only capture so much but what they do do is capture those moments of brutality. We all know what happens when the world sees. Never has there been positive feedback from a video of violence. But, in order to not to distort the facts the video should be shown in its entirety. Like the one I linked you with.     </p>

<p>I really feel as if Thomas Jefferson is perhaps a terrible example to use as moral reasoning. Yes yes I know I&#39;m using an ad homemin but, I think we can agree that a man as flawed as Jefferson should not be the poster child for change. On the subject of ideology, the whole notion of liberty falls in two different categories. If I&#39;m correct Jefferson would have been an adamant follower of negative liberty which has long since been denounced and positive liberty has become the norm. So, this tree is definitely not the same tree and it is not necessarily due to physical revolution but, a revolution of consciousness.   </p>

<p>On your last paragraph and the second last. I will admit that the States needs a complete overhaul but, I think there are different ways of going about it. See your talking to me via a medium. I&#39;m listening, learning taking this in as much as I possibly can. Why not apply this mode to a different medium. The T.V and education systems are where change needs to happen first. How do you change T.V? Well, Jon Stewart. The man has destroyed careers by just being...right. He&#39;s vocal but, he&#39;s only one man. Colbert, well he&#39;s useless to any cause of change.   Fine, I dislike his character but it&#39;s because I take him to seriously which I&#39;m sure some people do as well.    </p>

<p>You know what? I&#39;m sure if Reddit began its own political movement some traction would be gained. So many people from around the world especially America flock on here. Hell yeah, why not have online voting and choose our own presidential candidate? Voter turnout is already low wouldn&#39;t it be easy.....to play the game?     </p>

<p>That&#39;s the key. Play the game. George R.R Martin titled it best. &quot;A Game of Thrones.&quot; Politics is a game, can it be won? Of course! Maybe I&#39;m euphoric about elections because I&#39;m running in my student union one tomorrow (tomorrow and Wednesday are voting days!)  But change must happen peacefully. Do not fall into this notion that violence brings wanted change, it only brings fragmentation. Violence? Never, no matter the circumstances. Why? Because then you play their game of laws. You hit them where it hurts, the wallets. Sacrifices   must be made by us protesters.    </p>

<p>You might of course disagree but, playing their game is key. I cannot stress this enough.     </p>

<p>Btw...loving this conversation haha! I look forward to your response! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love your idealism! I remember being the same way before going to protests. But facing a crowd (not just a line) of police in riot gear gives one perspective. And I agree that it is not always &quot;evil cops&quot; and righteous protestors&quot;, that when violence happens there is enough blame to go around.</p>

<p>Camera phones and internet are indeed key to affecting peaceful change. It is truly a new development in our recorded history and has the potential for great change.  That is why the battle for the internet is so important right now. It allows for unbiased reporting of facts (or equally biased misinformation).  Never has a more powerful tool for social change been given to the average person since firearms became abundant.</p>

<p>And yes, Jefferson is not a poster child by any means (none of the Founding Fathers are). But he was an intelligent man, as many of them were. And he realized the importance of an educated, informed voting base. He knew that there was a time and place for both types of revolution and that neither should be discounted as an option for social/governmental change.</p>

<p>I agree that media and education must change to allow for future change and that technology makes it much easier to make the required change non-violent. But violence should not be looked at as being something that defines all other actions after it. In construction demolitions must sometimes take place to rebuild stronger or better. It&#39;s dirty, back-breaking labor, but doesn&#39;t have to reflect on what happens after. In fact, if done correctly and with skill, it can make all the building after it easier and better.  It is all a matter of perspective.</p>

<p>But back to politics. It is indeed a game, but one that has now become rigged.  Playing the game only perpetuates the game without benefiting those people it was meant and intended to serve. So I posit we need a new game one that adjusts for the corruption destroying the established game. Now if you can come up with a way to start a new game without the old one violently resisting it, then I will gladly advocate that!  But there is no hope of playing their game without becoming them and losing site of one&#39;s original intent. Even men like Stuart and Colbert are limited in what they can say or do due to the fact that their boss has stakes in the game.  So, time for a new game.</p>

<p>A there are no laws, rules, or regulation to violence. It is like water, just as fluid and dynamic while being just as forgiving (by which I mean not forgiving). That is why TPTB back so many non-violent ideologies. Violence scares them because they cannot control it.  No one can.  But like a wave, you can go with it or fight it.  The latter having less than desirable consequences. ;-)</p>

Some of us may have forgotten this, but it is still true. We all react to stress in different ways. Some of us react with violence, and that violence may not be effectively directed -- it may not accomplish anything useful in the short term for those who resort to it. However, each reaction to the indignities, the humiliations, the tyrannies, adds to the total human response, which collectively forms a revolutionary current in society. You may not believe that the LA shooter accomplished anything useful, but don&#39;t be too quick to dismiss his contribution to the overall revolt that is taking place. It is a small thing in itself, but it is part of a much larger movement of outrage and a yearning for justice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you telling anyone here? Why aren&#39;t you considering that this LAX shooter is Patsy McPlant? Why would he bring &quot;conspiracy material&quot; with him unless to say that it causes mass murder? Why would someone end their life (it&#39;s over for him essentially) on such a cause? Since that doesn&#39;t make sense, what makes more sense is that he was wound up and set off. Who took him to the airport by the way, if someone?</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t sound normal even by the standards for &quot;off the tracks&quot; disturbed person.</p>

<p>So far, there&#39;s common theme, people who randomly shoot other people are in some kind of zombie mindset, which was even reported by that US solder in Afghanistan, who killed whole bunch of civilians. He had said that he couldn&#39;t  remember what had happen.

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone else think having guns and ammo is the worst possible thing we can do as responsible citizens looking to maintain our freedom and change the status quo?</p>

<p>Hear me out before you down vote. Think about it. If the government could control your brain with their frequency machines and make you do something like the LAX incident or, Navy yards, etc, right on down the line of many more &quot;false flag&quot; events... then why should you have guns and ammo around? Won&#39;t it make you easier to frame, or just kill and say, &quot;he was a t_____ist&quot;? What&#39;s the point if our government is armed to the teeth as is? Fight fire with smaller fire?</p>

<p>Fight fire with water. I get it, &quot;protect ourselves from tyranny by possessing firearms&quot;. That supposes by owning guns you are on equal technological footing with the government police state. There&#39;s just no way that&#39;s possible any more. </p>

<p>It&#39;s going to come down to non-violent resistance of the system and progressing by building what we want to see instead of focusing on the old crap. The consciousness will have to change. Having guns makes you a liability to to any kind of beneficial change, in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it, stockpiling weapons for the expressed purpose of preparing for some kind of violent endgame is useless. However, owning guns simply for hunting, or target practice, or just because they are neat (really, some pistols from the 1800s are quite lovely pieces of art), I&#39;m all for it. Furthermore, such gun owners should not be made to feel like criminals because some drug runner lights up the place. </p>

<p>However, even with that being said, (and please do not take this out of context or view this as condoning the actions of said people) look at the successes of Al Qaida against the US. We&#39;re talking the warfare equivalent of sticks and stones against F22s and Abrams tanks. Success can be achieved, but at astronomical cost. This is only if you measure success not by winning battles, but by making the war too costly to maintain. A protracted war is a lost one. </p>

<p>Sun Tzu, even if his work is no longer secret, still has some damn good advice. However, it can be used in nonviolent methods, which we must cling to tooth and nail. </p>

He isn&#39;t THE TSA, but merely a messenger.  A majority of the people who work at LAX are all locals from that area, which is why they all work there.  LAX is a MAJOR job provider.  But seriously, who knows anyone who aspires to work for the TSA.  No one!  But they are one of the big job providers within LAX, and people will take those jobs because they have to provide for their family.  And now this shooter has robbed a family of their father and the TSA will continue being the TSA and security will only get tighter now at LAX..  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks OP. I think that what people forget is that this is a precedent. The things that we are witnessing now in the context of OMG THE WORLD IS ENDING have no preset defense mechanisms in the human body. The best we can do is have a support system and healthy outlets. </p>

<p>I think right now it&#39;s extremely important to build IRL relationships that will withstand the impact of this information in its entirety. Undoubtedly there will even be groups of people who do not have the resources to rebuild a community or go into political warfare (protesting, grafitti, etc). But being mentally prepared is just as important as stockpiling food or weapons.</p>

<p>There is never a valid reason to harm an innocent person, nor anyone for that matter who is not a direct threat to one&#39;s safety.</p>

<p>To simply be cognizant of the corrupt nature endemic in our society is neither a legitimate cause nor justification for violent behavior.

Remember, in order for a lie to be believable, it has to have a kernel of truth. We are heavily armed, quite literally preparing for combat, and some of us believe the president is a fucking lizard man. </p>

<p>Nowhere do I say that we&#39;re a breeding ground for mass murderers. However, you&#39;re a fuckin&#39; liar if you say that not a single one of us hasn&#39;t considered putting a bullet in a politician&#39;s head. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do keep trying to make this point: systemic problems have to be solved systematically.  There simply isn&#39;t any one man anywhere in U.S. government that you can shoot and magically make the world a better place.  Presidents have been killed before, and the government did not stop chugging along.  And if you resort to enough violence to make an actual change... well, it&#39;ll be the sort of change that comes from violence.  I have a feeling the U.S. wouldn&#39;t survive much of that, and as I happen to live here I&#39;m somewhat opposed to that.</p>

<p>If at all possible ignore police officers do not curse them out, do not go near them, do not talk back in a manner which would anger them. Do not play their game.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what if the police decide to initiate violence?  This has been the case more and more often here in the states.  This then brings up the question of when is it justified to defend oneself and their fellow citizens against the government?  And what response to such police initiation is appropriate? I rarely ever heard these questions brought up among activists yet it is becoming more relevant the more police are militarized.</p>

<p>During the civil rights movement the police were not equipped nearly as well with both gear and tactics. Many Occupy protests learned that first hand.  And I must agree that the Occupy movement were not unified enough to gain ground.  Part of the problem there was the idea that there should be no leaders of it. This to me says that no one in the states wants to be that kind of target, which shows how the people view government response to leaders of social movements.</p>

<p>I understand your optimism, being a polisci/history student, but remember that many of those institutions you have faith in were established after bloody violence. Wasn&#39;t it Jefferson who said &quot;the tree of liberty must be renewed from time to time by the blood of patriots and tyrants&quot;?  I think he new power systems get entrenched and sometimes must be violently removed.  He probably would of been horrified by intelligent/informed the average voter is today as well.</p>

<p>But those same &quot;founding fathers&quot; who so violently established the US also built in internal mechanisms so that such violence wouldn&#39;t be necessary (though still possible). With the affluence of big money, those mechanisms are becoming less reliable and our representatives less representative of the people who vote for them. So my faith is not as solid as your own.</p>

<p>And honestly, I too enjoy conversations that don&#39;t deteriorate into name-calling or penis-measuring contests. ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you just going to keep asking me the same question over and over again? I thought I explained this, or do you not read my responses?  You must not. I will try and simplify this for you since you seem to be having some sort of issue with my statements, so here goes:</p>

<p>A firearm is a tool because it has a use outside of war and one doesn&#39;t need specialized education to operate one. Nukes, biological/chemical weapons, and certain high explosives have absolutely no use by the average citizen outside of war.  Therefor, due to their highly specialized nature, cannot be considered tools. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why you can&#39;t seem to wrap your head around this concept or why you&#39;re so adamant about lumping firearms with highly specialized military WMDs. Why are you so insistent on lumping it all together?</p>
