       Now I didn't really want to believe it because I personally like Russell Brand and agree with the things he says. But my curiosity got the best of me as I had been shocked when he had started to come out against the big banksters and the NWO (although he never names it specifically, it's basically what he's talking about).
       <em>
        I mean he used to be married to Katy Perry for Christ's sake, how intellectual and concerned about society can this guy be
       </em>
       ? And we all know how the elite like to create distractions for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I looked into a few things about him. He was in a recent relationship with a woman named Jemima Khan (a.k.a. Goldsmith), associate editor of the New Statesman and editor of Vanity Fair and she also writes for various British newspapers.
      </p>
      <p>
       She is the daughter of a man named Sir James Michael Goldsmith, a billionaire financier, magazine editor and politician. The Goldsmiths had previously been known as the Goldschmidts, but Sir James's father, a German Jew, had decided to change it. This man, Frank Goldschmidt, was also a billionaire luxury hotel tycoon and former Conservative Member of Parliament. He was also a
       <strong>
        rival and neighbor to the ROTHSCHILD FAMILY
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Khan also has two younger brothers, Zac Goldsmith (British Conservative Party politician, Member of Parliament since 2010, journalist, entrepreneur) and Ben Goldsmith (financier and a co-founder and manager of a "sustainability"-focused investment firm.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Ben got married to banking heiress
       <strong>
        Kate Emma Rothschild
       </strong>
       in 2003, while Zac married her sister,
       <strong>
        Alice Miranda Rothschild
       </strong>
       , in March of this year. Just a little incestuous, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm not saying this means Brand can't be trusted, but
       <strong>
        why would he begin speaking out against the big banksters and the corporate elite while he was dating one of their daughters
       </strong>
       whose family is directly intertwined with the Rothschild family???

       Ive always seen him as a psychonaut almost. Its hard to talk about some of the things he does the way he does without truly knowing the subjects at a deeper level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps it barely clicked for him. Or maybe he thought speaking out now was the best time to do so.

       RuSell Brand is fake.  He is pushing an agenda.  He is pushing the socialist marxist agenda and he kisses the elite's asses.  Once he gets into the elite club, he'll start wearing top hats and monocles and not be remotely funny at all anymore.

       Since giving up drugs he's been really getting into spirituality self improvement, and obviously as he gets more famous people ask for his opinion in more public arena's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that Jemima Khan is actually a bit of an activist, and put up some of the bail for Assange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also note that Brand has always tried to push boundaries, including wanking another guy off in a pub toilet for a TV show (and having a prostitute and her family move in with him, and sharing a Bath with a tramp)

       The main message of his recent interview is "hey young people -- don't vote!!"  It is well known that the GOP generally opposes anything that would make it easier for college students to vote.   The talk of revolution muddles this -- in the near term revolution isn't very likely, but young people being lazy is very likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       This next presidential election will be incredibly important, and the GOP has more to lose.  The next president will decide the ideological makeup of the Supreme Court for a generation, and the Dems and GOP are perhaps farthest apart on the type of justices they nominate.  Losing the presidency three times in a row would be devastating for the GOP; hasn't happened since FDR.
      </p>
      <p>
       I halfway expect a Ralph Nader type to be propped up as spoiler for the Dems if it looks like it will be a close election.

       He's too famous to be legit.  Plus he pushes global government and shit like that.  Rogan is the same.  He is too famous and out in the open to be able to say anything legit.  Its all about grabbing the like minded but gullible types and dragging them into your own mindset.  That is what these people's job is.

       Ya, I honestly don't think Rogan is controlled opposition or whatever term you'd like to use. Or if he is, I don't know who he'd be working for. A lot of the stuff that I've heard talked about on his podcast is the kind of stuff that gets discussed here all the time. I.E. Military industrial complex, CIA involvement in drug trafficking, US middle eastern policy, to even aliens and the spiritual aspects of psychedelics like shrooms and dmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might not agree with him, but I do think its good he is around because he introduces a lot of people to the kind of stuff I just mentioned. Getting people thinking is always a good thing.

       Whaaaa? DMT and psilocybin, if used responsibly and sparingly, show you the true nature of the universe.

       I do not use them, but have, and am far better for it 20 years later.

       Unless they were trying to control the experience.  Famous people push psychedelics in order to control the interpretation of the experience.  They give you the "expected result" and all of a sudden every time you take shrooms or do DMT you have this vivid deep experience that you interpret just like they told you how to interpret.  Its all about controlling the expected outcome.  Propaganda works dude.

       He's a self-confessed sex addict so I can see him getting off on the idea of screwing Jemima Khan.  He flirted with Mika Brezinski in a roundabout way and she was a bit turned on by it, judging by her body language.  I can see someone like him being turned on by the idea of both liking/fucking one of them and also using her in an experimental sense at the same time, maybe attempting to get to the bottom of the whole illuminati thing by infiltrating.  He's very aware of nlp, coercive language, body language etc.   and I can imagine him having great fun mind-fucking these woman  and at the same time genuinely liking them and wanting to be with them.  He's a lower class boy at heart and the classes in the UK don't intermingle willingly, from what I know of the many I've met.   The disdain the lower classes have for the very highest classes runs deep.   If you, as a CT'er, could have one of these women really really like you and want to be with you, would you maybe go with it, just to see what kind of info could be gleaned?  Throw in some good E and it's confession time.

       So for him the connections mean nothing, just boys being boys but when it's an obviously funded political douche bag it's different? Why, just because he's preaching the things we believe? I just outlined the connections, that's it. And in other cases connections are everything. Are we going to overlook them this time because this man comes on TV and says some buzz words?

       and that's what I posted about: my conspiracy theory. Do you have anything to contribute? No, I didn't think so.

       I never saw the previous posts, if it's a repost I apologize for calling you a dick but I literally just came across this info. I'm just not really sure why it's characterized as womanizing for Brand while these types of connections would be used as hardcore evidence of involvement for some other high paid politician like Obama (J.P. Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs) or Cheney (Haliburton). I don't think these powerful families let people into their circle for no reason. And she's not that hot anyway...
