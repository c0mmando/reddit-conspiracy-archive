    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Snowden is likely doing his job as a government agent.</p>

<p>But you&#39;ve got the motive all wrong.  Obama clearly doesn&#39;t want to stop spying--after all, there are many more effective methods he could take to stop this.  They are doing this operation for other reasons.  </p>

<p>One, I think they are trying to scare us by exaggerating their power--that they are the all seeing eye.  </p>

<p>Two, I think they are acknowledging the existence of some real programs so they can justify using this information against us.  By putting the existence of these programs into the wider consciousness they can begin to chip away at societal opposition.  Fifteen years ago huge majorities of people would have been appalled at such wide scale spying and wouldn&#39;t want the gov. to use this information.  Now, people are starting to get used to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you so sure about this. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon&#x27;s_razor">Hanlon&#39;s Razor</a> generally seems to be a good principle to go by when trying to uncover conspiracy. Far from the apathy you suggested, more and more people are angered by some of the revelations about the NSA spying program, and against the US Gov&#39;t in general (look at the Congress&#39; approval rating, or approval of intervention in Syria). </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to undermine your claim, but you seem so sure of it, and I&#39;d like to hear your reasons why, perhaps even historical examples of what you&#39;re suggesting to make this claim seem more reasonable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I no longer trust opinion polls, especially on political subjects.</p>

<p>But even assuming that people don&#39;t like spying and don&#39;t like going to war, this opposition does not translate into government policy.  </p>

<p>Heck, we already have historical examples from less than 6 years ago was it?  Remember the Telecon spying controversy?  Which is basically what Snowden has &quot;revealed&quot; and what we knew about from almost 10 years ago.  People were pissed and Obama and the Democrats promised to stop it and hold people accountable  but they ended up legalizing this spying retroactively!  So they had their chance to punish officials and hold private companies accountable but they didn&#39;t.  The did the opposite.  <strong>You can largely thank Obama for making what was once against the law, your telephone company or email company giving the government your phone messages and email, legal!</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I know that politicians are likely just grandstanding and taking advantage of the situation, but my question is not about how the politicians responded to the event, but whether they <em>incited the event in the first place</em>. </p>

<p>There seems to me, to be no real advantage in creating a media shit-storm if they can just do things quietly in the background like they normally do. It seems more likely to me that politicians are just saving face after a real leak, rather than leaking and then trying to patch the hole just for public show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why did Obama and the Dems make such a big deal bout the Telecom violations, and Bush era violations?  </p>

<p>I think they want the controversy and incited it.  That&#39;s what the facts show they did.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s actually a classic M.O.  TPTB create both sides of a controversy so they can control the debate.  They got critics invested in the opposition of the Democrats and Obama and then Obama and the Dems <em>betrayed</em> them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Hanlon&#39;s Razor&quot; is a prime example of a fallacy. There is no reason to assume those who commit malicious acts are &quot;always just doing it because they are stupid&quot;. Nor is stupidity a good excuse for one&#39;s actions. Those who commit the really malicious acts are not only stupid, but most of them know very well what they are doing, and they are very malicious.</p>

<p>That being said, I don&#39;t think Snowden works for the government. He seems to have good intentions, judging from several videos. Body language, manner of speaking, etc are good things to look at to get an idea. But he is not unique in being a whistleblower, not even unique for being an NSA whistleblower. What he did get was a lot more media attention because of the way he did it. The real truth goes a lot deeper than the things he has revealed so far, and up to now the people have not taken any true action. Maybe once we get some truly shocking and undeniable revelations for all to see...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve given up hope that Obama will pull out the stops and live up to attitude he campaigned on in &#39;08.</p>

<p>And to answer your question I think it&#39;s possible but improbable for nefarious reasons. But the idea of a whistle-blower isn&#39;t so difficult to believe. The possibility comes from the fact that general knowledge in a pacified population of spying in almost all forms of communication induces somewhat of a &quot;chilling effect&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect</a></p>

<p>Already I see the trope of &quot;don&#39;t say that, the NSA is listening, lol&quot; becoming common, which is a sad and dangerous road to go down.</p>

<p>Another thing: fear serves the interests of TPTB. By inducing general paranoia you create a subtle &quot;background radiation&quot; of fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe this whole dog and pony show is centered around stripping the U.S. of its sovereignty. Just today I&#39;m seeing numerous articles regarding international treaties superseding the constitution. The globalists are using snowden to tarnish the alliances we have with other countries and to strip any remaining obedience or respect the people of U.S. still might have for the government. Probably ties directly into the whole trans-pacific partnership shabang. </p>

However, I disagree with what you&#39;re saying about Obama. I have trust issues with him, and there&#39;s executive orders in place that could end a lot of our problems quickly. One of those executive orders is to completely end the fed, not to mention ending war. Good question though.</p>

<p>Grandest_Inquisitor is correct about exaggeration of power; they&#39;ve got to keep Joe Average thinking that NSA, NCIS and CSI know everything, everywhere. (Although, if that&#39;s true, why hasn&#39;t NSA actually <em>stopped</em> anything?)</p>

<p>Obama is just re-playing his &quot;Those <em>insiders</em> are out of control!&quot; record. He&#39;s still campaigning against &quot;the Washington establishment&quot; as if he hasn&#39;t been a part of it since 2005.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just put this in another post but it belongs here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m almost wondering if the Snowden leaks are about finding a backdoor to get a SOPA/CISPA type piece of crap into &quot;law&quot;. Create an &quot;emergency&quot; with lots of players crying crocodile tears and all of a sudden the terds in chage get an opportunity to pass legislation to address &quot;national security concerns&quot;.</p>

<p>Essentially creating a problem, get the voters all whipped up and not paying attention, and bend them over giving them something they vehemently oppose under the ruse of making them safer. That has been the game plan that has gotten them this far.</p>

<p>Like all big, wasteful government jobs programs, the NSA will not go away.  Obama needs the jobs and these are the only ones that the GOP will give him since these types of government workers vote for them.  The only way to get rid of it is to vote for activist politicians outside the two party oligopoly or with the balls to defy the political parties and their corporate masters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this exposure of corruption is all apart of a plan. This will cause unrest and will work even better during the economic crisis. </p>

<p>The exposure of corruption will be used by certain leaders to gain a positive favor among the people. Those that exposed and weren&#39;t corrupt will be looked to as leaders in the new paradigm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe.</p>

<p>If I were in control of a powerful but unpopular milt-trillion dollar intelligence / surveillance apparatus that I wanted to expand, but couldn&#39;t because of public opinion - this is how I would play it: </p>

<p>1) Ignite public ire with single particular agency (snowden)</p>

<p>2) Ignite international ire with same agency to create diplomatic pressure (again, snowden)</p>

<p>3) Allow charismatic leader to close down that agency and/or send a bunch of dudes to jail. </p>

<p>4) Make an announcement - &quot;The NSA can&#39;t be trusted, but the Homeland Information Awareness office can be...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Today, I&#39;m announcing a new agency. One which will be directly overseen by this office to avoid these kinds of violations in the future. The Homeland Information Awareness office will be able to provide this nation wth the security it needs, while respecting the rights of our citizens... blah blah blah...&quot;</p>

<p>4) Prior to announcing the agency, sign half a dozen executive orders and railroad some ambiguous legislation through a midnight session of congress to get all the powers I want, above the scrutiny of anyone due to &quot;state secrets&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s what Obama or our government is doing - I&#39;m saying that&#39;s what I would do. But you can bet that a few dozen people way smarter than me have been planning this for a hot minute, with all kinds of resources at their disposal (academics, focus groups, think tanks, etc.) - so we&#39;ll see...</p>
