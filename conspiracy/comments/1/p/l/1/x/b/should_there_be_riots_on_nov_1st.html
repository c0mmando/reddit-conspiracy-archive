    <div class="md"><p>&quot;1.) Criminalize people.&quot; if you are talking about the amount of people that are in jail, I am sure that many agree that it is wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;2.) Punish them.&quot; I believe that you are saying to punish them, if not this part makes little sense.</p>

<p>&quot;Soviet tactics for population control.&quot; ???</p>

<p>your writing is fragmented an broken at best. but as to your question, no we should never riot! that would prove that we need to be governed. we need to stand. when they knock us down, we need to get back up and stand. </p>

<p>The veterans did the right thing in not fighting them. violence is their game, peace is ours. we know we are going to win, they know we are going to win. the cops that just want a fight, those need to be arrested and have to defend against a REAL criminal charge, under the Common Law. if we fight they win. if we resist them every time we have to talk to them, if we let them know that they are criminals every time we see them. hell who would want to be called &quot;traitor to your oath&quot; every time you get out of your car, and have their families be ridiculed everywhere they go. if they are identified for the damage they do to everyone. </p>

<p>I hope this answer is broken and fragmented enough for you to understand.</p>

<p>Whether you think it&#39;s right or not people will get upset when their children are forced to literally starve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  Absolutely not.  What there should be is a mass, MASS congregation of individuals willing to help one another independent of the manipulating system we live in.  Rioting is for stupid sheep - stupid pigs.  What needs to happen is the type of organization and coordination that people like <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/photo/2007/12/21/PH2007122101527.jpg">Martin Luther King</a>, <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/cartermyths/Pics/March.gif">Malcolm X</a>, and <a href="http://beautifultrouble.org/wp-content/uploads/Beautiful%20Trouble/CASE%20Salt%20March/CA_Salt%20March_Gandhi.jpg">Gandhi</a> exhibited.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m beginning to think that such a force of people should not be oppositional.</p>

<p>I think they should be focused on a goal and all other considerations should be secondary. That is to say; I don&#39;t think the U.S. Federal Government should be the goal or focus. The reasoning is that the same energy and effort could be spent on something positive and good. As where merely opposing the U.S. Federal Government will only have the end goal of - I have no idea what. </p>

<p>Kind of like The Count of Monte Christo. Anyone in the revenge business should dig two graves; one for the other guy and one for themselves. We should not put ourselves in the position of even implicitly being more petty than the U.S. Federal Government.</p>

<p>Real world example:</p>

<p>The United States was originally founded on just doing their own thing. They did not go to England. England came to them. This was a tactically genius plan. Protracted wars expend resources. England had to spend all the money and time to get troops there. All the Colonists had to do was sit tight and pick them off.</p>

<p>But the point, at all times, was for them to do their own thing.</p>

<p>I think that we should simply regard the U.S. Federal Government in a similar context. They&#39;re an alien and aggressive entity that uses violence for purposes that are non-beneficial; worse still, hey steal our resources and toil. If you regard the U.S. Federal Government as a fundamentally psychopathic entity then the only option - literally the only option - is to disengage and let the thing die on its own. Any engagement whatsoever will only give it power.</p>

<p>. . .</p>

<p>Then again, on a symbolic level, I agree with you.</p>

<p>I would likely cheer for such a sight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ultimate goal should be freedom from nefarious manipulation and tyranny.  This would in part involve the people simply coming together and helping one another.  Stop paying taxes, start helping one another.  Easier said than done, but that&#39;s the way.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I&#39;m pretty much agreeing with everything you said.</p>

<p>Most of us are too trapped in our minds, however, to simply just start DOING the things we have to as a citizenry.  We need to communicate with one another about a planned societal paradigm shift.  This tends to involve public communication, and that public communication often involves a demonstration so that all the pertinent groups can know what is planned.  The practical implications of just going through with what we need to do as a people independent of any political manipulation hits roadblocks if the ideas are not properly or successfully disseminated.  This dissemination tends to involve some sort of public spreading of the ideas so that many can listen to the ideas, agree with them, and get on board.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Foodstamps are not being shut off Nov. 1st. Everyone on foodstamps will have $38 less. This amount is equal across the board nationwide to make up for the gap in funding.  This has been on mainstream news even. Single folks without dependants will be asked to work 20 hours a week or go through job training classes. My advice to anyone dependant on foodstamps is this: learn to grow a garden, preserve food and save seeds. You can even use foodstamps to buy seeds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gardening is an almost lost art form now gaining more momentum. And by art I mean the balance of nature and man. Nothing is more beautiful. The more people work with the Earth and not against it the more the chances of survival increase. I imagine in the next 20 years all of us being forced to live like our Great Grandparents. If we prepare now for a much simpler lifestyle and a lot more physical labor to achieve it we have less chaos, fear, and rioting. Better yet if we teach our children these principals, and set an example we can raise a generation of capable adults forming a new paradigm. Growing food is key. Storing it and saving seeds becomes a huge step in long term self sufficiency. Also for bartering. Finding and purifying water. Cooking from scratch and over a fire, solar oven or woodstove. Building structures, forming communities, developing a viable skill if there was no govt.  or programs serving the needy, hunting, fishing, raising animals for food and preserving it all after the slaughter. I can only imagine the average Joe if faced with learning these skills all of this sudden. This is not a call for extremism in &quot;prepping&quot;, but wrather a reminder to look at where you live and how you live. Could you survive a solar flare taking down the grid, martial law, no foodstamps in a few days, natural disasters, false flags creating chaos, or even an extreme winter? I can only hope the average Joe wakes up to the understanding that learning to work with the land becomes priceless in a world of folks caught up in a crumbling society. </p>

<p>Nah, you just pass laws that inevitably will incriminalize people. (i.e. outlawing homelessness, then bagging up all the homeless as criminals. )</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) punish them</p>

<p>Its better to stage an event that will make them ask/beg for help. This &quot;help&quot; would normally be unpopular, but if this event is horrifying enough, the people will accept it. This &quot;help&quot; could come in the form of punishment as seen inbordinary times, but post-event it would be viewed as &quot;help.&quot; See 9/11 and patriot act.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Riots are actually what is reported to as being prepared for. Guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and stuff like that would be way more effective at disabling the criminals.</p>

<p>For example are the homeland armored vehicles. They&#39;re for crowd control. Maybe you could disable them by baiting them to a place where they could be jacked up, then not be able to drive? Things like this.</p>

<p>TL; DR. No, don&#39;t riot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These days all are an enemy of the state.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never wanted to own a gun in my life. I&#39;m afraid of them.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m thinking that a gun might be formally necessary as a defensive measure.</p>

<p>As we all know - the NAZIs didn&#39;t lose. They simply moved countries.</p>
