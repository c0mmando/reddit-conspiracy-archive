       I don't think Russel Brand plan for a one world socialist system with massive taxation and redistribution of wealth by an unnamed central body(world government) is the way to go, I think that's what the new world order wants. They want a one world government with the power to tax everyone, with the power to print money and power to own everything and then take it from you to give to somebody else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just watch the video again he even says that there will be a central authority (when the questionnaire asked if the body is "government", he said you can call it whatever you want) to do the redistribution, to do the taxation to have the power to take private property, to have the power to take all of your money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to remind people that this is what Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, Mao, etc... all spewed and we all know what happened. This is pure evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russel Brand is a tool of the new world order, he is a Zionist Jew who is an agent of the new world order who is being poised as the new Jesus Christ someone you can believe in to smother you into a one world government system of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having a world government, world system that can redistribute wealth, tax you for breathing, that has such power is the danger. If anything we want to get rid of centralized system of control and power and empower the individual and find solutions locally on an individual basis rather than a world basis by giving power to a system of control.

       You are fighting your own shadow, He said nothing about a one world system and socialism isnt a dirty word if applied correctly, he is thinking outside the box and offers a real world solution to fight the globalist plutocracy. You are still hung up on cold war propaganda.

       This. Russel Brand has not offered any solutions and is not advocating a one world government. He is expressing the need for a revolution and a rejection of a system that has become destructive to it's own peoples well being and happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the very foundation upon which the United States was founded. 
The Declaration of Independence expresses this in great detail:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
        </p>
        <p>
         We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --
         <strong>
          That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness
         </strong>
         . Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that
         <strong>
          mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government
         </strong>
         , and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's time to reject the current system, and form a new one. And I think the people are just about ready for that.

       Yet we as a people all have inherent interests which
       <strong>
        are

       Friend. I have been thinking on this idea for a while. It is hard to convey in written words.. but I hope you take time to read it and think about it. Find a flaw in the concept and improve it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Open source democracy.
Imagine it like a social media website, open source.
If you are running a different version of the program to everyone else, it doesn't work. (I imagine this can be checked somewhat like bitcoin, thousands of different users check miniscule sections randomly/anonymously and all have to confirm it as legit)
From there you are able to propose, or vote on others propositions for the use of communal resources. I imagine society to be far more communal agriculture based, with local industry organised in the anarchist co op style.
You can vote on things further and further from your actual geographic location, with the 'specificity' of the resource allocation becoming broader the bigger the area you are exerting your vote in. In your own village you can vote down to how many meters apart the streetlights are placed on the new street, one village/community over you can only vote on whether the new street is constructed in the first place, someone who lives 10 cities over can only vote as to resources allocated towards planning and infrastructure in that area.
      </p>
      <p>
       This works on a bigger scale too. A large, resource producing island can justify importing or using more of the communal resources from its mainland.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could also work for laws. The basics human rights obviously are universal, but your vote or political input is only going to get attention in areas with similar views. People move to areas that contain a majority that align with their cultural views, no geographical borders.
      </p>

       Its strange but I was thinking of something almost exactly the same that cuts out government bureaucracy entirely from all levels of decision making, with todays technology it is very possible, this sort of direct democracy would require a free press and a somewhat politically active population, I think this system could be perfect if planned out and implemented correctly to cut out human flaws entirely from government.

       What I find most interesting in all of this is the online backlash. The video got posted, then reposted. And when it got traction and votes, it was pulled down by mods repeatedly across subs. When THAT didn't curb the conversation, here comes hastily constructed hit pieces from authors that clearly didn't actually listen to the interview and all kinds of nasty slandering and falsehoods from other people who clearly never heard what he actually said.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't subscribe to his ideology wholecloth, but I can say he makes good points. No one is calling for a leader of the revolution, especially not Brand. Who was, in the interview most of the naysayers didn't watch, adamant that he does not want or consider himself to be a revolutionary leader. Only that he feels a revolution is necessary and already under way.

       The issue is that he is speaking like a radical, but "without any solution".  And the soapbox that he climbed up on is basically a thinktank for the Fabian system which every neoliberal policy seems to be geared towards progressing.  (To be clear- Neoliberalism is not Keynesian or socialist in it's own right, but is part of the path that Fabianism has laid out towards the One World Order socialist structure).  So he is supporting a solution, he's just not willing to utter it's name.

       The great conspiracy is that Socialism IS the plan.  I'm not saying it's a bad plan, but that's exactly what's been in the works for the past hundred years.  He's not offering a radical solution, he's advocating the same solution pursued by the powerbrokers.  And that may be fine, but let's acknowledge what we're witnessing here.  I don't think I would frame it like OP as him being a pawn of the "Jew World Order" and being illuminated as the "Second Coming of Jesus", but aside my visceral reaction to the subtle racism and messianic reference, OP isn't wrong.

       Socialism is immoral because it requires force. I agree with all the problems he speaks of, but his solutions are just more tax, more central control mechanisms. Glad he's addressing the real problems, but more government is not the answer. You can have a massive redistribution  of wealth just by dissolving the corporations that are destroying the economy and the environment. They have clearly violated the law and their corporate charters should be revoked. People should be held accountable. Banks should be allowed to fail etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that, let's see where we are.

       Russell Brand is a libertarian socialist, not a state socialist. And btw, socialism doesn't just mean more government. That is Cold War propaganda the US government has used to destroy any leftist movement in America. And it's been working.

       I'm having trouble understanding all this libertarian socialism thing. Every advocate says there is no central authority, claims it's essentially anarcho-capitalism or anarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, Brand never says dissolve corporations. He wants to leave them and have government step in, use force, and knock a "fair" amount of money out of these companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone can explain what the premises and goals are of libertarian socialism and how it's different than anarcho-capitalism, I'd love to know more.

       You're right, but at it's core it still means more Government. The clearest lesson left by our founding fathers was that more Government in any case at all, is a bad idea. Besides, what's the deal with this idea that we need to change everything? Don't get me wrong, the current system is broken, but it's so severely perverted from the core principles of the original Government that it's completely unrecognizable. Granted, some changes need to occur to modernize the Constitution, but what's wrong with simply following it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialism has been around for decades, and everyone argues that Socialism at it's core has never really been tried. I think the real problem is, Socialism has been perverted into several different categories, or structures, so no one really knows what Socialism is anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, Socialism, or anything close to it, is not the answer we should be looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr; Socialism is not the answer, and it's not because of "Cold War Propaganda", it's because it's more Government.

       Norway is not a socialist country, nor is Germany, and Canada isn't either.
      </p>
      <p>
       All 3 countries implement socialistic policies similar, albeit perhaps more extensive, as social policies offered in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering them Socialist simply because of the few socialist policies they have is silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I just wanted to elaborate on this further in case it wasn't clear. Germany has a capitalist economy, Norway in no way can be considered an example of a socialistic economy as it is considered to be more capitalistic than the U.S.A., and Canada actually does have problems with business growth due to high taxation, which also affects it's working class as well.

       Christ, instead of resorting to personal attacks like calling me a moron, perhaps you should take your own advice. Those countries are not socialist, otherwise America would be socialist, which while I cannot argue it is still a Constitutional Republic, it certainly isn't considered socialist.

       Do you believe in social security or medicare? If so you are also a socialist as well. If a government taxes it citizens or corporations and redistributes that money to its citizens they are a socialist government. If you support these programs you too are a socialist by definition.

       Social policies, while being "socialistic", do not make the Government which supports, enacts, or otherwise uses them Socialist. If I support Social Security or Medicare, I support Social Programs, I do not support Socialism.

       Again, as I've said multiple times, while the U.S.A. and other countries may use, or otherwise institute socialist programs, and while those programs are inherently socialist, it does not make the Government which does so to be Socialist. There are certain characteristics of Socialism that must be met before one can consider a form of Governance to be Socialist. There is no country in the world which implements an entirely Socialistic form of Governance, and while Socialism can be a very broad term, simply considering a Government Socialist because of few policies it's implemented is absolutely incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you try to tell others they need to learn what Socialism is, please be sure you yourself actually understand it's inherent principles, and what particular political environments are required for it to be such.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, if you have any retort of "you don't know what Socialism is, plz lern muh socials", don't bother. I am exhausted with the inability of those who profess others need to learn a subject, yet have either no knowledge, or otherwise a severe lack of logic to understand what it is they are professing to those to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope this helps clear up what Socialism is, and what it is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       America is not Socialist simply because it has Food Stamps, Medicare, and/or Social Security.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if we are to subscribe to your overly simplistic way of thinking, Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution which states:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers...
        <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/tocs/a1_2_3.html">
         3
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which deals with direct taxes, such as that of Income Tax, would make The United States of America Socialist. I believe everyone here, including you, knows that is not true, the United States was, at the time of the ratification of the Constitution, a Constitutional Republic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 is Socialist in the sense that its goal is redistribution of wealth by direct taxation, but it does not inherently make the Government, nor the Country for that matter, Socialist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope I've proven my point to you.

       he said a global utopia. watch it. and as he described his system, it is totalitarian. doesn't let anyone produce or consume without permission from the new political class. yay.
i wish i could buy him a beer, because he misdefines "profit" as the relocation of government ration coupons, rather than as an increase in production over consumption.

       socialism is force, you know. You can't pretend that its not. We have clear examples in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everywhere socialism has been tried its always led to millions dying from starvation alone, massive inequality, massive poverty, massive surveillance and control grid, massive oppression.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have the proof, its one thing if it hasn't been tried and you can theoretically argue that its heavenly, that its amazing, that socialism is what god wants us to have, that socialism is perfection and all that garbage, but facts are its a devilish system of control of totalitarianism of oppression.

       You are a very confused person and need to read about the differences between socialism and what you think is socialism which is actually marxism or stalinism or maoism. Socialism works wonderfully without violence in many of the most advanced societies in the world. Norway, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Canada, Australia and yes even the USA.

       He said exactly that. Watch the video again, when pressured by the interviewer he spew it out and said I want a world socialist-egalitarian system of mass taxation, mass redistribution of wealth, I want to shut down corporations(read: any medium sized businesses that aren't globalist owned, we know that the globalist businesses are private central banks which are state infused as well, so they won't be targeted. They are semi private, semi state so the private central banks are not really corporations.). When pressured again if a government body will be in charge of the redistribution of wealth and massive taxation, he said its a central body, authority which you can call whatever you want that is going to have the power to redistribute wealth, tax and take private property.

       He also says that he cant make up a global political system in the time and constraints of the interview. For anyone to paraphrase so closely what he says and take an argument from it is essentially making an invalid point, you have no context to what he was saying (An interview where he was essentially asked 'what would you change'). Yeah he says that we need a central administrative body, but without one the world would be chaos as there would be no moral or political middle ground, society would be even more divided than it already is and civil unrest would be massive. He's not saying that he wants to implement any of those things exactly as he put it (in
       <em>
        words
       </em>
       might I add, during a non-structured and off the cuff interview, as you would expect from Brand) he says that he merely wants to introduce an idea into the public sphere of change being needed and that the society in which we live today is corrupt and unjust. In the same way Edward Snowden leaked the NSA documents - to start a discourse on important matters which the masses might otherwise be oblivious to - Brand tries to make clear that there are alternate options that can be pursued and that we aren't stuck in this ridiculous system and very narrow system with little scope for significant advances of any kind.

       The U.S. government isn't the problem IMHO.  Every time I hear people talking as if the threat of socialism is the conspiracy, or that the U.S. government is too big, I can not help but assume that Fox news, or "tea-publican" propaganda has led them to r/conspiracy.  What about the problem of corporate influence in government, and the misuse of power in our "capitalist/democratic" society?  How are we supposed to correct that without a government that represents all people fairly?  What is the conspiracy to you?

       No, I didn't say you were retarded, I just said that you are wrong in my opinion.  You aren't talking about the corporations that influence the government, you aren't talking about the hundreds of billions of dollars that are being siphoned from the system and hoarded by the wealthy corporations, you are instead talking about food stamps and social security.  Food stamps, social security, welfare and the like cost billions, but they help people.  Sure, some people abuse the system but the majority really need it.  Why do they need it?  Their job got outsourced, the cost of living is increasing, the jobs that are available are part time minimum wage jobs if they can get a job at all.  FOod stamps feed children, yes, it may be the children of a lazy person who is addicted to drugs, but still, the children shouldn't go without because of their parents.  How could you complain about the money spent by the government to help feed the poor?  You are talking about the government as if it holds real power or that the money the government spends on the poor is somehow a bad thing.  The 10 richest people in the country made enough money last year to feed everyone on the planet for a year.  How is the government to blame for that but not the corporations?
      </p>
      <p>
       Afterthought: I don't view the economy in dollars, I view it in resources, Half of the food we produce goes to waste so I am glad their is a program to turn money into food for poor people.  The government owns a lot and they have a lot of power, but if you look at the big picture in terms of resources the companies in this country have the government in their pockets and they are procuring all of our nations resources and convincing the people that it that they would share it them if only we could get those pesky government regulations off their backs for them.  This government is not too big in my opinion, it just works to make the rich richer instead of representing the people, but we need a government to regulate those who have power over all of us, otherwise we would be at the mercy of a few individuals that only want more power and all the resources.

       Neither will implementing Socialism, people still need to run the Government correct? It took several decades, if not close to 2 centuries to destroy the form of Government and Economy this country enjoyed, eventually they accomplished their goals of absolute control. By creating a Socialistic Government you only make it that much easier for those who wish to govern with wicked prejudice.

       Consumerism creates a culture that praises greed and excess, people think they need billions of dollars and hectares of land to live comfortably in this life, but they only live a certain number of years and they cant take all that land and wealth with them after they are in the ground.

       Really? Name some that weren't overthrown by fascists backed by the CIA or isolated from the world market and coerced to trade with fiat baseless currency, thats the only "strength" of the current debt based system is that money can be printed by the trillions to be wasted on wars of economic domination, it is your debt system that lives on war and coercion, you're just too naive to understand that. Iran is still going strong even with the amount of economic and financial embargoes placed on it, the petro dollar will soon die and youll see the true value of your economies shine through, one based on invisible market derivatives and fractional reserve banking, no manufacturing industry, nothing.

        Umm... it does. No idea why you're laughing but the U.S government gives the legal right to the Fed to produce and manage the money supply. You are bound by law to pay taxes in U.S dollars therefore the state has a monopoly over money within the country.
The socialist idea that comes into play is the need to nationalize the currency and have control over it.
       </p>

      <p>
       Oh boy, you think a national currency makes a country socialist and that means the currency is government regulated even though it is issued by private banks?

       So I guess you're a libertarian/ anarchist who doesnt believe in any government at all... well good luck with that.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Yes. The government legally allows banks to participate in fractional reserve banking and even encourages it. Also the government(The FDIC) financially guarantees practically every bank deposit in America which means that people don't care that much as to where they stick their money because they know they'll always get it back. Not much of a Free-market...
Under a Free-Market people would be far more inclined to know about the stability of the bank they are lending to and their financial practices. Government regulation has bred an unstable banking environment

       You are saying the governemnt is to blame for the faults of the free market, that is laughable, if you think a totally governmentless anarchist society would be any better with  mega rich corporations around and banks that own a good portion of the worlds wealth then Im afraid you cant be helped.

       Counterfeiting is only legal if you're a bank because of the state. That is what fractional reserve banking is. A libertarian society with an objective law would outlaw such a fraudulent practice.

       Well a libertarian doesnt believe in laws and regulation, its basically law of the jungle and in that case the trillionaire bankers would still eventually dominate the economy without more stringent regulation.

       What Im sick of is the bipolarity of economic discussion, its either entirely socialist to the point of communism or entirely capitalist to the point of corporatism, when it doesnt have to be that way, there is a very comfortable middle ground.

Are you ignorant of the fact that a vast amount of the worlds gold reserves are privately owned now, so how will any independent currency survive subversion without stringent regulation?

       Capitalism is constantly enforced by threat of force as well.  Imperialism is as capitalist as it gets.  What is stopping factory workers from killing the owners and taking over production?  What is stopping denied policy holders from killing insurance company profiteers?  Who comes to your house when banks foreclose on you?  Violence goes hand in hand with capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The state in the Soviet Union did all the buying and selling.  Hence it was state capitalism.  We currently have global capitalism (unless you have sanctions forced on you.)

       Capitalism and Socialism are not mutually exclusive. Socialized and regulated capitalism works wonderfully if those in power are not corrupt. Corruption in politics can ruin anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real problem is the cold war propaganda that ties communism to socialism. They are two seperate systems. Communism is a centralized command economy. Socialism is essentially the middle ground between Capitalism and Communism. It works. Is proven time and time again for the past several decades all around the world.

       The fact that Zionism exists doesn't mean that calling everyone you disagree with a Zionist Jew is acceptable debate strategy. There's a not-so-fine line between bringing up a legitimate concern and an ad hominem attack that people here don't seem to get all the time.

       It's just a fucking witch hunt for Zionists and shills whenever anyone favors Libertarian Socialism over right-wing Libertarianism, even if they're saying all the right things.

       The thing is, he's had a different life experience than us Americans. He's been brought up in a different type of governmental system. The mindset between how Americans think government should work and how Europeans think government should work is vastly different. He is using his own expereinces to find solutions to the world's problems. Unfortunately, his solutions wouldn't fit over here in the US since its just not how we work. He is right in the fact we need change, but its the whole "different strokes for different folks" type thing.

       That doesn't seem to be the case. He wants equality
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       an authoritarian government. He's advocating for a complete social revolution, not a specific form of government change.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... There's no reason why what he's saying ought to be specific to Europe. I don't know what you mean by "his solutions wouldn't fit over here in the US," since Russel Brand isn't even offering actual solutions.

       Yeah, but his solution is using force to take private property, to tax us even more, to shut down corporations he doesn't agree with, which are coal plants, nuclear plants, local oil refineries, etc... that provide for 95%  of the world energy, he basically wants to deindustrialize the world which is the globalists plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       He believes in man made global warming and wants us all to pay carbon taxes and to shut down energy companies. He basically supports agenda 21, Club of Rome, he is part of the new world order.

       He's talking about British politics primarily, in a British periodical. His worldview is of a more equal global future, but the premise isn't of instilling that, it was an op-ed on the state of British politics.

       It's not equal or British, it's a worldwide storm of absolute overwhelming force that takes everyone's stuff and by the time it's done, somehow doesn't hand it all over to the same old elite?
Opinions cease to be opinions when political. they become orders to hitmen!

       That isn't its purpose, it's to offset pollution effects. Global warming used to just be called pollution which is really what it is. Like acid rain in the 70's, it's a result of pollution.

       I can somewhat see a lot of people's point that giving the govt more power is only good depending on who is wielding that power which is why I'm always against capital punishment but at some point you have to take a chance with something. Organized efforts simply result in greater synergistic accomplishment than a bunch of disparate individuals out in the wild west. I doubt 99.999% of the global elite want deindustrialization though, that's absurd. The want their iphones and such.

       The extreme left and right both have megalomaniacal plans. Brand is a leftist but he's not for totalitarianism. No matter who position you hold you could potentially be playing into someone's cabalistic hands but that doesn't mean we should give up on everything and become a paranoid libertarian psychopath hermit.

       You can regulate corporations and simultaneously not regulate individuals. Like with cigarettes in the U.S. You penalize them to offset public health effects of their products but it isn't illegal to sell cigarettes or consume them. Most pollution is industrial, not individual, and industrial companies should have to offset that damage and be forced through regulation to minimize it in the first place. I see nothing totalitarian about that. I wouldn't want to live in metropolitan China right now - smog city.
      </p>
      <p>
       For every Brand there is a paranoid right winger who will argue for libertarian wild west where the govt barely provides anything and we lose all of our collective benefits of pooling resources except for things in the name of profit. That would be a shitty world and actually was a shitty world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human beings are always going to pool resources. It's simply more efficient and results in greater accomplishments. We can't have a world where everything that is collectively pursued is only that which can be sold at a profit. We wouldn't have the internet or the polio vaccine in that world. We are going towards socialism, the trend is obvious b/c of the benefits involved but that has zero to do with totalitarianism. They are totally different things and it's stupid to conflate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what I don't get about right wingers and it points to their basic inauthenticity. They say that regulating school lunches, making them healthy, infringes on freedom. But of course it doesn't b/c you can always still bring your lunch. Except when you can't:
       <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-04-11/news/ct-met-school-lunch-restrictions-041120110410_1_lunch-food-provider-public-school">
        http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-04-11/news/ct-met-school-lunch-restrictions-041120110410_1_lunch-food-provider-public-school
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that concern and it is wrong to forbid children from bringing their own lunch. Societal norms are mostly wrong and faddish and shouldn't be forced on anyone. I don't see why we can't have both. Having a health lunch available at low cost is good but prohibiting bringing your own lunch is just wrong and an infringement on freedom but there's nothing in socialism as a political system that requires that. I find it supremely ironic that their justification is "It's milk versus a Coke" when someone that would go to the trouble of preparing their child's lunch surely knows this - the act itself bespeaks of conscientiousness. Blacks are highly lactose intolerant in the first place so forcing them to drink milk seems ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to digress but my larger point is that we should strive towards the benefits of both ideas, left and right. Having wants private and needs public (or highly regulated) seems to work.

       I'm a non-authoritarian left winger. I think we actually agree philosophically. You call it voluntarism, I call it anarchism. They are dual non-authoritarian ideals. I get your points but at heart I am also a pragmatist. Anarchism and voluntarism would work if society was mostly intelligent and not borderline mentally unstable. Most of the waste and inefficiency I see around me is the result of very petty pursuits for short term gain, pride, status, etc. and basic greed. Our society could be so much better and there would be no need for a state at all if everyone were reasonable and intelligent but that is a dream that will never come true. Authoritarianism, if you study what people like Hitler, Stalin and even Plato said, is a direct result of this problem - the masses of morons, the current idiocracy that we always live in. That film is a satire of the ever present, not the future. The pragmatist in me says concedes that this is reality and therefore we can't push towards an ideal system without idealized participants that don't exist. So I push towards regulated capitalism with some socialized services that directly affect life conditions such as health care, clean water, etc. It's a concession I have b/c we don't live in the world that I wish for and dream about.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could easily have a world of virtually no work, very little waste (which is important considering our energy depletion situation that is only going to get worse) if only everyone wasn't unintelligent and emotionally unstable. I have to support things that will mitigate power hungry sociopaths that will control this pyramid social structure we live in. My only hope is that with robotics and automation/high technology we can one day make this system obsolete which is preferable to some ridiculous power transfer revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a lefty that reads Walter Block and Noam Chomsky. They offer similar clarity in a the muddy, disorganized and petty world we live in. Both of their views are idealized and flawed in practical terms but valid and interesting. We have to work with what we have. Most people are not very bright statistically and half of the bright are not psychologically stable and prone to delusions of idealized grandeur.

       I think they simply can't. Civilization, compared to being a hunter-gatherer, is both overly complex and but also overly narrow. It's overly narrow in the career sense. IT is big now, how many people can do IT? Not many. We have to import labor for it. Civilization creates an extreme specialization that not everyone can adjust to. People always fall through the cracks and I would argue that they have never been cracks to begin with, more like cliffs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people definitely view the government as a surrogate parent but not most, at least that I have met, but then I mostly hang around with above average people but even they find civilization challenging. Most people aren't born smart or talented so a strict meritocracy becomes somewhat immoral.

       I agree with you. I think his idea of solutions to the world's problems are  misguided. However, I don't think he intentionally would want to make things worse. He seems like a smart guy but I dont think he's fully educated on how economies and free political systems work. His idea of forcefully making people share their wealth won't ever work and isn't practical or right.

Nobody has the right answer and if they think they do they're wrong. I believe he also stated he was not going to invent a utopia in a hotel room. How is what he's doing any different than what you are doing? You standing on the soapbox shouting at us to not support Brands ideas, in favor of what? Your ideas?

       There is nothing left to interpretation, he literally said:" I want a world socialist egalitarian system of massive wealth redistribution, massive taxation and shutting down corporation especially ones who are "damaging" meaning coal and nuclear which provide us with 95% of the energy today and closing them down would mean deindustrialization.

       But also included he would not devise a strategy for a world utopia in a hotel room. So I viewed it more as him just tossing ideas out... nothing concrete. I just find it odd so many people will attack him for what he said but he's one of only a few that uses his fame as an opportunity to start a discussion. Right or wrong in your eyes, he's at least bringing ideas to the main stream

       Redistribution of wealth is what we have now (bailouts/austerity).  It's just labeled and applauded as capitalism when workers are exploited by profiteers.  Socialism looks to empower the proletariat so that production is controlled by the producers.

       The current system is capitalism.  Nothing is more free market than the ability to freely manipulate and corrupt the government.  Don't like the way your politicians are acting after I lobbied them?  How about you get some money together and lobby your own politician then?  Not enough money to do so?  You must be a lazy communist then.  Corruption is just part of the game to gain more capital.  If you want to put rules into place, then the free market isn't so self-governing as you would think is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The elites do not need a world government when they control most of the worlds so called "democratic" elections.  NWO has what it wants this very moment.  There is a reason socialism is feared among capitalists.

       LOL? The current system is socialist, fascist and centrist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The money is fiat currency backed by nothing(not capitalism, not free market), the interest rate is artificially controlled(not free market), money is regulated and no competition is allowed(not capitalism, not free market), the economy is centrally planned by government bureaucrats(this is again 100% socialist/communist and not free market), you name it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The basics are controlled, this is not free, this is a controlled market system and the NWO doesn't yet control the medium sized and small businesses, so they are trying to socialize it all and then either make it so expensive to operate that you close down or be able to just take your property away.

       You are correct that fiat currencies, interest rate manipulation and general economic shaping isn't free market.  But the free market is the exact system that put those people into power.  The same old money from hundreds of years ago never relinquish their financial dominance because capitalism empowers the wealthiest.
      </p>
      <p>
       The free market is only attractive in it's infancy.  Lucky for us, economic system inevitably change.  Just like past systems, humanity will one day look back at capitalism and laugh at how exploitive it is.  Just as we do when we talk about feudalism now.  Let's just hope the replacement is better.

       First of all you don't even know what capitalism is. Its ridiculous to blame a system of capital for poverty, especially since that system doesn't really exist these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism is based on capital, which means savings that increase in value over time which are used to grow the economy, today most countries have the exact opposite system of capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we have today is anti capitalism as we have a system that is based on consumption, rather than savings and the consumption is perpetuated by fiat currency which is printed out of thin air.
      </p>
      <p>
       So absolutely not, people aren't poor due to the non existent capitalism system. They are poor because they've been historically enslaved and oppressed by different forms of government and haven't had the chance and time to develop and through freedom create prosperity.

       yea.....the beautiful days of early low income disparity capitalism is over.  That is how capitalism works by design.  Capitalists are rewarded with more capital.  The exploited continue to stay exploited and more people are constantly needed to exploit.  You can artificially create a guise of competitiveness but that kind of manipulation is exactly what you see now. Collusion and Corruption in business and politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't except that what we have now is the logical progression of laissez faire capitalism then you yourself need to re-evaluate your notion of what capitalism is.

       How is acquiring capital evil, especially when we don't actually have capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like seriously, we DON'T have capitalism, its the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       CAPITALISM IS CAPITAL BASED ON SAVINGS. Its that simple. What we have today is exactly the opposite, its a system based on consumption perpetuated by the fraud that is fiat currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free markets are based on mutual benefit, you create something, if someone else wants what you created you can sell it for a good that you want. That good today is represented through fiat currency which acts as the middle man. Which is of course a fraud in itself, because its just paper not backed by anything created out of thin air by a private central body.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system that we have is controlled anti capitalism market. We still have low level freedoms, that's why it still barely works, we are scrambling through the rules, regulations, massive taxes, depreciating paper that we call money and unfair market distorted by different forms of so called government.

       Our current system is socialist? Fucking hell, mate, learn something for a change that isn't some idiotic right-wing conspiracy theory. Socialism is the worker's ownership of the means of production. This can either be done through a state(what Lenin wanted) or done in a decentralized manner. There was a state in Argentina that decentralized healthcare and healthcare improved in that state by a lot. They used a form of democratic socialism and by the looks of things, the state benefitted from it.

yes. there are people in this world paying goverments to make them wealthier. BUT stop making up conspiracies about "forces" that want to take over the world. there are people who want to get wealthier. PEOPLE! not jews, muslims, christians, pedophiles or whatever you want. and yes news agencies may propose their own opinion on what happens. but that happens on every side of the coin.

people should consider voting for communism-esque mechanics like an unconditional basic income, centralized healthcare system (trust me. i'm german. we have centralized healthcare by force and a privat healthcare system for those who want it. the privat ones are killing the mean of the whole idea of a centralized healthcare), the capping of exorbitant manager wages and more taxes that actually scale with the capabilities of the specific taxpayer (honestly: despite the rage you feel when you realize that taxes you pay sometimes are spend for weapons n shit, i was proud to pay taxes the moment i first had to. it's for the society. taxes can help people)
      </p>
      <p>
       i have more ideas but that's basically the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       and for fucks sake. WE NEED DIRECT DEMOCRACY!

       On the interview, he condemns Paxman for the many questions regarding what he considers a revolution, which then Brand replies that he didn't really ask him to come to a hotel room to describe a new utopian system. This is all good and well.
      </p>
      <p>
       However
      </p>
      <p>
       Brand seems to have a pretty good idea, and not once does he mention that the
       <em>
        people
       </em>
       should decide this. This is a true democracy. What he talks about is still something that few people could have total control over. He speaks on behalf of "us", but the tone of his message is pretty much the same thing the NWO wants.

       No, we see that concentration of power, whether it be in the hands of corporations or government only leads to tyranny.  Democratically elected governments are beholden to those who pay for campaigns- the elite.  Autocratic governments just get to appoint that same elite directly.  The only solution is to distribute power evenly, and if the government is the one doing that, well, then they by default have all the power, which means it just gets transferred back to the elite.

       No it isn't.  Anarchism is an anarchistic state.  Socialism/Communism can only become anarchistic on small scales, or after "the dictatorship of the proletariat," which is a brutally autocratic system that relies on the autocrats suddenly giving up power to everyone once they've dominated the world and there's no one left to challenge their power.  It's never going to happen.

       The problem is they know nothing other than capitalism, and have seen examples of socialism fail around the world and can't think beyond the extremes of both ideologies.  Capitalism
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       a great system, unfortunately humanity is outgrowing it quickly.  It assumes that resources are infinite and that our use of them does not damage our habitat in a significant way.  This is horribly inaccurate.  Socialism, on the other hand, fails to account for the fact that people respond to incentives.  Again, horrible assumption here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pro-capitalism folks need to come up with real plans for managing humanity's absurd levels of consumption of resources and damage being done to the planet, and for dealing with a growing world population who does not fit into the work force unless you pay them wages unfit for life.  Pretend these problems don't exist has been the status quo here for awhile, and this will only work until there are enough people with nothing to lose to mount a violent revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pro-socialism folks need to present plans for basically everything else.  How do they see society functioning at all and not failing in the same ways socialist governments have failed before?  What will prevent people from settling for modest lives and contributing nothing to society, and when too many people do, how will we sustain vital functions like food supply, medical care, etc.?  How will you defend against violent land grabs from people driven by greed and ambition who want more than they can get out of a socialist society?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no easy answers here, and people need to stop pretending there are, but governments really need to start thinking bigger rather than hoping our problems will sort themselves out without making any changes.  Unfortunately in the U.S., the government is controlled almost exclusively by those driven by personal greed and ambition and couldn't care less what happens to future generations and those who are poor, which is why people are responding to Russell Brand saying a revolution is what's needed.  People are desperate for real change, but their government refuses to even talk about the real problems in the world, hoping instead to distract them with issues like gay marriage, abortion, obamacare, and completely fabricated problems like the debt ceiling.

       The recognition of our (Elders of Zion) despot may also come before the destruction of the constitution; the moment for this recognition will come when the peoples, utterly wearied by the irregularities and incompetence - a matter which we shall arrange for - of their rulers, will clamor:
"Away with them and give us one king over all the earth who will unite us and annihilate the causes of disorders - frontiers, nationalities, religions, State debts - who will give us peace and quiet which we cannot find under our rulers and representatives."

       Why does religion have to play a role in a reformation of government ideals? I see people naming him "zionist jew' and 'jesus christ' but why does any of that have to have anything to do with the group of people who oversee our governance? Keep religion out of it. No system will work when people's religious beliefs are over-represented or under-represented, choose not to represent anything relating to religion and see how much better everything and everyone can be. Keeping people separated based on imaginary lines of control is a major part of the problem and religious intolerance is a primary cause of these borders being constructed in the first place. Leave your god out of political policy and see just how ridiculous most conflicts really are.

       So? That is the fact, I mentioned it because he subscribes to the elders of zion, any normal Jew doesn't even know about that, but if you are a zionist you most likely subscribe to the elders of zion and if you research it its a one world socialist government that controls everything.

       There are approximately 1 billion people in this world that will go hungry tonight. This is directly due to Capitalism - there is more than enough food and resources for global abundance. Russell Brand isn't saying he's got the answer; he's pointing out the flaws in this system. We need to fundamentally abandon the idea that something is only worth doing if it generates profit and we should be making genuine efforts to house, feed and educate everyone in the world because it is technically feasible, it just wont make anyone any money - a human generated concept along with debt, government, rich, poor, countries and religion - that we must evolve out of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong I'm not against anyone making money by providing a service, just there are some things more important than wealth.

       First of all you don't even know what capitalism is. Its ridiculous to blame a system of capital for poverty, especially since that system doesn't really exist these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism is based on capital, which means savings that increase in value over time which are used to grow the economy, today most countries have the exact opposite system of capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we have today is anti capitalism as we have a system that is based on consumption, rather than savings and the consumption is perpetuated by fiat currency which is printed out of thin air.
      </p>
      <p>
       So absolutely not, people aren't poor due to the non existent capitalism system. They are poor because they've been historically enslaved and oppressed by different forms of government and haven't had the chance and time to develop and through freedom create prosperity.

       I agree with you about the oppression, however capitalism is based around inequality. More than that, it thrives on it, and perhaps even requires it to function properly. It's time to see it as an outdated system that is clearly broken, I'm not saying it can't be fixed, but my personal view is it will always encourage morally questionable deeds in the pursuit of profit.

       How is acquiring capital evil, especially when we don't actually have capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like seriously, we DON'T have capitalism, its the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       CAPITALISM IS CAPITAL BASED ON SAVINGS. Its that simple. What we have today is exactly the opposite, its a system based on consumption perpetuated by the fraud that is fiat currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free markets are based on mutual benefit, you create something, if someone else wants what you created you can sell it for a good that you want. That good today is represented through fiat currency which acts as the middle man. Which is of course a fraud in itself, because its just paper not backed by anything created out of thin air by a private central body.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system that we have is controlled anti capitalism market. We still have low level freedoms, that's why it still barely works, we are scrambling through the rules, regulations, massive taxes, depreciating paper that we call money and unfair market distorted by different forms of so called government.

       I understand your points but I fundamentally disagree. I believe every human should have the right to free education, food, water and shelter and this is in direct opposition to capitalists. Furthermore I feel that man has polluted the earth in the quest for profit, and we are vastly running out of resources a lot of it because in our current economic model it is required to keep buying things that could otherwise be repaired, shared or updated and frankly if we keep on this route then the road lead to extinction and I can speculate on  how it may happen and this is also an example of how capitalism has failed; Currently there is no profit to be had in the renewable energy sector. It simply costs too much to build windfarms, solar panels and the like for companies to build these renewable or fund research into improving them this leads into the oils wars -and on a tangent war is very profitable and is encouraged in a capitalist economy. Adding nuclear weapons into that equation spells disaster for our species

       Who's going to pay for free education, food, water and shelter? How is that sustainable in any way? Do you realize that giving people free food and water, like we do to Africa, is probably actually bad for the country long term because people become dependent and don't develop their own industry? People sending old shirts and pants to Africa actually ruined any semblance of a clothing industry they had. Look it up. I used to think like you when I was 15-16 and just getting into politics. It turns out the world is very complicated, and in reality there are no solutions, only

       You are the same guy calling for revolution that wont accept it if it falls on your lap. You live in a state where you focus all your energy on wanting change but are subconsciously afraid of what you would do if change comes. Your waiting for someone to listen to and that means you are doomed.

      <p>
       Corporations pay nothing because the very same government exempts them from taxes, if everyone paid zero taxes then they would actually have competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now they don't have competition as the average business is taxed 50%, so they can't compete with big business which owns the government.

       None of you seem to have any concept of the differences between Socialism and Maoism, Stalinism, Marxism or as most people would say Communism. You sound like the tea party with your rhetoric. Lets bash on "socialism" because its responsible for the USSR,Cuba, China, N. Korea, Greece,Italy, the collapse of the EU and Europe. Out of the countries I just listed Greece and Italy are the only Socialist countries. Greece and Italy are examples of how corruption can ruin any form of governmental or economic system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialism is the most effective form of government the world has ever known. It is responsible for the most advanced societies in the world today ie. Norway, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, Canada,    Australia and yes even the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you people are calling Socialism is actually Stalinism, Maoism, or Marxism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialism is a delicate balancing act between Capitalism and Communism. It is a redistribution of wealth through taxation that allows social services like state funded medical care, welfare, free education, government regulated industries etc. It spurs economic growth and technological advancement as well as funds art and culture. It creates public works projects and infrastructure as well as conserves the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stalinism is violent and oppressive, nationalistic communism. Forced collectivization is not socialism.

       What the NWO wants is for young people and leftists not to vote. So even if brand said some things the plutocracy wouldn't like him encouraging they deffinitely like to discourage voting by the left. I am remained how similar rhetoric got kids to avoid voting in 2000 or to vote for nader and allowed Bush/Cheney to steal the election.

       not if the government is truly democratic and beholden to the people. Socialism/Communism in its purest form is an anarchistic state.
