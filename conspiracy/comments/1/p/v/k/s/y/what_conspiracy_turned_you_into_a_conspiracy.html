<p>Wow, I couldn&#39;t I expected a response like this. A lot of people seem to be mentioning 9/11 as their reason. If you haven&#39;t seen it already (it&#39;s been posted here a few times) and have the time I would strongly recommend watching these videos. It&#39;s a 5 hour 3 part analysis of 9/11 that counteracts the debunkers arguments. It&#39;s the most interesting thing I&#39;ve watched for a very long time. <a href="http://www.luogocomune.net/site/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=167">http://www.luogocomune.net/site/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=167</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I drove across Sinai from Cairo, which is crumbling.  Sheep on the streets, buildings falling down, giant slums, poor education, nice food only for the very rich, streets covered in garbage, majority of the country is poor.  </p>

<p>Went to Israel.  Saw a city much like any city in Europe.  Clean streets.  Beautiful big store fronts.  Sidewalks.  Nice signs telling you where to go.  Little stands and shops everywhere.  Great food from around the world.  Pastries, pizza.  It was Europe, basically.  I loved it.  It was very clean!  It was great.  </p>

<p>You have to drive some distance out of Jerusalem to get to the wall.  It is a nice drive past pastures and rolling hills with bushes and trees on them.  </p>

<p>The wall is very tall.  It is made of concrete.  At the top there are guard posts with glass.  There is barbed wire, even though the wall is far too high to get over.  There are men with guns.  </p>

<p>When you go through it, you are asked many questions about who you are and where you come from.  If you have anything Arab about you this questioning is very long it can take several hours.  You are brought through many layers of security, the inside of the wall is like a fort.  You go back and force through a maze of metal bars, with many security cameras watching you.  The bars look like the bars used to hold cattle at a rodeo.  </p>

<p>You exit and on the other side is a tall wire fence covered with barbed wire. There is graffiti all over the wall.  The buildings are crumbling. Noo nice food, streets made of dirt, everyone is poor.  </p>

<p>There are men waiting to be taxi drivers, I went with one.  He showed me an ID card with a picture of a baby on it.  He told me a story.  </p>

<p>&quot;This is my son.  You know how I got this card?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;My son was born with a problem in his arm, and they said that if his arm wasn&#39;t operated on he would lose the arm. We don&#39;t have that kind of hospital here, so I have to go across into Jerusalem to see the doctor.  So I go to the Fence.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The man at the fence won&#39;t let me through.  He says that I can&#39;t bring through any person without a card.  He is referring to my son, who is a new born.  He didn&#39;t have a card.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So I say to him, where do I get the card?  He says you must get the card in Jerusalem.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I say let me through then I will get the card and leave my son with my wife.  He says that won&#39;t work, a person must be present to have fingerprints and a photo and so on in order to get the card.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I say how will my son get the card if he cannot travel through the fence to get the card?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He told me I was holding up the line, and my son never got the surgery, he lost his arm.&quot;</p>

<p>He passed me the card, he said it was fake, and he didn&#39;t have the courage to try it out, because you could be put in prison for such a thing.  He had to choose between making his son grow up without an arm or without a father.  The card was so poorly done.  It was obviously fake.  </p>

<p>We got up to the top of this hill, and he pointed out at these buildings coming over the hills, he said they were settlements, and they took over 3 more hills in the last few months.  These were very nice buildings.  Developments.  </p>

<p>I went back to Israel that night, and I went to a waffle store.   They had every kind of waffle.  Chocolate waffle, ice cream waffle, Nutella.  Anything.  Any kind of fruit and so on.  The taxis are really nice there they have meters, they don&#39;t clunk when they start.   The monuments are lit up at night.  There are little plaques at every monument that tell you the history in English and Hebrew and Russian and Italian.  </p>

<p>When I took the bus back, I sat next to a young girl who had a phone with rhinestones glued to it in a heart shape, and a beanie baby on a key chain.  She had a ponytail, she was texting and wearing an army uniform. She had a grenade launcher in the seat next to her. The bus stopped several times and the Palestinians were made to get off and be searched.  Their bags were taken off the bus and dumped out, and the soldiers kicked through their belongings at the side of the road and we sat inside the bus and watched and they passed out snacks.</p>

<p>It was absolutely banal, but the whole thing chilled me, and I realized that this was the country at the center of American foreign policy, and this was the beacon of democracy, and I realized that these were the supposed &quot;good guys,&quot; and I just thought that it wasn&#39;t fucking right, and that Christians should be embarrassed because Jesus wouldn&#39;t have stood for any of this.</p>

<p>Sorry I wrote a novel.  It really changed me.  </p>

<p>TL:DR;  I think every American history teacher should be forced to walk around in Jerusalem, then go through the wall to Bethlehem and walk around in Palestine before teaching students that colonialism is something that &quot;used to&quot; happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was originally making an ironic comment that referenced the US. </p>

<p>But since you asked-
Reconstruction is a bad example if you were black, a good example if you were white. It lasted for about a decade after the US civil war, and was essentially a program where white northerners ran the former confederacy via military occupation.</p>

<p>The reason why I said that Reconstruction was a bad example if you are black is that Reconstruction era governments elected a lot of African Americans and pushed hard for enfranchisement of all Freedmen. </p>

<p>Post reconstruction is closer to how Israel controls the WB and Gaza. There was a presidential election in 1876 that was similar to 2000- One guy won the popular vote (democrat) and another won the Electoral College (republican). The compromise was that the republican from the north would be president, but Reconstruction had to end so that the south could be allowed to run itself (and institutionalize racism). Overnight the KKK showed up, Jim Crow laws were passed, and separate but equal was the law of the land, de facto <em>and</em> de jure. </p>

<p>There was racism before Reconstruction ended (of course), but the southern governments literally decided to disenfranchise human beings <em>after we, as a species, had mostly agreed that people shouldn&#39;t be allowed to own people.</em> This is what makes Jim Crow particularly messed up. The American Civil War was fought over slavery, but the losing side was allowed to take freedom away from people after they were just freed, then they took pride in it and called it tradition.</p>

<p>Depends what race you were...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t social class have a lot to do with how you were treated during that period too? I mean, I understand that blacks were oppressed back then, but I don&#39;t think share croppers and people in that social circle were treated very well no matter if they were black or white. </p>

<p>Am I correct in saying this? I don&#39;t know any of this for sure, I&#39;ve just noticed that poor people in general have been looked down upon throughout the history of this country and figured it would apply to post-Reconstruction too. </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;d like to point out I&#39;m not trying to undermine the struggle of African Americans back then, I&#39;m just interested in how wealth and social status tied in to how people are treated by society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes its very difficult, but I am hopeful that the US is going to wake up to what those parties have served up. I like the greens and I&#39;m not even an environmentalist, it doesn&#39;t inform my politics at all, I am more interested in foreign affairs. I like the greens because they represent something outside the usual political power structures that are defined by and represent the stinking rich, they are people who care about more than just power. They care about the world around us. I would love to see someone like Jill Stein beat the republicans and democrats in an election as a protest vote even because I honestly believe she is a good human being and you could do with one of those in charge showing the world a more humane side to America that represents the core of America. You are good people led by a bunch of blockheads running a very corrupt democracy that puts the needs of the rich first. Its time for change imho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>QU3 since February of 2012 has been to the tune of 85 Billion <em>a month.</em> in buying toxic assets but mainly US Bonds.  Thats $1.7 trillion in extra fed stimulus not including the bailouts and average lending and god knows what else they do because we dont get to audit them independently. </p>

<p>China (the largest holder of foreign debt) has $ 1.3 Trillion in US bonds. </p>

<p>All that increase wealth the Global Wealth Databook shows (which is bullshit because it doesnt take into account private wealth of families who have been inheriting fortunes and keeping them in tax free shelters, or gold bullion, art, gems etc etc. the only shit they can count for in their $47 trillion in 2008 to $72 trillion in mid-2013 figure is private wealth we can see i publicly traded stock and income filings and demonstrated wealth. </p>

<p>But the rich families (like the Rockefellers and other old money fams) keep their wealth private in foundations and tax shelters and over seas so the rich actually have even more control than people like to admit. </p>

<p>So my point is that the wealth being talked about here has not only increased the gap between <strong><em>US</em></strong> and <em>them</em> but that increase in wealth is all paper stock money. its imaginary and intangible and has done nothing to increase the actual amount of production and services. Dont end the fed i say, create a state owned one to compete. </p>

<p>Complementary currency systems. International trade could be done in the federal reserve notes, and domestic trade could be conducted in both Federal Reserve Notes and Treasury Notes. OR you could have the option to conduct international trade in US Treasury Notes as well. And for those willing to deal with the debt money insanity give them the choice. But mandate that property taxes are payable in both currencies and employers must pay their employees in whatever currency they choose or a mixture of the two if they choose. Anyone who thinks this would be too difficult to achieve to confusing to enact and make sense of?? Bro... theres an app for that. Dont fall for that silly protest.</p>

<p>The difference being that Treasury notes are simply issued by the government by spending them directly into the economy without any interest, thru infrastructure development like the Hyperloop but all across the country, putting the latest and greatest solar panel technology on the roof of every house and business building and federal building in the country, building a super dope wall along the southern border, <em>updating all the fucking internet fiber</em> funding research centers, free college education for everyone, healthcare single payer system funding, etc etc etc. The bottom line is that we need more money going to the people and not to the banking class (who have the sole officially sanctioned monopoly on money creation.) </p>

<p>Also ban interest on loans. Its called usury. you used to be put to death if you tried that shit. Not even kidding. To this day, islamic countries ban it. They do fine, and if we didnt fuck with them, and prop up their dictators and stir up revolutions to over throw their democratically elected governments periodically, they&#39;d be so fucking rich its mindblowing. Why ban interest on loans? <a href="http://vimeo.com/71074210">take 8 minutes out of your life to change it. right now</a></p>

<p>its not a utopian fantasy. id like to answer any questions if anyone has them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the reason you ban interest is because it inevitably results in wealth extraction and consolidation into the hands of those with the power to coin money. In present case this is the private banking system. </p>

<p>i dont even advocate banning private banking or banning the fed. Merely creating an alternative. let the rich play their investment games, but dont hold the 99% hostage to their risky games and speculation. </p>

<p>i really suggest you watch the video and see if it doesnt pique your interest. Interest works and the current monetary paradigm works beautifully... the question is who does it work for?</p>

<p>There are objections to usury from two points of view: From the point of view of distributive justice usury is a sin because it victimizes the poor – to wit, payday loan sharks and credit card companies.  From the point of view of commutative justice, however, we see the true nature of usury and how it is in fact a sin against nature.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, imagine a poor starving man who comes to a rich man and begs to be fed a ham sandwich.  The rich man says, “I will not give you a ham sandwich, but I will lend you one.  This is a loan.  You must pay me back.”  The poor man promises to.</p>

<p>A month later, when the poor man has saved enough to buy a ham sandwich to replace the one he ate, he brings said sandwich to the rich man.  “This will not do!” the rich man says.  “You owe me 30 sandwiches, not just one.”</p>

<p>“But you only lent me one,” the poor man replies.</p>

<p>“Yes, but you ate that sandwich 30 days ago, and I have been without it myself for 30 days.  I could have eaten it 30 times over in 30 days.  You not only enjoyed my sandwich, you enjoyed the use of it, for a full month!”</p>

<p>“The use I put the sandwich to was to eat it.  And after I ate it once, I could not eat it again 30 times over.  And neither could you!  The sandwich vanished upon being put to use – which is to say eaten,” the poor fool replies.</p>

<p>But the rich man, flying in the face of nature and common sense, claims that somehow a thing that is consumed in its use is no different from the ongoing use of a thing that endures, as if the ham sandwich had been a plow the poor man had borrowed, a durable good he had been putting to productive use for that length of time.  And so the poor man is either clapped in jail, or in an enlightened society, asked to make the minimum payment of a half slice of ham every month for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>This crime against nature, of trying to gain from something that produces no gain, of charging for the use of something separate from the consumption of it, when its use is in fact that very consumption – this is usury. not &quot;An excessive or illegally high rate of interest charged on borrowed money.&quot; Any interest on loaned money is usurious as i hope this illustrates. </p>

<p>And this greedy neglect of reality, this demand for profit where no good is produced, this fee for use even when something is used up, this is the root of what is bringing the world’s economy down.</p>

<p>As someone once said, “We want our money to breed, but our sex to be sterile.”  And the effect of that fallacy is all around us, as you can seed in the <a href="http://vimeo.com/71074210">video</a> provided by Money Network Alliance <a href="http://www.monneta.org/index.php?lang=EN">MonNetA.org.</a></p>

<p>Very sadly, more than half of Israel buys into this. It&#39;s a place of hatered and persecution...very much the Nazi Germany of our time. Yes, America enables them but <em>they</em> supply the hate, bigotry, apartheid, and persecution of the entire Arab people. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it in America...imagine the deep South of the 50s times 1000. America keeps the money flowing in and the hatred flourishing.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Nah, the palestinians fire off a shitty rocket that is impossible to aim and Israel brings the helicopter gunships.&quot;</p>

<p>Hamas has upped its game considerably in recent years, with outside help.  In the last go-round they could have scored some direct hits if not for the Iron Dome missile interception system.  I don&#39;t think the &quot;asymmetric&quot; argument has much appeal to those on the recieving end.  Go on You Tube and have a look at what its like to be where those &quot;shitty&quot; rockets land.  Do you think, if Americans were those on the recieving end, they would accept the &quot;assymetric&quot; excuse?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. Sovereignty and the need to protect yourself is a thing. I&#39;m not sure about the rockets today, but I saw some of the rockets from the second intifada, the wings were worthless, impossible to aim. It was similar to throwing rocks at soldiers with armor and rifles (oh shit, that happened too!). </p>

<p>That&#39;s right, what Israeli&#39;s do instead is drop 500lb and 1 ton bombs on Gaza&#39;s civilian infrastructure when they are most likely to be inhabited with innocent civlians, or launch missiles at cars in Gaza&#39;s crowded streets thus ensuring innocent civilian casualties.</p>

Mostly the news reads like the sports page, tallying the wounded and the dead, the territories won and lost, and whatever the latest trash talk, threats, promises or treaties are being made or broken. </p>

<p>Seems to me the news is positive or negative depending on which team you are rooting for. </p>

<p>Of course, some news is clearly biased. But there are many sources. If you don&#39;t like what you are reading, find another source. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t ask those people that question. &quot;What would you do if ...&quot; bluescreens them. They don&#39;t experience hypotheticals in the same manner as we do. They see the world as they think it is, end of story, and they interpret any attempt to get them to deviate from their set view, as damage.</p>

<p>If you ask him that question, he will think &quot;but I am not the Palestinian father&quot; and reject it, probably with expressions of anger, as in his mind, you are associating him with an inferior by making that comparison.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cognitive deficit that maybe half of humanity have. They don&#39;t <em>analogize</em>. It&#39;s not a tool in their toolbox (well it kind of is, but it&#39;s painful and confusing to them to use it). There are reasons why that is, having to do with Jungian functional theory and developmental priority of intuition, but it doesn&#39;t greatly matter. The point is that they <em>can&#39;t</em> be swayed by an appeal to intuitive extrapolation any more than you might be persuaded by an elegant argument expressed in a language you don&#39;t speak. They basically have to be spoonfed conclusions by authority figures, or <em>personally experience</em> the sharp end of the exact same situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re comment reminded me a documentary I watched on youtube and I&#39;m hoping you or someone else here has seen it and could point me to a link of it. I&#39;ve been looking for it for months. It&#39;s about someone who seems a lot like you, that&#39;s why I thought to ask. A younger person whose family lives in Palestine goes to visit them and he records it all. The wall was being constructed, I THINK it may have been the WB, but maybe Gaza. He visits his family who I think was grandparents. The man who I believe was his grandfather inherited olive orchards from his father and doubled the size of the orchards. His grandfather seemed very nice and dressed nicely the way my grandfather did. What struck me about his family was how much they reminded me of my grandparents who raised me. Comfortable financially from a life of working hard and making smart decisions. Anyway, Israel shows up and destroys the orchards and the family property for the wall. It was an amazing piece of film. If anyone knows about this please hit me up with a link. Brohamad, be safe and good luck in your new home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your outrage of being treated that way, but if your honest, you will admit how much better that treatment is than the treatment you get from the police in any Islamic country.</p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that these procedures did not come into being out of a vacuum.  Before Islamic terrorism there were no security procedures.  You could walk back and forth between the West Bank and Israel and no one even asked for your papers.  The specific procedures you protest are a direct response to Arafat&#39;s entifada, remember?  </p>

<p>Clinton brought the whole region to the brink of a peace settlement.  Israel was offering the West Bank full autonomy.  Arafat went home, and broadcast over the radio, &quot;why accept only part when we can take it all&quot;.  Then he started sending over the suicide bombers one after another, blowing up kids in pizza joints.</p>

<p>I think it is terrible the way the Palestinians are treated.  But any honest soul has to admit that they have brought these security procedures on themselves, one suicide bomb at a time.</p>

<p>For thirty years my work took me among Muslim across the whole arc of Islam.  Across that whole arc, and among the Palestinians in particular, they are quite frank that there will be no peace until Israel is destroyed, and all the Jews killed.  Are you seriously suggesting that Israel should just roll over and die?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good, I&#39;m glad. But re-read your comment - it really doesn&#39;t sound like that - especially the comment about all Palestinians wanting the total destruction of Israel. The end line about the choice being to maintain the system as it stands or roll over and let the Palestinians kill everyone is the false dichotomy I hear from the blindly pro-Israeli camp all the time. Usually arguing with this group is impossible as all you hear is &quot;you just don&#39;t understand history&quot; followed by a one-sided discussion of middle-eastern conflict (as the nicer response) or the more common &quot;you&#39;re an idiot pro-arab liberal fucktard who can&#39;t understand historical issues.&quot; </p>

<p>When I tell them I&#39;m a history professor at a large, prestigious US research university their answer never changes - except to add that I must be a terrible professor, my &quot;liberal bias&quot; must stem from my training or that they must let anyone be a professor these days.</p>

<p>All I can say is look back at the world in 20 years, try to remove yourself from your biases and ask yourself if Israel&#39;s actions in the world have been a net positive. To prepare yourself to do this, try everyday to not only see the conflict through Palastinian eyes, but from other perspectives as well. Ask yourself if it seems right that internet brigades roam around anonymously &quot;correcting&quot; peoples&#39; &quot;misconceptions&quot; about Israel. Is it to foster an open discourse and exchange of opinion - or is it to manipulate this discourse? </p>

<p>Give it a shot - maybe the billions of people who think Israel has overstepped its bounds and become the thing they once hated aren&#39;t completely misguided and full of shit. There&#39;s a reason Israelis have despised (the Jewish) Hannah Arendt&#39;s <strong>Eichmann in Jerusalem</strong> and her concept of the &quot;banality of evil&quot; - it wasn&#39;t just that she read Nazi crimes as being perpetrated by normal people just carrying out their duties (and that &quot;evil&quot; was thus a woefully inadequate construct) - it was the implication that through the Zionist impulse the Israelis could travel down this same road - tossing aside all considerations of decency because of the belief that this land was meant for them.</p>

<p>You might consider taking your own advice about opening your mind, and looking at the facts of terrorism, and how it is the actions of the terrorists that brought these terrible security procedures into being.  You might want to look at how Arafat refused the peace settlement announcing that the Palestinians would take everything through suicide bombing.  You might face the fact of Palestinian representation in the Israeli Parliament, and their success rate in Israeli court action, and then make an honest comparison with how Jews and Christians are treated through out the Islamic arc of nations.  Not to mention how women are treated, and how gays are treated, and how liberal Muslims are treated.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What a brave opinion - The Israelis shouldn&#39;t all have to die. What straw-man are you fighting here? I didn&#39;t say the Israelis were overstepping their bounds by &quot;living, and breathing, and walking the earth.&quot; This is, again, a convenient ignorance and desire to cast everything in black and white terms. I said they were overstepping their bounds in their treatment of the Palestinian people and in their response to terrorist attacks. If a xenopohobic Palestinian terrorist kills an Israeli boy on a bus, that does not justify similar atrocities commited by the Israeli government/military. You can argue all you want about Hamas and other groups&#39; unwillingness to reach compromise - but Israel has again and again done the same thing. Until both sides see the absurdity of simply blaming the other and suggesting any criticism of their position to be condemnation of their right to exist, this bullshit spectacle (which is how much of the rest of  the world views this shit-show) will continue.</p>

<p>This is part of a LONG line of historical precedent going back to the Zionist movement in the fin de siecle - here&#39;s a quick synopsis of Arendt&#39;s post-war trip to Jerusalem for a lesson in how nothing has really changed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Jewish suicide bombers were coming daily into the West Bank and blowing themselves up near Islamic grade schools, and in the pizza shops of Islamic teenagers, the Muslims would have every right to build a wall, and establish security procedures.</p>

<p>But there is no moral equivalence here, is there?  Islam is sending over the human bombs, and the Israelis aren&#39;t.  Israel bends over backwards to avoid collateral damage, while the Muslims fire their rockets from the play grounds of schools, trying to get Israel to bomb children.</p>

<p>Palestine could have peace tomorrow if it acknowledged the right of the Jews to exist.  But they don&#39;t.  That is the objective fact you keep blanking out.  There is no equivalence here.  Israel does acknowledge the right of the Palestinians to exist, and has been ready to grant them an autonomous state since 2000.  To this day the Palestinian Authority, Hamas, and Hezbollah will not acknowledge the right of the Jews to exist.</p>

<p>I worked in this area for 30 years.  Every day the Muslim government sponsored newspapers promise the eventual destruction of all the Jews.  They teach this idea of genocide to their children in schools.  It is the basis of a dozen TV broadcasts every day.  You know this to be true.  You also know that Israel is not doing these things.  Why do you insist there is equivalence when you know there isn&#39;t?</p>

<p>If Israel recognizes Palestine&#39;s right to exist,  why do they constantly seize more land? </p>

<p>The PLO <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_%E2%80%93_Palestine_Liberation_Organization_letters_of_recognition">recognized Israel&#39;s right to exist 20 years ago</a>, but all they got in return was more lies, robbery and murder.</p>

<p>There is no equivalence. Israel was established in a program of ethnic cleansing which has never stopped in the past 70 years. <a href="http://www.btselem.org/statistics/fatalities/after-cast-lead/by-date-of-event/gaza/palestinians-who-died-following-an-infringement-of-the-right-to-medical-treatment">Their neighbors only want them to give it up, and have offered them national recognition in return,</a> but the Israelis only continue their efforts to seize and depopulate more territory, defending it with baldfaced lies like yours.  </p>

<p>My views came from my working in and with Muslims in their own countries over 30 years.  That, and a reaction to the extreme anti Jewish bigotry of my Irish American father.  I believe in a two nation solution, but at this point in time, it must begin with the Muslims acknowledging Israel&#39;s right to exist, and followed by their rounding up the terrorists.  Then we can force Israel to close the deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am so glad you shared this story. It&#39;s eerily similar to mine. I went to Israel as well, except on a pilgrimage type trip with a tour group. Our tour guide was Palestinian, and his son has severe autism. He managed to get him to Israeli doctors to diagnose it, but they refused to treat the boy because he&#39;s Palestinian. Last I heard, his wife was going to try to take the son to Jordan to be treated by doctors there. </p>

<p>And that wall. I am an easily distracted young woman, and I love to doodle to pass time. I was in my sketchbook drawing as we passed through. It was easy for us because of the tour group and I don&#39;t remember too much. The moment for me was when I was in my own doodle world, drawing I don&#39;t even remember what. I looked up to see where we were and I saw that wall and thought &quot;oh hey it looks like the Berlin wall.&quot; It was one of those odd instances in which I have a very clear involuntary thought and it shocked me. I can&#39;t get the comparison out of my head now. That giant, concrete cage of a wall, some call it a fence, or barrier. But it is a gigantic wall of separation, you can&#39;t even really see the sunrise/sunset/horizon over it. I try to explain this to people and they hear but you just can&#39;t put the shock and anguish into their hearts without showing them. And oh, it hurts me that I see bumper stickers and online campaigns to help Israel. I know that there are wrongs done on both sides, but I so hesitate to help Israel with anything knowing what they do to the Palestinians. </p>

<p>I think I said too much but OP, I really want to thank you for saying what I have meant to say so much better than I can. </p>

<p>Edit: <a href="/u/photographic_mammory">/u/photographic_mammory</a> argued that there was violence coming from the Palestinians as well, and that I only showed one viewpoint, that I am &quot;just someone else with an opinion.&quot; I would like to say that he/she is completely correct. The wall did stop a lot of violence from the Palestinians from what I understand. The wall did its job, with the unfortunate consequence that those inside the wall have much more restricted lives now. But I feel like that is much better known information, and that my perspective and that of <a href="/u/161719">/u/161719</a> are much less known. photographic_mammory is correct, though that I am just someone else with an opinion. However, Reddit has a reputation for calling people out as frauds and asking for sources for well-built arguments. This indicates to me that you are a community of critical thinkers (to an extent) and I expect you to hear my opinion, take what you already know, maybe investigate the issue further, and draw your own conclusion. So yes, I have my particular opinion among many. But building your opinion is your job.</p>

That wasn&#39;t a political solution to the middle east problem - it was a solution to the problem of palestinian infiltrators setting off bombs in israeli busses and restaurants.</p>

Even though you&#39;re civilians?  Of course you do, because countries like to control their own borders and who goes through them.  If you go on a greyhound between canada and the US does no one check your passport?  yes, they do.</p>

<p>The reason no one said anything is because its entirely normal for almost any country to question and if they choose to do so, search people who cross borders.</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t presupposition of anything.  That is called border control and every country does it.  countries that know there are groups wishing to infiltrate and create chaos do so with more rigorous methods.</p>

<p>The &quot;retaliation&quot; part comes in because if israel doesn&#39;t &quot;react&quot; then they send the message that terrorists are free to attack with impunity.  They aren&#39;t looking to kill civilians, they&#39;re looking to strike at those organizing or effecting attacks on israelis.</p>

Arabs are protesting a new settlement and a private security contractor for the Settler murders one, what happens to the murderer?  What happens to his relatives?

Does his murder justify the punishment of his family?  Should his children suffer?  His house and his parents house be destroyed?  Should his wife be murdered?</p>

<p>What does Jewish law say should happen to the private security contractor that murdered an Arab?  To his family?  To the women and children that live near him?  What if you live near him and are killed because he murdered a Palestinian?  Was that justified?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re implying that the construction of the wall lead to a decrease in suicide bombings, but there exists only a correlation. Over 40,000 Palestinians cross the wall from the West Bank into Israel today DAILY, many more illegally through gaps in the construction or through aforementioned means such as false identities. How is it that none of these 40,000 have taken up &quot;terrorism&quot;? How is it that not one &quot;terrorist&quot; can make use of the same channels for crossing the wall that regular Palestinians use for finding work and seeking medical care? What of the Palestinian holders of Israeli passports living inside Israel, who make up at least 20% of Israel&#39;s population? </p>

<p>You&#39;re falsely attributing your faith in Israeli security to a stack of concrete rather than to any change in Palestine&#39;s present political reality, as if Israel can hide behind its snipers and missiles for eternity. You are stripping the period of regular suicide bombings that you&#39;re referring to of the political context in which it was set - The Second Intifada - and instead attempting to portray it as something Palestinians just do whenever, for the hell of it. Do you honestly believe that when the Third Intifada happens, there won&#39;t be bombings in Tel Aviv again, because of some concrete wall 75 miles away? If so, you&#39;re dangerously ignoring reality and playing up short-term draconian security goals as if they have no impact on the long term political situation.  </p>

<p>Also, this is a discussion of the wall which separates Israel from the Fatah-controlled West Bank. Gaza, Hamas, and their feelings towards Israel have little to nothing to do with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason you believe that discussing this further won&#39;t get you anywhere is because you apparently don&#39;t have any explanation for the fact that any of the 2,000,000 Palestinians inside of Israel&#39;s borders at any given time aren&#39;t blowing themselves up, other than your claim that a wall to their east is somehow preventing it.  </p>

<p>&quot;Cast Lead II&quot; implies that the Third Intifada will be a one-side bombing campaign. The reports from the IDF itself on that conflict very unequivocally state that Gaza City was silent and abandoned when they rolled in with their tanks, and that nearly every Israeli casualty of that &quot;war&quot; was a result of friendly fire.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s not an Intifada. An Intifada is an uprising, which tends to occur when an occupying military thinks it can get away with killing thousands of civilians, imprisoning hundreds of thousands, and depriving millions of their livelihoods at any time it pleases.  </p>

<p>I say WHEN and not IF because at Israel&#39;s present course and policy, there is absolutely no way that a third intifada will not occur at some point. And when it does happen, those bombings are going to start right back up because a person who wants to commit suicide can and will find a way to get around 100 miles of concrete.  </p>

<p>The wall has a clear economic, social, and symbolic impact far beyond the damage it supposedly prevents. You should keep in mind that the wall does not just separate Israelis from Palestinians - it also separates Palestinian from Palestinian, as it is built inside of Palestinian territory and in many cases even cuts right through villages (necessitating the uncompensated demolition of Palestinian homes), breaks apart families, separates farmers from their fields, and annexes Palestinian territory into Israel in clear violation of dozens of international agreements to which Israel is a signatory.  </p>

<p>And for all the bullshit I have seen about Israel=Nazis and Jews are puppetmasters and such I have seen in this thread, I have yet to see ONE mention of it even being called &quot;The Apartheid Wall.&quot; Not that anything you&#39;ve said would in any way contradict the wall serving a secondary purpose of racial segregation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s address some of your statements:</p>

<p><strong>Isael Withdrwew</strong> - ...and built a huge fucking wall, with machine guns.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Which is what Gaza wanted&quot;</strong> - ask the average inhabitant of a US inner city, low rent district whether they want heavy government intervention in their lives, and they&#39;ll say no (even while relying on food stamps).  When the only view of a government they have is that of oppression and discrimination, of course they will not want more.</p>

<p><strong>Israel is absolutely allowed to control it&#39;s own borders</strong> - If I build a wall around an arid section of Nevada, and claim that it is outside the US borders, can I deport all the minorities there?  Can I block all international aid except what I deign to give?  Can I keep the media out?  Can I put machine guns on the walls?  Can I deport violent offenders to this new United States of Totally-Not-A-Prison-I-Promise?</p>

<p><strong>The naval blockade of gaza is considered legal internationally</strong> - true, Israel has been wholeheartedly supported by the UN, in this terrible act.  That doesn&#39;t justify it in any way.</p>

<p><strong>America shifted into a complete police state</strong> - but still, oddly enough, we haven&#39;t walled off South Dakota and started deporting all minorities, felons, and political dissidents.</p>

<p><strong>Palestinian Terrorists</strong> - I like this phrasing, by tying the two together, you can make all Palestinians sound like terrorists.  It&#39;s a wonderful form of doublespeak.</p>

<p>2) If nevada elected a group who openly supported and enacted strikes against other states, you&#39;re god damn right the US would clamp down the borders and the people responsible would be dealt with by police/military.</p>

<p>3) ¯(°_o)/¯  no response.  I don&#39;t think I can trust Hamas to not use the sea to ship in weapons.</p>

<p>4) because south dakota didn&#39;t elect hamas?</p>

<p>Wrong answer.  First, food and supplies are NOT cut off.  There is not starvation in either the West Bank or Gaza.  You have no idea what did or did not happen in the Warsaw Ghetto, where more people lost their lives from starvation in a single year than have been killed on all sides in the I/P conflict since 1948.  You seem to be just as poorly informed about the West Bank and Gaza.  Read a little about the Warsaw Ghetto.  You might be ashamed of even trying to make the comparision.  </p>

<p>On a side note, I saw graffiti from Banksy while I was there. I didn&#39;t even know it was him, but I remember seeing it and it had such an impression on me that I had to go look it up to see if maybe I could discover what the artist meant to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a similar experience in Israel/Palestine. I was finishing my last year of education at a religious university, one whose fealty to Israel was undying.  Fortunately, there were, at the time, a number of intelligent professors who encouraged cognitive dissonance. Anyways, one such professor led a trip to the middle east, where the majority of time was spent in a hotel in the west bank. The difference from one side of the wall to the other was striking.</p>

<p>Your anecdote about the girl and her grenade launcher brought back a &quot;funny memory.&quot; We were at the Golan heights for half a day. I saw a young girl reaching up and adjusting her scrunchy. When she turned around, I could see that she had a huge assault rifle strapped to her back that was nearly as tall as she was. So strange, I took a photo.</p>

<p>Last anecdote. While we were in the west bank, I went walking around (this was back in 2010 I believe) with a couple of friends. We stumbled upon a dilapidated, shot up apartment block sitting next to a graffiti laden portion of the wall. Perhaps you&#39;ve seen it - its most prominent piece is a likeness of the statue of liberty, though lady liberty has been replaced by a skeleton. </p>

<p>As we were examining the wall, taking pictures, and talking to some local boys (who showed us their makeshift ladder for taking (dangerous) peeks over the wall - they&#39;d jammed pieces of thick wooden dowel in the cavities between cement slabs of which the wall is composed), a woman yelled down to us from one of the apartments, which we&#39;d assumed were abandoned. Long story short, she had us in for tea, and through broken English, we learned about her story.</p>

<p>Same old, sad things. What stuck with me was the hospitality there, of which I saw little of back over on the other side of the wall. This woman, who&#39;s living in a shit hole, broken ass, shell of an apartment, whose possessions amount to little, was offering us westerners tea.</p>

<p>Anyways, I saw an image of that same spot, with the same graffiti, in Nat Geo a few years later. The apartments were gone and so was the makeshift ladder. </p>

<p>The world can be a very sad place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest I find the whole anecdote about the girl with the assault rifle to not be that shocking or astounding. In Israel you can carry more or less any weapon you so choose provided it&#39;s not loaded, and I basically completely agree with this type of gun control (IE very little.) It&#39;s the stigma around guns which leads to their use in so many murders in my opinion. They are, after all, just tools, exactly like a knife or a spade, both of which can and are used in a lot of murders. </p>

<p>I mean, look up some statistics and you&#39;ll find that Israel has much fewer uses of guns in crime per year than America, and also that more guns are used to prevent crimes such as rapes, muggings, and robberies over there. </p>

<p>To clarify, I do not condone any actions of the Israeli state, nor would I dare to suggest I know anything about the topic in truth. </p>

Israeli Government Consciously Planned to Keep Palestinians &quot;on a Diet&quot;, Controlling Their Food Supply, Damning Document Reveals</p>

<p>Israeli military forced to reveal that Israel calculated the amount of calories Palestinians would need to avoid malnutrition.</p>

<p>An Israeli human rights organization, Gisha, sued in Israeli courts to force the release of a planning document for ‘putting the Palestinians on a diet’ without risking the bad press of mass starvation, and the courts concurred. The document, produced by the Israeli army, appears to be a calculation of how to make sure, despite the Israeli blockade, that Palestinians got an average of 2279 calories a day, the basic need. But by planning on limiting the calories in that way, the Israeli military was actually plotting to keep Palestinians in Gaza (half of them children) permanently on the brink of malnutrition, what health professionals call “food insecurity”. And, it was foreseeable that sometimes they would slip into malnutrition, since not as many trucks were always let in every day as the Israeli army recommended (106 were recommended, but it was often less in the period 2007-2010). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true only of Gaza, and not the West Bank (where the majority of Palestinians live).  But Israel never had any intention of maintaining control over Gaza.  They ceded that territory (along with the rest of the Sinai Peninsula) back to Egypt in 1967.  Egypt never accepted the territory, so Gaza is essentially unclaimed territory.  It&#39;s not self-sufficient agriculturally and lacks even sufficient clean drinking water for its inhabitants.  It&#39;s unsustainable.  If it was its own sovereign nation, nothing would change or improve (except that Israel would no longer be pressured to feed the inhabitants of Gaza).</p>

<p>Yes, Israel put up barriers along its border with Gaza.  I don&#39;t understand why it wouldn&#39;t have a right to do so.  Gaza has essentially no farmland and can&#39;t feed its citizens.  Why are you blaming Israel for that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gaza borders with Egypt aswell, supplying the &#39;minimal&#39;  (over 2200 calories a Day sounds fine to me but i&#39;m no expert) by Israel ensures there is enough food so there&#39;s no violation of the international law during the blockade. just as the UN declared in its investigation after the Marmara thingie. This article is highly misleading but since I&#39;m on my phone I can&#39;t do much more than I just said, I might come back to it later if there&#39;s a need. </p>

<p>On a personal note I think there needs to be a differentiation between Gaza and the West Bank by both the international community and Israel, and although there is no blockade in the West Bank I think our government should ease the life of the people there a little more than it currently does. About Gaza? Hell no, when Gaza will be as quite as the West Bank is, things will get better for them aswell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every honest soul on earth saw the flotilla for the propaganda stunt it was.  The fact that you try and present it as a delivery of food is certain proof of just how biased your views are.</p>

<p>Through this period, Israel has repeated offered free access to any charity that wants to send food or medicine.  All it asks is the right to screen it free of weapons and missile parts.</p>

<p>Are you really so far gone in your hatred of Israel that you can&#39;t admit that simple fact?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were no weapons and only food on that flotilla. Activists were executed onboard for trying to bring in food. Period.</p>

<p>Let me say this once more to get it through your thick head. The Israeli government says that they monitor and limit food entering Gaza because of the possibility of weapons being shipped with the food. An Israeli activist group sued the government to declassify that report and it stated that the actual reason was to create &quot;food insecurity&quot; for Palestinians.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t see that the Isaeli&#39;s are trying to wipe out the Palestinians as a people I don&#39;t know what to tell you. It&#39;s as clear as day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All Israel asked of the flotilla was that it allow the shipments to be inspected, and they would grant passage to all the food the &quot;charities&quot; wanted to send.  The flotilla refused.  The charities refuse.  Every honest soul in the world knows that Israel would be delighted if the world charities would send in the required food and medicine.   One less headache for Israel.  They just want to screen out weapons and missile parts.</p>

<p>You do acknowledge all the missiles being fired at Israel from Gaza, right?  You do admit the thousands and thousands of missiles that rained down out of Hezbollah in 2008?  Are you seriously saying that Israel should just roll over and take it?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy crap.</p>

<p>Thank you thank you thank you for typing this. As an Arab, i WRITHE in heart ache whenever i see anyone defend Isreal. its not because &quot;oh, im muslim and theyre jews&quot;, its because Isreal is CLEARLY, quiet literally, destroying Palestine. My parents had an international satellite since i was 4, and i would be watching recordings of the war-crimes and BLATANT injustice done to a race, simply because of their ethnicity. Meanwhile, i hear people spew shit like how they &quot;deserve&quot; their own country and how those pesky Palestinians should stop being racist and let them.</p>

<p>You didnt get to witness the bulldozing of peoples homes with the familys still inside, as they scramble out with whatever they managed to grab. But you did witness the stiff-arming and profiling done just because theyre <em>arab</em>. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Now that youve witnessed this in person, do you understand when someone says they hate Isreal? specifically middle eastern countries? Its not about religion, its about human rights (though obviously racism/tribalism does creep in, as it would in any situation). The Palestinians would have had no problem integrating and living with an influx of jews who wished to leave in their holy land, but you better damn well believe theyll have a rpoblem when they start erecting walls and annexing more palestinian land without compensation.</p>

<p>Kinda makes you wonder, if you were living in Palestine and saw a forign military force ousting you and your neighbors from their home, would you take up arms against said nation? i wonder if thats happened...hmm..</p>

<p>edit: To those who argue that Israel&#39;s harsh domestic policy towards the Arabs is necessary: false, only thing that creates terrorists are aggressors. Remember when the Arabs controlled Jerusalem? Jews and Muslims actually got along. Sadly, it&#39;s not.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>and this. Not because Arabs are better than Jews at running nations or anything, but because of the mindset of Isreals leaders and their puppet masters. The only reason that plot of land was chosen is because it says so in the Torah, meanwhile if the Muslims ever try to use their book for justification, its called barbaric and shouldnt be implemented.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Youre on point. It drives me nuts when i hear someone actually defend israels actions because i know they dont know <em>shit</em> about the situation.</p>

<p>Its just as you said, its not because Isreal exists or is a jewish state, its simply a matter of Israel being a violent, imperious bully. The kind of way Israel treats arabs is the same as the germans treated the jews. its simply wrong, and (while im never an advocator for violence unless an imminent threat is on the way..) if you continue this behavior for now, 2 generations? thats alot of built up hate. Children are being born and grow up with this idea of Palestinians and arabs being &quot;lesser&quot; and Isrealis and jews are violent oppressors who will gut you if given the chance. It simply brews more problems, and unless one plans to exterminate an entire race, gunpower and explosives will make the situation much worse.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Unfortunately, i dont see an out for this conflict. Isreal thinks it should be there, just because, Palestinians think the opposite. Budging even slightly is losing</p>

<p>Yes, there&#39;s much more, but gassing people is pretty much a signature move in the treatment of jews by germans. there were also mass graves and experiments too, all things that Israel would never do.</p>

<p>There are a few differences.  Last I checked there were significantly fewer Jews in the world today than in 1939.  Also last I checked there were significantly more Palestinians in Israel and elsewhere than there were in 1948.  If we want to talk about comparisons with the Nazis, we also need to remember that it was the leader of Palestine&#39;s Arabs that spent the war in Germany meeting with Hitler and Himmler and helping to raise an SS unit.

<p>This is how I feel but the constant bullshit that Israel is the sole victim is incredibly infuriating as the world takes a back seat to the stuff that is happening. And there&#39;s a good reason why Israel is such a hot topic in conspiracy circles. I realise there is genuine anti-Semitism but most of it centres around a theme that is seen in other conspiracy theories. There is <em>silence</em> around the topic and a really odd knack of media and politicians completely ignoring issues while giving Israel a free pass.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s such a huge topic. It&#39;s so blatant, yet it&#39;s largely ignored and untouched and there is a really sinister silence on the topic and accusations of anti-Semitism for those that choose to speak about it. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all one sided but the Palestinians are being systematically plundered for the land they live on year upon year while claims of a peace deal keep getting trotted out. To me it seems as if the peace deal is never intended to be accepted and it just gives more time to make the land the Palestinians live on smaller and smaller.</p>

<p>If the current course continues, then it won&#39;t be that much longer until all the land is gone and the people are cast out as refugees. All of this is based on a fictional book written thousands or years a go taken as fact by some extremists that claim they are chosen by god.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Remember when the Arabs controlled Jerusalem? Jews and Muslims actually got along. Sadly, it&#39;s not.&quot;</p>

<p>I am surprised to read what your wrote.  When the Arabs controlled the Old City and Eastern part of Jerusalem from 1948-67, the Jewish Quarter was destroyed and Jews were not allowed access to the Western Wall or any part of the old city.  Jerusalem, as you know well, was divided by a ceasfire line and barbed wire. It was only after 1967 that the Jewish Quarter was rebuilt.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The U.S. should threaten to stop aiding Israel if they don&#39;t cut the shit. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, this will never happen. It is well documented that in order for an American to join the political class at any level of influence, they must tithe properly to centrally owned Media conglomerates, some of the most influential of which are run and operated by pro-Israel Zionists. The only place politicians can get that level of continuous money is from special interest groups, some of the most generous of which are comprised of pro-Israel Zionists. </p>

<p>When politicians take this money, it is understood that they will toe the line with pro-Israel Zionists on issues of import. In exchange, part of the money that the politician secures for pro-Zionist Israel finds it&#39;s way back to their campaign chests, and enriches the shell organizations that these politicians have set up for this (among other) purpose. </p>

<p>Therefore, any American politician that takes a hardline stance against the actions of pro-Israel Zionists will find (at the very least) that their campaign contributions have dried up. Without that money, they cannot participate in the discussions the influential pro-Zionist media is having in the election cycle, and the politician&#39;s campaign fails outright. </p>

<p>This ensures that a certain agenda is not only always in play, but always protected and self-policing. </p>

<p>Pro-Zionist Israel is marginalizing the American voice as well as the Palestinian. The methods are different, the result is the same. More for pro-Zionist Israel, less for everyone else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The Palestinians would have had no problem integrating and living with an influx of jews who wished to leave in their holy land...&quot;</p>

<p>I think former Palestinian leader Haj Amin al-Husseini was talking rather differently when he met with Hitler and spent much of WWII in Germany.  We know what he wanted in 1948.  Same for the the PLO&#39;s leader in the Spring of 1967, who in the leadup to what he expected to be an Arab victory, said he thought no Jews would survive in Palestine after it was liberated.  His name was Ahmed Shukiari. Even the current PA President said in 2011 that &quot;not a single&quot; Israeli would be allowed to live in a future Palestinian state. </p>

<p>Until necessity forced a change in rhetoric and tactics, the Palestinians were dead set against any significant Jewish presence anywhere in what was madatory Palestine.  But maybe times change.</p>

<p>Fred, I think you need to become a bit less emotional and more logical. Is any of what I stated not true?  Didn&#39;t the Mufti ally himself with the Nazis during WWII?  Weren&#39;t almost all Palestinians, then and for decades after, opposed to Jews coming to Palestine/Israel?  If I am factually wrong, Fred, please point it out.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what, dude? You blew your chances of peace. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Israel accepted a very small state in 1948. Five Arab countries attacked Israel and denied the partition. The Arabs lost. Jordan took the West Bank. </p></li>
<li><p>Egypt and several Arab armies lost the six-day war to Israel. Egypt had prior to the start of the war blocked the Straits of Tiran and moved forced through Sinai, clearly violating the peace agreement from 1948.</p></li>
<li><p>Syria attacked Israel on the holiest of Jewish holidays in 1973. Israel was unprepared, but won - again. </p></li>
<li><p>Israel withdrew from Sinai and forcibly uprooted Jewish villages to make peace with Egypt.</p></li>
<li><p>Israel signed and implemented the Oslo Accords. Palestinian school children still have maps without Israel on them and still see the pink rabbit on TV that teaches them that Jews are rats. </p></li>
<li><p>Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip, leaving in to Egypt to open their border to their Palestinian brothers. Egypt didn&#39;t do this. More than 10,000 rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israeli civilians.</p></li>
<li><p>Palestinians enjoy some of the highest living standards among Arabs. Including those in Gaza.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But you know what? You fuck it up. Yourselves. No Arab country works. Until you realize this, you&#39;ll never get good lives. I hope a peace deal is signed and that Israel completely closes her borders to the new state (this is obviously any state&#39;s right). Let&#39;s see if Palestine becomes a rich country overnight. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think so. But as long as Israelis can&#39;t get a peace deal, you&#39;ll have Israel to blame for everything that Arabs fuck up themselves. </p>

<p>Apparently, i cant feel bad about a specific issue on r/rconspiracy because i get bombarded withstupid  people waving around incidents saying &quot;oh yeah? what about THIS? you didnt say you feel bad about this!&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The rampant poverty in Palestine is not limited to Palestine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>im not referring to poverty, but yes poverty is everywhere in the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Human rights violations are not limited to Palestine in the Arabic world</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct, i never stated otherwise</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The same issues in Palestine of poverty, human rights violations, limited freedoms are present in almost every Arabic country</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cool story bro, what does this have to do with the Palestinian Israel conflict? nothing? oh ok.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is Israel to blame for those conditions as well?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read my post again. Im talking strictly about Palistine and Isreal. I have never insinuated Isreal is the root of all problems this world ever has and ever will experience. Why you are phrasing your questions as if i did is beyond me.</p>

<p>Israel. Palestine.<br/>
 Stay focused kids.</p>

<p>Israel was the reason U.S invested so much in the Egyptian army, Egypt had its elected president, and if things went well there, most of the other countries will follow Egypt lead. but U.S didn&#39;t want that, because <strong>Any democracy</strong> in the middle east will be against Israel and US doesn&#39;t want that.</p>

<p>Israel bears most responsibility for the situation of the Palestinians just as Hosni Mubarak was mostly to blame for the situation of the Egyptians. There isn&#39;t some third party here that completely made both situations, unless you want to take the &quot;blame America&quot; route without holding a single American puppet state responsible for its own actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I traveled to Palestine and Israel two years ago. I went with a class and we spent 10 days there. Your story is spot on. We traveled to Bethlehem, Jerusalem, Nazareth, Hebron and several other places. It was intense.</p>

<p>We came into the West Bank through the Allenby/King Hussein Bridge through Jordan b/c we had a member of the group who was half Palestinian so we couldn&#39;t fly into Tel Aviv. At the checkpoint, we got in late and ended up staying there for several hours b/c the Israeli military who were at the checkpoint interogated (yelled and verbally abused) the member of our group who was half Palestinian, along with another woman who was Indian. 
We were the last group to be able to leave the check point, while we waited for our two members to be released, we sat outside of the bus and as a scare tactic, the Israeli military members (who were all extremely young looking and carrying automatic weapons) blasted music from one of their Jeeps. </p>

<p>We finally we able to leave. From there we traveled to Bethlehem where we saw the Church of the Nativity (where Jesus is said to have been born) and saw the bullet holes from the Second Intifada and met Palestinian giftshop owners who have been blacklisted. </p>

<p>The Wall is an everpresent entity. It literally cuts through olive groves that used to sustain families and are now in a no man&#39;s land. And the ironic part about the Separation Barrier is that Israeli&#39;s claim it is for security purposes and yet we walked through areas where the wall hadn&#39;t been completed yet, walked though, with no one stopping us. No guards, no cameras, not even fences there. The wall isn&#39;t there for security, it is to separate. To cut off people from there homes and their land. And then to leave that land open to settlers. To build more settlements, which are illegal.</p>

<p>We saw segregated streets in Hebron. Where Israeli&#39;s are allowed to drive on one side of the road and Palestinians are allowed to walk on the other side. There was a group of young Israeli school children walking from one end of the street to the other being chaperoned by three armed men, who were their teachers. The doors to where Palestinian vendors used to set up shop were welded shut by the Israeli government to cut off commerce. In some parts of Hebron, Israeli settlers have literally pushed out Palestinian families from the second story of their houses and now occupy the second story, while the Palestinian family must now live only on the first floor. The settlers have taken to throwing trash and rocks, sometimes worse things like acid and human waste, onto any Palestinian who walks in the alleys, so there are now chicken wire and metal coverings in some of the alleys, to catch the larger things thrown. Hebron was the worst place we went too.</p>

<p>We were only there ten days and these stories are only a small fraction of what we saw and experienced. There were days where it was just too tiring to speak. Sometimes we just wondered what new horrors we would learn about. But I don&#39;t regret it. We also met some amazing people who risk their lives and freedom to give tours of the wall and places like Hebron, who just want to raise their family, or who travel across the wall and countless checkpoints to go to university. 
Sorry so long as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m far from a conspiracy nut, but the reason that the U.S. gives two shits about Israel is because the Christians in this country have convinced our government to support Israel in order to to have the Mosque on the Temple Mount destroyed so that the Temple in Revelation prophecy can be rebuilt thus initiating the return of the Christ and the start of the Apocalypse. Christians in Congress and the White House of the 1950&#39;s were not difficult to be persuaded into this conspiracy. And today the public is constantly reminded that Israel is under constant attack and must be protected at all cost because &quot;it&#39;s the right thing to do&quot; when in fact it is religious extremism that is pushing the agenda.</p>

<p>After Jesus&#39;s triumphant return, the U.S. will not give a crap about Jews and Palestinians. That is the plan, anyhow.</p>

It has a lot more to do with the fact that Israel is America&#39;s laboratory for testing out its weapons and tactics against insurgent Middle Eastern anticolonial movements. Most of what we&#39;ve seen in Iraq and Afghanistan was first applied in Palestine. Israel is a blunt tool that America can wield for bashing in any Middle Eastern government or movement that would challenge its hegemony in the region.

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t discount this element but the defining factor is the ability of Israel lobbies in the US. If you look right back even to Desert Storm (1992), it was Jewish academics who setup the deal with Richard Perle etc and Ahmad Chalabi. These people have been a constant in US foreign policy for over two decades and they are <em>still</em> influencing it.</p>

<p>There needs to be a very clear and calm discussion about how much influence Israel has on US foreign policy because history tells us that recent US wars have been favourable for Israel and they wrote and recommended it happened but America ended up doing the dirty work and all that come with that.</p>

<p>I&#39;d just like to add that this thread has been incredibly good to read and well mannered throughout. The usual mudslinging and accusations are pretty much none existent for such a hot topic.</p>

I think that&#39;s a huge part of it, especially the beginnings of how we got there. But also having a military presence in a region that hasa large amount of oil and unstable governments a large Soviet presence (during the cold war) gives legitimacy to modern politicians who may not have whackadoo apocalypse beliefs.
It&#39;s on of the few places with oil that isn&#39;t either under the West&#39;s or Russia&#39;s thumbs and the last region where American Military Might is contested.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember much of what he said about the media, but I think German media still has a tendency to back off from criticizing Jews because of the holocaust.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;but I think German media still has a tendency to back off from criticizing Jews because of the holocaust.&quot;</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t it depend on the nature of the criticism?  Criticism, after all, can be constructive or destructive. One can criticize Israeli policies and support the need for compromise.  That is constructive.  Asserting, as some on this forum do, that Israel is doing &quot;the same thing&quot; to the Palestinians that the Germans did to the Jews&quot; is not only false, it is malicious.  It demeans those making the assertion and does nothing to help the Palestinians.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to pose some questions to you to ask yourself.  Do you think the Jews have any right to a state at all, in any borders?  What do you think would be a just settlement of the conflict?  I have visited Germany a couple of times and was recently in Berlin.  Do you think Germany&#39;s treatment of the Turks offers an example for Israel to follow?  Making multiculturalism work is a challenge for any society.  Do you think it is working in Germany today? </p>

<p>The author you mentioned was Gunther Grass, I believe.  There are mixed opionions about him.  I think Israel missed an intersting chance to invite him to come and disscuss/debate his views. I don&#39;t know if he is anti-semitic or not.  My sense is that he, and many of his generation in Germany, have deeply mixed feelings about Jews.  That is certainly true for many older Germans I have known personally.  Have you ever talked about this with your parents or grandparents?  Do you feel they would speak honestly to you about what they remember and how they feel about it?</p>

<p>To some degree, I suppose. I think they there&#39;s still a slight bias towards not constructively criticizing, though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that Israel is doing &quot;the same thing&quot; to the Palestinians that the Germans did to the Jews&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly not what I think.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think the Jews have any right to a state at all, in any borders?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that everyone should be allowed to live where they want to live. The most important question should be the legitimacy of the government, and I think choosing one democratically with (voluntary) votes from everyone living in the respective area is one of the best options we have for maximizing that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you think would be a just settlement of the conflict?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure such a thing is possible given the warmongering from some factions and their mutual hatred. If it is possible, I suppose the best option is to have two seperate recognized states, though I don&#39;t know what the borders should look like.</p>

<p>I would say it&#39;s mostly working in Germany, though there could definitely be improvements. But I think the German situation can&#39;t be directly applied to Israel and Palestine, because the initial conditions are quite different. Both feel like the Levant is where their people belongs historically and religiously. That&#39;s not the case with Germany.</p>

<p>My parents, and I think my grandfather, share the views of most people I know, namely that antisemitism is horrible as is what happened during the 30s and 40s in Germany. I&#39;m pretty sure that they are honest about it, as well. My grandmother probably doesn&#39;t really have a strong opinion about it, but she tends to remember her youth quite often. When she talks about it, she just says what happened, without being for or against it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your answers.  You might want to have a look at the Clinton Parameters, issued in late 2000.  They provide a very good outline of a settlement.  Sadly, Mr. Arafat could not bring himself to accept them.  Even today, the Palestinians could put the Netanyahu government on the defense by accepting them.  Have a look at them:</p>

<p>My impression, at least in Berlin, is that there is little integration.  Turks and Germans live in largely separate worlds. The Turks do have access to many social services, but they are largely ignored. Have you ever talked with a Turk or other Muslim about how they feel?  </p>

<p>Ever wonder why she expresses no opinion for or against?  Do you know in what units or branches of the armed forces you grandfather&#39;s served and where?  It is only recently that older Germans were even willing to talk about this.  When I first visited in the early 1970&#39;s and you could not even mention the terms Hitler and Nazis without things getting very tense.  When I was in high school, we could go to Germany for a summer of study.  Those thinking about it were told not to mention certain things.  From many friends, I know that the generations born in the 1950&#39;s and 60&#39;s seldom were able to discuss this with their parents.  Times have changed as the older generation is passing from the scene and the current adult generation has no direct experience or memory.  Things are discussed much more openly now.</p>

<p>Ah, well I live in a small town in southern Germany, so I don&#39;t have any direct experience of how the situation in larger cities is. That was just the impression I got from what I&#39;ve heard so far. Where I live, immigrants are mostly from the former Soviet Union, and they seem to be able to handle it relatively well.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To be honest, I think she doesn&#39;t care much about things which do not directly affect her personally. In the past few years, she&#39;s also been starting to get forgetful, which reinforces that.</p>

<p>Not surprising after a long period of limited discussion. To realize just how much times have changed, you can see what happened when Phllipp Jenninger, the former Speaker of the Bundestag in 1988, tried to speak honestly about how many Germans felt in the 1930&#39;s.  Seems like his honesty violated a sort of unspoken rule and he had to resign.  You might find this intersting.  I felt bad for the guy, who was trying to be sincere....</p>

I think the Israelis need to show a lot more compassion because they are richer and better educated and have far far more opportunities, and they ought to try to lift the Palestinians up and figure out a way for them to feel like they have dignity and a chance as human beings.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this! I often see all over reddit that Israel is largely wrong. Israel can definitely fix some of their practices, however people really polarize the situation. Unfortunately, israel is now conditioned to protect itself heavily due to the history behind the country. The day israel was official was the first day it went to war. Its not as easy of a situation as people make it seem. There are quite a few terrorist organizations in Palestine that make it hard for Israel to relax their borders. I&#39;ve spent time in Israel and have family in the army, while I don&#39;t agree with somethings Israel does, I feel that if you at least try to see it from their perspective, you would see that their security is normal for a country constantly attacked on a day to day basis. And at least Palestinians CAN work in Israel. Its true that you don&#39;t see that at the US and Mexican border.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the practice definitely needs to cease. Its actually hurting both the Jewish settlers and the Palestinians. On the settlement borders its a whole different war. Similar to that of the wild west... It hurts the Jewish settlers because often times terrorist organizations can easily get to and harm the families there. (Which is completely wrong no matter what Israels policies are. They are still innocent families.) Its also taking away Palestinian land, which isn&#39;t right. I&#39;d prefer a melding of the entire Palestinian and Israel land into a unified country, however that&#39;s super idealistic. I definitely feel Israel should exist, that I am sure of. Israel conquered a lot of land in the wars they fought (and didn&#39;t start) but they gave it back in an effort for peace. However this was definitely an earlier Israel. Israeli policies have changed. They have become way more defensive over the years due to a consistent state of war. Should they give up more land? No. But they shouldn&#39;t keep encroaching on Palestinian land. Are they super evil and brainwash the Jews living there? No. I know many many people living there and have been there myself. There is a TON of peaceful, normal, everyday conduct among Palestinians, Jews, Christians, Arab Muslims, etc. Just no one ever points out the good stuff. There is certainly more good than bad I will tell you that. But the fact that Israel is bombed <em>everyday</em> from the Gaza strip is a good reason to create stricter border rules. If this was mexico bombing america everyday and america made strict border rules, there would be little fan fare, because most people would say its justified. I think more people need to take a step back from all sides of the argument and take a look at the history of the area and see that both sides have merit and both sides have things to be ashamed of. </p>

<p>Edit: sorry for it being so long, I just feel like no one really takes an objective look at the situation. </p>

<p>How &quot;innocent&quot; would palestinians be if they forced the Jewish Israelis to flee Jerusalem or be murdered, destroyed all the Jewish homes in Jerusalem, then offered Palestinian families homes in Jewish Palestine to seize the land from the Jewish Israelis in perpetuity?  What parent would put their children in that situation?  Not only using the home you raise your children in to seize the land of other people, but putting your childrens lives in danger.  Not only that, but settlers are recognized as being even more racist against arabs than the regular jewish population.  These are not nice, friendly people.  Settler rabbis openly preach racism.  Don&#39;t work with arabs, don&#39;t socialize with arabs,  Don&#39;t be friends with them or have relationships with them.  Don&#39;t live in an apartment complex with arabs.</p>

You just sound angry, biased, and if you want to refer to jews in israel as &quot;brainwashed&quot; you would be just as &quot;brainwashed&quot; as the other side. You are literally advocating for the death of jewish families, including babies who have nothing to do with this. You are supporting terror and I&#39;m sorry, but I cannot advocate that. Palestinians have killed jews, jews have killed Palestinians. Guess what... They are in a war, shit happens. But when I see <em>extreme</em> Palestinian soldiers hiding behind children and using schools as places to hide weapons, and bomb clear cut israeli cities (not settlements) I think there is definitely something wrong here. Both sides are doing wrong, deal with it. You seem very unwilling to look at the situation objectively, and seem really brainwashed yourself.

    <div class="md"><p>How many babies and children has the IDF, settlers, and israelis killed in the last 10-70 years?  How many babies and children were killed to commit the war crimes that are the settlements?</p>

<p>What is the israeli government doing when their official government policy is to inflict pain on the relatives of hamas members?  When Israel is an institutionally racist nation?</p>

<p>Have you seen the IDF murder, bomb, and attack palestinian civilians?</p>

<p>How can you watch the IDF murder thousands of Palestinians, most of them civilians, and then say that the Israelis are blameless, and that the Palestinians are the murderers?</p>

<p>What I am advocating is that Israel shouldn&#39;t have built the settlements on the dead bodies, and the blood, and the land of people they want to steal it from in perpetuity.  That destroying villages is Israeli violence that Israel knows will only fuel more violence, more death.  That Israel can&#39;t kill a thousand Palestinians without there being violent repercussions.  That a conscious government policy of killing and punishing innocent civilians, and thrusting hundreds of thousands of civilians deliberately into destitution is a terrible policy.</p>

<p>How many hundreds of thousands of israelis did you see forced by the government to live like scorned refugees, living in deplorable conditions?</p>

<p>How many hardships did you see the government thrust on hundreds of Israeli communities?</p>

<p>How would you describe Israel&#39;s settlement policy?  Where and how did Israel get the land?  What happened to the people that lived there?  Who is israel moving in to those places, and why?</p>

<p>How many dead babies are the settlements built on?  Explain that policy to me.</p>

<p>Tell me how this happy, civil Israel you tell me about thinks about the babies and children the IDF and settlers murder.  Do you call them advocates of child murder?</p>

<p>What would you say if a settlement policy was enforced on the peaceful, happy Jews, Christians, and Arabs you describe?  What would you say if the IDF demolished their towns, villages and cities?  What would you say if the IDF treated their children as mere collateral damage, killing them indiscriminately.  What would you say if there was a group like the settlers in Israel today that treated them the way settlers today treat Palestinians, murdering them without repercussions?  What would you say of the people who built homes on their graves?</p>

<p>You say I advocate killing settler children, what was the crime of the hundreds of Palestinian children murdered by the IDF and settlers?  Who advocated their murder?  Who advocates their continual murder?</p>

<p>How many children would you murder to make the next settlement Israel will make?  And the next?  And the next?</p>

<p>You criticize my policy on children.  What is the Israeli government&#39;s policy on women, babies, and children?  Would you say the democratically elected Israeli government advocates the murder of babies and children?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t a direct parallel, but say a settler family was given the option to press a button, if they press the button, a Palestinian house is destroyed, possibly killing people, and of course, they use their family and their children to commit a war crime, but in exchange, they get a heavily subsidized house along with paid security.  Are they totally without blame?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really complex, because on one side you have what the Israelis consider illegal settlements - set up by independent individuals and many times demolished by the army (though not always) on the other hand, you have the settlements the government supports, funds and builds. Eventually, most of settlements regardless of how the Israelis view them are illegal according to the international law. </p>

<p>Eventually it really depends on who&#39;s in the government. Right now we have a government that is ruled mostly by the right wing. A leftist government would&#39;ve made life easier for everyone, both Palestinians and Israelis. </p>

<p>It was under British for nearly a century, during which the Jewish population swelled to equal that of the Arab population. </p>

<p>When Britain moved out both groups were given separate nations. </p>

<p>Nearly as quickly several neighboring nations attempted to destroy Israel, during which Palestinian civilians evacuated their homes. </p>

<p>When the war turned against Egypt and Palestine Israel expanded into the evacuated Palestinian land. </p>

<p>To say that they just moved into land that was occupied by force is hilariously ignorant. </p>

<p>If you believe Israel deserves the land it occupies, then you must also believe the Native Americans deserve Manhattan back. Or that the Irish deserve Northern Ireland back.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this the EXACT opposite of what you&#39;re arguing?</p>

<p>That, though the palestinians may have had the majority population a centruy ago, they didn&#39;t when the time came to create nations, therefore they have no more right to the land than the Indians have to Manhattan.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more, the fact that any expansion done by israel was done in a post war movement, palestine really doesn&#39;t get much say in the matter now does it.</p>

<p>By your logic, no country could ever be formed unless it had a 100% population equivilant</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how it has ever worked, and it&#39;s not how it works now.</p>

I&#39;m not uppity, but i think you can compare those values. Just as we can say today that separate water fountains are wrong (and many people also did back then) we can say that certain traditions in the world today are.</p>

<p>The US doesn&#39;t directly support fundamentalism but if you claim they meddle in other countries&#39; business and it ultimately snowballs into fundamentalism that&#39;s a reasonable argument.
But there are countries that don&#39;t go in that route, and there are countries that do without any US interference so I&#39;m not so sure as you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CIA created, supported and funded the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan during the Cold War. The US claims that they only funded local Mujahadeen fighters. Seeing as Bin Laden was one of the leaders of the Mujahadeen you would have to be beyond naive to take the US&#39; word on this. </p>

<p>From wiki:</p>

<p>In a 2004 BBC article entitled &quot;Al-Qaeda&#39;s origins and links&quot;, the BBC wrote:</p>

<p>During the anti-Soviet jihad Bin Laden and his fighters received American and Saudi funding. Some analysts 
believe Bin Laden himself had security training from the CIA.[1]</p>

<p>Robin Cook, Foreign Secretary in the UK from 1997–2001, believed the CIA had provided arms to the Arab Mujahideen, including Osama bin Laden, writing, &quot;Bin Laden was, though, a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies. Throughout the 80s he was armed by the CIA and funded by the Saudis to wage jihad against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan.&quot; His source for this is unclear.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA%E2%80%93al-Qaeda_controversy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA%E2%80%93al-Qaeda_controversy</a></p>

<p>Re: Iran. Of course the US didnt prop up the Islamic Republic of Iran. That was formed after the Shah was assassinated by the CIA. The US hates any democracy in the Middle East and has sought to topple Iran&#39;s government ever since.</p>

<p>Lastly, the US DOES support fundamentalism. They have supported all the far right movements around the world in an effort to combat the Soviet Union and communism since the end of WWII. They have been caught colluding with Saudi Arabia in creating Madrassas that create the terrorists the US army currently fights in Afghanistan and Iraq. Almost all of the terrorists in these countries are from Saudi Arabia which is one of the US&#39; closest allies.</p>

<p>They stage false flag attacks and blame it on the Sunni or Shia in an effort to create a civil war. They want it to reach a point where the terrorism happens naturally without them having to stage false flag attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When discussing both forms of mutilation in their most analogous forms the reason is, in fact, not different by virtue of the fact that both are, primarily, for cultural acceptance. Secondly, the barbarism is arguably skewed towards male infant circumcision insofar as more tissue is removed, and lastly the outcome is the same - a child with no say is violated for some idiotic and outdated custom with virtually no prophylactic value in the developed world.
Also, those who would argue that FGM is always worse in severity than male infant circumcision are poorly informed given that some countries perform circumcisions with inadequate tools and no anesthetic, moreover, in developed countries there are botched circumcisions that happen - some serious enough to warrant gender/sex reassignment. Lastly, certain cultures perform variations of male circumcision that are quite traumatic, for example some remove the glans entirely and other split the penis down the middle.</p>

<p>tl:dr - all circumcision is pointless abuse unless it serves some legitimate medically warranted purpose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello: I don’t think I’m going to change your mind, but I recommend some additional reading. Acknowledging difficult historical and contemporary facts about both Israeli and Palestinian actions is important if you want to have a constructive conversation about the Israeli-Palestinian topic. To go through your points one by one: 
* The Palestinian expulsion. Israeli and Zionist historian Benny Morris supports Israeli actions in 1948 and acknowledges that there was a concentrated ethnic cleansing and forced expulsion of Palestinians. See his book The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem.<br/>
* Palestine was not a country: You are correct that Palestine was never a country as we understand a nation state today. The area contained by contemporary Israel and Palestine was administered by two different Ottoman districts, then became a British Protectorate until the foundation of Israel. Neither were any of the countries in the Habsburg Empire until after WWI. For that matter, neither was Israel a country, despite the best efforts of many, until 1948. The point is, whether or not a country is granted widely recognized ‘nation status’ does not mean that those who have lived on the land for generations can be dispossessed of their property.
* Arabs living within Israel have them same rights as all other Israeli citizens: From a legal perspective, you are largely correct. However, there is extensive discrimination against Arabs (and even Jews of Arab descent) in Israel related to land ownership, access to jobs, etc. The de jure status of Israeli Arabs should be distinguished from their de facto status.
Hope this helps lead you to take a more nuanced position on the topic!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being a Palestinian born in America, I can tell plenty of stories that will open up people&#39;s eyes to the situation. I currently have dual citizenship, and because so, I can&#39;t visit Jerusalem without a visa. Hell, I can&#39;t even fly into tel aviv, I&#39;m forced to fly into Jordan, and then spend another day crossing the border into Palestine, which is no fun task in itself. </p>

<p>The biggest issue I have with crossing the border happened approximately 5 years ago. My brother, oldest sister, and father don&#39;t have their Palestinian citizenship, so when we went to cross the border, they had to go through a line for US Citizens on the Israeli side. They decided to hold my family members with only US citizenship for  &quot;questioning.&quot; Now my oldest sister has Down&#39;s syndrome, and they held her as well. They started asking her questions like where do you work, why are you here, where do you go to school, why are you not flying into tel aviv? As you can imagine, this confused her and made her uncomfortable. My older brother noticed this and proceeded to start yelling at this, which caused them to release my sister and my father, and hold my brother for another 2 hours for a total of 4-5 hours of holding him. </p>

<p>More people need to realize how badly people are treated by the Israelis. </p>

<p>On that note, I&#39;ve met plenty of nice Israelis, but it&#39;s the bad apples that gives a bad name for most of them!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>look, I&#39;m Israeli, and I think that outside of what&#39;s happening in the west bank, there is not a lot of racism towards arabs in Israel. It exists, but not in the manner and prevelance that is described in this thread. There are no checkpoints in Tel Aviv that I know of, so I don&#39;t know how police officers could have harrased palestinians there. I don&#39;t know if your story about children throwing rocks at arabs in ashdod is true, I&#39;ve never seen such thing happen, and there are not many arabs in ashdod, but if it&#39;s true then it&#39;s bad and it&#39;s definitely not something usual.</p>

<p>I think that security measures in the west bank are justified and are a result of the constant hostility of the palestinians towards israel, and not the other way around. of course we need to minimize the inconvinience that is caused to the average palestinian by them, but it&#39;s a fact that since the wall has been built, the amount of terrorist attacks inside Israel has been reduced siginificantly. I wait eagerly for the day when such measures are not necessary and both sides can live freely side by side, but until then Israel has to keep the safety of its citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is so fucking true. I see more racism in my hometown (Atlanta) toward blacks than I did in Israel towards people of Arabic descent. The majority of the Israelis I met and spoke with were liberal minded people who wanted the Palestinians to be able to have access to the things they needed. The issue is so much more complicated than people want to accept. There wasn&#39;t always a wall. Back then you could get blown up by a suicide bomber at the mall or ripped from your house and tortured or raped in front of our children by terrorists. I know several families who lost loved ones. One girl lost her infant cousin in a suicide bombing, and her aunt nearly didn&#39;t make it.</p>

<p>The Israeli government targets terrorists, and yea, there is collateral damage: such is the nature of urban warfare. I will tell you though that my Jewish American friend with dual citizenship joined the military there, and has been in several situations where he was assaulted and had to &quot;aim below the waist&quot;. There is a general policy that, unless you are going to be killed, you do not shoot to kill. Even when the twenty point cement block slammed into his back after being dropped from a building onto him, or after the Molotov missed him by feet.</p>

<p>Idk. Lost my train of thought, just kinda rambling now. I just think its ridiculous to simplify the issue as &quot;Israel bad, Palestine good&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take it you didn&#39;t spend any time in Palestine, nor did you get to know many Palestinians. If you spent as much time in Hebron or at the checkpoints as you did in Atlanta, it&#39;s unlikely you&#39;d be saying the same thing about racism in Israel. At least most Israelis are willing to admit that they have a reason to be racist, unlike apologist American Zionists who will find any reason to ignore and excuse it.  </p>

<p>And &quot;yea, there is collateral damage: such is the nature of urban warfare&quot; is a weak justification for the murder of civilians. It&#39;s highly doubtful that Deir Yassin, Kafr Qasim, Khan Younis, the carpet-bombing campaigns in South Beirut, or the targeted white phosphorous bombings of the UN school, police stations, and utility infrastructure in Gaza can all be chalked up to &quot;collateral damage.&quot; As an American, you should know better than to quote the same propaganda line that justified the deaths of 100,000+ civilians in Iraq. Simply because some soldiers are ordered not to start a Third Intifada by shooting random civilians without good reason, does not mean that every civilian death that Israel caused can be excused as a harmless mistake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And which ones don&#39;t apply? Every single one of these applies to Palestinian citizens of Israel. Only one of the sources cites rabbis - the &quot;Jordan is Palestine&quot; ethnic cleansing euphemism.  </p>

<p>To elaborate, the &quot;transfer&quot; ethnic cleansing plan, while espoused <em>mainly</em> by hate-preaching rabbis with sizable right-wing contingencies, has also been regularly and seriously discussed by several prominent members of the Knesset and high-ranking cabinet ministers, which in the present government includes ex-Foreign Minister and Yisrael Beiteinu leader Avigdor Lieberman, deputy Defense Minister Danny Danon, and the entire Molodet party (which has adopted it as a platform and joined several coalition governments via the National Union party).</p>

<p>The &quot;transfer&quot; plan&#39;s present ideological leader, Aryeh Eldad, authored and secured 53 votes in the Knesset for a bill that declared in no unclear terms that the entire population of the West Bank should be ethnically cleansed from Palestine and moved to Jordan. While it was not a part of the bill, he hasn&#39;t ever minced words about the fact that he would like to see it applied to Palestinian citizens of Israel as well.  </p>

If you are staying in Jerusalem, I recommend walking from West Jerusalem to East Jerusalem and seeing the stark contrast. Maybe from Jaffa gate to Damascus gate.

Bring a map in your own language. If the religious things interest you, you should visit at least some of them. They&#39;re historically interesting if nothing else.

    <div class="md"><p>I went to Israel on birthright this summer. The closest we got to Gaza was some town that was 5 miles from the border. We could see Gaza from the bus. We couldn&#39;t see a wall. But the land was black. Israel is surprisingly green. It looks like West Texas. So the comparison is stark. I don&#39;t remember what the town was called. It started with an N. Everything was concrete. Apparently all the playgrounds are underground. Apparently they&#39;re rained with bombs on a regular basis. All the bus stops are bomb proof and there are shelters at regular intervals. This is on the Israeli side, btw.</p>

<p>I understand what the rationale is. They&#39;re afraid of insider attacks. The problem is the right wing government treating all Palestinians as potential terrorists. The other problem is that all these settlements are government sponsored. It&#39;s pretty much like manifest destiny and the homesteaders. The government will give hundreds of thousands of shekels to people willing to start homesteads in these areas. </p>

<p>My sister lives in Israel now. She says she has a few Palestinian classmates. I also saw lots of Arab Israelis. There are left wing Israelis, more than you&#39;d think, who believe what Netanyahu is doing is wrong. My sister doesn&#39;t seem to care either way. She&#39;s not politically literate outside of weed laws. So asking her opinion is not happening. </p>

<p>The care and support of Palestinians who aren&#39;t as privileged and can&#39;t get ID cards falls onto charity and nonprofit organizations like Save a Child&#39;s Heart and Hatzallah. I find it a little odd that a random taxi driver would tell a random foreigner his life story. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t believe you, but he sounds suspect. Hatzallah covers East Jerusalem. </p>

<p>I agree that the government isn&#39;t doing enough to support Palestinians and integrating them. The fact that they don&#39;t have Israeli citizenship is unacceptable. But I also find it hypocritical with the fact that America and Canada are doing something very similar with reservations. Britain also is guilty of doing the same thing with the Irish. There&#39;s also the fact that other Arab countries don&#39;t really care about Palestinians and just use them as an excuse to hate Jews. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really need to look into the history of Israel.  They already have defeated <strong>many</strong> invading armies (without nuclear weapons), and that was before they had their now very modern military and defensive fortifications (to say nothing of the nuclear arsenal they wouldn&#39;t hesitate for a moment to use if they felt their military was outmatched in a future invasion).  Saying they have no chance of survival is disregarding 60 years of history.</p>

<p>And to be clear, the previous invasions they successfully defended against were all intending to wipe Israel off the map and exterminate every Jewish inhabitant--if you want to talk about getting along with neighbors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of what you said. I went there this summer and stayed in East Jerusalem (The Palestinian side). It&#39;s completely dirty. Trash everywhere. People on the streets begging and trying to sell you touristy things. Then you go to West Jerusalem (the Jewish side) and it&#39;s like you&#39;re walking through a European town. It&#39;s a wonderful city with great food and great stores and what seem to be great people. We with my grandfather who is Palestinian but was fortunate enough to leave the country in &#39;48 or so. We tracked down the house that he used to live in and the man living there currently was very nice and let us in and showed us what the house looks like now. There were still a few olive trees that my grandfather remembered. The man was very nice and he even said something like, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be thanking me.&quot; The problem as I see it lies with a very vocal minority who don&#39;t want things to change. I didn&#39;t have an experience like yours when going to the West Bank, but I went across the border with a man who did tours for families in Israel which may have made it easier. We were questioned frequently by soldiers and asked to show our passports. They saw we were American, but the Arab name for my mother and Grandfather brought them to waiting rooms to be questioned. It was a great trip, but also exhausting and frustrating. I don&#39;t think Palestine is able to live off itself as an independent state from Israel. The one state solution has to work. I think it can, but there needs to be intervention. Apartheid really shouldn&#39;t be legal anywhere for anyone.  </p>

<p>It is very easy to understand why you would like a &quot;one state&quot; solution.  It would mean total victory for you.  No need to compromise or even tolerate.  Nothing can hide a simple fact--it would mean a Jewish minority under the control of a Palestinian majority.  No &quot;intervention&quot; will make it work.  Let&#39;s focus on what kind of compromise can work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Palestinian that had family get out before the wall, I feel it is the duty of our people to help the other countries realize that we need to take a look at the cruelty of the Palestinian people. I have been to the wall and was screamed at by many Army personnel that wanted to see my ID or passport... I have a dangerous amount of pride for my people and their origins and sincerely believe that we deserve a sort of say in a country that recently only belonged to the Palestinian people. </p>

<p>not even 80 years ago it used to be called Palestine and once WWII was over taken over by the Jewish people left over from Germany using weapons procured from England in order to  give them their own land. although it would have been nice to split Palestine among the Jewish and Palestinian people (christian, muslim, and Jewish!!). we would have waged a mini war instead.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to get to off topic, but I stand for the palestinians as they did own the land before and were literally told to &quot;fuck off&quot;. I am not saying the Israel we know today would be doing as good as Palestine if they didn&#39;t &quot;Invade&quot;, i am saying that Israel is not a country that should be supported. </p>

<p>All of the neighboring countries hate it for reasons similar to the Palestinian conflict. I don&#39;t like Israel for this reason and none of my Israeli friends like Israel as much now that they know the truth. </p>

<p>fun fact about teachers, my History teacher talked about Palestine for Literally 5 minutes. Not even mentioning why they, All of a sudden, were wiped off the map. I think teachers would be the first step into finding out if Israel is a country that should be supported by the US military. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was well written and I would like to respond without being downvoted to oblivion. (Hope springs eternal) 
When Israel was established in 1948 they were immediately attacked on three sides by their neighbors. All of the worst terrorist groups hate them with a passion. Iran wants to exterminate every Israeli. If you lived in Ohio, and Indiana, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania kept attacking you with mortars, rockets, and suicide bombers, then you would build a wall too. If at any time a Kentuckian could (and does) walk up to your checkpoint and blow you and your buddies up, you might treat them a little differently. If you were surrounded by countries that hate you and dedicate their whole beings to seeing you eradicated, maybe you would have a different point of view. it&#39;s easy to say &quot;oh that&#39;s awful&quot;, but let’s see both sides before we talk about how bad the situation is.
I was in the military and went to Israel 3 times. They were incredible nice to me personally and all of my buddies as well. Elsewhere in the Middle East, the people treat you like crap. </p>

<p>TLDR: It&#39;s easy to say oh the poor people, but look at both sides of the issue before judging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>and why were they attacked?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The war begins</p>

<p>“In December 1947, the British announced that they would withdraw from Palestine by May 15, 1948. Palestinians in Jerusalem and Jaffa called a general strike against the partition. Fighting broke out in Jerusalem’s streets almost immediately...Violent incidents mushroomed into all-out war...During that fateful April of 1948, eight out of thirteen major Zionist military attacks on Palestinians occurred in the territory granted to the Arab state.” “Our Roots Are Still Alive” by the People Press Palestine Book Project.</p>

<p>Zionists’ disrespect of partition boundaries</p>

<p>“Before the end of the mandate and, therefore before any possible intervention by Arab states, the Jews, taking advantage of their superior military preparation and organization, had occupied...most of the Arab cities in Palestine before May 15, 1948. Tiberias was occupied on April 19, 1948, Haifa on April 22, Jaffa on April 28, the Arab quarters in the New City of Jerusalem on April 30, Beisan on May 8, Safad on May 10 and Acre on May 14, 1948...In contrast, the Palestine Arabs did not seize any of the territories reserved for the Jewish state under the partition resolution.” British author, Henry Cattan, “Palestine, The Arabs and Israel.”</p>

<p>Culpability for escalation of the fighting</p>

<p><strong>“Menahem Begin, the Leader of the Irgun, tells how ‘in Jerusalem, as elsewhere, we were the first to pass from the defensive to the offensive</strong>...Arabs began to flee in terror...Hagana was carrying out successful attacks on other fronts, while all the Jewish forces proceeded to advance through Haifa like a knife through butter’...The Israelis now allege that the Palestine war began with the entry of the Arab armies into Palestine after 15 May 1948. But that was the second phase of the war; <strong>they overlook the massacres, expulsions and dispossessions which took place prior to that date and which necessitated Arab states’ intervention.”</strong> Sami Hadawi, “Bitter Harvest.”</p>

<p>The Deir Yassin Massacre of Palestinians by Jewish soldiers</p>

<p>“For the entire day of April 9, 1948, Irgun and LEHI soldiers carried out the slaughter in a cold and premeditated fashion...The attackers ‘lined men, women and children up against the walls and shot them,’...The ruthlessness of the attack on Deir Yassin shocked Jewish and world opinion alike, drove fear and panic into the Arab population, and led to the flight of unarmed civilians from their homes all over the country.” Israeli author, Simha Flapan, “The Birth of Israel.”</p>

<p>Was Deir Yassin the only act of its kind?</p>

<p>“By 1948, the Jew was not only able to ‘defend himself’ but to commit massive atrocities as well. Indeed, according to the former director of the Israeli army archives, ‘in almost every village occupied by us during the War of Independence, acts were committed which are defined as war crimes, such as murders, massacres, and rapes’...Uri Milstein, the authoritative Israeli military historian of the 1948 war, goes one step further, maintaining that ‘every skirmish ended in a massacre of Arabs.’” Norman Finkelstein, “Image and Reality of the Israel-Palestine Conflict.”</p>

I would like to point out that the wall being discussed is built for Palestinians, not for the other countries, though the wall did stop attacks from the Palestinians there.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not like this is surprising. Both are in unique situations. Israel had had enough because the countries surrounding Israel are aggressive. So they developed the mentality of stay string or die. Lebanon does the same thing to Jews. Iran once stated that Israel should be wiped off the map. If both sides cooperated, maybe peace is possible.  The non Jewish world has been screwing over the Jewish world for centuries. Of they loosened up their borders don&#39;t you think someone might take advantage and plant a bomb, after all Hamas and Hezbollah are right next to Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to Israel on a study abroad trip that focused on counter-terrorism from the Israeli perspective. The entire 3 weeks my groups was there we were ferried around by the IDF and their private security contractors who never allowed us out of their sight. Being an American and being bombarded by propaganda about how wonderful a state Israel was I was of course excited to be in this nation with our closest allies. With the exception of our tour guide and bus driver I have never felt as un-welcomed and despised simply for being an American. I was refused service multiple times in restaurants and was constantly ripped off at shops. When we were with the IDF they stressed over and over how dangerous the Palestinians were and how the West Bank along with the entire state of Israel has belonged to the Jewish people for over 4,000 years since the time of the Exodus from Egypt. At the security center at Bethlehem we were shown security footage of riots on the Palestinian side as they threw rocks at the security fence. In response the Israelis deployed tear gas and armored vehicles equipped with water canons that quickly and brutally dispersed the crowd. At the same time IDF ground forces were firing rubber bullets into the crowd. One Palestinian man who was on a 3 story building was struck with a rubber bullet and fell to his death. While watching all of these videos from the command center the IDF troopers were heartily laughing at the events. I was shocked and saddened that so many of our tax dollars were being spent to perpetrate human rights violation on a scale unheard of in decades. Especially in a country that claims to be a valiant democracy in the midst of a crisis with its neighbors. My only advice to the Israelis would be to remember the golden rule.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was almost precisely my experience when visiting Israel but throw in being called a &quot;dirty fucking Arab&quot; in Hebrew and being spit on. I saw much of what you did but coud never write it down as eloquently and as chillingly as you just did. I was lucky enough to be staying with a rabbi who was an ardent anti-Zionist though and he showed me everything and even took me to an anti-Zionism rally. Some of the Israelis hate what their government has done and indeed realize the irony of their country behaving <em>worse</em> than the Nazis did at the start of WWII.</p>

<p>Your story moved me to the core. Thank you for sharing the truth with us. May peace be with you friend.</p>

When you say that colonialism isn&#39;t just something that used to happen, are you saying that Jerusalem or Israel acts as a colony of the U.S.? That&#39;s what it sounds like, but I&#39;m unsure. Sorry for being ignorant on the issue and Thanks for helping me understand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, what&#39;s being said is that Israel acts like a colonial power (imagine what Canada, the U.S and Australia did to their native people) and colonized an area of the world that does not belong to them, hurting the indigenous people while doing so. What is happening to the Palestinians is essentially a silent genocide orchestrated by right-wing assholes in Israel who draw cartoon bombs to convey messages. Also what is happening is absolutely and undeniably  comparable to the apartheid committed against blacks in South Africa. Hell, the ghettoization of the Palestinians is actually pretty fucking similar to what the Nazi&#39;s did to Jews during WW2.</p>

<p>There is fault on both sides of the Middle East equation, but if Americans had a better understanding of what it is to live life under occupation then and only then we will we be able to understand what is the genesis of Islamic terrorism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really glad you got to have this experience.  I never really looked closer into the conflict until I joined Reddit and started hearing the experiences and looking at the numbers.  When you start to dig deeper, you realize that yes, this is a completely asshole move by the United States to continue.  It is, however, a strategic necessity both financially and militarily... for now.  That a compromise is not even a consideration shows exactly how much moral action means to the U.S.</p>

<p>When I met my current girlfriend a few months ago, she was astonished that I was aware of this stuff (her dad is Palestinian).  Needless to say, she let me closer a lot sooner than she normally would (a lot of arab girls are pretty conservative)</p>

<p>She&#39;s told me some very frustrating stuff that is similar to what you talked about.  She was a graduate student and had to lie about why she was coming there because they don&#39;t want people exposing what&#39;s going on or trying to make improvements that might destabilize what they have.  All she was trying to do was design improved infrastructure for the Palestinian people.</p>

<p>Funny enough, the only serious relationship I&#39;ve had is with a Jewish girl. And no, I didn&#39;t get any insights into the grand Jewish conspiracy, just a petite girl who loved to fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a similar experience back in 2005. I had family living in a really nice part of Jerusalem. But they worked as engineers for an American company with the Palestinian Authority to help get better resources to people outside of the wall. We went to Bethlehem and other cities outside the wall and they just looked like war zones. They&#39;re treated like criminals just for existing in the place their families have been for centuries. </p>

<p>The check points aren&#39;t so bad if you&#39;re white, but still pretty scary. Everyone has to serve in the army so it&#39;s a bunch of pissed off 18year olds with AR15s who are sceptic of everything you say. We weren&#39;t supposed to tell people who my family members worked for. We almost got held at the airport because my dad has a German name that is also a name in Arabic. This was just days before shit hit the fan in Gaza. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll do the best I can to explain this. </p>

<p>Israel is essentially the baby America in the Middle East. It was set up after WWII to be a country of the Jews to help atone for the Holocaust. That sounds all hunky-dorie until you realize that the area they carved Israel out of was all part of Palestine. There were people who had been living there for generations upon generations and suddenly they were just being told to move out. This created a pretty strong animosity between the Israel and the rest of the Middle East and so America decided that it was a great idea to supply them with the most modern, top-of-the-line military technology of the time, and a whole lot of it.</p>

<p>Now Israel didn&#39;t just use these weapons as defense, they militarized and immediately began to flex their power. They took the Suez Canal from Egypt almost immediately and only gave it back after America told them that they had to. They also began to carve out pieces of Palestine and claiming them as Israel, forcing even more people to become displaced as the land they lived on for generations was taken from them. </p>

<p>TL;DR: The creation of Israel displaced buttloads of people. America giving shit-tons of weapons and continued aid to Israel gave them the ability to go out and force more people off their land to claim more developments for Israel. Fighting a war against Israel as well as dealing with buttloads of displaced people has driven Palestine to poverty while America continues to bolster the Coffers and Armouries of Israel.</p>

<p>First off there has never been a state called Palestine. The land that the West Bank, Israel, and Gaza sit on has been held and ruled by countless countries, empires, and each of the three major religions. The term Palestine comes from the Ancesteral Greek Philistines that  emigrated inhabited the land. On this land the first monotheistic religion in history grew with its original inhaditanrts (those of which were returning from slavary in Egypt), Judaism, and came to be ruled by successive Jewish kingdoms. The Roman Empire eventually cam through and conquored the land and built up the religious city of Jerusalem (and built the Temple mount) to placate the conquored Jewish population as a goodwill gesture. Once the city of Jerusalem was established as a/the major center for religion after the advent and spread of Christianity (due to the holy sites created in Jerusalem because Jerusalem was a major city in the region therefore a great place for Rome to show its power, therefor being the perfect place to publicly crucify Jesus), and Islam deciding, due to many overlapping and very similar teachings as both Christianity and Judaism, that Jerusalem was important to them too, the area became a hotbed of fighting and one country/ruler/empire after another taking over. During these different &quot;regimes&quot;, for lack of a better word, the Jewish population was expelled, allowed back, expelled and over and over, each time haveing fewer and fwer come back due to them creating new lives for themselves in other countries (being the reason that there were so few Jews in the area during modern recorded history). </p>

<p>Fast forward to the 20th century, and the region has changed hands a million times, most &quot;recently&quot; (being the last few rulers) being the Byzantine Empire, that became the Ottoman Empire, and then transfered to become part of the British Empire after WW1. During the rule of the Ottoman Empire, the area had become muslim due to the Ottomans being muslim.</p>

<p>As we all know, WW2 and the Holocaust happened, murdering 6 million of the decendents of the historically displaced Jews from the middle east. This was the largest and most catestrophic of the many pogroms the European Jewish population have endured over the centuries. At this point nationalism (the gathering of similar backgrounds and ethnicities to create a state) was maturing all across Europe in every form (taken to en extreme by the Nazis), not excluding the Jews. So after the Holocaust the Zionist Jewish Nationalist movement wanted to take action and return to their ancesteral homeland of Israel, then know as the <em>Mandate</em> of Palestine (for adoption of the Palistinian label by the muslim arab inhabitants), which was still under British rule and was chopped into a smaller easier to manage entity with arbitrary lines (like Iraq and Syria, and Lebanon became under French and British rule). </p>

<p>With the resulting creation of the UN after WW2, it was generally agreed that the Jewish people needed and deserved a state. Due to the influx of fleeing Jews from Europe and thier agreed upin acesteral connection to the land, Israel was voted upon and agreed with a large majority to be givin space in the <em>Mandate</em> of Palestine alongside the arab inhabitants. The only ones that diagreed were the arabs (but you would think with all the issues they bring to the UN against Israel, making it seem like they find the UN a legitimate entity, they would take majority decisions as international law). So the arbitrary arab countries around the agreed upon land said that they would push the Jews into the sea and told the arab inhabitants of the area to flee/get out of the way to make the job easier. Now, I am not saying that the Israeli military was exempt from maing bad decisions, some that should be looked at as criminal, but to be completely honest, war is never humane or is totally run by level headed people and deplorable things are always comitted by both sides, so saying that bad things happened during the 1948 war is just a given. War displaces people, just like the 1948 war for Israel&#39;s independance saw the centuries old Jewish populations of arab countries be deported, most, if not many, of them ending up in Israel. It went both ways. </p>

<p>After independance, Israel has always had to defend itself from arab invasions, once time taking preemptive action to prevent another near catastrophe like the Yom Kippur war, so that was not a flexing of muscle, it was a war that ended with Israel creating buffer regions between them and thier enemies and holding land for future negotiations (which worked in one case at least!)</p>

<p>Now I do not agree with all of the settlement building in the West Bank, but put yourself in the shoes of Israel. If you saw that the disengagement of your country from an occupied territory (Gaza) resulted in the terrorism and daily threat of attack, you would be hestiant to leave the other larger territory unless there was an ironclad agreement that guaranteed your security too. Also, since many of the terrorist attacks came from these territories over long unprotected borders, you would put up a barrier to stop them from happening (which it pretty much did) too.</p>

<p>Again, the means to which the Israeli government tries to protect theur citizens may not be orthodox or seem friendly, and I am against many of the means they use, but in the grand scheme of things it is just the government trying to protect its people in a country built on land that was inhabited by said people&#39;s ancestors thousands of years ago. This is just another chapter in the brutal history of the region. </p>

<p>Finally, the violence is also attributed to the Palestinian and other Arab leadership incitiing and doing nothing to ease tensions on their side. I guarantee you that Israelis want peace more than the Palestinians do. </p>

<p>tl;dr Theres a lot of history of the region that no one cares to know or take into account when creating an opinion on the conflict. Its been going on for centries...this is nothig new!</p>

<p>Note: I apologize for all spelling errors!</p>

<p>I may have came off as though I didn&#39;t blame Palestine or any of the conflict and that I was demonizing Israel. That&#39;s not how I meant to come off. I understand that there is a very very long history all over the Middle East (probably longer than anywhere else in the world) and that is simply going to lead to a lot of conflict. Realistically though the Western World had no place cutting out portions of the Middle East and drawing borders where they saw fit just as they did in Africa. A very large portion of the problems in these areas come from neglectful border-drawing by Western Colonialists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.. That&#39;s insane.
first of all, there were jews living there before WWII, and of course those that survived came to join them. In 48 it was the Arab states who attacked and lost their land. until 67 the Palestinians were oppressed by Jordan, funny no one cares about that. Since they have their own government, their armed forces, they even sit at the UN.
To compare any of that to the nazis is simply illogical.</p>

<p>and that Christians should be embarrassed because Jesus wouldn&#39;t have stood for any of this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The craziest thing is that Palestine has a sizable Christian population. When Christians support Israel, they support the persecution and subjugation of fellow Christians at the hands of people of Jewish faith. I&#39;m not religious at all, but the fact that most Americans are Christian, and Americans overwhelmingly support Israel, is a complete mindfuck to me. They&#39;d rather let their fellow religious adherents get treated quite badly in the hopes that it will bring about the apocalypse so Jesus can come back.</p>

<p>Edit: and as silly as this may sound, Anthony Bourdain did a recent episode of Parts Unknown where he went to Israel <em>and</em> Palestine. He ended up spending more time in Palestine than Israel, and the whole episode revealed a very similar story to the one you shared here. It&#39;s seriously like a ghetto in Palestine, especially compared to the luxurious Israeli areas just on the other side of the wall. Also, apparently food in the West Bank has some of the most unique flavor combinations of any culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you explain that last paragraph to me? Israel was founded by and maintained a socialist government and the Knesset has one of the most diverse representations of any governmental body. And at this point isn&#39;t Israel pretty much its own autonomous nation that just happens to have US support? And don&#39;t you think security is necessary considering the relative volatility of the Middle East combined with the history of guerilla attacks being launched from the West Bank, Gaza and Syria?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit: Remove some stuff that was misunderstood on my part.</p>

<p>They are extremely paranoid about their land because the Jews have been systematically exorcised from location after location, a people without a country, for so long. Heck, they didn&#39;t even have a country to call their own until after the firggin Holocaust. They&#39;ve had a <strong>rough</strong> life. They just can&#39;t seem to catch a break. Now they finally have a place to call home and the Muslims are crying foul because the land that was theirs to begin with and was taken away has supposedly fallen under the &quot;finders keepers&quot; law and needs to be returned to &quot;the rightful owners&quot;. So Israel is in constant battle with a nation that is a perfect example of why vigilant democracy is far better than a de facto theocracy and they pay for their fanaticism with poverty and squalor. </p>

<p>Modern day Israel is the way it is because of the fanaticism and mistaken manifest destiny of their neighboring states and they in turn are subject to the product of their delusion. Jesus said: &quot;Be as gentle as doves but wise as serpents.&quot; </p>

<p>So no, Jesus would definitely say to keep your home safe in light of letting a fanatic blow it up.</p>

<p>Otherwise, great read!</p>

However, there are obviously two sides of a coin.  I&#39;m positive that we could get an Israeli to describe in detail how a grenade launched over a wall onto their kid sister or smuggled through the wall killed their mom.  There is obviously a reason that the wall exists.  The two sides don&#39;t treat each other like Canada and the US or even the US and Mexico (which is very similar in that one side is dirt poor and the other side rich).</p>

The fact of the matter is, both sides are right about certain things and both are wrong about certain things. This is a unique situation because in the past, refugees haven&#39;t stayed, they have left. However most of the surrounding Arab countries refused to absorb a significant amount, if any of the palistinians. Moving past that, the way israel has and is treating the palistinians leaves much to be desired. Since the wall has been put up, suicide bombings have almost stopped. They used to allow ambulances through without being searched, but some people filled one with bombs. Do I think that everyone should be punished for the actions of a few? No, but what else can you do?</p>

    <div class="md"><pre><code> One thing that&#39;s always cropped up in my mind is how often people disregard things. There are three sides to every story: their side, your side and the truth. People&#39;s opinions start based on personal experience. We can only generalize-innocently or not-from our point of view. It&#39;s naturally biased. We only learn other POVs by living through new experiences or by others. For this, I thank you for posting, and because of it I will post the following tagged under your comment so people following it can also read it:

I have a fair amount of empathy AND sympathy for Palestinians-especially those who are near my age. However, I think it&#39;s unfair that nobody ever points out the other side of the coin in that regard without ridiculous amounts of back-peddling, exaggerated or inexperienced opinions, or just outright paranoia (on both sides, and those on the outside). This is absolutely a heated subject; it always has been. However, what about the Israeli children that have grown up-albeit on the other side of that fence-from the Palestinian children? Much like the OP, I too have an experience in Israel...from being born and living there. I have read through many comments in this thread about the living conditions on both sides, and I have a serious bone to pick with the &#39;generalizations&#39; that were made from people who were simply visiting. (I have yet to stumble across a poster who has lived in Israel, or was a native, to comment about such a thing. If I have missed one, my apologies.)

I was born in an incredibly small town. I was born to an American mother and a Jewish father-who&#39;s parents were from North Africa. We have an Arabic based last name, but with European and Jewish ancestry. I am a dual citizen. I lived in Israel for a decade and go back every few years. Did you know that the streets are not paved in gold? In fact, when people ask me what it was like, I frankly tell them it could be a beautiful place if the streets didn&#39;t have so much garbage and if gutters didn&#39;t smell like piss and rot.  Did you know our first home-in which I was born and lived in my first year-was a bomb shelter? Did you know that I lived through a war before I was potty trained, or that I knew what a missile siren meant before I knew how to recite the alphabet? Did you know that our bathtub-in our second home, which was an &#39;upgrade&#39; to our first-was outside in the yard, or that my mom ran my bath water with the hose? How about the fact that in that upgraded &#39;home&#39; we had three people to a room in a one room house. That is, the house was literally four walls with a window, a door and a leaky roof. 

Our third house was owned by my grandparents. It had three rooms and an indoor bathtub. We had seven people living in it. Family.  The same family that worked their asses off-doing physical labor for nearly two decades-to save enough to start a family business in Israel. My dad had several employees that helped him in the business; he did his best to hire good men-family men-regardless if they were Palestinian, Jewish, Christian or other. They were judged based on their actions; we even spoke Arabic, Hebrew, French and English within the business-and the home-in order to be able to better communicate with workers who were eventually like one of the family. He even carpooled them back and forth to work. The respect flowed both ways. 

When I was five years old, a man my father had  hired attempted to behead  him. He was part of Hamas and luckily his plans didn&#39;t come into fruition. Why would a man we had treated like family want to kill my dad-and the rest of his family? Why me? My mom, my grandma? It was because we were Jewish business owners. Killing us was to be a message that we didn&#39;t belong there, in that land. 

I was a child, as the Palestinian children are. A lot of us-and I&#39;m speaking in the age of mid twenties here-have grown up in a war zone because of a war we didn&#39;t ask for, let alone start. As I stated before, the streets on the Israeli side aren&#39;t paved in gold. It&#39;s not uncommon to see dilapidated housing: crumbling concrete, rotting wood planks, old stone in mortar walls and bullet scarred neighborhoods under thin metal roofs and behind rusted fences.  A couple posters in this thread said that Israel was like walking through Europe. Europeans, I ask you: is everything-everywhere-as great as it seems? Ireland: is it all green and perfect like the postcards? France: is it all romantic like the movies? Romania, Hungary? Anybody? No?

How about Americans? I&#39;ve lived in America now for almost twenty years. I know for a fact that a slum can border the gates of a nice community. Does that mean that everything is good, or does it simply mean that a nice community was walled itself off from the shit pit? How about those of you in south Florida? I have lived in some downright holes in the ground with nasty flying roaches as neighbors in my walls. How can people be so blind to each other? It is SO incredibly easy to sit back and point the finger at a people in whole instead of holding the people at fault responsible. How about a whole country? Let me tell you: what most of the world thinks of Americans is not how a majority of us actually are. When I visited a friend in the UK this past year (right after the Newtown shooting) I felt like a side at the freak-show. The questions were so incredibly naive, but so irresistibly accusatory and broad; it felt like a blanket smothering me. I wasn&#39;t like that. I like owning my firearm. I&#39;m responsible. How can you say that I&#39;m like that individual when I&#39;ve never lifted a finger against another, let alone the barrel of my gun. Stupid, paranoid, gun-clutching, trigger-happy American that I am.

How can you say all Palestinians are terrorists? How can you say all Israeli&#39;s are oppressive? If you can say that, honestly, you need to look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself some hard questions. Saying all Israeli&#39;s, especially ones that were born there, are colonialists in training is like saying all immigrants born on American soil are going to take over and block us into a cage. It&#39;s okay to defend, but defend justly. A crooked defense is still crooked; sooner or later it&#39;ll throw you entirely off balance. Look where being out of balance leads people? Look at where it leads entire governments! As both a dual citizen I can honestly say that neither is more right than wrong. The road to hell was paved with good intentions; history shows us that is true for all nations, all races and all tongues. No human is except from mistakes, from rash judgment, from suffering. As much as we like to say that humans are the superior animal on this planet, we are-in fact-scared animals. Cornered, we lob explosives at each other. We sell, murder, covet, starve, beat and abuse each other. We fight over land that didn&#39;t originally belong to us. Nobody alive today-no culture-can accurately claim that any one territory belongs to them-and always has since time immemorial. 

We-as humans-behave in a hideous manner. We have the balls to start wars and not the common sense to understand that you can&#39;t have a &#39;war&#39; with &#39;rules&#39;.  War creates death, what&#39;s the point of making rules to spare lives? To RESPECT life? That&#39;s laughable. Sounds like we want to bake our cake and eat it too-while also not getting fat or having any of the supplies. In relation to my point: if you&#39;re going to be involved in this debate-which will probably rage on for many years with no progress at this rate-then please remember that open, respectful dialogue is how one acquires new points of view. Remember that there are three sides to every story, just as there are many people who belong to a nation who don&#39;t agree with everything their government does (ahem, every country in the world).

I am well aware that Israel has committed crimes against humanity, just as I am aware our neighbors to the south have as well. I have been the victim of hate crimes because of my race and nationality, witnessed offenses from both sides. I can&#39;t honestly believe that all Palestinians hate Israeli&#39;s. I have had to stand in long lines because of my last name, I get questioned, I get gruff treatment, disrespectful comments,  my bags tossed through every time I travel. I get grilled as to why I have two passports when I have dual citizenship. Going through security always feels like a really infuriating, cliché movie. Here in the states, I get shit for having a &#39;translated&#39; copy of my birth certificate. I&#39;ve been verbally challenged in workplaces/school/college for being from the middle east. I&#39;ve been accused of being a terrorist. A student in high school caused a mild bomb scare when he found out I was from Israel. He was convinced I was strapped to the gills with explosives.  I sat alone my freshman year because of the same paranoia that erected that wall. That rotten few-on both sides-is the ultimate kill joy. Neither side will win so long as they are in emotional bondage to each other. I wish our generation would stand up and say enough. We have a lot on our plate that is being passed down to us and-at some point-it will be our generation that is left in charge of the mess.

<p>As for a conspiracy that Israel is this great place... what posh. Maybe the bigger cities got all the funding while shit is falling apart elsewhere. A lot of the &#39;better half&#39; of Israel is to please the tourists. Tourism is big, therefore gets cleanliness, attractions, renovations and amenities. You see that everywhere with a booming tourism industry though. What you don&#39;t see-much like every other country-is the ugly side...or the whole truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but your driver was full of shit.</p>

<p>I used to be a medic for the Israeli government and served people living in Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Southwest including Gaza. We served EVERYONE, regardless of age, religion, or citizenship. There are some very shitty towns in the West Bank and Gaza but most people there blame the terrible Palestinian government that does nothing constructive with all the aid they get. When Israel evacuated from Gaza they left nice buildings, neighborhoods, and hospitals, all of which have since been destroyed or used for the militias by the Palestinian leadership.</p>

<p>Back to the story at hand here, I find it hard to believe. Not that 161719 was necessarily lying but foreigners are pretty easy to spot and westerners are a sympathetic target. He was likely looking for this poster to give a good tip and/or spread his story. Working in an ambulance we transferred many Palestinians without a border permit to Israeli hospitals. Yes there was a process but it was not impossible. Even after the Gaza disengagement we would go into the aid holding area on the Gaza border and collect residents of Gaza who needed to go to the hospital in Ashkelon or Tel Aviv and drive them and a family member the rest of the way because the disengagement terms meant they couldn&#39;t drive themselves past the border.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guess what? It&#39;s a military country. Guess why they have adopted so many policies about searches and security? Don&#39;t you sort of see at all why they do these things? If you lived in America and Canada was constantly attacking with rockets and bombs that target your <em>children</em>, would you not want your country to protect you?</p>

<p>The PURPOSE of government is to protect the people. I think Israel does a damn fine job given their circumstances. Don&#39;t even try to argue about who the land belongs to, it&#39;s changed hands dozens of times. Now it&#39;s Israel&#39;s and they aren&#39;t going to be letting Arabs be treated equally until the surrounding Arab nations are on par with Israel as far as being humane. </p>

<p>&quot;If palestine were to lay down their weapons tomorrow, there would be no war. If Israel were to lay down it&#39;s weapons tomorrow, there would be no Israel&quot; </p>

<p>The world hates Jews and it&#39;s despicable. A country a fraction of the size of it&#39;s surrounding nations is constantly ridiculed. Not ONCE has Israel been on the UN Security Council, yet Russia, China, Egypt, have all had a turn. </p>

<p>Palestine is crumbling because of their religious hatred and that&#39;s it. If they played nice with Israel they would be safe within Israel and treated equally. When every surrounding country hates you it&#39;s not hard to envision a police state. Don&#39;t expect it to change anytime soon </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make some good points but I somewhat disagree with a bit. Israel does have some fantastic security. My brother and another man in our group both had skin and hair dark enough to pass as arabs, and they got searched for much longer than the rest of us did, even at gunpoint once. It is very effective security. I do disagree though that if Palestine were to lay down their weapons tomorrow, there would be no war. From what I understand, they want the Palestinians gone because Israel is their God-given land. And I absolutely do not believe that disarming Palestine would eliminate all the maltreatment. I believe that Israelis would still try to force them off their land. </p>

<p>Also, this is going to sound very harsh, but please bear with me. I think there is a reason that the untra-orthodox Jews in Israel are disliked. I know I personally harbor some feelings against them because of how they treated me as a female. Nothing really bad happened, mind you. But I recall one instance in which my mother and I got in an elevator with three orthodox jewish men (you can tell by the clothing they wear, mind you.) We stepped in, they looked at us and then stepped away from us and made slight faces. It confused us, so we asked out guide what we might have done to offend them. Apparently, some just dislike women as women are seen as temptresses. Mind you, we wore skirts and long shorts or pants and shirts that covered the chest and shoulders at all times. We always wore that if not more, so we weren&#39;t dressed promiscuously. But I feel like that illustrates that they still hold on to unpopular traditional values, some that might even offend visitors.  </p>

<p>Of course, that is a very small portion of the population. In the same elevator, I got on with my brother who got searched thoroughly. I had gotten some sun too, and passed as a local a couple of times. Another man got on with us and tried speaking to us in his language, and we had to explain that we were tourists. We all had a bit of a giggle at it. He seemed totally fine, though, see? But there are so many different people in Israel, I suspect that at some point you&#39;ll inevitably come across someone who offends you in some way. Keep that in mind, then, for me. First, that you are right and that Israel has some great security, but the debate is whether or not it is worth the mistreatment of the Palestinians. Second, that there are always things that you and I will have not experienced, things that we aren&#39;t able to speak of because we have not experienced them. So consider that while weighing in on your own opinion and on mine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You bring up that the state of Israel is militaristic as though it justifies Israel&#39;s apartheid policy towards Arabs.  I understand that Israel is a country where every citizen is born into war, but I still think that all people have rights, and it is a governments duty to protect those rights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The PURPOSE of government is to protect the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will have to disagree with that.  The purpose of a government, in my opinion, is the protection of individual rights through laws which clarify the proper use of force.  Not different sets of laws for different sets of people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they aren&#39;t going to be letting Arabs be treated equally until the surrounding Arab nations are on par with Israel as far as being humane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my opinion, this is wrong.  To persecute another race because of the actions of another state is despicable.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m just strongly opposed to apartheid police states and I don&#39;t fully understand Israel, but I do not see Israel as an example of democracy and I don&#39;t support their policies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have walked all the same places.  I think your &quot;novel&quot; is a bit of propaganda pushing a very racist agenda.  When I walked the places you talk about I kept thinking about the difference culture makes.  Israel is a wonderful place to live because they focus on producing goods and services that other people want.  The Islamic zones, are, for the most part, hellholes because they focus on killing others, and indulge the politics of envy.  </p>

<p>The Islamic countries are not poor because Israel is rich.  Israel is rich because they worked their arse off turning a malaria ridden swamp (with no resources) into a paradise, by the sweat of their brow.  The Islamic countries have sat for the last hundred years on the oil treasure trove of the world, and have slid farther and farther into poverty because of their own darn ignorance.</p>

<p>As long as Islamic nations continue to lock women in the back room, forbidding them to learn to read and write, as long as they kill all the gays, and persecute their fellow citizens who promote innovation and development, they will remain in the poverty and tyranny they make for themselves.  As long as they choose to remain in the cosmology and ideology of the 12th century they will remain in the poverty of the 12th century, and blaming the Jews for it is at best a red herring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, Israel was an uninhabited malarial swamp after World War I, when the Jews began to arrive.  The total inhabitants numbered in the tens of thousands.  I am not suggesting that that the hard work of the Israelis gained them the land, but only that it turned this swamp into a wonderful place to live.</p>

<p>I spent most of my adult life working in and around both the Israelis and the Muslims.  I don&#39;t disagree at all that the Israeli state has a very dark side to it.  Doesn&#39;t every state?  I also agree that the Orthodox are not for equality, but they only pull down about 5% of the vote.  So they are not in charge.</p>

<p>In fact, Israel has Palestinian representatives in their Parliament.  Israel allows Palestinians to bring direct legal challenge in court against any government action.  If you go and look up the facts you will find that in a majority of cases the Israeli supreme court rules in favor of the Palestinians.  This last fact shows that injustice is being done to Palestinians, but it also shows a democratic response to the injustice.</p>

<p>Can any Islamist state claim the same towards it&#39;s Jewish inhabitants?  Why do we never talk about the native Christian population of Bethlehem that was driven into exile by murder and intimidation?  Why do we never talk of how the Christians of Iraq and Egypt are treated, nor talk of the hundreds of thousands of Jewish citizens that disappeared into thin air in Iran, Afghanistan, and the Islamic states that came out of Russia?  What happened to all those Jews?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For an objective account of the state of Palestine, go and read Mark Twain&#39;s description during his tour of the Holy Land.  His description was rendered immediately before the Jews began to return.  He had no bias, and politics had not yet put spin on any of the facts.  You might also look the census and the reports of the map making teams of the British Empire after they took over the administration of the region from the Turks.  You will find that my comments are bang on.  Palestine was an uninhabited wasteland, notorious for it&#39;s malaria and other diseases.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you address yourself to how the Supreme Court of Israel sides with the Palestinians again and again?  Can you cite any Islamic land that gives such rights and protection to it&#39;s Christian, Jewish, or Zoroastrian minorities?</p>

<p>Why is it only Israel that seems to illicit your ire, when virtually every Islamic country around it does so much worse on every single point you care to name?</p>

<li><p>Because that&#39;s what I expect from Islamic countries.</p></li>

<p>The results of these lawsuits is not extraordinary either.  You count up the number of suits brought, and then you count the number of times the court has ruled in favor of the Palestinians.  The Court rules in favor of the Palestinians 2 to 1 as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>They already have, however, Israel doesn&#39;t like who it is that is in power that have issued such a decree. That and Palestine insist, rightly so, that Israel remove all settlements, which are quite illegal, and go back to the &#39;68 borders.  Israel won&#39;t agree to this very reasonable request, so they refuse to give peace.  Because they want to continue to be able to steal land.</p>

<p>Again, neither I nor the OP proposed any actions.  </p>

<p>As far as hating Jews and wanting to exterminate them goes, that is neither racist nor anti-semitic, since Jews aren&#39;t a race, and aren&#39;t the only Semitic group in existence (Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews are largely not Semitic, actually).  The people who usually espouse such views are often Semitic themselves, and to a much larger extent than the Jews.  </p>

Ill try to find the link to the website I saw a few years ago.
Actually I won&#39;t. It&#39;s fucking disgusting. Armed and armored men killing unarmed people who have rocks to throw as weapons, at best. I was probably 14 when my dad was in his computer looking at the pictures. I remember sitting for a long time just scrolling through hundred if pictures of true genocide.. I sat still and silent for a long time. I got up, and walked to my bed. I felt sick and I cried, filled with feelings of anger and hatred. It changed me.
They killed two of my cousins and a great uncle. One woman because she was protecting her child and they shot her.. 
Another just wanted to go to the mosque to pray but they decided to kill him.
My great uncle went fishing to feed his family. They were starving, they decided to shoot and kill him because he was out too late.
The oppression, poverty, and war crimes are unimaginable. But the whole world lets them get away with it and turns a blind eye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ohhhhhhhhh give me a break. I am going to get downvoted to oblivion for this, but screw it.</p>

<p>The truth is that you, and everyone else replying kindly to your post is either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Arabic (there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with this, but ethnicity IS a factor when discussing matters like this)</li>
<li>An ultra-liberal hippy that takes most info from other ultra-liberal hippies</li>
</ol>

<p>The truth is that everything you described is either:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>True in EVERY single border between a rich country and a poor one. Have you ever seen the US-Mexico border? The same high walls, barbed wire, crazy screening process (4 hour lines!), etc etc, is present there too. The same beautiful roads and buildings on one end, crumbling and dilapidated infrastructure on the other. Believe me, I&#39;ve been there.</p></li>
<li><p>Untrue or exaggerated. I have been to Israel on many occasions and you make it sound like Palestinians are being treated like animals. Palestinians segregated, stopped, searched and their belongings dumped out? WHAT? This is the biggest bunch of nonsense I&#39;ve ever read.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now here&#39;s the TRUTH of the matter: Israel is living side-by-side with an extremely hostile and unpredictable neighbor. A neighbor that will shake your hand one minute, only to stab you in the back the next when you put your guard down. Do you know what that feels like? Here in the USA, we started two wars and killed countless innocents after we were attacked ONCE on 9/11. Can you imagine living next to a neighbor who constantly harasses you and kills your civilians? Do you think US citizens would be OK with that? To what ends of the earth do you think US citizens would demand that the US flexes its military might against the aggressors? What sort of tactics do you think the US would employ on the Mexican border if Mexico was a threat?</p>

<p>Having said all that, do I agree with all of Israel&#39;s politics? No, I don&#39;t. But then again, I don&#39;t agree 100% with any country&#39;s politics. There is no saint among countries. Israel is no different. They do a lot of things right, and they do a lot of things wrong.</p>

<p>So to sum up, yes, Israel DOES employ heavy security measures around its border regions so that they don&#39;t let through anyone that shouldn&#39;t be there. The difference between the US-Mexico border and the Israel-Palestine border is that most US border patrol personnel don&#39;t need to worry about a suicide bomb being strapped on to every Mexican that wants to &quot;have a better life&quot; in the US. And yet, despite that, the border looks surprisingly similar to the Israel-Palestine border. So take your self-righteous and naive dribble somewhere else, and try to understand how the real world works.</p>

<p>How many homes did the US bulldoze in Iraq and Afghanistan in their hunt for enemy combatants? How many did the Allies in WWII? Do you REALLY think Israel bulldozes homes for pleasure?

<p>How can you honestly talk about antagonizing a population when Palestinian militants actively work day-and-night to terrorize Israeli civilians? Do you think the Israeli military is actively trying to target civilians in the same manner?</p>

<p>As for driving their people in a corner, this is what happens when people support terrorists. If Palestinians were to reject Hamas and Hezbollah, and accept a peaceful existence with Israel, you&#39;d see how quickly Israel would provide aid and tear down the walls. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that when Israel was founded, the government offered citizenship to all Palestinians. The Palestinians refused, instead opting to terrorize and fight until Israel was wiped off the face of the earth.</p>

The Jews brought infrastructure and the fact of the matter is those hospitals still treat the Arabs despite having no real obligation to do so. Palestinians get more international aid than almost anyone else, they&#39;re just too corrupt to handle it well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your story is fake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you go through it, you are asked many questions about who you are and where you come from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Going from Israel into the West Bank is easy and requires no check. It is going the other way that can take time, but usually not. So many reports say &quot;oh, hours of checkpoints&quot; but it simply isn&#39;t true. Thousands of Palestinians go into Israel everyday, if it took that long it wouldn&#39;t be logistically possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have to drive some distance out of Jerusalem to get to the wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you don&#39;t. One can walk from Jerusalem to Bethlehem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are little plaques ... in English and Hebrew and Russian and Italian.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean Hebrew, Arabic, and English.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bus stopped several times and the Palestinians were made to get off and be searched.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This did not happen. There aren&#39;t even individual, less multiple, stops of buses inside Israel for security checks of anyone. You are parroting hearsay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...they passed out snacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More nonsense. The bus driver gave you snacks?</p>

<p>You just made up a story and got tons of karma for it. This is a sure sign that you&#39;re only information about the Israel/Palestine conflict is from bias sources. Go there for real, and you will see how different it actually is from the impressions you got from a couple youtube videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are extremely paranoid about their land because the Jews have been systematically exorcised from location after location, a people without a country, for so long. Heck, they didn&#39;t even have a country to call their own until after the firggin Holocaust. They&#39;ve had a rough life. They just can&#39;t seem to catch a break. Now they finally have a place to call home and the Muslims are crying foul because the land that was theirs to begin with and was taken away has supposedly fallen under the &quot;finders keepers&quot; law and needs to be returned to &quot;the rightful owners&quot;. So Israel is in constant battle with a nation that is a perfect example of why vigilant democracy is far better than a de facto theocracy and they pay for their fanaticism with poverty and squalor.</p>

<p>Modern day Israel is the way it is because of the fanaticism and mistaken manifest destiny of their neighboring states and they in turn are subject to the product of their delusion. Jesus said: &quot;Be as gentle as doves but wise as serpents.&quot;</p>

<p>So no, Jesus would definitely say to keep your home safe in light of letting a fanatic blow it up.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s a reason your comment got deleted it&#39;s probably because it&#39;s a deliberate half truth instead of a whole one. I may be a personal account but it reads like universal fact without showing both sides of the story. </p>

<p>Oherwise, great read!</p>

<p>If we&#39;re comparing governments to the NAZIs we might want to call recent NSA activity &#39;Gestapo-esqe&#39;, we may draw similarities between NAZI indoctrination of children and religiously-informed bigotry in Saudi schools, we may say that Islamic gangs in Britain bear resemblance to the brown-shirts.</p>

<p>Godwin&#39;s law perhaps doesn&#39;t apply here, but there is a reason why it is often argued that when said law is invoked the thread should draw to a close. It is not really a valid form criticism or argument, it is an emotive hyperbole designed to pre-emptively quash any disagreement. </p>

<p>I find that Godwin&#39;s Law is invoked more regularly on the subject of Israel than any other, on both sides of the argument, and there can be no mistake that this is directly relating to the role the holocaust in the establishment of the country. </p>

<p>Frankly I find it repulsive and wholly insensitive to those that lived through the holocaust, and Jewish people who are affected by it. </p>

<p>Nazis would cut off most, if not, all of the Jewish people from their neighborhoods. the methods differ as Nazi&#39;s would do it in a way that would either force physically or financially to eradicate all jewish people from their society. If this Isn&#39;t similar to Israelis physically, forcing a Wall to be built under the illusion of protection. In other terms to segregate the Palestinian people from entering west Israel and cut them off from their society. </p>

<p>Ive been told that Palestinians were too radical, in the sense of danger, to control and this made it hard for Israel to Properly function as a society; that this is the reason for the Wall. Building a wall to fix a problem is like covering a gunshot wound with a bandaid. but if they were trying to separate the people so they can take the land for themselves it would make more sense. Building a wall to keep a snake from eating a rabbits would be a better analogy of what is happening in Palestine to this day.</p>

<p>as for your political stance on Israel... If it ain&#39;t a conspiracy I don&#39;t give a rats ass.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t matter who&#39;s ruling over you if the people of the region don&#39;t want to be ruled over. Israel could decide that those people are within Israel, but those people could decide they don&#39;t want to be Israeli. simple.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At those times you could even see cooperation between the two sides</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, actually, after the 1917 Balfour Dec laid bare the intentions of Jewish leadership (making a Jewish nation in Palestine), the Palestinians started getting uppity, having riots and shit. Then, the Jews formed terrorist groups to fight the British and Arabs.</p>

<p>Then, the largest employer in the region, the JNF, spearheaded the Hebrew labor movement, which discriminated against all non-Jews.</p>

<p>All this tension sort of undermines your last point</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The real conflict came when the brits left....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, maybe if the main Jewish representational body (Jewish Agency) hadn&#39;t sanctioned terrorist groups (Lehi, Irgun, Haganah) who carried out the terrorist attacks on the British, they wouldn&#39;t have withdrawn prematurely?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really not.  The weirdest part for me was that I loved Israel.  It was really nice!  I saw people on jetskis in Tel Aviv, I saw really nice things to eat.  It was beautiful.  The thing was that it was really really not the Middle East.  It was Europe.  That was so strange.  I mean I guess that happens in other places, but it just struck me as really really strange.  </p>

<p>I have to say though there is a difference between the Israeli people and the government.  No people should be held accountable for what their government does, but only for their own actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up in South Africa under apartheid, and when I went to Israel three years ago, it was like walking into a time machine. The same ubiquitous military presence, the same siege mentality, the same island of development surrounded by the enemies. </p>

<p>High tech in the universities; bright, hard-working students. Civil disobedience, a government desperate for positive publicity, conscientious objectors who had been to prison for refusing to serve in a military that was doing things that they couldn&#39;t reconcile themselves with. Complex moral judgements at every turn. Dirty tricks on both sides of a dirty war. Huge disparities of income.</p>

<p>When people say that Israel is an apartheid state, I know that that&#39;s the truth. When people defend Israel, I understand. People used to, and still do, defend apartheid. Israel is living in a bubble and they need to let the air out carefully before it bursts. South Africa isn&#39;t paradise, but if we hadn&#39;t turned back from the brink and re-crossed PW Botha&#39;s &quot;Rubicon&quot; it would have been hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I don&#39;t know much about Israel, but how is it that they&#39;re able to justify on the world stage how they treat the Palestians? Do they just claim that Palestine is full of terrorists and do what they do in the name of national security? It seems to me that they&#39;re simply using American money to bolster their military while completely dominating their neighbors with foreign-supplied technology. What good is the Israeli government?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flight 93 hijack occured at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Hijacking">9:28</a></p>

<p>Todd Beamer&#39;s call describes the hijack about to happen at <a href="http://intelfiles.egoplex.com/2001-09-11-FBI-FD302-lisa-jefferson.pdf">9:43</a></p>

<p>Flight 93 crashed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Crash">10:03</a></p>

<p>Todd Beamer&#39;s call made with an airfone last for <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_ME83nFczBk/UK9vUHoEglI/AAAAAAAAAKE/mcoNOAidgDg/s1600/airfone93.png">3925 seconds</a>. It last 45 minutes <strong>after</strong> the plane had already crashed.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The hijack could not have occured at two different times, either the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/12/us/12cnd-moussaoui.html?hp&amp;amp;ex=1144900800&amp;amp;en=f6fc83f83a632d06&amp;amp;ei=5094&amp;amp;partner=homepage">Flight 93 recording</a> is fake or Todd Beamer&#39;s call is fake.</p>

<p>The airfone could not have been working after the airplane crashed, either the crash itself is fake or the Todd Beamer&#39;s call is fake.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Since we have two absolute contradictions we can with upmost certainty conclude that 2 out of 4 events are faked.</p></li>
<li><p>Since we can conclude that 2 out of 4 of the official events are faked we can also conclude that the official story given is incorrect and flawed.</p></li>
<li><p>Since we can conclude that the official story is incorrect and flawed we can also conclude that the conspiracy theory is conceivable.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you reach a moment when a conspiracy theory answers the questions that the official story does not you find yourself as a conspiracy theorist. This was the moment when I turned into one and this is why it happened.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>EDIT: To address a very important question about this subject before anyone else continues repeating the same question.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;<em>The call sheet saying 3925 seconds is clearly label &quot;Duration Operator&quot; (...)</em>&quot;. <a href="/u/doeldougie">/u/doeldougie</a> points very well that the time of the call might have included the time that the operator was still on the phone, regardless of the connection. This is possible, however this is not the case for two reasons; if it was then the official story would have clearly explained it and also:</p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_ME83nFczBk/UK9vUHoEglI/AAAAAAAAAKE/mcoNOAidgDg/s1600/airfone93.png">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_ME83nFczBk/UK9vUHoEglI/AAAAAAAAAKE/mcoNOAidgDg/s1600/airfone93.png</a></p>

<p>According to the call log, the Todd call was not the only one that was still counting after the crash, there was another. Jeremy Glick&#39;s airfone call was also counting for <strong>7565 seconds</strong> (and no, that is not 1565), placing his call termination also after the plane had already crashed. The most important of this call is that the destination was not an operator but an external number. Now even if we assume that the call counter includes the operator&#39;s time on the phone, it most certainly cannot do the same for numbers that are not inside the system.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2: I keep being questioned about the same thing that I have explained in the note above so I hope that the following is even more clear than the previous one</strong></p>

<p>GTE Airfones communicate via RBS - Radio Base Stations. These RBS have a range and (in well covered areas) their range is usually mutual in its limits in order to avoid any disconnection.</p>

<p>Each call that is about to reach the limit of one RBS and entering another goes through the proccess of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handover#Purpose">Handoff</a> in which the call is transferred from one station to the other and thus keeping the connection alive.</p>

<p>These handoffs were <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_ME83nFczBk/UK9vUHoEglI/AAAAAAAAAKE/mcoNOAidgDg/s1600/airfone93.png">registered in the U93 call log</a>, 6 for Todd&#39;s call and 8 for Glick&#39;s. Even if Todd&#39;s call was still counting because the operator&#39;s phone was still in use or because the system didn&#39;t stop counting due to the plane crash, the number of handoffs clearly indicates that the call was still connected through 6 RBS when the max of all the other short calls was of 3 RBS handoffs.</p>

<p>Handoffs cannot exist if the phone that was connected is destroyed, let alone 6 and 8 handoffs. The most important question here is which RBS stations these 6 and 8 handoffs underwent because if you find the answer for that then you find the path that the airfone communication went through. In short, find the RBS stations and you&#39;ll find where the plane &quot;flew&quot; after it crashed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve created several false dichotomies.  I&#39;m not saying you are incorrect, but it&#39;s certainly not as cut and dry as you are claiming.</p>

<p>&quot;The hijack could not have occured at two different times, either the Flight 93 recording[5] is fake or Todd Beamer&#39;s call is fake.&quot;</p>

<p>At 9:28 the hijackers were at least kicking in the cockpit door.  However, the typed up eyewitness account is much less exact.  It&#39;s just someone typing up the answers that a random operator gave.  They even say right in the document that the time was approximate.  That includes the sentence about Todd saying the hijack was &#39;about to happen&#39;.  Without a more rigid data set, this is a false dichotomy.</p>

<p>The call sheet saying 3925 seconds is clearly label &quot;Duration Operator&quot;.  I&#39;m sure the operator was very attached to Todd by the time the plane crashed.  When the chaos began, she could have left the call connected, saying, &quot;Todd.  Todd.  Are you there?&quot;  for hours.  She may have even left her desk with the connection still active.  In call centers, your talk time keeps running until you end the call and categorize it.  Then you sit a few seconds until the computer sends your terminal your next call.  If you don&#39;t categorize it, then your talk times climb.  I know, because I always did this to increase my talk times in a call center.</p>

<p>Now let me be clear.  I&#39;m not saying that you aren&#39;t correct.  I am saying that you think you&#39;re being logical, and coming to a logical conclusion, but it&#39;s actually the opposite of that.</p>

<p>The hijack occured 20 minutes before Beamer started describing it as happening. 20 minutes is not close to &quot;approximate&quot; to the event and live testimony.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And when you (the client on the other end of the operator line) end the call, the call ends. When the airplane crashed nothing was left but the call was still connected to the operator. You cannot have a call connection working when one of the phones is destroyed.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not at all, the logic is actually simple: Once the airplane crashed the phone was destroyed. Once the phone was destroyed, the call ended. Once the call ended the call duration stops counting. In this case, the phone was destroyed and the call did not end and the duration didn&#39;t stop counting.</p>

<p>Approximate wasn&#39;t my word.  That was the word of the article you posted, and anyone will tell you that eyewitness or in the this case, ear witness, testimony is worthless because it&#39;s wrong so often.  Especially when it&#39;s a transcription of an interview that happened hours or maybe even days after the events.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not true at all.  You just have no idea how call centers work.  Its&#39; not like it&#39;s common knowledge, so I don&#39;t blame you, but call center phone systems don&#39;t work like two iphones connected together and when one gets dropped in the swimming pool the other phone automatically disconnects.  It even talks about how the operator still had the phone line open 20 minutes after Todd stopped talking... right in the document that YOU posted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not at all, the logic is actually simple: Once the airplane crashed the phone was destroyed. Once the phone was destroyed, the call ended. Once the call ended the call duration stops counting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not how call center computers work.  Feel free to ask anyone in the telemarketing industry, if you don&#39;t want to believe me.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how that testimony is worthless and wrong.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand how anyone would want a system that monitors how long an operator has the phone off the holder and not the duration of the call connections that are being addressed. I have worked in a telemarketing company during summer, all our operator calls were being registered for the time that our calls were connected and used as evaluation for efficiency.</p>

Sometimes a quiet caller would get disconnected from me without me knowing and a knew call would come in while I was in mid sentence telling them &quot;to try pulling their battery and put it back in.&quot;  Maybe it was just a difference in tech?

<p>The reason why the system tracks the connection duration and not the time the operator has the phone off the hook is because the system would count inside calls too (operator to operator) and off the hook phones that are not connected instead of just service calls. If the system was really like that then it would continue counting the connection on the operator end when he redirected the call and we know that once the call is redirected, the previous operator connection ends so that he can receive new ones.</p>

<p>It would be the same as networks tracking cellphones turned on duration as if it were call duration times.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t find any logic in using a system that counts phones off the hook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my call center reps on the phones are ranked/reviewed on many different statistics, one of which is AHT (Average Handle Time). This includes not only time one the call talking to the customer (ATT), but also includes hold time (ADHT) and after-call, which is time spent &quot;on the call&quot; after the customer disconnect (ACW). Chances are what you&#39;re viewing on this sheet is the handle time, not the talk time. Those are two very separate things.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not even a little bit true. The system stops counting when the rep/operator leaves the call, not when the customer leaves the call.</p>

<p>Not exactly, he never ended the call and there are a lot of systems involved in connecting an air phone to a land line and they aren&#39;t generally made to handle complete destruction of the plane. Sending the call hangup is a little difficult after the plane has been destroyed.</p>

<p>I agree with you, I just don&#39;t think blindly trusting that the system will work as intended when it&#39;s faced with almost instant destruction is the best way of going about proving this theory. I would look at whether or not it is possible the line would stay open at the operators end if no signal to hangup has been sent, and at what point it would disconnect if so. 10 seconds of zero transmission? I guess that could be muted, how about after 30 minutes or a time like that? </p>

<p>Did it disconnect after a (approximately rounded) time of something like 5,10,15,20,25,30 minutes had elapsed with no data? Could be the system falling back to a time-out period at that point</p>

<p>I have thought the same after discussing with <a href="/u/doeldougie">/u/doeldougie</a> except that if such was true, it would be true for any call that was still active at the time of the crash.</p>

<p>For example, &quot;<em>the airfone system stays connected for 45 minutes even if the airplane crashes and everything is obliterated</em>&quot;. You still have the Glick&#39;s call ending far longer than Todd&#39;s, proving this incorrect. You are also left with the lack of that explanation on the official story, reinforcing the fact that there is no such possibility for it to be true, that&#39;s why the official story never said it in the first place.</p>

<p>Yeah.  This doesn&#39;t make sense.  According to Jefferson, Beamer and Jefferson are on the phone for 7 minutes (such very precise amount of time for a witness to remember) before the hijackers storm the cockpit at 9:52 a.m.  Whereas the official story is that the hijackers stormed the cockpit at 9:28 to 9:31.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s conceivable that Beamer didn&#39;t know that the cockpit had been stormed by 9:45 because the one hijacker with a bomb evidently stayed in the cabin and the first class curtain was pulled at one point.  But Beamer does tell Jefferson they stormed the cockpit so he must have seen it happen.</p>

<p>Also, the hijackers were not able to communicate with the passengers from the cockpit as the messages were routed to air traffic control.  </p>

<p>But the plane lost altitude during the initial hijacking, and then the plane changed direction and ascended to 40,700 feet shortly after the hijacking.  <em>Beamer tells Jefferson about the plane changing direction, but puts the time after 9:52 whereas the official story has this around 9:35</em>.  </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This could easily be part of the Airfone system design. When you hit &quot;end&quot;  during a normal phone call your handset sends a signal to the &quot;service provider&quot; to end the call. That signal is relayed to the other caller&#39;s provider and handset to end the call thus ending the connection.   </p>

<p>I have seen before when i call internationally or through obscure phone systems that one user will end the call but i can stay &quot;on&quot; for several minutes after.   </p>

<p>In this case its possible that when the plane crashed the Airfone system on the plane was destroyed in such a fashion that it didnt get to send out a &quot;end call&quot; or even a &quot;disconnect&quot; signal to the airfone service providers. Thus leaving the system to think the call was still valid, having no reason to think the call had ended.   </p>

<p>Except that neither the company nor the official story has ever said it as explanation for the two calls that were still connected well after the plane had already crashed. To this day, 12 years after, they still didn&#39;t explain why the calls were still going.</p>

<p>The argument is in correlation with the official story evidence, once the story fails to work in the reality of the evidence that itself is built on then the story itself cannot be possible. It is not a choice, it is a relation.</p>

<p>The reasons behind it are of personal interpertation and open for anyone that desires to justify it (like you). However, no matter what you try to say, the official story is already flawed and incorrect.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No. The system is built to count call durations, not hangup counters. Once the call ends, the counting ends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have any more info about the call log showing the duration as 3925 seconds? If anything about the data is wrong I would suspect it to be that. The duration shown for all of the other calls on that image is 0, I don&#39;t see how that would be, even if voicemail picks up on the other end the counter should start, at least for a second.</p>

<p>Any more info would be appreciated, this is quite interesting. Maybe the full call log for that flight? I&#39;ll look myself but I assume you know of good sources already. Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT: actually, looking into it provides some interesting stuff. <a href="http://www.consensus911.org/point-pc-1/">this link</a> provides a LOT of sourced points which may point to the illegitimacy of Todd Beamer&#39;s phone call. Particularly interesting to me were these points:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>According to the FBI’s telephone report on UA 93, which was provided for the Moussaoui trial in 2006, four calls were attributed to Todd Beamer. The first lasted “0 seconds” (meaning it was not connected). The second, which also lasted “0 seconds,” reportedly occurred at exactly the same time as the first one (9:42:44). The third call also lasted “0 seconds” and was dialed to the Beamer’s home. The fourth call – which allegedly reached a GTE operator and lasted 3,925 seconds (about 65 minutes) – was placed at exactly the same time (9:48:48) as the third one.[20]Thus two sets of numbers were evidently connected in the identical second, and no official explanation was given as to how this could have occurred.</p></li>
<li><p>According to Jefferson, the phone of the man to whom she was speaking remained connected long after UA 93 crashed. Reporting that he had left the phone after saying “Let’s roll,” she wrote that the line “just went silent.” Although she held on for “probably 15 minutes” (the early evidence had indicated it was 13 minutes), she “never heard a crash.” She added: “I can’t explain it. We didn’t lose a connection because there’s a different sound that you use. It’s a squealing sound when you lose a connection. I never lost connection, but it just went silent.”[21]</p></li>
<li><p>On September 29, 2001, the FBI received detailed records from Verizon’s wireless subscriber office in Bedminster, NJ, that Todd Beamer’s cell phone made 19 outgoing calls after the alleged 10:03 AM crash time of Flight UA 93.[22]This fact, along with the sixth one, indicates either that the man self-identified as Todd Beamer was not on UA 93, or Tod Beamer’s cell phone was not on the flight, or this flight did not crash.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to summarize some of this evidence, b/c it&#39;s confusing:</p>

<p>According to Lisa Jefferson, AirPhone Operator, and the AirPhone records:</p>

<p>-A number of passengers make calls before Beamer.  Beamer also tries calling three times before he&#39;s connected.  Finally, at <strong>9:45 a.m. he is connected to Lisa Jefferson</strong> (because it took 77 seconds to establish a connection).  </p>

<p>-<em>The hijackers have yet to storm the cockpit</em> after 20 minutes of hijacking, but are getting ready to, and do so at <strong>9:52</strong>.  This conflicts with the official story which states the hijackers stormed the cockpit between <strong>9:28 and 9:31</strong>.  </p>

<p>-At 10:00 Beamer says &quot;Let&#39;s Roll&quot; then the plane &quot;took a dive&quot; (don&#39;t know if she heard this dive or is assuming it).  Then Lisa hears silence on the phone but not a disconnection, and after about 15-20 minutes (her FBI statement differs from her media interview), ends the call.  Plane crashes at 10:03.  So <strong>she hangs up at at 10:23</strong> at the latest.  </p>

<p>-<strong>So Lisa Jefferson is on the phone for 38 minutes according to her statements yet the phone records have her connected for over 65 minutes, ending the call at 10:50 a.m.</strong> </p>

<p>So we have a number of discrepancies between the official story and Air Phone records and testimony.  <em>Beamer and Jefferson describe the hijacking occurring 20 minutes later than it did and and the phone records indicate Beamer and Jefferson were on the phone for 27 minutes longer than she claimed.</em></p>

<p>One interesting possibility is that the the two were on the phone starting at about 9:20, before the hijacking occurred, and that she got off the phone around 10:25.   This is consistent with the phone records.  But of course why would they be on the phone before the hijacking?  And how does one explain that she says it only took 8 minutes (which is a pretty precise number) from the hijacking of the cockpit until the passengers decided to storm the cockpit?  </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>JEFFERSON received a phone call at approximately <strong>8:45 a.m.</strong>
Central time, September 11, 2001 from an individual aboard a

Cranberry, New Jersey, a passenger aboard United Airlines (UAL)

<p>Look at the airfone log, the second column legend. The timetables for the hijack and the call logs are in ET, not Central.</p>

<p>PS: The 8:45am is the time that the operator received the call in Central time and the call was made in ET, 9:45am. Hope this is clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a video of the aftermath i saw once, it&#39;s interesting as it shows some planes flying around and also the front of the pentagon I believe, the guy filming it is on the side of a highway. The most serious thing in it is that he talks about how the front of the pentagon collapsed some time after the &#39;crash&#39;. </p>

<p>Not a video of the crash though, but relevant and not very well known.</p>

<p>Have you seen the video of the taxi driver? He said at one point that there were guys unscrewing lamp posts from the highway near the pentagon (these would be the ones which were supposedly knocked down by the plane), he later ended up changing his story and denying he ever said it. It&#39;s amazing how much stuff has come out about this.</p>

<p>You know what else? It&#39;s amazing how many people have been got to, you get people like Assange and other intellectuals and people in the public eye who you expect to be on the ball with this stuff and yet all you get is silence. Gore Vidal wasn&#39;t silent about 9/11 or the Oklahoma bombings but he&#39;s an exception. Interestingly enough, in some wikileaks releases from a few years ago, there is all the pager messages from officials on 9/11, there&#39;s a lot of weird shit, people reporting car bombs, all sorts.</p>

<p>And then you get stuff like Barry Jennings who was in WTC7 before it was demolished, talking about stepping over bodies, explosions, people with skin blown off their arms. Firefighters who were saying there were explosions in the buildings, people nearby with video cameras with this stuff on film. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if you&#39;ve seen this thread about the contradictory records from <a href="http://letsrollforums.com/fog-fiction-and-flight-t28270.html">Flight 11</a>.</p>

<p>I also wonder what you make of the technical information contained in the comment quoted in the first post of that thread, and how it might contradict or support the technical information you discovered:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are calls that went through the &quot;Claircom box&quot; on AA77, the plane that hit the Pentagon. This is the box that handles seatback phones, but &lt;b&gt;calls did not originate from seatback handsets&lt;/b&gt;. It appears they came from something plugged into external port #4 of the Claircom box.</p>

<p>My hypothesis is someone put a picocell (cell phone base station) on the plane and plugged it into Claircom box in order to get a connection to ground stations. The implications are:</p>

<p>.. Someone other than hijackers was involved. The Claircom box was not accessible from the passenger compartment. The picocell must have been installed days beforehand.</p>

<p>.. Cell phone calls were legit. The calls seen here were operator assisted, but calls from United planes, which used a different seatback phone system, might have passed through normally so as to show the caller&#39;s cell phone&#39;s number on the recipient&#39;s CallerID.</p>

<p>I believe calls did not come from seatback phones because HandsetID shows ffff, computer code for -1, meaning unknown. I believe they came from port #4 because Originating # shows 9045550004. The 555 in the middle (NXX) indicates is not a working telephone number, but rather for &lt;i&gt;internal use&lt;/i&gt;. Area code (NPA) 904 is in Jacksonville FL. They had to put some three digit number to fill the space. Perhaps software was developed in JAX. The last four digits (NNNN) contain the useful information. I think 0004 means external port #4. </p>

<p>I wonder if you&#39;ve seen this thread about the contradictory records from Flight 11.</p>

<p>No I have not, thanks for the share.</p>

<p>I also wonder what you make of the technical information contained in the comment quoted in the first post of that thread, and how it might contradict or support the technical information you discovered</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not much, his following text from that quote reinforces the suspicion that the calls were not being made from inside the airplane and were in fact being staged. </p>

<p>Theres not much I could find in there that could support what I discovered, the Flight 11 call log lacks a lot of legends. But on the other hand, there is one thing that sounds impossible, unless I am mistaken.</p>

<p>Call <a href="http://htmlimg1.scribdassets.com/1bfw9rs1dse6sz3/images/19-1f570a8a28.jpg">#18</a> last for 274s.</p>

<p>There are two ground stations involved during that connection - <strong>Gnd Sta ID 30|Coriapolis, PA</strong> and <strong>Current Gnd Sta ID 98|Arlington VA</strong>.</p>

<p>If this log follows the same structure as the one from U93 then Gnd Sta ID = Ground station id when the call started; Current Gnd Sta ID = Ground station id when the call ended.</p>

<p>Problem is this is telling us that at the time of that call the airplane Flight 11 was not where the <a href="http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/7595/flight11radardatawh0.jpg">radar showed us</a> but instead far West around Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Please take in consideration that I do not know exactly the RBS ranges in 2001 but I remember reading somewhere that they were around 128miles in radius and this is what I am using for the above relation.</p>

<p>So, if I am correct, Flight 11 was not the airplane that crashed into WTC and was in fact in Pensylvania, or the other way around.</p>

<p>You write:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Problem is this [call #18] is telling us that at the time of that call the airplane Flight 11 (sic) was not where the radar showed us but instead far West around Pennsylvania.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just to be clear . . . the call starts at 9:20 Eastern time, right?  The Global research article claims the time determined by the RBS but this is a PA RBS so wouldn&#39;t the 7:20 start time really be 8:20 Eastern?  Also, apart from whether the flight could already be in Western PA, isn&#39;t there an even bigger problem that <strong>the call is handed off from Coriapolis, PA to Arlington, VA even though the call only lasts 4 minutes?</strong>  How could it fly that fast?</p>

<p><em>Also, if you look at the full records you see that #18 is actually from Flight 77.</em>  </p>

<p>Also, can you verify that if these Flight 11 calls were legitimate Airphone calls they would have separate and distinct phone numbers?  Flight 11 and 77 records show all calls from 904-555-0004.  Why? There doesn&#39;t appear to be a listed phone number for the United records as there is is for AA though, right?</p>

<p>You say:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>How do you account for the hand offs then?  Would these be faked if the calls were not originating from the planes?</p>

<p>I guess I don&#39;t understand the United RBS codes.  The United records don&#39;t appear to show each individual hand off like AA does so it&#39;s harder to track.  Is &quot;RBS id&quot; the originating station?  What is &quot;RBS id lcp&quot;?  I notice only a couple of &quot;RBS id lcp&quot; are different from the &quot;RBS id.&quot;  The ones that are different have &quot;RBS id lcp&quot; of 065 and 026.</p>

<p>What do these locations tell us about the location of Flight 93 during each call?   I assume these are Bellevue, OH and Columbus, OH, and Fort Wayne, IN, and Coroapolis, PA.  </p>

<p>Anyway, a lot of questions and don&#39;t feel a need to answer because it&#39;s confusing.  I may come back to edit because I spent a lot of time and still am very confused.</p>

<p>You are correct, nice catch! I was misguided by the continuous call numbering and thought those were all from the same flight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(...) the call is handed off from Coriapolis, PA to Arlington, VA even though the call only lasts 4 minutes? How could it fly that fast?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah, the RBS handoff doesn&#39;t tell you that, what most likely happened was that the call switched RBS during those 4 minutes, something that is suppose to happen. It could be 60 minutes or 30 seconds, would make no difference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you account for the hand offs then? Would these be faked if the calls were not originating from the planes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I explained in my first comment, because of the handoffs and the 2 long lasting calls that reach beyond the crash time, the airplane from where those calls came from was not the same that crashed. And since we have absolutely no evidence telling that the Penn crash site is from the U93 we can assume that U93 was still flying and the one that crashed was not U93, something that the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1pvksy/what_conspiracy_turned_you_into_a_conspiracy/cd6sa08">ASCAR data</a> reinforces.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>RBS ID = Radio Base Station ID when the call started.</p>

<p>RBS ID lcp = Radio Base Station ID last call path, shows the last station that the call was connected when it ended.</p>

<p>Basically you have the starting position of the call and the ending position, if the call goes through a different base station then a handoff occurs which will show in the handoff column, if the call was short and never left the same station then no handoff occurs and both RBS IDs will be the same. It can also happen that a call goes from one rbs to a different one and again to the first one, showing the same station on both IDs but the handoff column will display 2 (first to the second and the second to the first = 2 handoffs).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It tells us an average (not very precise) path that the plane was travelling, for those stations to be in there then the plane had to be within it&#39;s range. Also, Belleville is actually the RBS station on Detroit.</p>

<p>Without the legend I cannot guarantee but it looks like it is the base number for the AA airfones, both planes were AA. For the U93, that is correct, no numbers show up for their airfone, probably because their call log system catalogs all the calls per airplane, as you can read on the top left &quot;Aircraft ID&quot;.</p>

<p>But it switched between those two particular RBSs though, right?  At first I thought they were much farther apart but I see they are only about 265 miles apart so if each RBS has an ~ range of 125 miles it&#39;s possible they switched from one to the other, as the record indicates.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just trying to figure out how they faked it.  Did they have alternative planes up there that were really transmitting calls.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yup, that happens when the plane is reaching the range limit of one station and entering the range of another, then within that space the call is transferred to the next station.</p>

<p>I did a quick draft showing the flight 77 path and the 3 RBS that show on the call log.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/SGyUnlt.png">http://i.imgur.com/SGyUnlt.png</a></p>

<p>A = Dunbar - RBS ID 160</p>

<p>B = Coraopolis - RBS ID 30</p>

<p>C = Arlington - RBS ID 98</p>

<p>RBS Range in my image = ~128miles</p>

<p>As you can see, where the circles are touching is where the handoffs occur, following that example you can place the airplane in its flightpath by following the call logs. Hope that makes it more easier to understand.</p>

<p>Well, one thing we have to be sure is that the calls were made on that day at those hours because we have to take the evidence as priority and the rest comes later when necessary. For me, U93 never crashed, it was following the same path of the scapegoat plane that did crash. The other planes is something that I am not too confident to talk about, yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great graph.  Thanks for doing that.  Would be nice to put the other RBS stations from the other planes on the map as well.  My link to the documents above has info for all 4 flights.</p>

<p>Also, not that I disagree with your ultimate conclusions, but do Beamer&#39;s 6 hand offs really prove much?  Let&#39;s just forget about how the record shows him connected for 65 minutes which is longer than the 38 minutes the statements indicate.  Even at 38 minutes long, the call was much longer than most of the others, and could have easily been handed off a number of times at a point where there was concurrent coverage between RBS, like your map indicates.  Indeed, Flight 93 records for the other calls show a lot of calls connecting either at Columbus or Bellevue in a short amount of time, and switching back and forth.  So since we don&#39;t have a breakdown like we do with AA, it&#39;s hard to tell much from the total number of hand offs.</p>

<p>Jeez, what a rabbit hole.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll have to look more closely at what the (anonymous!) expert in the Global Research article is claiming is possible:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Th[is] essay also includes new information suggesting that the digital technology of the day could have routed the calls that appeared to emanate from Flight 77, from the ground up to the aircraft and back again. . . </p>

<p>[The documents have] been examined by a former Claircom system designer, who has written (letter of March 25 2011) that “the elements of the call record data listed in the fax are consistent with my recollection of Claircom call records and how Claircom listed that data in reports. . . .”</p>

<p>This person was kind enough to engage in a private email exchange but is still employed in the IT business and prefers to remain anonymous in a public discussion. . . .</p>

<p>Just as it has come to light in a recent study that over a dozen aircraft were unwittingly transmitting the hijack code (7500) on the morning of 9/11 [29], it has also come to light that in 2001, “it was theoretically possible to route an [AT&amp;T] call from one location, through a ground site, to an aircraft and then back down to another ground site. . . .” [30]</p>

<p>It would certainly explain why the billing records were not available.</p>

<p>Well look at your map!  There is a small portion covered by 3 different RBSs.  It&#39;s possible it could be switching back and forth between RBS when there is overlap.</p>

<p>Except that it didn&#39;t - and I hope you are not mixing Fligth 77 RBS areas with the U93 because they are quite different - study the calls after Todd&#39;s last and see how many RBS they go through. Since Todd&#39;s call was still going during the other last calls that were made we can assume that the RBSs of those calls are the same that Todd&#39;s went through so for now we have a few of the 6 RBS of his call:</p>

<p>Started at Detroit RBS</p>

<p>Transferred to Columbus RBS</p>

<p>Transferred to Pittsburgh RBS</p>

<p>Ended at Detroit RBS</p>

<p>So now we have 3 known RBS that Todd&#39;s call had to switch but that is not all, Marion and Sandra calls have 3 handoffs which can be:</p>

<p>Columbus - Pittsburgh : 1st handoff or Columbus - X</p>

<p>Pittsburgh - Columbus : 2nd handoff or X - Y</p>

<p>Columbus - Pittsburgh : 3rd handoff or Y - Pittsburgh </p>

<p>Knowing that after 9:43 the airplane was in a straight path and that the only RBS in its path were just Columbus and Pittsburgh, the handoffs could not have been more than one unless it was flying in circles.</p>

<p>Compare the location of the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Columbus,+OH,+USA&amp;amp;daddr=Pittsburgh,+PA+to:Detroit,+MI,+USA&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sll=40.212441,-79.870605&amp;amp;sspn=16.226692,13.820801&amp;amp;geocode=FVjCYQId9okN-ylx3pC5wYk4iDEztbHP-GYy5A%3BFTETaQIdElw7-ykDhQZIb_E0iDE0G6JaoRX5jQ%3BFSPthQIdhtIM-yl1HcsQAcokiDHSxLk1ToZ2Vw&amp;amp;oq=detroit&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;mra=mru&amp;amp;z=6">3 RBS</a> with the <a href="http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/307_flight93_timeline2050081722-9086.jpg">U93 flightpath</a> to have a better understanding.</p>

<p>Now we can compile Todd&#39;s known RBS during each handoff:</p>

<h1>1 - Detroit to Columbus</h1>

<h1>2 - Columbus to Pittsburgh - assuming he flew in a circle here</h1>

<h1>3 - Pittsburgh to Columbus - assuming he flew in a circle here</h1>

<h1>4 - Columbus to Pittsburgh - assuming he flew in a circle here</h1>

<h1>5 - Pittsburgh to Detroit</h1>

<p>And we are left with one handoff and RBS missing.</p>

<p>Handoffs occur when the signal strength is below a certain treshold and another is above it or at least with more strength than the previous one. When that happens the call is transferred to the one with the strongest signal and the call does not drop. No GPS, nothing fancy, just a simple signal strength priority switch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to belabor the point too much . . . because I am inclined to agree with your ultimate assessment and I like that you started these comments, but . . . I still think there could be multiple hand offs because the <em>official</em> flight path basically flew through areas where there was concurrent coverage between these 3 RMBs.  I mean atmospheric conditions could have effected the range.  They didn&#39;t have to fly in circles to toggle back and forth--especially if they were flying equidistant between RBS.  </p>

<p>Indeed, the first calls at 9:28 connect via the Fort Wayne, IN RMB, then at 9:31 a call connects to the Columbus RMB, just as the official flight path (which I think could be faked) has the plane crossing from PA to OH.  That&#39;s weird because you would think the Pittsburgh station would have the strongest signal at that point.  </p>

<p>Then you see people&#39;s calls connecting via the Detroit RMB for the next ten minutes.</p>

<p>And then you see an example of what I&#39;m talking about . . . when the plane enters no man&#39;s land: at 9:40:20 a call connects to Detroit, then at 9:40:34 a call connects to Columbus and then the next 12 calls or so alternate between these two RBS!  Beamer&#39;s call initiated at 9:43 seems to be the last one that originates via Detroit.</p>

<p>But you do have a point that the flight path after Beamer initiated his call at 9:43 seems to go straight into Pittsburgh&#39;s RBS.  </p>

<p>So your scenario above is not farfetched and doesn&#39;t need the plane flying in circles.  Except I think #5 is unlikely.  Since Shanksville is East of Pittsburgh it&#39;s feasible the RBS to the East of Pittsburgh took a hand off for #5, and who knows, maybe #6 is a hand off back to Pittsburgh.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I know that #5 is far fetched but it was meant to be as handoff counter, that&#39;s why I said there was still one missing.</p>

<p>Like I said before, if we had all the RBS we would have a better idea of the plane path during the calls compared to FDR path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have an explanation on this.  I saw a program on this guy that got accused of murder.  He said he was at someone&#39;s house during the murder and he made a call on his cell.  Investigators tried to verify he made a call from that house on his cell, and the records showed it happened an hour earlier than the murder, and not during the murder, so it didn&#39;t prove he could not have killed the guy an hour later.  Well, it turns out, that the cell tower he was connecting to was either in a different time zone or not on Daylight savings, or something like that.  Once they adjusted the logs from the tower, it turned out he WAS at someones house during the murder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit. I mean, I just read the wikepedia page on it and it almost blatantly states that there was a huge cover-up.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>One agent stated that the infiltration team fired first, then changed his story for the trial and stated the opposite.</p></li>
<li><p>During a phone call to the FBI one of the church leaders stated that the door of where the shots broke out showed clear evidence that the agents fired first, all bullet *holes were incoming. </p></li>
<li><p>That door, the right-hand door of a set of double-doors, mysteriously goes missing. Agents state that it was too damaged in the fire to be recovered, but the left-hand door was fine, albeit riddled with both incoming and outgoing bullet *holes. </p></li>
<li><p>Fire marshals say that it is extremely unlikely that a steel door would be that severely damaged in the fire, especially when the adjoining door was fine.</p></li>
<li><p>A state trooper Sgt. testified that he saw what could have been that door being loaded into a Uhaul van, never to be seen again.</p></li>
<li><p>The door remains missing, even though the entire site was under &quot;close supervision.&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This entire thing is bullshit. Seriously, what the fuck?</p>

<p>Edit: Formatting.</p>

<p>Edit: Just read some more, this time about the start of the fire.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Attorney General ordered that no pyrotechnics, e.g. CS grenades, were to be used.</p></li>
<li><p>FBI spokesmen swore under oath that none were used.</p></li>
<li><p>CS grenades were found in the rubble of the building.</p></li>
<li><p>Apparently there were tapes that proved that the fire was started by the church people, but when played in court only the FBI &quot;Audio Expert&quot; was able to hear such things on the tapes, as the voices were heavily muffled and there was a lot of ambient noise. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is so fucked up.</p>

<p>Edit: Bullet holes, not wholes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Montreal.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra#Canadian_experiments">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra#Canadian_experiments</a></p>

<p>From what I understand, the CIA deliberately chose Montreal because of its many hospitals and universities and proximity to Cambridge and New York, and to avoid being accused of experimenting on US residents. So they experimented on Canadians instead, primarily Quebecois. Duplessis, our premier at the time, is infamous for authorizing experiments on and brutal murders of babies of unwed mothers (as well as the unwed mothers themselves).</p>

<p>It is called The Duplessis Era, and the children who were victims and survivors of this era are called The Duplessis Orphans. There is a graveyard in the east end of Montreal that the government does not want exhumed. Last I checked (anyone, feel free to correct this info) the government is still refusing to exhume the bodies of hundreds of murdered infants dumped into a mass grave in the east end, which the remaining Duplessis Orphans are calling for in order to prove that the infants were experimented on and died as a result of those experiments, particularly lobotomies. I&#39;m guessing the government is waiting for the last Orphans to die off before exhuming the grave. The Orphans are pretty young though, so... I&#39;m not sure how long they can hold out without being obvious about avoiding the issue. The youngest survivors were actually born in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s rather than the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s as claimed, so... they have a good 50 yrs to go before we all die off.</p>

<p>It is called The Great Darkness. No one likes to talk about it. Even though many of the policies and attitudes born out of the Duplessis Era are alive and happening in hospitals (and foster homes) across Quebec to this day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Canadian Forces are the U.S.&#39;s clean-up and medical crew. The US goes in, murders a few thousand people, sets up policy and a permanent military unit of some variety, and then withdraws from the area. Canadian forces then go in, provide medical services to both sides of the &quot;war&quot;, sandbag a few floods, plant a few trees, rape a few locals, clean up the US&#39;s debris, set up a permanent &quot;peace keeping&quot; presence while looking like heroes, and then withdraw from the area.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to justify sticking to the program because not only does the CAD government make so much money doing it, but generally speaking they really do provide decent medical and auxiliary services to locals. For example, the US razes Haiti, and then Canada goes in and rebuilds Haiti. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s active collusion or simply a matter of the Canadian government taking advantage of the US gov&#39;ts genocidal policies to make money and look good. Judging by the way I was treated as a ward of the government growing up, I&#39;m going to guess it&#39;s both. The Canadian government may look good on the international stage, but they sure don&#39;t have a problem abusing children and murdering indigenous folks. So... I&#39;m not so sure Canadian government are the heros they like to make themselves out to be.</p>

There&#39;s really nothing exciting about this town until football season starts up and then everybody packs the streets, making it impossible to drive around. I mean now that I think about it, nobody in this town would even consider conspiracies of the such. Very few know about the Waco incident and the younger kids aren&#39;t interested in it so it&#39;s a slowly dying conspiracy. Yet I can&#39;t help but feel like there&#39;s more to the place. I see free masons around the place and there&#39;s buildings dedicated to free masonry but I highly doubt anything goes on in those buildings. Just a bunch of old rich guys who donate alot to Baylor and what not...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. I was in high school when Waco happened. I was pretty punk-rock and teenage-rebellious, so I was kind of rooting for the Davidians, even though I, in general, hated christians. But watching that on TV, seeing how these people who weren&#39;t really hurting anyone were literally burned alive...and then realizing over the next few years how much the government lied to us during that time...it shaped the way I see it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still kind of punk-rock, still a little socialist in regards to what I think a government SHOULD do for it&#39;s people...but I will never again trust the people in power now. Whenever i hear any official report on anything, I default to disbelief. My automatic reaction to anything the media says is considering it bullshit until my research proves it true or false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is absolute bullshit. Those types of drama were the initial accusations. The local authorities had already investigated the same claims and dismissed them as total bs. The local authorities who had been around the davidians knew these charges were bullshit and said so publicly. The evidence the federal government later brought up was obvious lies. David Koresh invited the feds onto his property.</p>

<p>There was actually a house full of fbi and atf staying across the street from the compound. Everyone knew who they were because their cover was college kids. They had no furniture in the house and they were obviously older than college kids. They befriended on agent that actually almost converted to their religious beliefs. He openly cried when speaking of how good of people the davidians were. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This, also Ruby Ridge. Bull shit charges against a guy who wanted to keep his family off the grid basically. They were pretty much conspiracy theorists themselves really. So eventually the government comes to take him away by force, end up killing his 14 year old son and later his wife shortly after they retrieved the body of their son from the woods while she was inside the house holding their 10 month old daughter. I was like 5 at the time and I remember it well for some reason. 
It has never really left me. Even if a person thinks they were crazy or were part of a cult, it was handled poorly, just like Waco. Hell, ATF agents tricked him to arrest him when they could have got him in town multiple times. They pretended to have broken down on the road in need of help. The guys and his wife stop to help them and get arrested. The 80s were a scary time for some people but the government was right there to make it worse.

There are many youtube videos about this that are high quality video production documentaries. There may be a conspiracy someone could come up with related to false flag b/c of anti-Clinton militia groups at the time but the coverup is more disturbing to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like this is a good place to just mention that one plausible example of a conspiracy should not turn people into conspiracy theorists.  I happen to believe there is credible evidence to believe that there was a cover up at Waco.  But that should not mean that I presume that every conspiracy theory is true unless proven false.  I can believe, for example, that we haven&#39;t been told the entire truth about 9/11 and still not believe that the US government planned or knew about 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Maybe even the only conspiracy involved with this is that they wanted to cover up how bad they fucked up. This turned me into a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;, because I no longer believed that our government was actually there to serve us.</p>

<p>I will define being a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; here as someone who doesn&#39;t believe what their government and MSM tell them. My theories are often very different now then what they try to sell. This doesn&#39;t actually mean I believe some other &quot;conspiracies&quot;. Most of them are bullshit, it just made me a more critical thinker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 2001, about a week before 9/11, I was home sick from work and watched the ATF shoot into the wrong house, then burn a house down with a man still inside, live on CNN. Someone&#39;s compiled a bunch of info about the incident <a href="http://www.greatdreams.com/atf_8-31-2001.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is commonplace now (almost like a playbook: Whoops, he didn&#39;t shoot at us, we shot our own guy, shhh, don&#39;t tell anyone! Whoops, we shot the dog! Whoops, shot into the wrong house! Whoops, we used the wrong flash-bangs, we TOTALLY meant to use the cold ones! Oh well, guess we&#39;ve got a fire now), but it wasn&#39;t then. I was fascinated by it, as none of the stories made any sense, and they specifically sprayed water on neighboring houses, while they burned down this house. </p>

<p>What kept me from forgetting this incident, though, was how quickly news stories were scrubbed from the Internet afterwards. I mean, this happened on live TV, in the middle of the day, stories were all over the Web. A week later, describing it to a friend, I went to look for an article to cite - I could find a single article, deleted - but not scrubbed from Google cache.</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t wholly understand the significance of the event, and I doubt I ever will -- but I feel like it was a turning point, and it definitely woke me up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Socrates was set-up and essentially forced into suicide by a conspiracy of his opponents who essentially got him labeled a godless heretic. They were angry about his social and political influence over a rather wealthy segment of young people, and that he was a big critic of Athenian democracy (and supported Sparta over Athens).</p>

<p>Pythagoras it is believed died in one of two ways (but as the result of the same action against him and his followers): Burned to death with his followers in their meeting place, or that he escaped the conflagration but later starved himself to death. Nobody knows 100% which of these is true. The conspiracy however, was instigated by two men, one of whom had been rejected as a student &amp; member of the Pythagorean Brotherhood.</p>

<p>You can learn more from the Wiki articles on both. We know some things from translations (from Greek into Latin, and then into Modern English), but if you really want to read up, you&#39;ll need to learn Greek and read the source texts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, as serious as I can be, I challenge you to come up with sources for confirmed, not suspected, historical conspiracies. Ones that historians agree took place. I mean no disrespect, but it seems a tall order seeing as history is written by the victor, and a successful conspiracy would, canonically, involve the general public not knowing and no loose ends. </p>

<p>You have the attempted overthrow of the U.S.  government in the late 1800&#39;s, but that failed. I&#39;m trying to think of any others.</p>

<p>With all possible honesty, I think it could be your time to shine to provide sources. I would greedily absorb them. I imagine you have mostly books to cite, and that&#39;s fine, but the majority of the historical conspiracies that I&#39;m aware of do not meet the definition of a true successful conspiracy.</p>

<p>I hope you respond.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire Revolutionary War my fellow Redditor, was based on the &#39;Founders&#39; and others gathering in bars, wayhouses, and other places - plotting out acts, and then carrying them through. It&#39;s all right there in the history books.</p>

<p>Lincoln&#39;s assassination is another classic.</p>

<p>Then there is the assassination of Julius Caesar, The Gunpowder Plot (involving Guy Fawkes), etc. There are many. Even Hitler&#39;s rise to power was based on him and his Nationalist Socialists conspiring to take the Chancellorship after many of them had earlier spent a few years in prison for a failed plot involving burning down a certain building in an attempt to seize power. Read Mien Kampf, for instance (ignoring what he says about the Jews in there, he does give a fascinating insight into this particular incident).</p>

<p>There were also many plots throughout the centuries in Europe, with the enmity between France and England being a veritable goldmine. So many of Europe&#39;s royal families are directly related to one another, and they even plotted against each other and went to war against one another, to the point of using one relative to assassinate another over land, trade, or religious disputes while retaining &#39;bloodless&#39; hands in public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean the history of cannabis prohibition perhaps?</p>

<p>If so, I completely agree. I would also say that cannabis prohibition is one of the strongest arguments for a) the corruption and irrationality of government(s) (note that cannabis production and usage is treated as a criminal behavior around the world, despite its general lack of harm and tremendous medical benefits) and b) the ignorance and gullibility of the public at large. </p>

<p>On the conspiracy theme, I think the arguement could be made for a conspiracy of drug companies and other entrenched interests keeping marijuana criminalized for monetary gain. The same could be said for some other psychedelics as well IMO in terms of treating addiction and mental illness, and keeping people from thinking outside of conventional norms in a range of areas.</p>

<p>Anyone wanting to argue that the US government (as one example of many) is insane/corrupt/a danger to the public needs look no further than the way it treats marijuana, i.e. classifying it as a dangerous (&quot;schedule 1&quot;) drug with no known medical benefits. </p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/07/03/government-sponsored-study-destroys-deas-classification-of-marijuana/">http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/07/03/government-sponsored-study-destroys-deas-classification-of-marijuana/</a> for a better explanation of the reality vs. US government classification of marijuana.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who grew up in one of the most conservative counties in California, I knew nothing of marijuana besides &quot;it&#39;s bad&quot; and the basic shit they taught me in elementary school probably 10-12 years ago.  Which is basically &quot;just say no.&quot;  </p>

<p>I then went to college and smoked weed.  I&#39;m not here to be a stoner trying to be pro-cannabis, but it&#39;s amazing the view that society has taken on alcohol, versus how society views marijuana.  I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; than alcohol, but the idea that one is acceptable, but the other is not, is a bit alarming.  There&#39;s no basis for this way of thinking.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the prohibition of marijuana is perhaps the most insane - and obviously insane - law of modern times (i.e. after WW2).</p>

<p>Making the use of a highly medicinal plant illegal simply makes no sense whatsoever. Some other psychedelics are in a similar category IMO (useful for mental illness recovery and breaking drug addiction in certain circumstances), but locking people up in quite rapey prison environments (look it up) for marijuana use is completely insane.</p>

He had orchestrated three major earlier bombings of US holdings and was the most well known terrorist at the time.

When I got home I saw the TV replaying the crashes and I couldn&#39;t comprehend why this would happen. Through years of trying to reconcile the misinformation, I have come to one conclusion; At the very least, 9/11 not necessarily a creation by the US, but the US certainly ignored many warning signs purposefully just as Pearl Harbor. It&#39;s not secret that Cheney was looking for a &quot;new Pearl Harbor&quot;. In retrospect I see how easily fooled I was, and now I am on a mission to correct this. I support peace, liberty, and all that is good &amp; just. At no time shall these natural rights be given up in the name of security, protection, or anything else. No good can come from it. </p>

And at the time, some news agencies((may have been local new station)(keep in mind, i&#39;m in 7th grade at the time, news was news)) actually showed video of controlled collapses, to &quot;show the difference&quot;, I remember thinking they looked the exact same.

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with you 100% until you look at the number of people that tried to help, starting at the FAA level, but were unable to due to military exercises that were replicating a very  similar scenario. When the biggest blinder is not real information, but a war game that just would not end, there is much more room for conspiracy being true. There are a number of individuals that describe the events in such a way that it appears there is a force keeping everybody from quite sucessfully doing their jobs. Furthermore, the detailed events outlining Cheney&#39;s movements are intriguing to say the least. Cheney appears to be the ring leader and Bush was the face to rally against terrorism. Cheney did contribute to a paper calling for a &#39;new Pearl Harbor&#39;, so this is not speculation in hindsight, but foresight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would have to agree. I was in 12th grade when it happened. I remember sitting in my Chemistry class glued to the TV. At first everything seemed pretty straight forward (as straight forward as something like that gets), and then something happened. It was after the second tower fell. Everyone in class all kind of had this look on our faces, like at this point we knew this was no accident. We knew this was planned. And a while later I remember someone on the news saying that &quot;The US Government has contacted Osama Bin Laden, who claims he did not have anything to do with the attack, but when he heard about it he got on his knees and praised Allah.&quot; That sentence always bothered me, and still does to this day. So much is wrong with it. Why would a terrorist leader not immediately take credit for the largest terrorist attack on US soil in history? How did the government find him so quickly? Why wasn&#39;t he detained for at least some form of questioning? That one sentence just raised so many red flags. I started doing my own research. That was the day I started realizing that conspiracy theories aren&#39;t always dreamed up by crack-pots that live in their parents&#39; basement. Sometimes they are incredibly valid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was an unbelievable amount of coincidences regarding that day.  To name a few:  </p>

<ul>
<li>The FAA&#39;s lack of communication with other agencies, even after the first plane hit the tower.<br/></li>
<li>Military air bases along the east coast were all anticipating a training exercise on the morning of 9/11, which is the apparent reason that they took so long to scramble intercept fighters, even after apparent orders had been given.<br/></li>
<li>Despite what the Bush Administration parroted, they HAD been made aware at least a month prior that bin Laden was interested in hijacking planes for an attack.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>So, to answer your question:  No, I don&#39;t <em>really</em> believe that hundreds of people in our government all knowingly conspired to have this happen.  I do, however, believe that a select few conspired to allow <em>someone(s)</em> such a window of opportunity (whether it be that the US allowed al-Qaeda agents to commit this horrendous act in the same suspicious vein as the attack on  Pearl Harbor; or worse, that it was a false-flag).  </p>

<p>And as long as I&#39;m answering questions, CIC = Commander in Chief</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you and a bunch of friends ran off into the mountains and did some communal living, grew food together (or hunted it), made some shelters together, raised families together, etc., in the absence of any other affairs with the rest of humanity on earth, you&#39;d find that within a short time, you&#39;d have a &quot;government&quot;.  You might not call it that, but you&#39;d have your own norms, your own ideas about right and wrong, and your own ideas about community.  Formalizing those concepts is really not at all far from having a government.  In that sense, government is very real, because our natural state is to devise a system whereby we can live in a community and still have some natural recourse when someone does something wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;the dialectic aims to control both the conflict and the resolution of differences, and leads everyone involved into a new cycle of conflicts.&quot;</p>

<p>It is my understanding that the traditional use of this dialectic is used in this manner (for example); if (a: thesis) my idea of freedom conflicts with (b: anti-thesis) your idea of freedom then (c: synthesis) neither of us can be free until everyone agrees to be a slave.</p>

<p>It does not mean, however, that I cannot use the triad in my previous statement above; (thesis) Problem, (opposing) Reaction (aka, anti-thesis), Solution (synthesis).  I am confused as to why this does not &#39;fit&#39;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oops, forgot point three: my work as a lawyer has always been in public interest, providing free civil legal representation to people who can&#39;t afford a lawyer. Some of my work has been in home foreclosure prevention, and I&#39;ve read a lot of news about the practices of our financial services industry and the various national class actions that have been pursued in our country on behalf of distressed homeowners. And I do believe that our largest banks conspired internally, and maybe even between eachother, to foreclose in abusive ways and sometimes when foreclosure is illegal and they know it. I know that some banks processed HAMP modifications, which are supposed to be mandatory when requested, in ways that were illegal and made it impossible to get a modification, and that they knew what they were doing. I know also that there are laws on the books in some states, like Trust Deed foreclosure acts, where it&#39;s possible to foreclose and sell without any direct notice to the homeowner, and I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s possible that any politician would vote for something like that, unless the process is deeply corrupted by contributions by banks and realtors. I also know of one &quot;foreclosure prevention&quot; scam which is connected to big-ish (regional-level) businesses that are breaking federal laws and trying to evade law enforcement through use of shell corporations. </p>

<p>I know that conspiracies are real. I don&#39;t believe in them quite to the extent that some people here do, but there are some really scary goings-on that are often too inconvenient, or boring or complicated to make CNN, that you can see if you just keep your eyes open enough.</p>

<p>Edit: found an example of the mortgage prevention scams: <a href="http://ftc.gov/opa/2013/07/apex.shtm">http://ftc.gov/opa/2013/07/apex.shtm</a> It&#39;s not the one that my client got suckered by, but it&#39;s almost identical modus operandi. Anyway, point is that businesses that put on a respectable face are often only a hidden degree or two away from petty thuggery and thievery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well he had wealthy backers (specifically J.P. Morgan) whom he made far wealthier when he invented the Alternating Current generators.   It enabled placement of power stations far away from the delivery point, rather than having to be every few miles when using Edison&#39;s Direct Current generators.   This made him famous.    Then when he announced he had a way to give free energy to the world he became a threat to J.P. Morgan and others who were now making a fortune off of Alternating Current.</p>

<p>Others have indicated over the century to have learned ways to generate this free energy.   They all either suddenly become very silent, or die.   In some cases whatever they are working on is purchased by a company and never seen again.</p>

<p>Economy of Scarcity.   You can make a fortune off of scarcity.   They do not wish to give up this fortune.</p>

<p>EDIT: To me Nikola Tesla is the greatest American (yes I know he was not born here) inventor.   Edison took credit for things he often took from other people.  Tesla even worked for him briefly.   Nikola Tesla won in the Supreme Court that he was the inventor of the radio.   Yet, history classes still teach it as being Marconi who invented the radio.   Another silenced person.   There are some great biographies on the guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck, I&#39;m gonna wake up with negative karma, but fuck it...</p>

<p>What the hell are you talking about? Only in this thread could you make such an assertion and expect to be taken seriously...</p>

<p>I mean it. I&#39;m not out to insult you, but in order to make a point, shouldn&#39;t you, like so many of the top posters of this thread, have to cite sources, give further information, in order to be taken seriously?</p>

<p>Holy cow, you make I count three or four different assertions, different points,  different declarations to conspiracy, mostly in two sentences.  And look, I&#39;m not here to cut you down or anything, in fact, I&#39;m subcribed to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> myself. This isn&#39;t a thread demanding you convince us what you believe is correct without fault, and I&#39;m really not trying to hold you to that standard. But my God man...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to deny that there are (for many differentiating reasons) suppressed inventions, but what are they? Created by whom? For what purpose? By whom were they suppressed? </p>

<p>The majority of humanity is forced into a position of modern day slavery and control. Okay! Great! By whom? The Bourgeois? The politicians? The Church? All three? You are accusing basically everything unseen as the culprit, and that&#39;s sheerly unfair. </p>

<p>We are being kept under control on oil. Why is this not circumstance? Why is this not being changed? If it is not endemic to our culture (wherever you live), then why does it span so many generations? Who keeps this all quiet and how?! </p>

<p>You give nothing to the charge, and everything to the plain accusation, and it makes people who would cite sources, and give evidence look so much the sillier. Without reference, it appears phantasmic, and ethereal. Please consider those who would question the established status-quo, and try to amend your accusation to reflect someone of reputation and greater intellect. Again, all I&#39;m asking is for you to back your mouth, the same thing we were taught in the schoolyard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your response. I appreciate that there are many assertions that Tesla made, especially during the twilight period of his years, that he used to make himself famous, as far as he was able. I understand that, given the uncertainty of scientific process he had the ability to make claims that spun far into the future. The best example of which was his earthquake engine. </p>

<p>Please do not confuse me for someone who believes that he was not a great inventor, someone ahead of his time. But given his many drawings, and the multiple confidants he had, I cannot believe so simply that he mastered the secrets of the universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It honestly has always been a fascination since I was a kid. At a fairly young age I got into UFO’s, Project Blue Book, Majestic 12, etc. (Views on all of that has since changed, haha). 9/11 was the real kicker for me. I was in high school when it happened and the thing that stuck out the most was my dad’s response. My father has a degree in aeronautical safety and engineering, and flew combat aircraft in AFSOC. He can just look at wreckage of an airplane and tell you what happened. Where I’m going with this is that I will never forget his response to the scenes that were playing out that day. He was baffled by the lack of wreckage and continued saying “there is no way a plane can just ‘evaporate’ like that”. I had always filed it away as my dad being my dad. Fast forward ten years later, I’m confined to the couch and Netflix thanks to a nasty bout with the flu and I see this documentary “Loose Change”. I watch it with a “meh” attitude but it stirs something inside and I start doing my own research and now here I am, rocking the proverbial tin foil hat with the rest if you guys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracies do happen.  &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; as a term has been conditioned to be a bad thing.   Propaganda trying to stop people from questioning anything and blindly follow what they are told.   I know I am preaching to the choir.</p>

<p>EDIT: For me I was teethed on UFO stories.   I heard a lot about JFK and while I believed there were conspiracies occurring, I did not really start paying attention until 911.   I also have studied a lot of history and particularly like the period of the Knights Templar.   Learning about that being where the stigma for Friday the 13th came from and the historical proof that was a conspiracy is just one of many historical examples that conspiracies are very real.    I just apply REASON to anything I see, read, or hear.   I don&#39;t believe anything blindly.   I question the official stories, and I question conspiracy theories.   I tend to embrace whichever one seems more probable based on the information available to me.</p>

This CIA veteran, Victor Marchetti, was recently on Jesse Ventura&#39;s Conspiracy Theory show &quot;Brain Invaders.&quot; He said the experiments now focus on bioelectromagnetic interactions with the human body- neurological psychotronic weapons testing on innocent citizens. FOIA documents proved that subprojects of MkUltra included &quot;remote electronic activation of the human organism.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if the bohemian grove can be considered a conspiracy. Seriously. They enjoy privacy, and partake in very secret rituals (which have since been published, and are weird but not sinister,) but the biggest nail in the coffin to me is that no one there denies that there are dealings going on. They are all very powerful people, many masters of industry, and other political giants. But I have never heard anyone deny that there are deals going on. And obviously it doesn&#39;t necessarily branch out into the illegal, or other governments would get involved. You aren&#39;t untouchable just because you are a member, just look at the extended membership roster. </p>

<p>Really, to be it is no different than the skull and bones society, or the Freemasons. I think it is something that is poorly understood, not evil or misguided.</p>

<p>And lastly, in my opinion, to those who would say those &quot;backdoor&quot; secret dealings that go on are evidence of something more troublesome, I would say that if that were the case, we would then need to prohibit wall street traders and other board directors from fortune 500 companies from mingling with each other. And no one is suggesting such a rash and illogical option. Even if there is disagreement that they should not gather industry moguls and politicians should understand that the worst that is occurring is simple lobbying. </p>

<p>In the end, I see it this way: If they are all working together as some large conspiracy, then so what. Nothing anyone can do could overcome them. And these are all people who are always used to getting what they want, and if there was something sinister at work, do you think that there wouldn&#39;t be massive disagreement and internal sturggle? Just look at the U.S. congress for reference of what that would look like. An abysmal failure. It is astronomically unlikely. </p>

<p>If they were disbanded, consider it for a moment, would this make peace in the middle east? Would it bring food to the mouths of starving hundreds of millions of Africans, or Indians, or Asian poor? Would it stop nuclear proliferation, or bring balance to current propaganda within the media? I say not. These men, these rich and undoubtedly powerful few, could not with all their might do what every religious member of the world prays for. And that is how they are portrayed, as all-powerful, as a secretive sect of rulers. </p>

After that, I was like, &quot;what&#39;s the harm.

I started looking into the hidden history of this world and I have been engaged, entertained, and educated in a way I never had been. I got into the trivium, activism, and propaganda has little to no affect on me.</p>

<p>No regrets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That powerful men have, for a long time, have used their wealth and influence to control policy and politicians to attain more wealth and power. I&#39;ve learned that bloodlines matter to these families and they are very patient, with a long view of their intentions and goals. For someone like Zbigniew Brzezinski to write a book titled <a href="http://youtu.be/t-XIeb879SY">The Grand Chessboard,</a> it&#39;s evident how these people see the planet. They are playing this adversarial game of wealth, hegemony, war, espionage, conflict, subversion, murder, etc. yet their families will never hold a weapon.</p>

<p>You look at how the wealthy and powerful are connected to the intelligence services and the media, and it&#39;s clear what they want. They want little light shown on them and what they are doing, and if any is shown, they want it to be positive (propaganda).</p>

<p>I think <a href="http://youtu.be/nju_6gT4UQ8">this clip</a> is very indicative of these people&#39;s patience and intentions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, 
The Maralinga (british) nuclear test in Australia <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nuclear_tests_at_Maralinga">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nuclear_tests_at_Maralinga</a> is one actually one that has affected my family. In short: the poms came over here and tested their nukes in &#39;remote uninhabited areas&#39; of Australia. These were not &#39;uninhabited&#39;. Native Aussies were severely affected. My Grandfather was posted at woomera test range in the early sixties, and did time at Maralinga. He was given minimal protection( as we&#39;re many other Aussie servicemen, but not the Brit officers and scientists) they were exposed to high amounts of radiation and died off at varying ages ( all very prematurely). My uncle was born after the tests. He was born &amp; lives sick. The conspiracy is that he receives top notch medical treatment &amp; a LOT of money from the government ( about $1400/month) in his sickness pension. This is after members of my family were in a class action against the British government for what they did there &amp; the effects on civilians. Our family seldom talk about it, mainly fear that the money &amp; medical will stop. No waves. No fuss. 
There&#39;s many other conspiracies involved in this one. Including a massive miscalculation by the Brit meteorologist at one test that ended up with fallout floating over the populated east coast of New South Wales, Australia. This was massively covered up. Ill cite these claims when I get home on my PC. But that&#39;s the crux of it. </p>

<p>edit, edit: I should have mentioned, i like the British people, instead of saying &quot;brits&quot;, i meant British Ministry Of Defence (MOD)</p>

<p>Edit: my grandfather and uncle were never formally recognized and essentially receive hush money. </p>

They were testing radiation effects and the use of nukes as a naval weapon and had boats surrounding where they dropped the bomb. He was in his normal navy uniform and after the explosion men with geiger counters started checking them. They asked if they were in any danger. The guys with the geiger counters said no. They lied.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed 100%. The perception that Maralinga Tjarutja were reimbursed adequately for the stuff they went through sickens me. Ive read material first hand from Yami Lester that links the radiation from the blasts to his blindness and other health issues that have plagued communities in that region. </p>

<p>Im sick to death of hearing bureaucrats try to justify the damage with lines like &#39;well they got compensated for the tests&#39; - the amount they received was pitiful compared to the trauma they were subjected to.</p>

<p>these recognise that that some fallout went through the east coast of QLD, but i cant find the stuff regarding the east coast NSW contamination.</p>

<p>i am actually finding it hard to cite what i have read about the meteorological data concerning the fallout path(s), it was actually in a book that my father had/has, i may have to scan &amp; post the info. Its all tied up in a box with all grandpa&#39;s medical &amp; servicemen stuff.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11, and i figured out it was a lie the very next day.</p>

<p>I was in 5th grade, you all know the story: randomly people began getting picked up to go home...etc.</p>

<p>The entire time i was wondering &quot;why would someone delibertly kill themselves by crashing a plane in a building? To me, it didnt make any sense and i thought it was litterally stupidty on someones part.</p>

<p>He could have scared more people by doing something different (why not crash in times square, or outside the whitehouse?). if he was after a body count, he could have had way more by hitting something else (football stadium, time square). If he wanted to cripple the government, another building would have had better effect (right into the white house).</p>

<p>In the mind of a 5th grader, i couldnt wrap my head around why someone would pick such an odd combination of things. </p>

<p>Then, on 9/12 when i went back to school, <strong>I</strong> was being blamed and harassed for 9/11 and had my first taste of racism and bigotry. I also learned on that day, that Osama Bin Laden was supposedly my uncle (still waiting for that asssholes birthday gifts, they never come). But thats what really did it. How, in less than 24 hours could we KNOW who did it, meanwhile there are thousands of basic murders and other crimes that take weeks, months, or even YEARS to solve. I re-swallowed the blue pill because i just made fun of more for saying that Osama bin laden didnt do it. </p>

<p>Early middle school i dabbled in it, but never went balls-deep. I looked into JFK, area 51 and MK ultra, thought it was interesting, but wasnt fully committed. I heard of this &quot;alex jones&quot; guy and how hes &quot;crazy&quot; and steered far from him as possible. but by the time i reached late middle-school, i stumbled onto Loose Change (didnt know AJ was involved). I believed it, but didnt want to; so i tried to reject it as &quot;nuts&quot;, but due to other events in my life my mind was already expanding and i simply couldnt believe the BS story given to us any longer. It wasnt until i saw Obama Deception which was a roundhouse kick to my face-bone</p>

<p>Couple of hookers, lines coke, and a giant midget later, im now here sharing this story with you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to Uni in a small down in Tennessee. I bought a box of tissues on 9/12. I got a really bad look from the guy stocking the shelf I didn&#39;t think about. The girl at checkout wouldn&#39;t look at me, and that&#39;s when I realized they were looking at me that way because I was brown and had a beard; I&#39;m Indian.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t start really learning about 9/11 until 2005 when I watched Loose Change. In the years since then I&#39;ve grown to understand how evil and corrupt many world powers are and how people are often easily led to vote against their own interested. </p>

<p>I doubt I&#39;ll ever return to American unless the regime falls. But even if it does, I&#39;m sure the corporations that survive will fight each other to put someone else they like in change. </p>

<p>There isn&#39;t new conspiracy revelation every day (at least not until Snowden). If you try to make a show about that type of material, you basically start making up shit or sensationalizing. It&#39;s the same problem with Jessie Ventura&#39;s crap TV-show.      </p>

<p>I listen to him after i get off work on the way home and while im chilling at home. Most of the topics he discusses ive already read myself and its nice to hear it spit back at me. But youre right, he starts banging his fist for no reason and makes me roll my eyes.</p>

<p>i will come to the defnce of Jesse Venturas show though. He said he was going to cover every conspiracy theory, even the ones he thought were silly. Alot of the episodes conspiracys interfere with a previous shows. The show is there more to hook peoples attentions to start thinking outside the box</p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly. (this comment might earn me a visit from the feds) when i was told that they did it because of &quot;terrorism&quot;, my mind exploded. If they were able to hijack an airplane, why not a remote controled car with explosives near the beltway around rush hour, a mall, 4rth of july events, music festivals.</p>

<p>Anything that has a high amount of people concentrated. you certainly dont get screen for walking into a mall (though thats going to chain thanks to the recent false flag shooting), if they really wanted to, and were as zealous as they say they could have done what &quot;they&quot; wanted to do alot better</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My story.</p>

<p>For me it started when I was young by an event that pulled the trigger and molded the part of my life that is &quot;conspiracy.&quot;</p>

<p>I was a young kid living in Colorado, dad was in another state trying to climb the ranks to provide for me being a single father, so for a few years I had to live with my aunt and uncle. One night I went to get in bed to wait for my aunt to come &quot;tuck me in,&quot; what was probably around 5 seconds after I got situated I felt a hand grab me from the other side of the bed. I jumped up so fast I didn&#39;t even use my hands of legs to touch the carpet as the fear of what just happened terrified me so badly I used the bed as a spring and bounced out from underneath the covers to a standing position on the floor, running out like Michael Johnson, frantic with fear I went to tell my aunt what had just happened as I bawl my eyes out and this is where I got my first heavy dose of &quot;nobody believes,&quot; and that stuck with me. This event sparked something that would almost &quot;open something up&quot; inside of me as if a knob had been turned a few degrees higher, making me more aware of my surroundings. </p>

<p>A few years later my dad moved back and we moved around a bit but ended up settling in Aurora CO, not far from where I was before when I lived with my aunt and uncle in Littleton. One day I woke up, it seemed like it was going to be a nice day so I looked out of my window, everything seemed great and I was excited to go out and play but right before I left the window something caught my eye. It was a metallic looking, what I described at the time as an old metal trash can, hovering about 100 feet over the neighbors home. I ran into my dad&#39;s room to wake him up and said &quot;dad, dad! where are my Batman binoculars?!&quot; groggy and most likely grumpy he said he didn&#39;t know. I ran back in my room to see if it was still there and it was, so I ran down stairs and searched for them but they were no where to be found, so I ran back up the stairs as fast as I could to keep staring at it but it was gone, I never saw it again nor did I even find my Batman binoculars for the record.</p>

<p>Fast forward to around 8 years I&#39;m living in CA where I was born, we&#39;re back home and settled into the same area as some of our family and it was great. Not long after I begin looking into UFO&#39;s online and one day I came across someones story, the person said that they had witnessed a &quot;Metallic looking trash can object&quot; appearing to be under some sort of smooth intelligent control that made no sound. I couldn&#39;t believe it, this is exactly what I saw and this is what started me off in the UFO field.</p>

<p>Now, you can not just be &quot;into the UFO field&quot; because to be in the UFO field you must first research the history, and when you research you find things like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vyVe-6YdUk">The Disclosure Project</a> which is where I really started to question things and learn just how deep Government corruption into the UFO field went, <a href="http://www.citizenshearing.org">this is a very similar one</a> that took place this year before former members of congress, called <a href="http://www.citizenshearing.org/">The Citizen Hearing on Disclosure.</a> and it includes everything from Military Generals, to Astronauts, even the former Canadian Prime Minster, all blowing the whistle of the UFO field. When you research more you begin to see actual Government documents of these, NASA footage of UFO&#39;s and so-forth. This research also led me towards government corruption involving the mega banks, NSA, and dirty politics.</p>

<p>9/11.</p>

<p>First I want to say, the Flight 93 pilot Jason Dahl was a family friend, him and his wife Sandy lived around the corner from my aunt and uncle in Littleton CO, who are both United Airlines Flight Attendants, we have been to their home and they were the all American family, just great kind people all around. Last year Sandy died in her home, she was the reason that the memorial in PA stands today in honor of this event, she is deeply missed in the community and at large, God bless her. </p>

<p>On the morning on 9/11 my dad woke me up for school, instead of the regular &quot;time to get up&quot; he said &quot;a plane just crashed into the tower in New York&quot; my dad was a United Airlines mechanic at the time and now retired, so to him it was a huge deal. The scary thing was that we didn&#39;t know if my aunt or uncle were on the plane and it was a very tense time and I still had to go to school but it was being talked about everywhere, a girl who&#39;s father worked at the Pentagon was ushered out of school and everyone seemed to be on their toes. There was a history teacher, a former Military man who flew the P.O.W flag in his 8th Grade class room all year round who had the T.V on all day so everyone could stay updated.</p>

<p>Not long after and still being in the UFO field I heard people starting to talk about 9/11 theories and I came across <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8Hk1-BpXO8">videos like this</a>, where Alex Jones predicted there would be an attack involving Bin Laden soon, he did this in July 2001, this is where I started. Then I began to uncover all of the weird, WTC 7 falling into it&#39;s own footprint and not being mentioned once in the 9/11 commission report, the collapse being reported before it even fell, the fact that there wasn&#39;t even going to be a commission report at all but the families cry&#39;s for help wanting answers were the reason for it, that to me was amazing. So I began to start watching all of the documentaries on 9/11 and do the research for myself.</p>

<p>Now, this is pivotal and you must understand that for me, there was no conspiracy until I researched what was being said in these claims myself, so I began to dig really deep and uncover stuff the typical person saying &quot;you&#39;re a conspiracy theorist&quot; has absolutely no idea took place on that day or leading up to these events and the amount of lies and happenings I found out about was astonishing</p>

<p>That is basically how I began to be a &quot;9/11 Truther,&quot; a lot of things touched close to home for me, my family could have been on those planes. I&#39;m almost 27 now and these events changed my life, and when I say changed my life I mean it. Once you uncover something you ask yourself &quot;what else have we been lied to about,&quot; then that knob begins to turn more and you begin to connect with people all over the world and hear from professionals in fields. You begin to learn more and more, about all types of things like the Pilots for 9/11 Truth community or the Demolition Experts for 9/11 Truthers and all the Engineers etc.. new evidence comes to light all the time and you want to keep up with it to be as informed as possible. One day there may be an Edward Snowden of 9/11 or UFO&#39;s, and when/if that day happens all hell is going to break loose with the &quot;I told you so&#39;s.&quot; </p>

<p>YouTube also changed the game for the world of conspiracy, and there are some crazy people out there that will believe the most ludicrous of things but it&#39;s important to stay grounded and tell yourself that just because someone else believes it, doesn&#39;t make it true or mean that you have to believe it as well. A &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; favorite word is &quot;evidence,&quot; and like the great Jerry McGuire, you better &quot;show me the evidence&quot; before talking crazy. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem thanks for reading. It&#39;s definitely a winding road, I wanted to give a look at where and how it all starts, some people are under the impression that we wake up one day, watch a YouTube video and immediately believe everything and become a &quot;conspiracy theorist.&quot; That word is ancient also and I don&#39;t like to call myself that, because the things I believe in have been researched enough by others and myself to be factual. The UFO thing should be 100% obvious now to people, but since people aren&#39;t a part of this or have never heard the testimonies from government generals and corporals, 3 astronauts giving accounts, one of them is Edgar Mitchell, the 6th man to walk on the moon. Another was Gordon Cooper who was the last man to fly alone in space. Edgar Mitchell has been dedicating his life and work to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quBgwOYrKk0">telling people about the existence of ET&#39;s/UFO&#39;s</a> and what NASA has been lying about, Gordon Cooper <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvPR8T1o3Dc">also spoke publicly</a>. All of the projects, files, FOIA requests and whistle blowers like the lady that airbrushed everything for NASA, I wish everyone knew just how far these things go and just how much evidence there really is.</p>

<p>People like Gary McKinnon, the Hacker that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XacevWeOkHg">got into NASA and just about every branch of Military we have</a> and found the evidence and saw the UFO&#39;s and technology and some really strange things. If this would of happened today like Edward Snowden and he was to get the files it would have been massive. People like Werner Von Braun&#39;s long time co-worker Carole Rosin, the lady that took over his work for him that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-wsBFSsCbI#t=54"> told her about the agenda</a> saying &quot;first it would be Russians, which was existing at the time, then it would be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CSPbzitPL8">Terrorists</a> (Afghanistan, Iraq) then it would be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDI-m6mW0_g">3rd World Countries</a>, (Libya, Syria, North Korea) then it would be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6Dd8MXnjI">Asteroids</a>, (10+ more have fallen since Russian in a very similar fashion.) Then he would repeat to me over, and over, and the last card, the last card, the last card would be the Extra Terrestrial threat.&quot; </p>

<p>As a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; with a lot of information and info the regular doesn&#39;t know about, there are massive structures on the moon and China plans to have a lander there this year, Space X plans to send people to Mars in less than 10 years, these are the perfect opportunities to play the last card. You will get that chip in you to track you if an &quot;abduction&quot; happens, so they will know you&#39;re not just kidnapped but have been &quot;taken,&quot; and all the while it will be OUR back engineered &quot;UFO&#39;s&quot; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE2GL-_lm4I">and other technologies</a> flying around scaring the terror out of everyone as people plead and beg for Government help, so remember this post in the near future everyone. But hey, I&#39;m just a conspiracy theorist like I was when I said the NSA had spying programs that collect your data and monitor your calls, but I was wrong, as it&#39;s public info now that they literally know a hell of a lot more than even I would of ever thought. But despite all of the evidence out there, people will still laugh and shun you and the main reason for that is because they have not acquired all of the information that we have because it&#39;s to &quot;wild&quot; for them to entertain, so telling someone everything I just talked about sounds absolutely insane to them, it&#39;s like telling someone that has only seen our moon that there are more moons out there and having them not believe you because they can only see the one moon.</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite references to use.. </p>

<p>Imagine you&#39;re a cow at a slaughtering ranch and every other day cows are herded off because the decoy cow tells all the other cows that they all go on a vacation when they get taken away. Well one day, one of the cows believes the heard is being lied to, so he sneaks off to investigate and witnesses his buddies being hacked up into pieces to be eaten, he runs back as fast as he can before his buddies are taken off, but he&#39;s too late. The cows are already on the truck saying &quot;hurry hurry! you&#39;ll miss your vacation!&quot; our curious cow says &quot;NO! WAIT! DON&#39;T GO! THEY ARE GOING TO KILL YOU! AND EAT YOU!!&quot; the rest of the cows burst into hysterical laughter and make fun of curious cow as they&#39;re all driven off to their death.</p>

<p>You say that what you saw on 9/11, I assume referring to WTC towers 1 and 2, was &quot;clearly controlled demolition&quot;. How many controlled demolitions had you witnessed prior to 9/11 that you formed this opinion? How many have you seen since? How many non-controlled demolitions have you witnessed, for contrast?

<p>Another thing the whole point of this subreddit and the whole conspiracy &quot;genre&quot;/ &quot;community&quot; is for average everyday normal people to watch tv or the news or internet and provide insight into the events going on maybe it provokes questions in their mind and they are right maybe they are wrong but you don&#39;t need to try patronise people because you don&#39;t believe what they say</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How am I being patronising? I&#39;m asking questions, which is exactly what a conspiracy theorist or truth-seeker is supposed to do.<br/>
My concerns about the controlled demolition theory is that people always respond &quot;well just compare it to a controlled demolition and you&#39;ll see&quot; but that isn&#39;t an answer. The people saying that aren&#39;t experts or relying on expert evidence. A few people have offered hypothesis&#39; based on some visual evidence that has equally if not more plausible alternative explanations. They&#39;re questioning the official story, but people aren&#39;t allowed to question their theory? Why? I don&#39;t expect an expert answer or opinion from lay-people, because that&#39;s not reasonable. But if you have a theory, you need to really think about what you&#39;re basing it on. Is the conspiracy theory really more plausible?</p>

<p>Sometimes people refuse to accept an answer simply because it&#39;s the official one and they don&#39;t like it, and too many theorists are happy to pat themselves on the back for not being one of the &quot;sheeple&quot;, but they can&#39;t put forward a viable alternative. Until you can, you need to keep asking questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not avoidance. I answered your question. </p>

<p>How many skyscrapers have you seen crumble in their own footprint from fire before 9/11? The answer to that is ZERO. </p>

<p>On 9/11 we had 3 high rise steel buildings collapse at near free fall speed from fire - defying logic, reason and science. </p>

<p>How many controlled demolitions have I seen? You seriously doubt peoples ability to view controlled demolitions? </p>

<p>That&#39;s your reasoning behind believing the governments explanation of 9/11? If so that&#39;s seriously sad. </p>

<p>Ive personally watched hundreds of controlled demolitions on the internet alone. Thats not including hours and hours of Discovery and NG documentary&#39;s on controlled demolitions and the companies hired to do them. </p>

<p>You dont have to be a expert on explosives and controlled demolitions to see the eerie similarities with 9/11 and controlled demolitions. The same way you dont have to be a expert on ANY subject to have a educated and thought out opinion of it.    </p>

<p>Let me help you and anyone else out that has not seen a controlled demolition. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Controlled+demolition&amp;amp;oq=Controlled+demolition&amp;amp;gs_l=youtube.3..0l10.2754.5329.0.5521.21.12.0.9.9.0.98.815.12.12.0...0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.7oSN8BOCdwY">http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Controlled+demolition&amp;amp;oq=Controlled+demolition&amp;amp;gs_l=youtube.3..0l10.2754.5329.0.5521.21.12.0.9.9.0.98.815.12.12.0...0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.7oSN8BOCdwY</a></p>

<p>The beautiful thing about 9/11 is there are thousands of expert outside consultants, Architects, Engineers, Construction experts in the top of their field that agree - 9/11 was a controlled demolition. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/">http://www.ae911truth.org/</a></p>

<p>You can argue that I&#39;m not &quot;qualified&quot; to make a judgement of this scale with just watching a couple of videos but how do you argue the thousands of qualified experts opinion? That ones easy - You cant. </p>

<p>I cant open your mind and force you to think. All i can do is put the information in front of you and let you put together your own opinion. Hopefully a well educated one.  </p>

<p>I form my opinions on facts and what I experience and learn for myself. You and millions like you on the other hand have formed your 9/11 opinion on speculation and what the government has told you to believe. The truth. There is no historic data on highrise steel buildings collapsing from fire. </p>

<p>There are not hundreds of videos aside from the Trade Centers where you can compare the collapses to other steel buildings falling at free fall speed from fire. </p>

<p>So my question for you. How did you come to your opinion that fire collapsed the World Trade Centers on 9/11? The Answer - Thats what you were told to believe. Thats what your TV box told you to believe. </p>

<p>Please feel free to back up your opinion with critical thought, videos, expert opinions and historical data that back up your claim that the Trade Centers fell from fires. Prove to me - SHOW ME that these towers did not fall from controlled demolition and I will gladly change my stance. </p>

<p>Nepotism is the gold and the conductor&#39;s connection and ignorance is the prison that the people are kept in. </p>

<p>Think about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I can&#39;t fault you for effort, at least, though most of what you have to say is recycled and comes with the same flaws as other conspiracy theorists. For instance, the repetition of the lie that the buildings fell at near free-fall speed, something that has been debunked by measuring from when the top of the building actually started moving, not demolition-theorists start counting - starting with Dylan Avery&#39;s Loose Change video and repeated in every demolition-theorist analysis since. Heck, you can disprove this by watching a couple of seconds of the WTC towers falling, since you can see debris falling around the main core of the building even faster. Was that debris in some sort of super-freefall then?</p>

<p>Another common argument is that no other building has fallen solely from fire, as if the fact that the buildings were hit by large planes is rather immaterial. I find it interesting that when people say the towers fell from fire, they behave as if the fires occurred spontaneously. When you factor in the damage caused by the planes, that seems to get handwaved away as a minor issue.</p>

<p>Eerie similarities between the WTC and other controlled demolitions? Well, if you mean the buildings fell down, sure. But when happened with the WTC was the upper halves of the buildings crashed down onto the lower halves, and then continued to telescope down level by level as hundreds of tons of concrete and steel crashed down, and down and down. I looked at a few of those controlled demolitions and didn&#39;t really see many similarities at all.</p>

<p>Of course your conspiracy theorist website you obtained these engineering sources and reports from is completely balanced, I&#39;m sure. I will go ahead and discount the expert opinion of people who don&#39;t agree with the CT explanation, because reasons.</p>

<p>I especially like this part of your post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So my question for you. How did you come to your opinion that fire collapsed the World Trade Centers on 9/11? The Answer - Thats what you were told to believe. Thats what your TV box told you to believe. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you for answering the question for me! I was paralysed by your <del>flawless</del> logic. At the same time you are calling into question my ability to critically think and analyse information, you posit a question the immediately substitute an answer of your choosing, drawing a conclusion without any consultation from me. I haven&#39;t even told you what I believe, but you assume I readily accept the official version without putting any thought into it, because I questioned your views and you assume we are in direct opposition.</p>

<p>Edit: I don&#39;t seem to be able to reply directly to comments or even edit my own posts anymore without doing so via my comment/reply history. I&#39;d assume someone isn&#39;t happy with my participation in this discussion, but I don&#39;t have enough evidence to draw a conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And..Beautiful post clarifying my point. You have no facts or reasonable educated reasons to actually back up that the towers were brought down by fire, not demolition - which in essence - is the real conspiracy theory. </p>

<p>Oh by the way. Another enlightening fact for you! Other highrise buildings have been hit by aircraft full of fuel. The fuel is exhausted in a matter of seconds leaving only office fires. We have these things called building codes and standards. The steel in high rise buildings is required to withstand a certain melting point. A melting point no combination of Jet fuel could ever reach. Thats why no other steel buildings have ever collapsed due to fire. </p>

<p>Thats ok. Nevermind building 7 even existed or fell on its on footprint from a office fire with no jet fuel or impact. You continue to believe that jet fuel caused a smoldering inferno that was able to turn tons of steel and concrete into dust leaving huge pools of molten metal at the base of the structure while leaving traces of high tech nanothermites in the ruins. </p>

<p>LOL. Are you paid to shill or just spread disinformation? Either way. I love how you show no remorse for your ignorance. Again. Thousands of experts agree that the impacts, jet fuel and office fires would not, COULD NOT bring down the towers in the manner that they fell. Your rambling is comparable to arguing that the earth is flat when science and fact simply proves its not.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good job for being the first out of 400 replies to mentioned building 7. I agree completely. The way it fell was identical to a controlled demolition. I don&#39;t believe for one second that a fire can cause such a uniformed collapsed in a steel framed building. If a fire did caused Building 7 to collapse, it would be the first ever fire-induced collapse of a steel-frame high-rise. Also, it&#39;s interesting how building 7’s collapse was not mentioned in the 9/11 Commission Report.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I more or less buy into the whole xenophobia/racism/paper protectionism explanation for it originally becoming illegal in the 30&#39;s, and its continued illegal status after the 60&#39;s being driven by the fact that it facilitates interactions between police and various elements that &quot;the powers that be&quot; wanted to oppress, mostly black people and counterculture types.  </p>

<p>I think the recent changes are being driven by a combination of three main factors.  </p>

<p>One is the dying off of the WWII generation, which did not embrace pot, was more racist than every generation since, and voted.  </p>

<p>The second major factor is the rise of the internet, which enabled conversations about drug policy to expand out of peoples living rooms and helped people people in favor of reform to organize -- the internet made people feel less isolated in their experiences with marijuana.  </p>

<p>The third factor is the fact that the economy sucks, and there&#39;s a good argument to be made that marijuana decrim/legalization will help the economy, and at worst will not hurt it -- this has swayed many fence sitters toward reform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll tell you a little theory I have. I think pot had to be made illegal b/c of industrialism. We simply needed dumbed down workers for industrial/factory processes. As we&#39;ve become increasingly post industrial our job requirements under capitalism have changed. We need less and less labor every day through automation and efficiencies from technology. I think pot will slowly become legal b/c of this. Cigarettes and booze are fine drugs if you&#39;re a factory worker and pot is fine if you&#39;re an office drone.</p>

<p>The reason for it being illegal?

    <div class="md"><p>Fluoride is a known poison and even though it&#39;s labelled as only &quot;mildly toxic&quot;, drinking that crap for your entire life can&#39;t be good for you. Same thing goes for all the junk they put in plastics. Fluoride also causes something called fluorosis, which is what those white streaks on your teeth are. You can look up the statistics on your own for this one, because I don&#39;t feel like spoonfeeding right now, but fluorosis keeps increasing year after year and there are more and more diagnoses for severe cases of it as well. Fluorosis is a sign of overexposure to fluoride, and can really fuck up your teeth. The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research did a survey back in the &#39;80s where something like 22% of children had dental fluorosis. The CDC did another one in the late &#39;90s/early &#39;00s, and they came up with a 40% statistic for fluorosis amongst children. What this means is that all these kids are being overexposed to fluoride and are showing signs of poisoning from it. There&#39;s also skeletal fluorosis that is crippling in its most severe forms, and it&#39;s considered to be endemic in over 20 countries. The important thing to note is that fluorosis is permanent so that 22% stat carries over to adults as well.</p>

<p>What I want to ask you is why you think the government has a right to put chemicals in your water to &quot;prevent you from getting cavities&quot;? Do you think the government has the right to force medical treatment on its citizens?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to first personally thank you for exposing your beliefs. I understand that it takes a lot to give an explanation that will be subjected to such severe criticism. I am not a person who will ridicule, or deride you, and in fact I think that out of all the responses in this thread, yours does and should merit the best of all logical responses.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s handle your claims one at a time, shall we?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fluoride is a known poison</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Awesome. I agree, as long as it is at least 20x to 500x the recommended dose as regulated by normal inductory intake per fluid per liter. In these ranges, it can cause havoc, which will come into play later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Drinking that crap for your entire life can&#39;t be good for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cite source please.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Same thing goes for all the junk they put in plastics. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cite source please, as used for human normal rate of plastic consumption.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fluoride also causes something called fluorosis. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, Let&#39;s tackle this. I will give you that at a minimum, 25% of youth in the United states exhibit some form of fluorosis. 25%! That&#39;s huge! That&#39;s a big deal! So why doesn&#39;t the U.S. government address this burdensome issue? </p>

<p>Because it is well within normal parameters. Unless you contend that the USDA are lying! Other than that, it is normal, and yes, it occurs, but within normal, expected guidlines, and in no way are people in danger from over exposure!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can look up the statistics on your own for this one, because I don&#39;t feel like spoonfeeding right now, but fluorosis keeps increasing year after year and there are more and more diagnoses for severe cases of it as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have found a grand total of 5 cases in India, 1 in Iceland, 3 in Nova Scotia, 8 in the United States, 2 in France, 1 in Spain, 6 in the UK, and a grand total of 13 diagnosed cases everywhere else. I am perfectly willing to cite my sources for these diagnosed cases. I am also willing to admit that the presence of fluoridated water is a reason to submit causation in these specific cases.</p>

<p>Now I want to understand your hesitation to accept these cases as necessary. I want to understand your frustration as valid. I want, overall, to call this as it is, not what it appears to be. But I ask you to understand  that the ball is in your court. That the fact that so many untold millions have resisted tooth decay as a result of this fluoridation of common drinking water is some kind of conspiracy, some type of over arching means of control. In this, I just don&#39;t see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mother of... you again. Okay, fine by me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fluoride is a known poison.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In too many parts per million per liter of water, or any other ingested or absorbed thing. So are most other elements as well, that is why they are not labeled as Poisonous, they are labeled as Toxic. The disease that was referred to is a byproduct of fluoride toxicity. This is impossible to get at regulated levels (normally set at 2 parts per million.) </p>

<p>From the World Health Organization Website:</p>

<p>&quot;In humans, &quot;disease&quot; is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person afflicted, or similar problems for those in contact with the person.&quot;</p>

<p>The symptoms listed as a result of Fluorosis are different than those of acute fluoride toxicity. The symptomatic lines in the teeth are harmless. That&#39;s what 25% of children in the U.S. have and that is <strong>all</strong> they have. Fluoride does not accumulate in the body and stay there, it is passed harmlessly through the body. In the cases I cited above, none of them were ever confirmed to be caused by fluoride in the water, it is much more likely that it was an element of pesticide that caused the disease.</p>

<p>Please, please understand you would very literally die of water intoxication before you ever developed any ill effects from fluoride toxicity, if it is given at the set levels of 2ppm. </p>

<p>You charge that governments the world over are systematically poisoning their people, and that every scientist is either hushed, or in on the conspiracy. Because the practice is so widely accepted as beneficial to both preventing tooth decay and strengthening bone density. The paltry sum of people, who even if in theory were poisoned by drinking water, do not even begin to outweigh the massive benefits.</p>

<p>Now, I invite you to do your own research, and if you have constructive input, I would be happy to hear you out. But don&#39;t be, let&#39;s say, &quot;naive&quot; and only accuse me of being wrong, or throw another insult, or add nothing of any substantial basis. Don&#39;t use language that is only designed to scare, and to accuse. Don&#39;t make another passionate remark about the need to stop poisoning our children. It&#39;s not helpful, its inflammatory, and its the same type of language used in propaganda. Don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, I look for the conspiracies that hold the most water. I give everyone a fair chance, but if I see something that seems to be like a loose thread, I pull and see if it unravels. I don&#39;t believe in a lot of conspiracy theories, but I do believe that at times the government lies to us, not necessarily for our own good. Granted, the government&#39;s been spying on us since at least 2005, even Christopher Hitchens went before the Senate to debate this, it&#39;s in his Memoir, I&#39;ll find it when I get time.</p>

<p>In short, I don&#39;t believe a lot of what the government tells us, because we are told to accept the social contract and accept inequality so that we can be comfortable. Basically, I think some things are ingrained in the system and that other things are legit conspiracies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That the shadowy aspects of the government actually run the country through capitalism and terror. The POTUSA, Congress, and the SCOTUSA are now just puppets of the CIA, FBI, NSA, DOD, etc., that is, unelected officials who are accountable to no one. It has since turned into what I see as an increasingly Evangelical movement to bring about the apocalypse. </p>

<p>It was when the PATRIOT Act passed, and it suddenly dawned on me that the government is way too involved in things it needn&#39;t be involved in. It got me searching, and I became aware of the Congressional-Industrial-Military complex and its increasingly Christian exclusivity. Thanks to a friend, I learned about the School of the Americas, and America&#39;s involvement in worldwide terror and hegemony. Chomsky is a big influence, but I think he&#39;s either too optimistic or unwilling to accept certain ideas.</p>

<p>Even as it is, I am hesitant to call it a &quot;conspiracy,&quot; because I am not sure whether these people are planning as a group or just individually following their fucked up worldviews, and having worldviews in common with the powerful is how you are brought into the fold. Like attracts like, right?</p>

<p>I am now skeptical of everything the US does and everything a government official says. All they want is to increase wealth disparity, Christianize the world, and create an ignorant and complacent populace too tired to do anything but crunch numbers, write code, and operate machines. I think the tools used are ultimately capitalism and religion, but the only reason they have any success is because all the bullshit people would disagree with happens behind closed doors.</p>

<p>God, I can ramble on and on about this forever.</p>

<p>Essentially, I think capitalism and religion ruin everything, and it&#39;s not an isolated group of people like &quot;the Zionists&quot; or &quot;the illuminati&quot; or &quot;the Rothschilds,&quot; etc. But no one wants to believe that capitalism and religion are bad. They&#39;ll criticize individual aspects, suggest ways to &quot;regulate&quot; certain aspects that are found to be disagreeable to the populace, but they won&#39;t admit that both have failed <em>Homo sapiens</em> and, more importantly, the earth as a whole (pollution, etc. all stems from a uniquely human arrogance driven by religion and greed).</p>

<p>Edit: Other countries and their leaders cannot be trusted either. Governments worldwide have long been in bed with capitalistic greed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know. It runs in the face of the Christian idea (especially in America) that Christians are a down-trodden people quickly being marginalized by a secularizing society. I used to think that was the case too until I saw that one needs either be a Christian or cater to the Christians population to succeed politically.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t mean &quot;Christianize&quot; in the way that, say, radical Muslims wish to spread Islam. It&#39;s a watered down version, but it suits the purposes of the powers that be, both in keeping the population docile at home and garnering support from them in terms of foreign policy (eg, &quot;America is a Christian nation,&quot; &quot;American Exceptionalism,&quot; etc). Keeping a &quot;Christian&quot; attitude in our policymaking serves the government (and many business people&#39;s pocketbooks) well.</p>

My mind is still blown that they could do a 9/11 scale operation, but if the steel can&#39;t melt from office fires the steel can&#39;t melt from office fires.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Helping to run logistics for a battalion and at Group level in the Marines taught me a lot about how military functions as a mechanism and as an organism, in garrison and in theater. It is rather frightening, once you step back to look at it as a whole without the filter of what is instilled in you during training. The overall waste and useless redundancy alone is stunning. Waste of material, resources, and manpower. We really aren&#39;t as far from Caesar&#39;s days of &#39;throw more men at the problem&#39; as we might think. Following regulations for supply means that you will, without fail, overpay and expend far too many peripheral resources to ship/obtain what you are paying for. The old joke about $40 for a hammer is not a joke. It is how things actually work. That waste and disregard for expenditure does not end at materials. It takes place with manpower as well. Ask any infantry units about it. You really are just a number, just a value placeholder in a spreadsheet, and that value is not high. When computing the worth of each member, only the money used to train, maintain, and equip the member is tabulated. But not the person. That is just a vessel for the investment. Now take leaders that do not see the conflict firsthand, that only see the spreadsheets. they are just moving investments around. The people dying are just the transportation for those investments. How often does leadership care for investments wisely?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which story? Unaccounted for sections of unit budgets I was told to ignore, ordering supplies through Granger at exorbitant prices that couldn&#39;t possibly be accurate (74.50 for a fiberglass handle hammer. No bullshit), being told that &#39;maintenance will worry about the failed ground water safety tests, you just sign off that they occurred&#39; when the yearly base testing went through, bleaching then painting over black mold every spring in the barracks buildings despite objections that this only covers it for a few months, hearing a couple docs (Corpsmen) discussing vaccines and flu shots like the nasal spray that do nothing or have nasty and completely unexpected side effects? I saw a lot that made me wonder just how well our military is actually controlled, and by who. Look up Persian War Syndrome, Gulf War Syndrome, and others. If these nebulous collections of effects, ranging from mildly irritating to debilitating, are/were caused by the places we were fighting in, then why aren&#39;t the locals affected? And I know about regional immunity, but the amount of people hit with these syndromes and the wide array of how can hit makes it pretty clear that it is more than just a couple regional bacterium or contagion. If that were the case, then world air travel would render airports plague pits that infected nearly everyone that went through them with oodles of bugs. It is just those that deploy that are getting nailed with these horrible effects. And trust me, Persian War Syndrome is no fun. I know from continuing experience.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wonder if the human species is the only one to so quickly accept the idea of greater forces working in their favor, whilst at the same time automatically dismiss the possibility of any forces conspiring against them. If we can establish there are groups of people coordinating to impact the world positively (as there are – i.e. Doctors Without Borders, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch etc.) it follows that it is neither wholly unreasonable nor illogical to assume the opposite. There are groups of people coordinating with the express intent of doing harm to others – most likely (though not always) in order to produce a favorable result for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, I have to throw in my two cents, and I don&#39;t give a damn if no one wil read it and it&#39;s only for the NSA datacenter.</p>

<p>Five years before V for Vendetta was released I heard this phrase: </p>

<p>&quot;All the best records are tax records.&quot;</p>

<p>Mother of God does that phrase ring true to me.  All these years later. Every single annotation, every last file, every single mislocation, when it comes to money, and where it went, I fucking listen.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say 80% of what I look into is bullshit. I don&#39;t care for an agree or disagree, I don&#39;t. If a government has missing files, I mean confirmed missing files on an event, personnel, or a government program, then something was hidden. </p>

<p>I look at databases, third party, transparency issued databases. Ten, twenty, thirty years after the fact, it doesn&#39;t matter. Where the money is allocated, and then disappears. Nothing, not the NSA in America, or the programs in India, the IMF, the consulate in Europe, or the countless actions in Africa, everything comes down to the almighty Dollar, the Euro, the Yen, the Krone, the Pound, whatever. When money dissapears from public oversight, it&#39;s being used in an illegal or unethical manner.</p>

<p>People, in my opinion, tend to lose sight of the fact quickly, that wherever bad deeds may nurture, it takes money to grow. Without money, all these afformentioned &quot;conspiracies,&quot; would just be thoughts in the minds of otherwise ordinary men. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I&#39;ll edit, just for my own self. I believe income inequality is a conspiracy. I to this day don&#39;t know why masters of industry would file down every last fraction of a profit loss percentage. To pay their workers, and contractors, and franchises, and dealers down to the absolute minimum. Greed doesn&#39;t cover it to me. There is a loss of logic there, why they couldn&#39;t see why people wouldn&#39;t eventually revolt against the system. Maybe its something that their greed disallows them from seeing, maybe. But it doesn&#39;t make sense, you don&#39;t retain that kind of power by being stupid, foolish or any other denigrating thing.</p>

<p>There are many, many, many other conspiracies, but I see this as the great overarching conspiracy. The ebb and flow of the almighty tinge of wealth. I&#39;ll probably never figure it out. But in this day and age, morality, ethics, chivalry and honor take a definite backseat to profit. I&#39;ve seen it a hundred times. I could cite my sources, but who would ever read this? I couldn&#39;t even blame the nameless faces who march towards that ever forward goal. What would men with money want, but more money? What would men with power want but more power? It is the one inescapable, immovable, irrefutable move towards hiding from people who are controlled to those who control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The drug war and religion pushed me in the direction, the Snowden/NSA stuff shattered my &quot;a lot of people can&#39;t keep a secret&quot; assumption.</p>

<p>That said, it was more of a logical realization, and I&#39;m not sure of what defines &quot;conspiracy theorist.&quot;</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just open to looking at things without confirmation bias and heuristics.</p>

<p>If you want a long explanation, read everything below this line:</p>

<hr/>

<p>Two things I used to grapple with:</p>

<p>1 - Many conspiracy theorists are completely nuts.</p>

<p>2 - However, every once in a while a conspiracy comes true.</p>

<p>Why the dissonance?  Then I realized something.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a paranoid schizophrenic, you are going to think EVERYTHING is a conspiracy.  Your medicine is poison, your headache is from the government, et cetera.</p>

<p><strong>HOWEVER,</strong> if you think literally EVERY ASSUMPTION is wrong, by the law of probability you are naturally going to find all the actual fakes in the process.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an analogy that I explain to people:</p>

<p>Imagine if you had three people in a forest: Ken, Bob, and A-A-ron.</p>

<p>Ken decides &quot;HA! I know that everything in this forest is inedible!  If you think any stuff here can be eaten you&#39;re crazy!&quot;</p>

<p>Ken is a sheeple: scared, arrogant, misguided or all three.</p>

<p>Bob decides &quot;HA!  I know EVERYTHING in this forest IS edible!&quot;</p>

<p>Bob starts eating things that can actually be eaten, like miner&#39;s lettuce and grubs, but also eats the rusty car fender, the poisonous mushrooms, the tree bark...</p>

<p>In this process Bob will stumble upon things that can actually be eaten, but only as a function of believing EVERYTHING is so.</p>

<p>This convinces Bob that everything he eats (thinks) must be edible (true), because some things he eats (thinks) are  edible (true).</p>

<p>Bob is a standard &#39;crazy person.&#39;</p>

<p>Ken, however, has fallen into the inverse of the exact same trap: Ken just assumes everything is inedible (false), which is just as bad.</p>

<p>Both are wrong.  Both are illogical.</p>

<p>A-A-ron sees this and decides: &quot;I know!  I&#39;ll avoid BOTH traps, and be skeptical yet open minded!&quot;</p>

<p>I try to be A-A-ron. </p>

<p><strong>TL DR: &quot;nothing is a conspiracy&quot; and &quot;everything is a conspiracy&quot; are BOTH assumptions.  The truth is &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; and the follow-up is &quot;I should find out.&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ironically it was South Park in an episode that lampoons the 9/11 conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>I, at the time, hadn&#39;t heard of any of this stuff and my buddy looked at me and said, &quot;You that&#39;s all real, right?&quot; And I filed it away in my head for later (I had a lot going on in my life at that time). A year and a half later I formally looked into it. to say that I had my world view rocked would be an understatement. I took it pretty hard.</p>

<p>Initially I thought Jordanis Maximus knew his shit (I was wrong).</p>

<p>I discovered Bill Cooper. A bastion of information.</p>

<p>Then Robert Anton Wilson as a sort of antidote to the anxiety.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;[m designing my own program for dealing with &quot;the situation.&quot;</p>

<p>The specific thing was the freefall speed of the buildings. All that material had to stop existing in order for such a thing to happen. Material doesn&#39;t just stop existing unless a lot of preparation is involved. And Osama bin Laden did not have access to those buildings. DRAMATIC CHORD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was learning so much about how the Native American&#39;s lived and then hearing a teacher&#39;s voice trail off when confronted with questions about where they went. </p>

<p>It was the circus of the Clinton impeachment, knowing that there must be underlying political issues at work, that first made me see the absurdity of it. </p>

<p>The 2000 recount was political theater, with a two month long protest situated not far from my house. Neither candidate were anything for a teen with a burgeoning sense of social justice to get exited about. But through all the faux objectivity it was plain to see that the electoral college was a terrible system, and that the two warring factions were concerned, not with getting it right but with winning. You could see the media and feel the system pulling for GWB, I didn&#39;t understand why, but it was palpable. I heard so many of my friends parents say that Bush was a better choice because of Clinton&#39;s sexual indiscretions. I could tell they were being manipulated into thinking a certain way, and sexual morality was not the real issue at hand.</p>

<p>9/11 on the West coast -  watching from the second plane hitting to the second building falling, and then going to class in my second week of high school. Holy shit. I can&#39;t say I was mature or smart enough to not think the plane impacts brought down the buildings at that point. </p>

<p>But it was the readiness with which we marched to war that made me realize the complex was ready, they wanted it. When we went to Iraq I understood it was scheduled, we had built a hammer that needed to find nails. </p>

<p>From that point it&#39;s just research. It&#39;s not, as they say &quot;want to believe,&quot; in conspiracies, I understand the repetitions of Empire, and that power is bigger and stronger than it has ever been in human history. A lone gunman might be a far MORE frequent occurrence than a conspiracy, but the differences are plain, the evidence tells the truth. An assassination by a lone gunman looks like John Hinckley shooting Reagan, not the calculated, planned, covered up events that continued another 50 years of American imperialism. </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that the speed of technology has also increased the rate of societal decline. The democratic ideal might never return to the US. I can see it happening with my friends. Idealistic, smart people that have turned their attention to capitalism. They work and they fuck off with money. People are distracted from their sense of service by football and entertainment. Everybody&#39;s fucking depressed, with good reason.</p>

<p>The voice of the modern media is louder than any other voice in the history of the world. Messaging and propaganda are so ubiquitous it&#39;s hard to imagine life where  word of mouth or simple written documents carried news and it was up to you and your immediate relations to editorialize and form opinions and beliefs. It&#39;s no wonder that most people believe the things they&#39;ve heard their entire life. Especially upper and upper middle class white people who&#39;ve been treated so well by US policy for the last 30 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 2001 I was also starting my Freshman year in high school in the Mid-West.  I watched the 2nd plane hit on the TV in the PE locker room just after I had finished changing.  While I couldn&#39;t believe it had happened, it wasn&#39;t very profound for me.  I still went home that afternoon and played computer games after school.  I knew it was unprecedented in the history of the modern world, but I didn&#39;t think it was a sham or a lie at all.  And I still didn&#39;t understand that the world had changed dramatically.  I credit that to my lack of maturity then.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2003.  I watched live on TV the bombing of Baghdad.  That&#39;s when I understood the significance.  I understood that it stemmed from 9/11, and that the world was a different place, but I thought it was justified because of terrorism.</p>

<p>2004, aim instant messenger is still all the rave.  I saw in my friends info/profile that he believed the pentagon wasn&#39;t hit by a plane.  I can&#39;t remember if I actually attacked him in conversation about it, but I remember I couldn&#39;t believe that such a smart kid, someone smarter than me, could believe that &#39;bullshit&#39;.  </p>

<p>Part of me hates how naive and egotistical I was back in high school, but another part of me was glad I was that way, because now I can better understand the mindset of someone who accepts a story as opposed to questioning it.  Because that&#39;s what I did.</p>

<p>Through college I became more of loner in a sense and really bit down on the chomp and studied hard through school, instead of partying and always going out.  Through a series of new professors, friends, environments, and extra-curricular activities I developed into my own person.  I became more analytical and questioned fundamental things about life and how we live it.  Towards the end of college I started following and caring more about politics because I realized how much power such few people had over everyone.</p>

<p>In 2010 I started reading Chomsky after I saw him in an interview.  He influenced me to study US foreign policy after WW2, and I was fucking blown away!  South America in particular.</p>

<p>2011, Arab Spring.  It all came together.  The news was just blindly reporting on the events, with no critical thinking or history applied.  The US just started dropping bombs in Libya for purely political gains, and I thought back to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.  It all clicked.  I started, for the first time EVER, actually researching the events of 9/11.  It was just following the tree branch from there  </p>

<p>I remember NDAA being barely mentioned in the news and I couldn&#39;t understand how the average person was not absolutely furious with this.  I wanted to take to the streets.  I thought everyone should want to take to the streets.  Political views aside this was fundamental liberties at stake!  </p>

<p>In November Obama said he&#39;d veto NDAA.  In December he said he wouldn&#39;t sign it.  On New Years day without a word or hesitation he signed it into law.  That&#39;s when I truly realized, for what it actually is, the empire I live in.  And now I knew how far it would go to control and dominate the entire world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started to question things when the Iraq war kicked off and hearing that the bombing campaign was called &quot;Shock and Awe&quot;, I remember thinking to myself, wait a minute that sounds a lot like terrorism. 
Seeing how dumb President Bush was told me that there had to be more intelligent people pulling strings behind the scenes, and so began my research into American foreign policy, the history of the Middle East and Israel, the history of European banking families and the alliance they made with European royalty and secret societies and elitist clubs that practically run the show in Britain and America. How major conglomerates produce practically everything we consume and are owned by a few banking families, how the Federal reserve is actually a privately owned bank and every American dollar is created with interest laden debt and how the whole damned system is nothing more than a massive ponzi scheme going back to 1913, everything else falls into place once you realize that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, it&#39;s less about some conspiracy theory here or there that really changed my mind and more about looking back at historical events that would look very conspiracy theory worthy in hindsight (whether there were conspiracy theories or not). History has examples of rushing to judgement to start a war or military action prior to getting the facts straight, administrations outright breaking laws or bending them to go to the outcome they&#39;d like, and plenty of stuff that the public seems to conveniently forget or believe won&#39;t happen again despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Iran-Contra affair should have been a pretty clear indication that sometimes intelligence agencies act illegally and probably merit more oversight, but as a whole the nation seems shocked at NSA revelations. The characterization of the USS Maine and Gulf of Tonkin incidents to put the country on a war footing happen to this day...we just narrowly avoided direct military intervention in Syria over chemical weapons. If Kerry hadn&#39;t had a throw away comment that Russia siezed as an idea, we&#39;d probably be there now. As it is, we&#39;re still funneling weapons to the Syrian opposition. Because supporting oppositional forces in the Middle East has never backfired on us before, amirite?</p>

<p>I want to believe in aliens, and I do believe that they&#39;re probably out there...but am less a believer that they visit us. I also listen to podcasts (both skeptical and on the believer end) about cryptids and other paranormal stuff. But I follow those for entertainment. I pay attention to government conspiracy theories because they sometimes turn out to be right (or to at least have a grain of truth), and that&#39;s much more likely to have a direct effect on my life.</p>

<p>Remember, and it&#39;s hard to now, but we weren&#39;t at war with them. If anything, wouldn&#39;t attacks make sense now?

    <div class="md"><p>She was wife to and mother of the future kings of England and was out of the control of the royal family and embracing her freedom. She was openly critical of some members of the Royal family and also hinted at dark secrets which were not revealed. She had a variety of interesting and powerful boyfriends one of whom, James Hewitt, has always been rumoured to be the father of Harry with whom he bears more than a passing resemblance. Throughout this time, she remained hugely popular with some elements of British society. At the time of her death she was romantically involved with a muslim playboy the son of a controversial and untrusted, but very rich, business tycoon, some rumours say that she was carrying his child and were about to announce their engagement. The prospect of the mother of the future king converting to Islam and the royal princes having muslim half brothers and sisters must have been appalling to parts of the establishment.</p>

<p>And then she died in an unseen car accident, hit in a tunnel by another car which has never been traced in circumstances which remain murky. I&#39;m not saying I believe she was definitely bumped off, but the evidence must give pause for thought and which along with my earlier ominously accurate prediction certainly gave me a jolt.</p>

They are hurrying the Palestinians demise as quickly and efficiently as they can get away with in front of the complacent world community. They are doing what the Nazi&#39;s have done to them (over 50 years ago however they continue to play victim to) in a slower and more methodical manner. Whenever the issue is raised in front of the UN,  they receive condemnation from the entire world community other than from its pawn, the USA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really, it&#39;s common sense, without going into any specific conspiracy theories, it is absolutely conceivable that a small minority of influential people secretely cohort to conceive a plot to gain power in some shape or form. This isn&#39;t only conceivable, it has happened. What else is organized religion if not a conspiracy to keep as many people as possible under control? That&#39;s only one example, the Third Reich, the federal reserve, the gulf of tonkin, conspiracies are real and have happened and continue to happen to this day. Not necessarily lizardmen and illuminati, but banks, government, corporations, think tanks are constantly conspiring, it frankly is naive to believe otherwise. Everyone and every organization has an agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was about 16 or 17 (1992-ish), my friend&#39;s dad gave me a copy of a new book he had just finished reading. He had kind of a blank look in his eyes, compared to usual, and he hung on to it as he handed it to me.</p>

<p>&quot;This book will ruin your life,&quot; he tells me with a grin. &quot;It ruined mine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It can&#39;t be that bad,&quot; I said. &quot;Let me check it out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don&#39;t want to know the kind of shit that&#39;s in this book,&quot; he says. &quot;Even if only a tenth of it is true... Just go smoke a joint or something, forget you ever saw it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come on - let go!&quot;</p>

<p>A little mock tug-of-war goes on for a few long seconds.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you...&quot;</p>

<p>That book was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Behold-Horse-Milton-William-Cooper/dp/0929385225">Behold a Pale Horse</a> by the late Bill Cooper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I realized that everything was a lie.&quot;  </p>

<p>I visited the same places you did, just a couple of years ago.  Went through the same checkpoints in the Palestinian Authority areas, rode in Palestinian vehicles etc. Also walked the streets of Bethlehem and Ramallah as well as the old Hebron market as well as several others.  Fresh food, especially produce and fruits, were plentiful.  I also saw well stocked stores many new buildings, coffee shops as well as banks, etc. I also ate at several places in the PA where the food was every bit as good as anything I had in Israel, and bought cookies and sweets produced in Ramallah.  These were not &quot;tourist&quot; places as, except for Bethlehem, there are not too many tourists visiting the PA these days.  </p>

<p>I also visited a refugee camp and heard a speaker tell me that Palestinians would never accept Israel within any borders and that only a single state was acceptable.  They wanted no part of any &quot;two state&quot; solution, which offers some insignt into why they rejected the Clinton parameters in 2001.  What I saw and heard was that, for many Palestinians, the conflict is not about the West Bank, Gaza or 1967 lines, but about 1948 and the need to reverse its result.  I will let each Redditer judge for the themselves the validity of these opinions.  I am only describing what I saw and heard.</p>

<p>What I did not see was levels of poverty that I saw in parts of Mexico and other places I have visited.  I surely saw frustration at long some of the checkpoints, yet I also did not see was much fear of the Israeli soldiers manning them. In fact, I heard several, waiting in line, curse Israel in English loud enough for all soldiers to hear.   I have no doubt that some cannot get the medical treatment they need due to checkpoints.  On the other hand, I saw Palestinians coming and going from the Gaza for medical treatment in Israel.  They entered through the only crossing left.  Yes, it used to be better there.  When I was last in the region--twenty years before, one saw huge numbers of cars and trucks with Gaza license plates and often heavy traffic moved both ways.  Here too, one needs to look at the why as well as the what. Again, this was not tourist area and we were, in fact, kicked out after about ten min&#39;s or so. </p>

<p>I like to see the best in people, especially the good people of the Reddit community. So I will assume that these making comparisions to the Nazis, the Warsaw Ghetto or the death camps are simply not well informed of historical or current facts, and not doing so out of less innocent motives.  What I am sure of is that these comparisons are disrespectful to the victims of the holocaust and do absolutley nothing to help the Palestinians.</p>

<p>Another difference from my experience at that of #161....I have visited these areas three times over 40 years and can make comparisions over time.  What I saw on my last trip in terms of streets, buildings, food, clothing was far, far better than what I saw the previous two times I was there--1970&#39;s and 1990&#39;s.  And, bear in mind, the Palestinians I went through the PA with on this last occasion had every reason to want me to see see the situation &quot;with the bark off&quot; as they say.</p>

<p>Back to the wall for a moment.  Does #161....have other walls to compare it to?   Has he been to portions of the wall along the US-Mexican border.  How about other places in the mideast? 
To be clear--anyone who goes to Israel and the PA will see there is a political problem and that a compromise would benefit all involved.  I also saw that a solution will involve painful compromises for both sides and that neither side has come to full grasp that yet.</p>

<p>Travel is a great way to experience and learn.  To truly understand, however, one needs to learn a bit of history beforehand. Then one can better judge what is, or is not, a consipracy or a lie--assuming truth and insight are really, in fact, what they are after.</p>

<p>Here you are, and it&#39;s forty years later, and the man is grown, maybe he married, maybe not, but what has defined his entire life, his essence, his being, is a moment of cruelty and indifference from someone who doesn&#39;t consider him a human being. He&#39;s likely bitter, sad, and to whatever degree frustrated by life, feeling that the chance to really shine, to truly contribute and make a difference, to have any kind of meaning or control in his own life was snatched from him. To feel his spirit shackled by hate and despair, to hate life and all those in it. To turn from anything positive, since what positivity has he seen in his life?</p>

<p>And why? Because of you.</p>

<p>And because I&#39;m an American and I make Israel possible with my political indifference and apathy, because of me, too.</p>

<p>I think actually more because of you than me.  I was there, I dont know if you were or were not, but I would suggest you ask yourself what responsibilty the guy without the arm, and those that led him, had for what happened.  It takes two to tango.  If you really cared about him, you would encourage him to think about constructive solutions---like the Clinton Parameters his leadership walked away from.  Encouraging and enabling him to believe that Israel will be eliminated does him no good.  If that is your choice, your apathy is more constructive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee3bld4lTG0">This radio interview</a>. The sound of genuine fear in the caller&#39;s voice is just startling. Then the radio station&#39;s own satellite equipment suddenly shuts down when the caller is about to continue the call.</p>

<p>The original caller then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCfxC88AUT0">allegedly rings back a few weeks later</a> to explain it was all a hoax. As the comments and video suggest, what hoax caller rings back to explain it was a joke and apologise? Also, how can you explain the radio equipment cutting out at the right moment in the original interview? I&#39;m not sure whether the guy in the follow-up is the original caller or not, but his voice sounds different, still sounds nervous and I think he even gets caught out in his lie in the video. There&#39;s just too much weird and unexplained things around these interviews that you can&#39;t immediately dismiss it as a hoax. </p>

<p>I truly believe something was going to get out in the original interview that somebody else didn&#39;t want to know and cut the cord before it could.</p>

<p>I think it is a fantastic metaphor to describe people who knowingly adopt &quot;the beast&quot;, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli">Machiavelli</a> put it.</p>

<p>Here are some words that describe metaphorical &quot;Shapeshifting&quot; or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machiavellianism">Machiavellianism</a> </p>

<p>&quot;Therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. And I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with a mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able and know how to change to the opposite.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_brain">Triune Brain model</a> where each part of the brain is responsible for different behaviors. </p>

<p>&quot;MacLean proposed that the reptilian complex was responsible for species-typical instinctual behaviors involved in <em>aggression, dominance, territoriality, and ritual displays</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>Carl Sagan had some interesting things to say about &quot;reptilians&quot; based on the Triune model.</p>

<p>&quot;The global balance of terror is a very delicate balance. It depends on things not going wrong, on mistakes not being made, on the reptilian passions not being seriously aroused.&quot;  from Cosmos.</p>

Instead of watching the news and taking it at face value, I started to question what else was at stake when these events were taking place. I wanted to know more about the stuff that wasn&#39;t being said and eventually realized that none of my concerns were truly ever being discussed and even dismissed on a regular basis. It made me question more and I became a Conspiracy Theorist. I don&#39;t believe in the Lizards taking over the world but I do believe that our US government is in no way controlling the policies. I believe that 9/11 was an inside job and I believe that we are on a path to repeat the actions of the 1940&#39;s all over again. Different country, different leader figure. My greatest fear is that Hitler was merely a puppet for someone bigger who left WW2 unscathed and unknown and is merely repeating the process over again.</p>

It continued after I wondered more about the free masons, and why there was so much wealth, political influence, and everything else behind it. The masonic lodge in my city never had anyone going in or out of it... how could they afford to keep it open? Better yet, how did they have all this without seeming to have visible members?</p>

<p>Today I usually try to look for prevailing conspiracy theories when I believe I&#39;m being fed disinformation. I&#39;m never really satisfied until I have a good picture or explanation in my mind of anything that happens that is consequential.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Boston.
Was working nights and following it all day. So many inconsistencies forced me to contemplate why something like that would be staged. I understood there was means and opportunity, and in my search for a motive I came across historical accounts of things that are common knowledge here but boggle the mind of the unaware... Like I was then. There is no lack of motive.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gone thru denial, anger, and depression since then but I accept it now and I am very positive at this point. My family used to think I had fallen for some scam, but most are receptive to the possibility of something major going on behind the scenes now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My 9th grade forensics class.</p>

<p>We had three long sections about three large cases/examples of murder in a semester. Each one we were to draw our own conclusions and turn in our evidence for why we came to that conclusion for our grade.</p>

<p>The way he conducted the class was in a matter of only the proof that exist. Explaining the coloring of evidence by media, ways to see the answer through the bigger picture and why the media may have steer it in a certain direction.</p>

<p>The third and last topic we did was the JFK assassination. He showed us most of the media outlets explanations, the shooting video, the media reportings immediatly after then he asked us to do backgrounds on the people involved. What led up to their assassinations, and what we thought the motives behind them were.</p>

<p>At which point, I was shocked that something that seemed so abruptly visible for anyone to see if they only decide to put a little effort into reading into something that is put right in your face. I was disillusioned for sometime after, trying to get my mind back into the thought process that I believed previous to that. I could not go back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I studied my country&#39;s history. Im filipino by the way, some parts was just not right. As I grew up, Ive talked to many people, in school, in parties, online. Ive talked to socialists, communists, religious extremists, some addicted people, couple of wackos along the way. And then one day I decided to get a major in Philosophy. Fast forward today what made me a conspiracy theorist is that when some facts doesnt sound quite right I tend to seek for alternative answers. I guess when you reach the age of reason you just become more and more curious about the shit that has been going on especially in our own countries. What makes me sad is that other people view conspiracy theorists as crazy people who make up things in their head, well I laugh back up them. For me those kinda people will just eat and absorb whatever kinda shit the government and media feed to them. Oh yea Im getting off topic. My answer will be the Philippine Revolution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That goes way back. I&#39;m thinking it was either JFK or aliens. JFK I say because of the insurmountable evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald wasn&#39;t his killer and was conveniently shot before his trial. Aliens because I personally had a night where I woke up in my bed full of dirt and the window wide open... This after a dream where I felt like the house had turned on it&#39;s side and I was mashed against the window, something eventually opened the window and I was being pulled out from under my shoulders and my leg got caught. Very bad bruising the next day also from my leg being stuck in this &quot;dream&quot;.</p>

OWS is back in a smaller way, but was spreading around the US like a wild fire, which was eventually stamped out all at once thanks to the involvement of the DHS. No mention of it from the President, no help, no acknowledgement, just the boot.  </p>

I couldn&#39;t believe our own govt. would kill over 3k of people...and blame it on some guy in the mountanious caves.Not only that, but when WTC 7 &quot;collapsed&quot; but later during the coverage, Silverstein said the words &quot;Blow it&quot;. Because WT7 sustained &quot;severe, irreversible damage&quot;  It got worst as I kept diving into history, about how Osama and the Ladin family had intimate ties w/ the Bush family.  How we funded Osama (Tim Osman- Google it).  in afghanistan, for them (the taliban) to fight Russia.  It goes on and on. From predictable programming in movies (exp.. A long Kiss Goodnight / X-Files).   It just really skull fucked me.  Then the gulf of tonkin, and how the commander of the Ship explained on 60 Minutes, that the US govt told him to report heavy damage to the USS Maddox... This govt isn&#39;t doing it&#39;s duty. They aren&#39;t following from examples our fore fathers left.  Instead they&#39;re selling out, and policing the world, making every country follow their agenda.  There&#39;s a reason why we&#39;re attacking all countries in the middle east.......... ALSO.... WHY CUT 5BILLION DOLLARS IN FOOD STAMPS/ SNAP (ON NOVEMBER 1ST 2013- SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM)..... AND THE NEXT DAY FND ISRAEL OVER 40 BILLION (NOVEMBER 2ND 2013), THATS 10 BILLION MORE THAN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.   BUY YOUR GUNS AND AMMUNITION.... SEED.... ETC.. ETC.... Because Marshall Law and a civil war will ensue soon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11.  I kept hearing &quot;911 was an inside job&quot; so one day I googled it out of absurd curiousity.  To my shock, the evidence tearing down the lies was overwhelming.  Building 7, the cruise missle at the pentagon.  The weird sounding call from flight 93. The missing wreckage at the field and at the pentagon.  The &quot;drill&quot; being conducted THAT DAY.  Rumsfeld speech and the financial investigation that happened RIGHT BEFORE 911.  The pre-war war preparations.  The history of fires and planes bringing down buildings (none before 911).  Larry Silverstein&#39;s insurance and convenient absence from work that day (along with his son and daughter)  Dick Cheyney&#39;s ties to halliburton.  Rumsfeld&#39;s ties to biochemical companies and other military contractors.  The wholesale privatization of our military after 911.  The FUCKING PATRIOT ACT.  The ridiculous circus of government controlled mass media about the whole thing.  The Cia&#39;s un-refuted foundation of Al-Qaeda. Bush&#39;s tyrannical insistence on an unrelated war in a different country as retaliation, and condemnation of anyone who wasn&#39;t on-board.</p>

<p>I could go on.  9/11 opened my eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>America.  America in it&#39;s entirety is one big conspiracy. </p>

<p>I remember about a year ago I kept hearing a lot of &quot;George Carlin is amazing!  He&#39;s the best comedian ever!&quot;  So I looked him up on Youtube and he gave me a good laugh.  I thought it was just hilarious seeing this old guy who was about 70 tell perverted, dark jokes and use words like &quot;motherfucker&quot; and &quot;bullshit.&quot;  And then I watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV1lZMTCqf8">this</a> clip and it changed my life.  I couldn&#39;t believe it.  A scam.  That&#39;s all America is.  A giant scam.  They tell you since you&#39;re born that America is &quot;the freest nation in the world&quot; and you can do whatever you want and be whatever you want to be.  But it&#39;s really quite the opposite.  The education system, the media (at least most of it), the government, the military, the big corporations are all run by the same elite group of people.  You work your entire life thinking that you&#39;re free when you&#39;re really their slave.  Ever since then I&#39;ve been obsessed with researching different government conspiracies.  I wouldn&#39;t call myself a conspiracy theorist, because what&#39;s happening now isn&#39;t a conspiracy.  We know it&#39;s happening.  We&#39;ve done our research.  And the elite will keep enslaving us until we rise up and take back the country.  </p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s called the American dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.&quot;</p>

From there I began seeking out stuff my age. Bigfoot, UFO&#39;s, and BERMUDA triangle stuff. I think pop culture sort of embraced it with Oliver Stones JFK and the X-Files debut.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, are museums dedicated to a specific cause the best place to get critical information?</p>

<p>For instance, I went to the Monterey Aquarium and they have a large section dealing with the sardine fisheries in Monterey Bay.  I was really curious about how WWII effected the fishing industry there, and knew Japanese were &quot;interned,&quot; but the museum barely touches on the treatment of the Japanese.  I had to leave the museum and go to a little plaque in town to find any good information on what happened to the Japanese fisherman during WWII.</p>

<p>The Japanese were put into camps, often made to work, and had their assets and businesses seized from them.  Japanese made up the majority of fisherman in the Monterey Bay before the war but since their boats and businesses were taken from them they no longer predominated.  The U.S. government basically ran the industry by fiat and fishing changed drastically there.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t even have found out about the plaque if I hadn&#39;t asked tough questions of the tour guide and he directed me to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No single conspiracy theory, in fact I find most theories rather dubious. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just that the world is obviously torn between good and evil, and evil has the advantage of being able to destroy everything to get its goal so one up on those guys. </p>

<p>And conspiracies are a natural thing, they do in fact teach them in history class but it&#39;s always part of the past right... even though human minds have changed very little. </p>

<p>So short answer is, no single conspiracy, whether exposed or hypothesis, has turned me into the cynical bastard I am today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me and my friends had the same experience. A kind of epiphany about America. After all studying history, politics and International relations at Uni for three years, we all came to realise that democracy has nothing to do with US foreign policy, and it never did. </p>

<p>Not a conspiracy. But then you start looking at other things, like JFK and 9/11 for example, and suddenly you find the established stories very hard to believe. I&#39;m also one of the &#39;Iraq war generation&#39;, where Tony Blair filled us with similar dross to George Bush in the US. </p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t really trust the media in any form. A lot of that was due to Julian Assange going on TV and explaining that if you searched his name on google, 90% of the articles contained the word rape. This was the day after the story first broke and before he was hiding in embassies. He was getting stitched up over it, because of Wikileaks, pure and simple. Made me think how much free will do we really have.</p>

A few years ago one of my professors asked the class to question it a bit saying that we were just told and automatically accept we landed on the moon. He went on to talk about our lack of technology available and how film cameras wouldn&#39;t be able to function in space. He also said if you look at the actual footage there&#39;s no stars in the background at all which is odd.</p>

<p>I was intrigued when he so researched some conspiracy theories about it, conclusion: I don&#39;t think we landed on the moon on 1969</p>

How much easier would it be to stage a moon landing opposed to actually going to the moon and putting astronaut lives in doing so. </p>

<p>I mean it wasn&#39;t just the first landing on the moon but the first landing <em>as well</em> as first man on the moon.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also kind of weird that Neil Armstrong hardly ever talked about it besides a few quotes. I get someone trying to keep their privacy but still, it seems like a hush up operation~ not a lot of talking= not a lot of questions.. Just an acceptance that okay he went to the moon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cameras are exposed for the surface of the moon. That&#39;s why you don&#39;t see the stars. An imperfect example would be to compare this to exposing for a subject on Earth and getting a &quot;blown out&quot; look in the sky. The blown out areas are the film or sensor being overwhelmed with light. The Moon has the opposite problem. The faint light of the stars wont show up taking fast exposures. And if you still have doubts answer me why the long exposures they took all have stars in them as they should.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a professional photographer and videographer.</p>

<p>Also, what makes a film camera not be able to function in space. A filme camera is simply a mechanism that lifts a shutter so light can cause a chemical reaction on a piece of film. So where does the space part come into play?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I may be mistaken but I think film begins to distort/melt at moderately high temperatures. I can&#39;t remember the exact temperature but when the sun is shining on the moon it reaches near 200 degrees F.. </p>

<p>The footage shows everything well lit so I&#39;m guessing it would&#39;ve been about that temperature. I&#39;m really not sure though. They could&#39;ve covered up the camera/film in protective gear while filming but again the footage is crisp with no glare/tint and I&#39;d assume there would be one if it was filmed through a space helmet kind of deal. </p>

<p>Film is also extremely picky to get a good shot with, something I&#39;m sure you know because you&#39;re a photographer: Everything has to be precise with near perfect lighting-especially back then- to get a good shot. I&#39;d assume the moons lot surface would&#39;ve been overpowering to film, not allowing it to capture shadows/detail. </p>

<p>Again just assumptions. I study film in TV so have learned a little bit about the difficulties of handling film. Even today the film roll can only film about 10 min of footage than have to be changed. I&#39;m not sure how much reel footage there is of the landing but if it&#39;s more than 10 min then changing that would&#39;ve been a bitch.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long comment. I hope I didn&#39;t sound rude with my counter arguments </p>

<p>That being said, the event that started me down the path to questioning what I was being told by mainstream media, was the Marilyn Monroe conspiracy.  I watched some History Channel Special about it several years ago and started researching online...500 websites later, several, several hours later...my mind was blown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the term conspiracy theorist is it&#39;s become a social stigma due to the more outlandish claims, so many who feel some hypothesis have a solid structure, they don&#39;t like referring to themselves using a socially stigmatic term, so many might avoid using it. The fact remains though, if you have suspicions based on facts about a group plotted agenda, you have a conspiracy hypothesis, when you have proven facts &amp; none proven guilty, you have theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in &#39;86-&#39;87 there was the Congressional investigation into the selling of weapons to Iran, via Israel, to fund <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Contra_Affair">death squads in Nicaragua</a>, since the US Congress refused to continue funding it. No one ever pretended to claim it was just Oliver North acting in complete isolation. </p>

<p>Then in 1990 I read the book &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/CIA-CULT-INTELLIGENCE-Victor-Marchetti/dp/0394482395/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1383616940&amp;amp;sr=1-2&amp;amp;keywords=cult+of+intelligence">CIA &amp; THE CULT OF INTELLIGENCE</a>&quot; (there&#39;s also a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/CIA-Cult-Intelligence-Victor-Marchetti/dp/0440203368/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1383616940&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=cult+of+intelligence">1989</a> version). Many people seem to have conspired to prevent much of this data from getting published. Much of the censored material, later allowed by successive court orders, showed classic CYA behavior (cover your ass). All the work of a lone censorship clerk with a fat black marker? Not likely.</p>

<p>In 1991 I noticed a huge media backlash against the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102138/?ref_=nv_sr_1">JFK</a> <strong>BEFORE</strong> it was released. Then I watched it. For reference: Mr X scene <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6dx00_008-garisson-meets-x-1-jfk-7m54s_news">part one</a> and <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=654_1288971975">part two</a>. Lone gunman? Sure. Then I read about <a href="http://www.sonic.net/kryptox/history/covert.htm">fluoride</a>. It was enough to make me learn to love the atom bomb. Then I learned about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Casolaro">Casolaro murder</a>. Holy SH*#!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My dad and I watched WACO live and he had his reservations that he explained to me. But really started it was I remember sitting in 1st period high school freshmen year, and someone had frantically turned the TV on and I watched a plane slam into a tower. I thought &quot;What movie trailer is this?&quot; only to be disturbed instantly it was on the news ... BUT I was even more disturbed when the towers fell the way they did. I may have been a 15 year old freshmen, but I knew from watching 90&#39;s TV show on demolition, that only demolition ops look that clean and precise ESPECIALLY on a tower of that immense height. The stories really raised my eyebrow, and a few years later I ran across someone that felt the same suspicion that also had a website for more information from experts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to go to stock market seminars with my dad.  One of these seminars was fairly small and the guy started talking about the FED and Creature from Jekyll Island.  I had this inkling that he was talking about stuff that you wouldn&#39;t normally ever hear in mainstream financial discussions.  I was furiously writing notes, books, authors.  I needed more.  Then he said something about Fibonacci sequences which will stick in my head forever.  That the Golden Ratio, when applied to technical analysis in the stock market can sometimes yield accurate predictions.  He then proceeds to tell us that back in the late 90s he went to a training session in which they were starting to program stock software with such algorithms.  He told us that the man who taught him was showing a predictive market movement of the NASDAQ 100 Trust commonly known as the QQQQ (kews).  In proportion with the Fibonacci sequence it predicted that the market was going to steadily decline until it would eventually bottom out in mid September 2001.  He said he didn&#39;t believe it at the time but sure enough, he became a believer.  </p>

<p>That and the interview with Aaron Russo in which he says his conversations with Nicholas Rockefeller in which he told him that there was going to be a massive event which we would use as a catalyst to go into the middle east and harness oil pipelines.  These are two of the many things which validated a lot of my suspicions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iran-Contra.  I was a very patriotic young boy, sort of a liberal Republican type.  I was pro-drug war and pro-war in general.  I really truly believed that &#39;MURICA was the greatest country on earth, that our government not only protected our freedoms, but went around the world giving freedom to other people.  Then I learned that my ultimate &#39;MURICAN HERO, President Ronald Reagan and his cronies had been selling weapons to Iran- whom I thought of as the penultimate evil next to the wicked commies in Russia- in order to fund terrorists in Central America.  This shook my faith in the goodness of &#39;MURICA, but not so much as when good ol&#39; Ollie North got up on the stand, wrapped himself in the &#39;MURICAN flag, and cried that he only did what he did out of his patriotic duty and love of country.  And most everyone seemed to ACCEPT that!  That was what started it all. </p>

<p>Over the following years I started to read more and more of our history, the history that they don&#39;t teach you in the public indoctrination facilities.  About the genocide of Native Americans, and the nasty, repulsive, cowardly things &#39;MURICA did to them.  About the Philippines, and the tortures and murders there.  About Vietnam.  And Korea. And my &quot;patriotism&quot; started to crack, doubts began to seep in.  I was starting to learn that everything I&#39;d believed about &#39;MURICA was a lie.</p>

<p>Even so, I was still quite patriotic, and when the first Gulf War started, I was all for it.  I STILL believed that we were doing it to free Kuwaitis and protect the freedom of the Saudis.  I was 14 at the time, and I desperately wished I were old enough to go fight over there.  I still, at this point, planned on joining the military after HS then becoming a cop after the military.  </p>

<p>The the Rodney King trial happened.  Much like Iran/Contra it wasn&#39;t the beating itself that got to me, I understood the whole &quot;bad apple&quot; concept.  It was the reaction, once the shocking, horrifying videotape came out, of so many people, especially those in government, actually DEFENDING those cowardly, gang-banging pieces of human garbage.  I could not believe what I was hearing!  And then, somehow, they were found innocent!  I could not believe this was happening in &#39;MURICA, the land of the FREE, the land where cops and government PROTECT the people.</p>

<p>Over the next few years I got into smoking weed, and started reading High Times, which was filled with stories of US government atrocities at home and abroad, about the awful fascist nature of the federal government.  I started to learn about how the War on (some)Drugs that I had once wholeheartedly supported was nothing more than a grab for power and wealth based on lies, racism, and distortions of truth. Then WACO happened.  Then the Taliban started making headlines, and I learned how the US government had been trying to court them to allow a US oil company to build a pipeline through Afghanistan, human rights be damned.  I read more un-PC history, and learned about FDR&#39;s plot to provoke a Japanese attack so he could get us into ww2, as well as how Japan wanted to negotiate for peace but was rebuffed so Truman could have an excuse to launch nuclear terrorist attacks on two Japanese cities.  And so on and so forth.</p>

<p>And so, by the time 9-11 happened, I was no longer the flag-waving, cop-hugging, troop-supporting patriot I had once been.  There was no longer any evil that I could not imagine our Dear Leaders stooping to, if they thought they could get away with it.  In fact, a couple days after the initial shock of the attacks wore off, I started to wonder about them, and how damned <em>convenient</em> they were for the warmongering neocons in the Bush administration.</p>

<p>So, really, it wasn&#39;t one thing, it was a process.  But it was definitely the Iran/Contra conspiracy that set it all off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dont recall when it actually started, at a young age I was always intrigued in the intricacies of how things actually worked, and I always questioned what I was told. Couple of things stand out while growing up, namely I was always fascinated by George Carlin and saw him as a role model. Then there is the movie Godfather, where the main character says something in part 3 that always stuck out to me: &quot;All my life I was trying to get up in society... where everything is legal, but the higher I go the more crooked it becomes.&quot;</p>

<p>I see conspiracy theories as just another source of information and like all information (these days) it becomes necessary to filter relatively factual data from the abundance of falsified data (conjecture) in order to form a rational assessment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive alway been a person who tries to find underlying truth in everything. Starting from the 3rd grade and being sent to a catholic school. Studying the bible turned me into a agnostic then a atheist. Ever since then i cant just take someone or somethings word for it. I mus search. 9/11 is what made me start questioning the motives of our government and everything they do. Its unbelievable what they do to &quot;protect our freedom&quot;. And really after 9/11 ive felt like we cannot continue on trying to believe in this system of government that is ruled by a few people with their own agenda. Thats just my 2 cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure if this is a conspiracy, but I feel like I need to state it.
I am not sure if I could say that it I realized it at that moment, but that Israel post made me think of something. The moment I had was when I realized the true divisions which existed in terms of wealth, and how despite numerous pundits speaking about &quot;progress,&quot; I realized how unfair things are for so many in the world.</p>

<p>A few years ago I went to a conference in Africa in which very, very important people were in attendance. The conference lasted from the first day we got there until the last so there wasn&#39;t much room to do anything but talk about climate change, economics, the whole spiel. Somehow or another I was able to get out of the usual dialogues and actually go visit some of the places outside of the list of places they told us that would be fun to go to. Thus far in my trip I had saw the beautiful side of the country, skyscrapers, beautiful malls, stores which I had never even seen inside the United States with price tags for commodities which I couldn&#39;t even afford with my American dollar. </p>

<p>So I eventually was able to go to somewhere they probably didn&#39;t want us to view. I came across a village that extended for miles and I was able to get a tour guide to show me around. The entire time children were following me, and at numerous instances they would try to hold my hand or see if I would give them some cash. He took me inside some of the houses, which a family of 5 or more would live in, and it would be made out of tin foil, and if not that straw. It was the size of a small bathroom.</p>

<p>Some other tourists who I assumed were from another group were taking pictures with the kids and made sure they smiled with them. I didn&#39;t take pictures. As I was about to get in my car with my driver, a horde of children rushed up to me and begged me to buy them some food. I didn&#39;t bring a lot of money with me, but I had enough for one bag of cheetos. Over 50 children immediately attacked me, I was shocked how smiling children transformed in an instant and pushed the smaller ones out of the way, who began to cry, and started tearing me apart to get the cheetos. I eventually let go of them and they chased after the one who was able to get the food. In that moment, I was shaken to my core.</p>

<p>7 hours later I received a request by one of the Heads of State that was attending the conference if I would have dinner with him and some of his friends. Of course I accepted, and we have a 9 course dinner with lobster, swordfish, delicious red wine, and other delicacies which to this day still tingle my taste buds. I smiled and continued the conversations with this man, who I harbored personal doubts about his character, which turned out to be true, and thought of how in a mere 7 hours I had come from destitution to a land of milk and honey.</p>

<p>I left that night, back to my lavish hotel and left a few days later. In first class I sat there thinking. And in that moment I realized that despite comments to the contrary, and numerous instances of people saying the world is getting better for everyone, I finally understood that there truly are few winners and many losers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The something of <a href="http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Nick_Berg_conspiracy_theories">Nick Berg.</a></p>

<p>There are jumps in the video, including a discontinuity of over 11 hours in the video&#39;s time-stamp from 2:44:12 to 13:45:47 just after the knife is drawn.
Cutting a person&#39;s artery in the neck while the heart is pumping results in the release of large amounts of blood. (Consider, for example, how much blood there was at the Nicole Simpson scene.) Lack of bleeding, and lack of movement following a video jump, suggest that the decapitation of a living person did not occur. Medical experts interviewed by the Asia Times concurred [2], also adding that a person decapitated would have their body strongly shaking and jerking in response to the act.
The man said to be Nick Berg wears an orange prison jumpsuit that seems identical to the jumpsuits worn by the hostages held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, by the United States. None of the recently kidnapped hostages in Iraq wore any uniform outfits whatsoever
The unidentified masked men in the video appear to be standing at parade rest, or more loosely in a Western-style posture.
The unidentified masked men in the video have light-coloured skin and a high body mass by Arab standards.
One of the unidentified masked men in the video is pudgy and wears very clean tennis shoes. This will not be the case with an Al-Qaida fighter.
At least three of unidentified masked men in the video have Israeli Uzi ammunition clips. </p>

<p>There were many things wrong with this psyop, but what initially got me curious was the Corporate Media telling me they had seen the clip, but that it was just too horrible for us peons to see.  Upon searching for the clip, I first came across Infowars, and love them or hate them, but they did a pretty good job debunking the decapitation video.    </p>

If there is a direct financial gain at the root of a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; it is usually a very plausible one. If you can&#39;t point to anyone profiting from it, it usually sounds much less possible. I don&#39;t believe 9/11 was planned, I believe it was capitalized on. I believe most wars and global conflict are manufactured. I believe that the NSA isn&#39;t trying to do anything particularly insidious, I believe that they are just genuinely naive people robotically trying to do their job as well as they can at the urging of our government, who are in turn prodded to do so by the lobbyists who want to expand government contracts in that sector. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When 9/11 first happened, I was convinced Osama Bin Laden was guilty.  I believed America was complacent and the accused/dead terrorist exploited our complacency.  Having recently left the USMC, I was ready to go fight for my country.  I was so certain our country was justified in taking the war to the terrorist and anyone that believed otherwise was UN-American.  Then my roommate (who I thought was becoming a little too liberal) showed me a video that totally blew my mind.  It took a few years but I&#39;ve become somewhat of a free thinker, meaning, I take ALL NEWS with a grain of salt.  Following my gut, when Osama Bin Laden was &quot;killed&quot; I didn&#39;t feel like justice was done.  I felt as if &quot;a loose end&quot; was tied up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I left for Iraq as a born again Christian.  While I was there I regularly volunteered for the most dangerous possible missions because if someone had to do them then it might as well be someone that was sure he was going to heaven.  After seeing just how evil men can truly be (on both sides) I returned as a grizzled veteran agnostic.  When I came to the realization that a good chunk of what has been drilled in your head since birth was a lie, I realized that nothing was really sacred.  Everything must be looked at from a logical perspective.  </p>

<p>I think I differ from most people on this forum though since I accept the fact that the simplest and most likely explanation for someone shooting up a naval yard is probably simply that he was mentally unstable, and it probably isn&#39;t a multi national conspiracy...it could be, but I tend to accept the simplest explanation.  </p>

<p>However, sometimes the simplest explanation for a UFO sighting is that there was a flying object in the sky that no human has ever seen before.  Sometimes the simplest explanation of why a CEO in charge of a company being fined 1.2B for insider trading isn&#39;t being charged in criminal courts is because lawmakers &amp; and law enforcement are corrupt.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The concepts of social engineering, collective psychology, and mass manipulation. </p>

<p>Started thinking one night in my mid twenties about how the elite using their knowledge of modern psychology and vast control of resources could more easily and subtly condition the average citizen into serving their interests. </p>

<p>Started out by looking at the work of Edward Bernays, Josef Mengele, Joseph Goebbels, and Hermann Goering. Then ended up coming across info on how organizations like the Rand Corp, the CIA, and the Tavistock institute come up with policies and implement them based on the premise of controlling people and shaping public opinion. It scared the living shit out of me, I had a nervous breakdown when I realized that this shit was real and not just a wacky idea I made up. Made me realize that most people including myself were heavily brainwashed by corporate and military propaganda, that there were men behind the curtain scientifically controlling us like rats in an experiment. It was terrifying to realize they know everything about us and what makes us tick, and how to get us to behave just by pushing a couple emotional and chemical buttons they can get us to react however they want.</p>

<p>When I think about this, it makes me lose hope for the future. That the modern independent thinker is vastly out-manned and intellectually outgunned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>More than anything, my overwhelming hatred of authority. That&#39;s been around since i was a kid though. No idea why. Probably father issues. </p>

<p>Then I watched Fight Club, and realised why i felt so fucking lost. Then i watched some random video of Fight Club on Youtube, and someone commented that anyone who likes it should watch Zeitgeist. So i did. And then that&#39;s pretty much it - after that my main focus, research wise, was 9/11. Zeitgeist did a great job of pointing me in the right direction when it came to the subjects covered in those films. I don&#39;t necessarily agree with everything that is said, and i think the 9/11 section wasn&#39;t particularly well researched looking back, but the overarching point of &quot;Shit&#39;s fucked, and we need to change it&quot; got through very well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m now at the point where i hardly give a shit any more. I can&#39;t stress myself with it. If/when the time comes, i&#39;m sure we&#39;ll all have a part to play in changing things, but for now, i just don&#39;t care. All i do now is remember that watching the news doesn&#39;t mean you know what&#39;s going on in the world, it means you know what they want you to think is going on in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TWA Flight 800. That story never sat well with me. Then the 9/11 attacks were five years later that story was even less cohesive. However, I am inclined to believe that all of the &#39;conspiracy&#39; stories we get, from Flight 800 to 9/11 to Newtown to whatever news story is reported on, are part of a larger pictures. It&#39;s as if no one is stupid enough to think the public would swallow such debatable facts -- but there are people smart enough to realize that there is something to gain by creating a culture of distrust, fear and suspicion. </p>

Something profane and not so nefarious. Nobody believed me when I showed them even the reports in <em>our</em> journals, magazines and papers. It showed me that they* can pull off anything that is opaque enough to the public. </p>

<p>* anybody, really</p>

<p>Then Tonking incident, Liberty incident,  various scandals concerning money laundering. At some point I learned about the other &quot;reasons for war&quot; like the assault on the radio tower, Lusitania, lousy telegrams. And Napoleon could <em>somehow</em> just come a second time and wage war, somehow.  Funny enough, they told us in school about most of that and how it was a ruse, but the effect was that any forthcoming contemporary reason made me alert. But somehow again, most didn&#39;t click or didn&#39;t care enough to repel the world view of the GIMME establishment. Sad. But that made me thinking too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we all know global warming is real and those people who try to deny it can&#39;t see it in their faces.  I really believed global warming; it made sense, there was so much proof, it was so hard to deny.  I want to be an accountant, so I got into economics and all of the money stuff.  It changed the way I looked at things; good change.  Then I saw how much money people are making out of global warming.  That was the turning point, it was like a flip of a switch, from &quot;I need to care more about the planet.&quot; to, &quot;I need to read more, much more.&quot;</p>

<p>Admittedly, it is odd to call myself a conspiracy theories, since I haven&#39;t come up with any theories.  I simply read what is in conspiracy threads and read their sources.  Just kinda got that label for hanging out with conspiracy theorists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mine was the secrecy around UFOs which always fascinated my since I was a child. I started to listen to Art Bell on Coast to Coast and Jim Marrs was on the program, so I eventually got to read Alien Agenda and it concluded with secret societies behind the secrecy of UFOs, which let me to Ruled by Secrecy. And, that had many references from David Icke in there which led me to Only the Truth shall set you Free and the rest is history regarding conspiracy. I still believe the UFO phenomenon is behind the national security state we have been living in since the national security act of 1947 (Roswell). The corporate elite have been back engineering alien technology for profit and creating a world controlled by a few in the know...essentially a breakaway civilization (thank you Richard Dolan) behind a wall of secrecy financed by consumption and consumers of the technology that they allow us to have and technology they use to quell dissent through war and spying; guaranteeing that none would EVER finding out about the &quot;ultimate conspiracy&quot; of the breakaway civilization. Great question and it was fun to answer :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think being an awkward kid was what turned me into a bit of a conspiracy theorist.  People tend to want to identify as being part of a group, and when there&#39;s an awkward kid around they tend to pick on him or her because being a part of the &#39;in&#39; crowd makes them feel like they&#39;re a part of something.  Being on the other side of this dynamic can really show you some interesting things about group psychology.  </p>

<p>People in power seem to tend to insulate themselves and develop an us-vs.-them mentality in my experience.  The underlings don&#39;t necessarily need to know the details of how they get things done, or even the real reasons behind why the things they&#39;re doing need doing, they just need not to get in the way of those things getting done.  The specific methods by which problem individuals are kept out of the way aren&#39;t particularly important.  </p>

<p>Even in the groups that I&#39;ve been a part of, we (myself included) will usually tend to find some &#39;other&#39; group to think of as being &#39;lesser&#39; or even just &#39;otherly&#39;.  The feeling of being similar to our peers, combined with the feeling of togetherness that comes with unification against the &#39;others&#39; makes us feel pride in being a part of our group&#39;s identity.  </p>

<p>While this happens, I always seem to consciously recognize this, while simultaneously reveling in the very human impulse to take pride in my &#39;in&#39;ness when compared to a group of people that are &#39;out&#39;.  I think that thinking about large organizations with powerful people at the top from this perspective can make it seem obvious that conspiracies would tend to form at relatively higher frequencies than people generally seem to expect.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in 2nd grade around august maybe july of 2001. in 2nd grade it wasn&#39;t too uncommon to have someone come in and read the class a story. the lady that came in was an older lady probably late 60&#39;s early 70&#39;s she had just finished reading us a story in one of those over sized books teachers used to teach little kids and the teacher started packing up for us to go to recess she had us line up in alphabetical order as teachers used to do and most of the class was already out of the door. with the last name of Sveum i was generally in the back of the line with maybe two or three other kids behind me. well anyways, nearly everyone was out of the door when we heard the old lady that came to read us the story start crying hysterically. one of the other kids yelled for the teacher who was already out of the door when the old lady started in screaming &quot; the towers! the towers! a plane hit the twin towers! how could they do this to us! she fell to her knees and started groaning and making indistinguishable noises. i think the teacher had called 911 at this point.pretty soon a substitute or another teacher took us to recess. i remember is seeing the fire trucks and an ambulance at the front of the school.... there is more to this story but it is even more unbelievable </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Boston bombing. I was a new redditor at the time and the night of the shootout, before it was a shootout, when the campus officer had been murdered, the very first link on the front page of reddit was a link to a live stream of the Boston police radio. I listened to the scanner for hours. I heard the shootout, I even heard when they made the connection of that shooting / carjacking to the Boston bombers, it was more thrilling than any action movie or thriller movie I could recall. Unfortunately I had work the next morning so I had to go to sleep. I woke up the next morning and the names of the suspects had changed. One of the ones previously was a missing student from Brown who was thought to have been associated with something like this when he first went missing. Yes I am aware that the names were &quot;Falsely reported&quot; but the more time I spent on the sub the more awake I was. The whole story was breaking in real time and they could not control it if it happened like that all time. Someone posted something on here saying &quot;What would happen if we didn&#39;t have the internet&quot;, well you&#39;re living in it. One of my facebook friends went on a facebook tirade one night about how much he hated the cops because they were always stopped everywhere watching him (to his defense, in our city the cops have nothing to do so they are literally neighborhood watch), the next day the cops came to his house and detained him because he allegedly stole a family members mail. They were not able to identify which family member it was or what piece of mail that it was. After a few hours, they let him go and reminded him to watch what he says amongst other things. This country is a joke. It&#39;s set up for anyone with the last name Baum, Stein, Berg to be treated better than everyone else. It&#39;s fascism at its finest. Except instead of the Aryan race, it is the Jewish race. I also feel that everyone behind the curtain know the secret of life and are using it to exploit the masses for profit. I wish I had a glimpse of that knowledge for my own good, I wish everyone did. 
EDIT TL;DR The Boston bombing was the first peek behind the curtain for me (9/11 was always attributed to the Bush administration in my book) and behind that curtain I have found that Israel somehow controls the US. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11. I&#39;ve seen a plenty of videos of buildings collapsing by controlled demolition. The twin towers by my own conclusion was a controlled demo. They (official report)say the jet fuel is what melted the steel beams causing it to collapse but jet fuel doesn&#39;t burn hot enough to melt steel. Also building seven. I never knew about building 7 until recently. Somehow that building collapsed do to your basic office fire. There is even video of it and the gov. defended the statement that it was just an office fire but later admitted the building dropped at free fall. My guess it that the plane that went down in PA was meant for building 7 and since it was already set to blow they destroyed it. </p>

<p>That, and the related World Trade building that was OBVIOUSLY demolished by carefully placed explosives at the same time as the towers fell.

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy theories and wing nuts are simply more entertaining than Hollywood or mainstream media are right now.</p>

<p>No but seriously, I guess the Holocaust was the first major conspiracy that made me start questioning institutionalized authority. That or the vietnam war. Or the Salem witch hunts. I don&#39;t quite remember which of the three came first, but these are the ones I heard most of when I was a kid. It may actually be the witch hunts since it&#39;s something younger kids talked about when I was growing, a spooky tale, so I may have been 8 or 10 yrs old when I first heard of the witch trials, whereas Vietnam and the Holocaust were things I learned about as a teenager.</p>

<p>Edit: My own personal conspiracy story was probably the first one. But it&#39;s tedious and boring. So nevermind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was an unbelievable amount of coincidences regarding that day.  To name a few:  </p>

<ul>
<li>The FAA&#39;s lack of communication with other agencies, even after the first plane hit the tower.<br/></li>
<li>Military air bases along the east coast were all anticipating a training exercise on the morning of 9/11, which is the apparent reason that they took so long to scramble intercept fighters, even after apparent orders had been given.<br/></li>
<li>Despite what the Bush Administration parroted, they HAD been made aware at least a month prior that bin Laden was interested in hijacking planes for an attack.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>So, to answer your question:  No, I don&#39;t <em>really</em> believe that hundreds of people in our government all knowingly conspired to have this happen.  I do, however, believe that a select few conspired to allow <em>someone(s)</em> such a window of opportunity (whether it be that the US allowed al-Qaeda agents to commit this horrendous act in the same suspicious vein as the attack on  Pearl Harbor; or worse, that it was a false-flag).  </p>

<p>And as long as I&#39;m answering questions, CIC = Commander in Chief</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then where do you stop?</p>

<p>If we&#39;re comparing governments to the NAZIs we might want to call recent NSA activity &#39;Gestapo-esqe&#39;, we may draw similarities between NAZI indoctrination of children and religiously-informed bigotry in Saudi schools, we may say that Islamic gangs in Britain bear resemblance to the brown-shirts.</p>

<p>Godwin&#39;s law perhaps doesn&#39;t apply here, but there is a reason why it is often argued that when said law is invoked the thread should draw to a close. It is not really a valid form criticism or argument, it is an emotive hyperbole designed to pre-emptively quash any disagreement. </p>

<p>I find that Godwin&#39;s Law is invoked more regularly on the subject of Israel than any other, on both sides of the argument, and there can be no mistake that this is directly relating to the role the holocaust in the establishment of the country. </p>

<p>Frankly I find it repulsive and wholly insensitive to those that lived through the holocaust, and Jewish people who are affected by it. </p>

I like the greens and I&#39;m not even an environmentalist, it doesn&#39;t inform my politics at all, I am more interested in foreign affairs. I like the greens because they represent something outside the usual political power structures that are defined by and represent the stinking rich, they are people who care about more than just power. They care about the world around us. I would love to see someone like Jill Stein beat the republicans and democrats in an election as a protest vote even because I honestly believe she is a good human being and you could do with one of those in charge showing the world a more humane side to America that represents the core of America. You are good people led by a bunch of blockheads running a very corrupt democracy that puts the needs of the rich first. Its time for change imho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was originally making an ironic comment that referenced the US. </p>

<p>But since you asked-
Reconstruction is a bad example if you were black, a good example if you were white. It lasted for about a decade after the US civil war, and was essentially a program where white northerners ran the former confederacy via military occupation.</p>

<p>The reason why I said that Reconstruction was a bad example if you are black is that Reconstruction era governments elected a lot of African Americans and pushed hard for enfranchisement of all Freedmen. </p>

<p>Post reconstruction is closer to how Israel controls the WB and Gaza. There was a presidential election in 1876 that was similar to 2000- One guy won the popular vote (democrat) and another won the Electoral College (republican). The compromise was that the republican from the north would be president, but Reconstruction had to end so that the south could be allowed to run itself (and institutionalize racism). Overnight the KKK showed up, Jim Crow laws were passed, and separate but equal was the law of the land, de facto <em>and</em> de jure. </p>

<p>There was racism before Reconstruction ended (of course), but the southern governments literally decided to disenfranchise human beings <em>after we, as a species, had mostly agreed that people shouldn&#39;t be allowed to own people.</em> This is what makes Jim Crow particularly messed up. The American Civil War was fought over slavery, but the losing side was allowed to take freedom away from people after they were just freed, then they took pride in it and called it tradition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OOC, can you provide specific examples of how people were treated in the south during reconstruction? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends what race you were...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I may be mistaken but I think film begins to distort/melt at moderately high temperatures. I can&#39;t remember the exact temperature but when the sun is shining on the moon it reaches near 200 degrees F.. </p>

<p>The footage shows everything well lit so I&#39;m guessing it would&#39;ve been about that temperature. I&#39;m really not sure though. They could&#39;ve covered up the camera/film in protective gear while filming but again the footage is crisp with no glare/tint and I&#39;d assume there would be one if it was filmed through a space helmet kind of deal. </p>

<p>Film is also extremely picky to get a good shot with, something I&#39;m sure you know because you&#39;re a photographer: Everything has to be precise with near perfect lighting-especially back then- to get a good shot. I&#39;d assume the moons lot surface would&#39;ve been overpowering to film, not allowing it to capture shadows/detail. </p>

<p>Again just assumptions. I study film in TV so have learned a little bit about the difficulties of handling film. Even today the film roll can only film about 10 min of footage than have to be changed. I&#39;m not sure how much reel footage there is of the landing but if it&#39;s more than 10 min then changing that would&#39;ve been a bitch.</p>

What is Palestine? Exactly. There was never Palestinian sovereignty or even a nation until Israel came along, up until then, they saw themselves as pan-Arabs. But Most Arab nations who joined the war wanted to take the territory for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with you 100% until you look at the number of people that tried to help, starting at the FAA level, but were unable to due to military exercises that were replicating a very  similar scenario. When the biggest blinder is not real information, but a war game that just would not end, there is much more room for conspiracy being true. There are a number of individuals that describe the events in such a way that it appears there is a force keeping everybody from quite sucessfully doing their jobs. Furthermore, the detailed events outlining Cheney&#39;s movements are intriguing to say the least. Cheney appears to be the ring leader and Bush was the face to rally against terrorism. Cheney did contribute to a paper calling for a &#39;new Pearl Harbor&#39;, so this is not speculation in hindsight, but foresight. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fluoride is a known poison.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In too many parts per million per liter of water, or any other ingested or absorbed thing. So are most other elements as well, that is why they are not labeled as Poisonous, they are labeled as Toxic. The disease that was referred to is a byproduct of fluoride toxicity. This is impossible to get at regulated levels (normally set at 2 parts per million.) </p>

<p>From the World Health Organization Website:</p>

<p>&quot;In humans, &quot;disease&quot; is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person afflicted, or similar problems for those in contact with the person.&quot;</p>

<p>The symptoms listed as a result of Fluorosis are different than those of acute fluoride toxicity. The symptomatic lines in the teeth are harmless. That&#39;s what 25% of children in the U.S. have and that is <strong>all</strong> they have. Fluoride does not accumulate in the body and stay there, it is passed harmlessly through the body. In the cases I cited above, none of them were ever confirmed to be caused by fluoride in the water, it is much more likely that it was an element of pesticide that caused the disease.</p>

<p>Please, please understand you would very literally die of water intoxication before you ever developed any ill effects from fluoride toxicity, if it is given at the set levels of 2ppm. </p>

<p>You charge that governments the world over are systematically poisoning their people, and that every scientist is either hushed, or in on the conspiracy. Because the practice is so widely accepted as beneficial to both preventing tooth decay and strengthening bone density. The paltry sum of people, who even if in theory were poisoned by drinking water, do not even begin to outweigh the massive benefits.</p>

<p>Now, I invite you to do your own research, and if you have constructive input, I would be happy to hear you out. But don&#39;t be, let&#39;s say, &quot;naive&quot; and only accuse me of being wrong, or throw another insult, or add nothing of any substantial basis. Don&#39;t use language that is only designed to scare, and to accuse. Don&#39;t make another passionate remark about the need to stop poisoning our children. It&#39;s not helpful, its inflammatory, and its the same type of language used in propaganda. Don&#39;t.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra#Canadian_experiments">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra#Canadian_experiments</a></p>

<p>From what I understand, the CIA deliberately chose Montreal because of its many hospitals and universities and proximity to Cambridge and New York, and to avoid being accused of experimenting on US residents. So they experimented on Canadians instead, primarily Quebecois. Duplessis, our premier at the time, is infamous for authorizing experiments on and brutal murders of babies of unwed mothers (as well as the unwed mothers themselves).</p>

<p>It is called The Duplessis Era, and the children who were victims and survivors of this era are called The Duplessis Orphans. There is a graveyard in the east end of Montreal that the government does not want exhumed. Last I checked (anyone, feel free to correct this info) the government is still refusing to exhume the bodies of hundreds of murdered infants dumped into a mass grave in the east end, which the remaining Duplessis Orphans are calling for in order to prove that the infants were experimented on and died as a result of those experiments, particularly lobotomies. I&#39;m guessing the government is waiting for the last Orphans to die off before exhuming the grave. The Orphans are pretty young though, so... I&#39;m not sure how long they can hold out without being obvious about avoiding the issue. The youngest survivors were actually born in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s rather than the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s as claimed, so... they have a good 50 yrs to go before we all die off.</p>

<p>It is called The Great Darkness. No one likes to talk about it. Even though many of the policies and attitudes born out of the Duplessis Era are alive and happening in hospitals (and foster homes) across Quebec to this day.</p>

<p>I wonder if you&#39;ve seen this thread about the contradictory records from Flight 11.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No I have not, thanks for the share.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also wonder what you make of the technical information contained in the comment quoted in the first post of that thread, and how it might contradict or support the technical information you discovered</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not much, his following text from that quote reinforces the suspicion that the calls were not being made from inside the airplane and were in fact being staged. </p>

<p>Theres not much I could find in there that could support what I discovered, the Flight 11 call log lacks a lot of legends. But on the other hand, there is one thing that sounds impossible, unless I am mistaken.</p>

<p>Call <a href="http://htmlimg1.scribdassets.com/1bfw9rs1dse6sz3/images/19-1f570a8a28.jpg">#18</a> last for 274s.</p>

<p>There are two ground stations involved during that connection - <strong>Gnd Sta ID 30|Coriapolis, PA</strong> and <strong>Current Gnd Sta ID 98|Arlington VA</strong>.</p>

<p>If this log follows the same structure as the one from U93 then Gnd Sta ID = Ground station id when the call started; Current Gnd Sta ID = Ground station id when the call ended.</p>

<p>Problem is this is telling us that at the time of that call the airplane Flight 11 was not where the <a href="http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/7595/flight11radardatawh0.jpg">radar showed us</a> but instead far West around Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Please take in consideration that I do not know exactly the RBS ranges in 2001 but I remember reading somewhere that they were around 128miles in radius and this is what I am using for the above relation.</p>

<p>So, if I am correct, Flight 11 was not the airplane that crashed into WTC and was in fact in Pensylvania, or the other way around.</p>
