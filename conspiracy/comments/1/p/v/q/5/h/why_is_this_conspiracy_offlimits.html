    <div class="md"><p>I do, and the majority of them recognize that Christianity has frequently been altered at least to fit the people and accommodate for changing cultures. They agree that <em>in the past</em> people have used the church to control people and to grow wealthy and powerful, etc.</p>

<p>Although, try telling them the same thing about the rapture, etc, and they don&#39;t take it nearly as well. We&#39;re all fine with agreeing that things were corrupt and bad a few hundred years ago, but when it starts affecting stuff we believe in <em>now</em>... That goes for everyone, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think modern christians see the religion in a very granular way. As in, they don&#39;t relate their individual practice to the larger organism of Christianity. They and their friends are the &quot;real christians&quot; and everyone else is either doing it wrong or not quite right. </p>

<p>They aren&#39;t actively evaluating the diaspora of their religion and its context in the world at large. So, I don&#39;t think the majority of them realize how much their religion has been manipulated nor do they care because they don&#39;t think that greater body of practice has anything to do with what they individually practice. It has been a work in progress which they now have correct, past versions and concurrent versions are irrelevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I can definitely see that. In fact, that&#39;s probably how I tend to see it as well. I&#39;ll believe what I believe and everybody else is <em>the other</em>. That said, Christianity is hardly a monolith of thought. I mean, even Jesus&#39; divinity isn&#39;t agreed upon within Christianity. (Or even whether Jesus and Christ are the same thing. Or if the Bible is to be taken literally or not. Or whether homosexuals should be punished or not. Or whether Christians should try to use the state to promote their morals, etc.) So I really find no reason to associate myself and my beliefs with those groups I do not give credence to, in anything but the most basic ways. (Mostly in terminology and a basic connection to the Gospels.)</p>

<p>But I&#39;d never thought about that before, mostly because those first couple sentences kind of accurately described the was I see it. (saw, maybe, now) Although I wouldn&#39;t have gone as far to say that <em>I&#39;m</em> a <em>real</em> Christian and only people that agree with me are <em>real</em> Christians.</p>

<p>Anyway, enough religion. Enjoy your upvote. Let&#39;s get back to the NWO. lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I highly doubt the OP will put as much effort into bashing that crowd. </p>

<p>By the way, I think the whole reptilian thing is only a slight misdirection. In my opinion, it came out of the brotherhood of the snake, the dragon societies, satanists/luciferians (garden of Eden snake), etc. There is a huge body of literature that everyone is ignoring. Reptilians aren&#39;t literally reptiles, they just metaphorically follow &quot;the snake.&quot; See ancient Egypt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re making the claim that reptilians literally exist or not. You&#39;re entitled to your opinion, but I disagree. That was the point of my post; to provide my opinion on &quot;reptilians&quot; and where the concept came from. The same goes for your rabbit holes. People used to think that women would shape shift into rabbits, which I think was just a misdirection of the symbolism. Follow the rabbit to knowledge (the matrix and Alice in wonderland resurrected this) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This &quot;conspiracy&quot; is self-contradictory and hence pretty unlikely.  The supposed purpose was to pacify the Jewish people by planting a new religion that would encourage peace and supplication to Earthly government (Rome)... except that was not a key teaching in Jesus ministry.  It would also be exceedingly unlikely for such a thing to take off and succeed, and if it did, it could easily morph into something else even something violent.  The last thing a sensible government wants is a unified and motivated people interested in changing the world.  Who could trust such people to be peaceful?  That is likely the reason that the Roman government did not support it when it took off among the Roman population, but persecuted it mightily instead.  If it was good enough to pacifiy Jews, why not Roman citizens?  That is probably the most devastating argument against this silly idea.  The main reason this idea keeps coming up is that it gets ignorant atheists with poor critical thinking skills excited.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was raised in a Southern Baptist/Assemblies of God household.. I find it interesting that Christians will believe ancient Roman texts that talked about the &quot;Christ&quot; existing and hold onto that as infallible evidence he existed, but come across equally valid Roman evidence that they made up a lie so they could continuing the taxation of their citizens, and immediately it&#39;s disregarded as false info. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its an interesting concept. Not sure if i subscribe to the belief or not. but interesting nonetheless.</p>

<p>The reason i dont subscribe to this belief as written, is because the whoke christian faith was based off of pagan belief systems that are far older than christianity itself. The foundations of christianity lie in the very pagans they murdered during their conquest called the inquisition. But the copy-and-paste religion we call christianity was doctored up before the inquisition, when conventions were called by the heads of the church to debate which books were to be included into the bible, and which ones were to be omitted. Google the apocrypha forbmore info on that.</p>

<p>Point is, christianity was editted long before the romans got a hold of it (i think the emporer constantine made it the official religion of rome? Correct me if im wrong on that...) But, thats not to say the romans didnt edit it to their benefit for the enslavement of their populace. Thats not the same as &quot;inventing&quot; jesus, but instead exaggerating him.</p>

<p>I think this conspiracy seems to be &quot;off limits&quot; because there are a bunch of religious people on this sub. No one likes their religion to be potentially debunked. No one likes their religions accuracy to he debunked, either. And thats okay. But it shouldnt stop others from discussing the details and coming to other than accepted conclusions..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It comes down to your approach. I personally think it would be much easier to convince somebody that preacher A and B are fake than it would be to convince them that their entire religion is fake. But personally, I think most of the people who spend all of that time trying to convert people to atheism are really just being condescending because it makes them feel smart. I highly doubt most &quot;converters&quot; really want to change the world for the better. I know from being one myself and it took a while for me to admit it. </p>

There is tons of disinfo out there now, but if you are interested, I can find some quotes by Iraneus, who wrote around 150 AD.  That guy laid out the traditional view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christian - someone who believes the bullshit the various Christian religions spew.</p>

<p>All Christian religions are based upon The Bible which itself is fiction and, even if you don&#39;t accept that, self-contradictory and therefore clearly false. If you question that The Bible is self-contradictory, please read it. Yourself. Instead of asking someone else to translate it for you. Just read it.</p>

<p>Anyway, Christians, therefore, do not possess the capacity for critical thought - to discern bullshit from truth.</p>

<p>Not allies - if we accept the notion that the community of conspiracy theorists necessarily means we need critical thinkers, then Christians aren&#39;t allies.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where your problem begins. Christ was no more here than Sigurd was. Or Heracles. Or any of the other myths men made up around the same time to explain shit they couldn&#39;t explain.</p>

<p>The only difference between Christianity and those others is the location in which you were born, in both space and time. Had you been born in northern Europe 1,500 years ago, you would be talking about Thor and Odin. Had you been born in the Middle East at the exact same time you were now, you&#39;d be talking about Mohammed.</p>

<p>Think about that.</p>

<p>how HEARSAY is handled</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hersey, you mean? Yes, those who believe in their religious teachings must dismiss or fight anything that contradicts their religion because they find cognitive dissonance something between uncomfortable and painful. That is why most are indoctrinated as children - when they still believe everything their authority figures told them.</p>

<p>The alternative, of course, were a religion actually true, would be to teach its children to pursue to the greatest extent possible evidence and truth. To learn critical thinking skills so they can determine for themselves when statements are accurate and when they are inaccurate. To teach children how to test statements and evidence for accuracy.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not what happens in any religion, is it?</p>

<p>If you had been born in 1,500 years ago in northern Europe, what would your religion be? Would you be as certain in it as you are in your current religion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;Golden Rule&quot; is not, in and of itself, a Christian-created notion.</p>

<p>Nor is it a very good way to live. Treat everyone as you&#39;d like to be treated, sure, until they fuck with you. Then you gotta do what you gotta do.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t want to have someone shoot me. But if someone is dumb enough to invade my house and threaten myself or my family, I&#39;m gonna shoot &#39;em.</p>

<p>Golden rule only goes so far.</p>

<p>Pretty nifty trick, ancient Israelites anticipating English common law. Can you talk about common law cause of action for coveting your neighbor&#39;s ass?</p>

<p>There may be highly educated Christians. Degrees and all sorts of shit. They just cannot think critically. They cannot discern fantasy from reality.</p>
