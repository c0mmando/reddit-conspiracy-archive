I work with your type, and lucky for me i fired three of your type already just for taking that smug atheist attitude you are trying to take with me. After i fire them i invite them to my church! Next time they wont try to argue with THE BOSS over his personal choices in life, see thats where kids like you go wrong, you try to fight so many battles but forget your place, well those kids learned their place fast. You cant differentiate between respect for personal choices in life and agreeing or to dis agree. Kids like you only see black and white. SO when you get that first job, keep your mouth shut and ACCEPT peoples choices in life, dont be a bigot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, that&#39;s why this is entertaining to me.</p>

<p>You&#39;re marginalizing my input. You insinuate that I&#39;m young. You call me a fool. You call me angry. You suggest that I&#39;m uneducated.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the mind&#39;s defense mechanism that kicks in when its ingrained beliefs are threatened.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually quite surprised to have found a mind like yours in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I would have hoped to  have found an abundance of critical, evidence-based thinkers in that subreddit.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You might want to exercise caution with that. If your documentation trail leaves anything to be desired, you are opening up a significant possibility of lawsuit for your company. If you&#39;re the owner, I guess that&#39;s all well and good, but if you are not, you&#39;re doing your employers a disservice by increasing their risk of ruin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You cant differentiate between respect for personal choices in life and agreeing or to dis agree</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m not the one who has levied the insults in this thread.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>dont be a bigot</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Says the person who relishes firing people of different (or absent) religions?</p>

You are not even a Christian by the way. You say you are, but you obviously don&#39;t have the slightest fucking clue what it means to be a Christian.

<p>Also I&#39;m not gay, I&#39;m all about the pussy. I&#39;m actually so confident in my masculinity that the idea that some guys like to fuck other guys in the ass doesn&#39;t actually bother me. Weird, huh? Kind of makes me think that all of this talk from you about the gays might be .. I don&#39;t know.. some kind of a show. As if you were trying a little too hard to sound like not a gay. Like maybe you might actually be gay, and you are trying to cover it up with a bunch of homophobic statements. But then that&#39;s ridiculous. No Christian who talks a lot about how evil homosexuals are has ever turned out to secretly be gay. That would be silly. </p>

<p>You do know the word SWAG was a homosexual word used to identify each other, back when RIGHTFULLY so, they were looked down on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so you are not just a bigot, you&#39;re a fucking liar too. awesome.</p>

<p>edit: holy moley your posting history is a shining example of Christian benevolence</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You post this shit to all the single lonely worthless jobless males, you deserve to be raped.</p>

<p>Can i lick your butthole?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that this last comment was to a 17 year old girl.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sounds like you know how that stuff works, i guess you speak from experience? Im married, and if i was some idiot 18 year old, i suppose women would have total control over me, as they do you. When you grow a bit, and stop being a boy, you will see things differently, but until then, you&#39;re wrong, im right and shes still average......</p>

<p>Wow, married christian asks if he can lick 17 year old girls butthole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It good kiddo, driving as in playing GTA V i assume? You&#39;re just the standard angry fool out to win some internet battles. I work with your type, and lucky for me i fired three of your type already just for taking that smug atheist attitude you are trying to take with me. After i fire them i invite them to my church! Next time they wont try to argue with THE BOSS over his personal choices in life, see thats where kids like you go wrong, you try to fight so many battles but forget your place, well those kids learned their place fast. You cant differentiate between respect for personal choices in life and agreeing or to dis agree. Kids like you only see black and white. SO when you get that first job, keep your mouth shut and ACCEPT peoples choices in life, dont be a bigot.</p>
