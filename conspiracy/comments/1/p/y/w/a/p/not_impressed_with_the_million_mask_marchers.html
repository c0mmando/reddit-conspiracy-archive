       I fear they are more of the same, and their chants speak of SOCIALISM, and even chaos. I feel these people are wrapped up mindlessly in some illusion/hip/cool factor.

      <p>
       I bet those people would hate me for being Christian, and tell me to stop hating gay people(THIS IS THE ARGUMENT ANTI-CHRISTIANS GIVE) i had to edit this for first grade educated people to understand, things must be explained in a much more simplistic fashion i guess.

       You do know you are spreading hate right? i never said i hated gays, you just failed to read clearly. The bigot is you, since you hate me for being a christian. And you continue to attack, this is your purpose in life, to endlessly attack on the net lol.

       AS i said, you won the internet, but its clean victory only comes from you getting the last word, of which you cant, as this is my thread.

       It good kiddo, driving as in playing GTA V i assume? You're just the standard angry fool out to win some internet battles. I work with your type, and lucky for me i fired three of your type already just for taking that smug atheist attitude you are trying to take with me. After i fire them i invite them to my church! Next time they wont try to argue with THE BOSS over his personal choices in life, see thats where kids like you go wrong, you try to fight so many battles but forget your place, well those kids learned their place fast. You cant differentiate between respect for personal choices in life and agreeing or to dis agree. Kids like you only see black and white. SO when you get that first job, keep your mouth shut and ACCEPT peoples choices in life, dont be a bigot.

       You're marginalizing my input. You insinuate that I'm young. You call me a fool. You call me angry. You suggest that I'm uneducated.

       It's the mind's defense mechanism that kicks in when its ingrained beliefs are threatened.

       . I would have hoped to  have found an abundance of critical, evidence-based thinkers in that subreddit.

       You might want to exercise caution with that. If your documentation trail leaves anything to be desired, you are opening up a significant possibility of lawsuit for your company. If you're the owner, I guess that's all well and good, but if you are not, you're doing your employers a disservice by increasing their risk of ruin.

       Right, the lady laughing and texting in the car beside me is a good person, caring about others, life matters to her and shes filled with love for the goodness of the human race. Her acting of texting and driving are inherently EVIL, it shows a total lack of concern for others and a stone cold SELF SERVING attitude, how is that good?

       Well if you think that being a Christian is beneficial, then by your logic that makes you evil, because you are doing a really shitty job of promoting Christianity. If I was to base my opinion on your example, I would think that Christians were crazy raving assholes.

       Nothing to think about at all, your mind is made up, i personally think you're a sack of shit and wont lose any sleep over you. You think im supposed to be the soft little man that just loves and loves, well it's not my job to love you or beg you for anything, you're an adult, make up your own mind, you gota face GOD and explain your life, not me, we will all stand alone for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do my daily best, im NICE to everyone when they are respectful and nice to me, i gave up trying to convert, ill leave to to more patient types, at this point in my life id assume kick your ass as talk to you, given your current attitude towards me. So let those squishy joyful types deal with you, i gave that up years ago. Ive done my time, and my patience is gone.
      </p>

       I only said the word christian, and all hell broke loose, ONE AGAIN the bigots come out and REFUSE to accept anything that doesn't fall within your guidelines, your types are broken records, endlessly spewing shit, gets old.

       In case you haven't seen my other post yet. Just so you understand. After reading your comments, you are actually the worst person I have seen on Reddit so far. By far. You are not even a Christian by the way. You say you are, but you obviously don't have the slightest fucking clue what it means to be a Christian. Don't get me wrong, I am also not a Christian. But then I don't claim to be one, and I don't use my bullshit claims of being a Christian to justify my homophobia.

       But then I'm also not homophobic, so whatever.

       Also I'm not gay, I'm all about the pussy. I'm actually so confident in my masculinity that the idea that some guys like to fuck other guys in the ass doesn't actually bother me. Weird, huh? Kind of makes me think that all of this talk from you about the gays might be .. I don't know.. some kind of a show. As if you were trying a little too hard to sound like not a gay. Like maybe you might actually be gay, and you are trying to cover it up with a bunch of homophobic statements. But then that's ridiculous. No Christian who talks a lot about how evil homosexuals are has ever turned out to secretly be gay. That would be silly.

       I never claimed to be an example of how someone should act. I freely admit that I am an ego-maniac and kind of an asshole, so, keep looking for more ammunition. I'd love to hear what you think about my description of what I would do if I murdered someone, for instance. I put a lot of effort into that and some feedback would be great.

       It good kiddo, driving as in playing GTA V i assume? You're just the standard angry fool out to win some internet battles. I work with your type, and lucky for me i fired three of your type already just for taking that smug atheist attitude you are trying to take with me. After i fire them i invite them to my church! Next time they wont try to argue with THE BOSS over his personal choices in life, see thats where kids like you go wrong, you try to fight so many battles but forget your place, well those kids learned their place fast. You cant differentiate between respect for personal choices in life and agreeing or to dis agree. Kids like you only see black and white. SO when you get that first job, keep your mouth shut and ACCEPT peoples choices in life, dont be a bigot.
