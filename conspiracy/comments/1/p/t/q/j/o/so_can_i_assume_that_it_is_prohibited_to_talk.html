So, how is your original comment in any way related to the possible false flags related to the Sandy Hook shooting and now the LAX shooting? Or the Boston Bombings, which anyone who&#39;s actually informed on the American synthetic terror system that is the FBI knows all about? I am genuinely trying to follow you, here, man.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 47.  I think for the most part there&#39;s a tendency on the part of law enforcement not to give us all the details when it&#39;s perceived that they&#39;ve screwed up.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong - I think the powers-that-be benefit from keeping the public in a constant state of semi-alert because it allows them to pass increasingly egregious laws to further restrict our freedoms.  But I don&#39;t think that any of the three events you mention were, at their roots, anything other than what they seem - I think some nutcases decided to shoot/bomb shit up.  As for how the resulting melee played out, it&#39;s certainly possible that we don&#39;t have the whole story, but I don&#39;t think they were staged or actually perpetrated by members of the government.  There&#39;s no need - nutcases do crazy stuff often enough that all the big boys have to do is escalate the emergency to level 10 each time.  They don&#39;t need to fabricate or cause these scenarios.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t think that there is any kind of cabal plotting out what I&#39;ve just described.  Nobody is saying &quot;we need to keep people panicked so we can pass more laws like the patriot act.&quot;  But the government acts a bit like a single coherent organism just like big corporations (all staffed by individuals who probably value their freedom as much as anyone) tend to do.  And they tend to move towards trampling our rights as well.</p>

<p>Not sure if I was completely clear here.  I think the idea that everything is a conspiracy is simple minded - it&#39;s a stretch for simple, easy to understand villains.  The real problem is that there are very few villains - the system as it&#39;s set up is the real villain and despite being staffed by good people it still has a tendency towards mission creep and worse.</p>
