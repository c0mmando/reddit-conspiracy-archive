       It's prohibited to talk about reality.  You are supposed to propagate the fake society that they are building over there, in which Democrats and Republicans supposedly represent two poles of a bitterly-divided America.  (When in fact, the real divide is America vs. corporate government.)

       Just found a video my self.. was kind of funny watching it. The facial expression on the two people behind the police chief was just priceless. "Now, why did you go and say that?" ... "Damn it, now this will be portrayed as a false flag event." ... "We're so f**ed now."
Could go either way if you ask me, but a bit suspicious non the least.

       I did. Downvoted into oblivion and called a psycho. It blows my fucking my that people don't think false flag attacks are real. You bring up Operation Northwoods (completely common knowledge and admitted to by the gov) and they start getting dodgy and panicked. One dude told me it wasn't "real" because JFK turned it down. Im like "the fucking plan made it all the way to JFK before he had to tell them no!" Lol. What the fuck is wrong with people.

       From everything that I have seen so far from the dummy to the video in question this entire thing is able to be explained thoroughly with normal reasoning. I'm not deciding either way but you have to keep a clear mind and make good valid irrefutable points or else our theories will just get ripped to shreds. Keep your thinking cap on.

       be sure to take this conversation the right way when they try to use this to beef up the tsa. attack the fallacy. do not engage in discussion on this event. do not take the whack job bait. the real arguement is that TSA does not make us safer. it is way easier to argue against their falacy then it is to prove conspiracy.

       OK, agreed. Yeah, I suspect you and I might be closer in age than your usual Redditor, I'll give you that (I'm older, 44). So, how is your original comment in any way related to the possible false flags related to the Sandy Hook shooting and now the LAX shooting? Or the Boston Bombings, which anyone who's actually informed on the American synthetic terror system that is the FBI knows all about? I am genuinely trying to follow you, here, man. Am I some sort of idiot in your mind for thinking that the official stories in these events don't add up?

       I'm 47.  I think for the most part there's a tendency on the part of law enforcement not to give us all the details when it's perceived that they've screwed up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong - I think the powers-that-be benefit from keeping the public in a constant state of semi-alert because it allows them to pass increasingly egregious laws to further restrict our freedoms.  But I don't think that any of the three events you mention were, at their roots, anything other than what they seem - I think some nutcases decided to shoot/bomb shit up.  As for how the resulting melee played out, it's certainly possible that we don't have the whole story, but I don't think they were staged or actually perpetrated by members of the government.  There's no need - nutcases do crazy stuff often enough that all the big boys have to do is escalate the emergency to level 10 each time.  They don't need to fabricate or cause these scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't think that there is any kind of cabal plotting out what I've just described.  Nobody is saying "we need to keep people panicked so we can pass more laws like the patriot act."  But the government acts a bit like a single coherent organism just like big corporations (all staffed by individuals who probably value their freedom as much as anyone) tend to do.  And they tend to move towards trampling our rights as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure if I was completely clear here.  I think the idea that everything is a conspiracy is simple minded - it's a stretch for simple, easy to understand villains.  The real problem is that there are very few villains - the system as it's set up is the real villain and despite being staffed by good people it still has a tendency towards mission creep and worse.
