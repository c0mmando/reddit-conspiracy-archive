        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know what is happening. You know what is happening. I&#39;m not going to go over the evidence with you because you all have seen the same things that I have. When Edward Snowden came into the spotlight a lot of people took a step back and started to really doubt their government. More and more people are taking a look at 911, to the point where there are billboards around the country that millions of people see. This was unimaginable 10 years ago. Everyday more and more people are investigating what is really happening in this country. And the only place to really turn is places like this, places that look at our governments activities under a magnifying glass. And our government is aware of that. </p>

<p>And now we have someone who just attacked a public place who conveniently happened to be carrying &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; propaganda. We are about to officially become the enemy. You know what happens to the enemy. Be aware that everything that is written here is examined. Every single one of you is on a list, and every single one of you is a traitor and a potential terrorist. Know that the net has been cast and that at any time it could be reeled in. To us we are surfing the web and pulling together pieces of information to provide to others in an attempt to get people to see what is happening. To them, we are in our basement building bombs and threatening freedom. Protect yourselves brethren, because when shit hits the fan we will be the first ones it lands on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course we are on a list. Click on probably half the links here and I rest assured that you are automatically enrolled on some watch list. Subscribe to this site? Again you are most likely on a list.</p>

<p>You see though, do not fear. That is what TPTB would love to happen. They would love it if people really hesitated to make that submission, share a viewpoint, or have a &quot;radical&quot; idea they share with others. That is the control they want, and things will happen for years to discredit the truth and obscure it.</p>

<p>The truth is though that they need for us to be afraid, if we are not, then others may start to ask questions. Cable TV is losing out to fringe sites, people are asking questions, people are starting in many ways to wake up. For those at the top this is not a good thing... but for us it is.</p>

<p>I think the point of no return has been reached, just keep going and dont be afraid to speak. once we are afraid to speak, then they win.</p>

<p>Keep writing, keep publishing, keep talking. Its the one thing that will change things as time goes on...</p>

<p>The shooter was carrying conspiracy propaganda because he was fucking insane.  You&#39;d think the fact that he shot up an airport would be enough evidence.  Oh riiiiiiiiiiight...that was the gubment dat dun killed dat agent.  The shooter was an actor, shill, plant, agent, whatever and you and your special cadre of super intelligent heroes are the only ones who know the truth.

<p>On the contrary, those who bomb, shoot or otherwise create destructive mayhem do the Authoritarian Oligarchs a great service - by terrorizing the befuddled public, who quickly, quietly and willingly surrender more freedom for the sake of &quot;security&quot;.</p>

<p>They know well that their hold on power relies on the ignorance and apathy of the confused, frightened and distracted masses. To them, the free flow of information is a FAR greater threat than any bullets or bombs wielded by &quot;terrorists&quot;.</p>

<p>One of the biggest things that we&#39;ve talked about besides theories is the idea of us moving from the US, but I&#39;ve ultimately decided that there&#39;s no point. This is MY country. We can&#39;t abandon it because we fear TPTB. You can&#39;t be scared, that&#39;s what they want. I will fight for MY country and not just behind a computer screen. When the time comes, I will be a part of the resistance. I will sacrifice anything to ensure the rightful liberties from being stripped from us. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for the noble sacrifice. I&#39;ll die before I submit. They may have the power now, but they won&#39;t last</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re trying to say your &quot;VERY&quot; pro-government parents have changed, and that it&#39;s an indicator of how bad it&#39;s getting. So why did you call them conservative? Are you ignorant of the basics of politics yet pretending you know stuff?&quot;</p>

<p>Never heard of r/conspiro, so I took a peek.</p>

<p>Who is conspirobot?</p>

<p>Well, he&#39;s a bot that is capable of cross-posting submissions and comments from any subreddit, while providing detailed statistics on the discussions taking place. He&#39;s currently busy building a web of detailed information on the posting habits of users active in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. This subreddit provides his public facing data, for meta analysis.</p>

<p>conspirobot is still in alpha stages. He still faceplants every now and again, dying a miserable death. He just needs a few bandages, some incantations, and he&#39;ll be up and running again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been questioned by the secret service and they questioned at least one of my neighbors some weeks or so later (can&#39;t recall the actual time frame between both events). I&#39;ve never done anything that any of you have not done by simply conversing about these things on places like Reddit or Facebook. So, I can tell you that one thing is a fact: they just have not gotten to you yet.</p>

<p>Now, don&#39;t think I&#39;m afraid or have changed anything because the SS came to my house and asked to speak with me. I knew I could refuse them at the door and tell them to leave. I told them to come in and I answered their questions. I even let them have a look around. Why? Because I literally have nothing to hide and when they leave they can&#39;t say &quot;I bet he has all kinds of this or that in his house&quot; but now they know that I&#39;m just as normal as they are and normal people feel this way about the government. Though that was the only pass they get. The next time I&#39;ll tell them to take a hike. They only get one pass.</p>

<p>That said, I have actually even amped up my statements a bit and since then I&#39;ve even taken part in things like helping to organize protests: getting police paperwork, openly organizing on Facebook events pages, etc.</p>

<p>Basically: I don&#39;t give a fuck. I have rights and I&#39;ll use them. I might even abuse them. </p>

<p>As far as those of you mentioning 9/11 and how it&#39;s more of an acceptable subject now and out in the open: I feel bad for the idiots that actually believed a single word that came out of mainstream media&#39;s mouth or a shred of the official story at any point. I won&#39;t get into why, but let&#39;s just say that you would have to be practically brain dead to accept such nonsense and not even pseudo-science (worse than pseudo-science).</p>

Especially when you are told it  occurred dozens if not hundreds of times in a single day, when none of these &quot;freak occurrences&quot; have have occurred at any other point in history, much less often, or enough times to be a possibility. </p>

<p>If you were told that marijuana killed 200 people today when it has never done so in the history of the world, would you believe it? Of course not. Would you believe that today, light suddenly stopped moving at the speed of light and instead moved at the speed of a bullet and only did so in New York city and Washington DC? Of course not.</p>

<p>Yet millions are told such lies and to this day it has not thrown up a red flag in their minds. They simply accept it, because they are told to. They accept it simply because the government says so.</p>

This has been the whole town where I live. I am pretty sure it is the same elsewhere. I would say about 80 percent of the population harbors some suspicion something is wrong. So at least half of those people would be conspiracy theorist. How many of these conspiracy theorist might be on to something would be pretty small. They would probably go after those individuals first. Probably silence them quickly to prevent riots. Then they would make the others believe they were mentally ill or needed anxiety meds or treatment for paranoia. Why cage a cat when you neuter and de-claw him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After Sandy Hook, Joe Rogan had these huge rants that were posted over and over and over again in this sub talking about how &quot;mental health&quot; should be the focus not gun control.  The &quot;mental health&quot; meme was OBVIOUSLY aimed at people who were anti-govt or &quot;truthers&quot; because it was constantly insinuated.  Mental health was used in Soviet Russia as a way to see who was &quot;loyal&quot; to the party, if you were deemed mentally unstable because you didn&#39;t agree with Communist Party goals then you were executed.  Rogan pushed this shit ignorantly and got about 90% of the people on this sub parroting his BS.  Rogan is a shill, if you haven&#39;t seen his new show, you should and watch it with a keen eye. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only threat to freedom we have are the whack jobs in the government who think those kinds of thoughts. If the conspiracy theorist was the threat and not the mental patient doped on SSRI drugs we would have already been rounded up. These mental patients who are not getting real psychological help with proper understanding and support are the problem. We used to lock people up who had emotional and schitzo if they had the tiniest iota of possibly being dangerous. Now we let them walk outside doped on drugs that may or may not work. What is really dangerous is cutting down funding for mental health treatment so you can fund wars and tax subsidies for the rich.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a big problem with the current system. 
We&#39;ve made a big switch from trying to come up with practical solutions for mental disorder and replaced it with &quot;psychiatrists&quot; who just push psychotropic medications and call it a day. 
It disgusts me. That&#39;s why I want to devote my time to finding better treatment plans for those with mental disabilities. Cut back meds and start pushing a program of behavior modification, psychoanalysis and rehabilitation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s never a good idea. I&#39;ve seen it so widespread. Pts get diagnosed with depression and Anxiety and are pushed antidepressants, anti anxieties and/or benzodiazepines.. You don&#39;t need to push so many drugs for one patient especially for diagnoses as open ended as depression and anxiety. 
Not to mention the real horror is the welfare system. 
Children as young as 5 prescribed hard drugs like Xanax, Valium, adderall. 
In general it&#39;s sickening how medicine is veering from patient care and falling further and further into the clutches of big business. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>More and more people are taking a look at 911, to the point where there are billboards around the country that millions of people see.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Billboards paid for by a corporation that wants to help spread disinformation and doubt. Get people involved in the minutiae and you have successfully misdirected them with very little effort. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And now we have someone who just attacked a public place who conveniently happened to be carrying &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; propaganda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is it so outside of the realm of possibility that this guy was a tinfoil-hatted &quot;patriot&quot;?  Is there any evidence to suggest that Ciancia was a clean-cut, conservative moderate before this and then suddenly evidence was placed on him to make him look like a conspiracy theorist? He had a hand-written note on him talking about his hatred for the DHS, Janet Napolitano and &quot;fiat currency.&quot; </p>

<p>He sent text messages to his brother before all of this took place. His Father was the one that called police in LA to try to stop this. </p>

<p>My point is that this is not some plant. He&#39;s not a patsy that the government is trying to make look bad. This guy was doing the same things a lot of you do every day: complaining about the government, demanding that things change, etc. The only difference is that this kid was stupid enough to think that opening fire on a TSA agent was going to do anything but make the situation worse for Americans.</p>

<p>Make no mistake: Paul Ciancia was one of you. I know this may be painful for you conspiracy theorists to comprehend, but  I&#39;ll bet 10 to 1 odds he&#39;s a die-hard listener of Alex Jones and subscribes to Infowars.com. I also bet that Alex and the other fearmongers are working very hard to keep that information hidden. All I seem to find on the site is articles talking about how the media is trying to pin this on honest patriots and how our freedoms are going to be further reduced. No talk of responsibility. Just the standard infowars narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This really is the crisis that will define Millennials ... not 9/11. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the prerogative of young people today, to determine if they&#39;ll take the awesome strength they possess, collectively, for teamwork and collusion, to take the next step toward the Orwellian world of authoritarianism and a complete loss of individual liberty, human rights, and basic human decency, or if they&#39;ll stand, united, against an all-powerful, all-knowing, security state.  One that controls every person everywhere, and at all times.</p>

<p>I cannot wait to watch this play out!  These are really very exciting times.</p>

Getting my children&#39;s generation to take the blinders off and pay attention is becoming easier now with all the attention brought by Snowden&#39;s revelations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a few weeks ago they visited my parents about posts i made on facebook and elsewhere online. after that one of my friends who lives across the country from me told me she was contacted as well.</p>

<p>i do not know details of anything from my parents as my mother is just &quot;too disappointed&quot; to talk to me lol.</p>

<p>and from my friend she hasn&#39;t said much, and i haven&#39;t pressed it because frankly i just do not care.</p>

<p>the point is to intimidate people who do investigative journalism by approaching their friends and family in an effort to shame them into changing their actions.</p>

<p>not going to work.</p>

<p>edit: and i should add, they never have contacted me lol. which sort of proves my suspicions about their motives. if i were a real threat, wouldn&#39;t they need to contact me directly to determine how much of a threat i was?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If only the conspiracy theorists could see themselves from the outside. Some of you are crazy and dangerous as individuals, but as a movement you are not a threat to anyone. </p>

<p>Occupy was a genuine threat and I saw how the FBI destroyed them. I watched and took notes. If you scared anyone you would simply disappear and stop being a force.</p>

<p>The truth is you are useful despite causing occasional trouble. You are fearful and vain, and that makes you very easily manipulated by the very people you think you despise. </p>

<p>If you wanted to become some kind of threat you would need to lose the fear (I see through your internet tough guy mask), but then you wouldn&#39;t be conspiracy theorists anymore.</p>
