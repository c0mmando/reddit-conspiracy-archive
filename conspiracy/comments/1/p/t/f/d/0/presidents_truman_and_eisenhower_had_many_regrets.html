       "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American militaryâ€“industrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary
       <em>
        could be invented
       </em>
       . Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy." (emphasis mine)
      </p>
      <p>
       --George F. Kennan in preface of Norman Cousins's 1987 book The Pathology of Power
      </p>
      <p>
       The implications of this quote definitely startled me a bit when I first came across these words about a year ago. After looking up his wikipedia and learning Kennan was a career diplomat and historian--he seemed to be an influential insider who helped mold the Truman Doctrine and thrusted the U.S. into the Cold War. But Kennan was more than a player in creating U.S. foreign policy after WWII--he was actually at vital meetings that helped create a brutal, under-handed agency mindframe that was often out of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't until I read
       <strong>
        Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA
       </strong>
       (2007) that Kennan lost the gentlemanly diplomatic facade and was exposed as something quite sinister. The book contains a quote from a 1948 secret report which was sent to the U.S. State Dept, the White House and the Pentagon in which Kennan called for "the inauguration of organized political warfare". Another memo sent to Sec. of Defense Forrestal called for the formation of "a guerrilla warfare corps". Obviously, these are much different purposes than what the original function of the CIA was stated to be--an intelligence agency updating the President on world events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you know some of the sordid details of the CIA--Tim Weiner's book
       <em>
        Legacy of Ashes
       </em>
       will make it quite clear that Kennan's memos were taken seriously--and if only HALF of what Tim Weiner writes is true then America has been subjected to the biggest CON JOB ever. The book weighs in at 809 pages with almost 200 pages of notes/sources and much of the info is from the CIA's own files. It begins with the end of WWII and proceeds chronologically without getting bogged down in code names. Direct quotes are used often, sometimes they even jump off the page: "We killed thousands of Communists, even though half of them probably didn't know what Communism meant. (CIA pilot Al Pope)".
      </p>
      <p>
       After reading the first 60 pages it's stunning how the CIA was able to disregard all laws and procedures in the U.S. to get initial funding. For the first year or two Wall Street bankers were asked to chip in by sending a million or so overseas--then they could mark a special code on their tax form and write it off. Other familiar names quickly enter the picture--Allan Dulles, John Foster Dulles, Richard Helms, Richard Bissell. The drive for power was matched by the increase in funding--by 1948 the CIA had somehow ransacked 5% of the Marshall Plan money which came out to $680 million over 4 years through a secret clause.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, right from the start, the CIA finances were crooked, Americans--often even the President and congress-- unaware. The stated mission of intelligence gathering was taking a backseat for much higher stakes of assassination, funding/training militia groups--laws simply did not apply in any way to the CIA. The Agency was gambling and it's actions were often sloppy and self-defeating. The enemy was anyone who didn't openly reject communism and bend over for American business. From Japan to Iran to Guatemala to the Congo--the Agency poured in cash to political parties and journalists. If that didn't work the proper militias or henchmen were supplied with weapons and hired.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I pondered the first three chapters of Legacy of Ashes two questions raced through my mind: can the U.S. possibly be much deeper in debt than the $17 Trillion they are telling us? Secondly, could 9/11 have been perpetrated by the CIA to destroy (permanently) financial records and to further fund the defense/intelligence sectors?
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I ask these questions is because of the enormous economic fraud from the inception of the CIA which was perpetrated by the Dulles brothers and the Wall Street bankers who backed the Agency. On top of that is the fact that the CIA is but one of a myriad of defense and intelligence arms of the U.S. and you have to question why Americans have not demanded an open audit immediately. Just in the intelligence/homeland security field there are now well over 3,000 government agencies and private contractors churning out over 50,000 reports a year. The Dept. of Defense has no actual audit in recent memory--though there are rumors an audit was made in 1993. No one has ever seen an actual audit for the CIA (let alone the entire defense/intelligence budget). Even today, the CIA's budget total is written on a piece of paper and then shown to a senior senator of the Intelligence Committee--no one else (outside of the CIA and possibly the President). Now multiply that process 20 or 30 times for all the other major U.S. Government agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Legacy of Ashes
       </em>
       proves the President has often been oblivious to the plans being played out by the CIA. Justice has been subverted--every law in the U.S. and internationally has been laughed at and spat upon while the party goes on in CIA mansions around the world. After just one dozen years of existence the CIA had played the politics of fear so successfully that Eisenhower was giving the OK to assassinate Lumumba (leader of Congo) and Fidel Castro in just one meeting. There's a reason they won't release most of the files for 50 or 60 years--because the citizens of the U.S. and the world would demand an actual investigation (one which doesn't involve puppets).
      </p>
      <p>
       The dangerous threat these defense and intelligence agencies present to freedom and democracy--especially when added to the Edward Snowden revelations--should stop you in your tracks. I highly suggest you read the book and seriously consider the implications of these agencies being allowed such an extreme lack of accountability. In the end even Presidents Truman and Eisenhower had many regrets over their dealings with the Agency--Truman regretted creating it and Eisenhower even blurted out "I would like to resign" after he had been burned (and exposed) by a CIA operation which involved the U2 spy plane.

       part of the truth is out there...but Americans need to TUNE OUT the American media, educate themselves and DEMAND Answers...i myself have just written a letter to the NYT letting them know I used to read their paper 3-5 times per week--but no longer will purchase it or even read a link to their site.
      </p>
      <p>
       more important, i empowered myself by reading a BOOK...even if you are low on funds you can find FREE books online--3 weeks ago I found this link by JFK author Robert Morrow which has 29 books on the JFK Assassination FREE in pdf format...

       i could definitely be wrong about the media over there...all I know is that I'm glad the guardian came along and published Greenwald's articles regarding Snowden/NSA...over here Snowden/NSA stories are often buried--plus no one seems to actually investigate further.

       Europeans do question more things than Americans but the difference isn't huge. There is a huge apolitical culture in America, largely thanks to the MSM making details excruciatingly boring. In Europe, you don't have that apolitical culture, or at least not to the extent that exists in America.

       What if it's not that they question their news more or that we don't question ours at all?  Rather that they question us so that anything the governments in Europe do looks good and uncorrupt and the U.S. People look at what the governments in europe do so that everything looks peachy clean in the united states.

       TPTB will never come clean about everything they do. Power structures simply don't work that way. You can make extrapolations in your own life all the way down to your own circle of friends.. do you let everyone know everything you do or do you pick and choose which people should receive which information?
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, the current trend toward absolute secrecy and power grubbing must be curbed. Power (real power) needs to be distributed among the largest number of people possible.

       Very true. They try to make it so severe as to be unbelievable. The CIA imported and incorporated many a Nazi, and they've used a lot of the same plays. Josef Mengele, who started the Mind Control experiments at the concentration camps, said, "The more we do to you, the less you seem to believe we are doing it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Many Nazis who came over under Operation Paperclip continued the mind control experiments here. Many believe Mengele, himself, was involved in MkUltra (Mind Kontrolle) under the alias Dr. Green.

       I'm sure you meant that as a slight to the conspiracy minded as a whole, but I ask you, is the dumbing down of media really a response to market pressures or a more deliberate appeal to the lowest common denominator?

       Yes. Required reading. Once you learn about the carelessness with which they carried out assassinations and supported coup's of democratically elected leaders, it becomes hard to refute that the Agency would have any qualms at all with doing the same in America.

       subject: WHY I won't buy the NYT
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to buy and read your paper 3-5 days a week--you have LOST me as a customer--I will not purchase your paper or read your articles online.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans are becoming aware of the fact that they have been SOLD fabrications continuously by our news/media and that our media has failed to rigorously fight for the TRUTH through investigative journalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two most open and notorious examples of your failures being:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) the JFK Assassination and the obvious editorial decision to cling to the Oswald MYTH by the NYT. How about an article about the 16 doctors from Parkland Hospital (Dallas) who all corroborate the fact that JFK had a fist-sized hole in the BACK of his head???
      </p>
      <p>
       2) FAILURE of the NYT to seriously question the "official story" of 9/11. The 9/11 cOMMISSSION was a farce shoved down America's throat just like the Warren Commission was back in the 60's. I, of course, do NOT know what happened, but there are so many flaws in the "official story" that every news organization should be asking questions and assigning investigative reporters for further discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NYT and American media have FAILED the American people--even Benjamin Franklin would be disgraced by your lack of willingness to seek ANSWERS.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It is every American citizen's first responsibility to question authority."
--Benjamin Franklin
