    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think they&#39;d be able to get away with killing all of us with poisons and not have some kind of repercussions?  An outright poisoning of water and food to kill everyone off wouldn&#39;t happen in a few hours.  It couldn&#39;t be done like that, besides they need people in a way, they need people to be part of the business.  If people are healthy, they don&#39;t participate monetarily in any significant ways.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a business.  In a way they want us dead, but they want people dying more.  That makes them money, not just butchering the population outright.</p>

<p>They just don&#39;t care about life.  Life has turned into a commodity.  Life is a tool to be used to further other more important human beings through THEIR lives.  We are less than they are simply due to the lack of digits in our banks accounts.  We are expendable.  There are lots of us.  Look at China!  Billions of people working for nothing at all and living in a pollution filled nightmare.  No care or worry about the cost of life.  That is what they would call, the cost of &quot;business&quot;.</p>

<p>Chem trailing controls weather and controls food, and controls health.  If you have even more control you can drill home plans to keep people in their place and make for an easier business model in the future.  It will keep you in your place and them on top.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a simple thing for me.  The end result is always the same.  Money over people and well being.  Money over a life worth living and unfucked with.  They are securing that for themselves with every day they rain down Aluminum, barium, strontium and whatever else down on you.  It&#39;s not always so much the details, its the end result that will coincide with everything that&#39;s been happening already for years.  More control, harder for you to stand up and say no, if you wanted to.  The precedent is set and people believe in things that have been going on for as long as they know.  They just don&#39;t know anything else.</p>

The biggest issue with this subject seems to be the language.</p>

<p>If one points at the white elephant in the sky and yells chemtrails, geo-engineering and weather warfare, that one watched the history channel.</p>

<p>If one points at the same elephant and yell persistent jet contrails all up in them clouds altering the composition of condensation nuclei which affects their albedo and shit, therefore contributing to anthropogenic climate change, one sounds like a ghetto climate scientist.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t find reputable sources on chemtrails because nobody who studies &quot;chemtrails&quot; calls them chemtrails. It has various names but it all looks like crap in the sky, persistent contrails, global dimming, anthropogenic climate change, radar jamming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaff_%28countermeasure%29">chaff</a>, ect.</p>

<p>From u/going2shambhala</p>

<p>I&#39;d urge you to examine this issue more vigorously, starting with this <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2011/20110721_particles.html">NOAA article regarding an anomalous doubling in high stratospheric particles in the last decade</a>. There is sufficient evidence that he Western world, particularly the US and EU, engages  in large scale weather modification.</p>

<p>This project has multiple components: the dispersion of aluminum oxide particles in the nano scale to increase &quot;cloud&quot; reflectivity, thus dimming the earth below and secondly, the release of metallic ionizing salts (commonly of Ba and Sr) acting as an electrical medium for <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/niush/chemtrails_and_vtrpe/">military radar systems</a>. Some researchers of this false cloud phenomenon have concluded that part of what we are witnessing may be the byproduct of an antistatic agent, <a href="http://chemtrails.cc/docs/chemtrails.cc_the_not_so_secret_ingredient_02-2009.pdf">Stadis 450</a> used in military fuel. Released high in the atmosphere, all of these fine aerosols (specifically metallic ionizing salts) can stay aloft for long periods of time and be manipulated by ELF antenna for steering high pressure systems.</p>

<p>Geoengineering/weather/environmental modification is an activity militaries, particularly our Air Force, have identified as a power play in satellite mapping (VRPE) and to influence storm tracking and shifting pressure systems.  A LARGE number of these flights are not civilian; moreover modern aircraft engines are much more efficient than these massive plumes of aerosols would indicate.
Even assuming absolute humidity conditions, these extensive and persistent trails are not the product of condensation alone.
Patents abound on mechanisms for dispersion of salts (ie Welsbach).</p>

<p>The health implications are severe---From a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15082100">2004 NCBI article hypothesizing on the origin of MS</a>: &quot;The use of Ba as an atmospheric aerosol spray for enhancing/refracting the signalling of radio/radar waves along military jet flight paths...&quot; <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1a22be/public_law_10585_allows_chemtrails_and_biological/c8tlwi3">source</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ultimate goal is to have influence over when storms happen and where. It is probably inconsequential to whoever is in control of it that toxic substances must be used.

    <div class="md"><p>My cut&#39;n&#39;paste stock answer: (cue stock c&amp;p ad hom &quot;King-Hell is a shill!&quot; attack)</p>

<p>First of all, I don&#39;t simply write off every conspiracy theory as the work of paranoid nutters. Many conspiracy theories turn out to be true, like the CIA&#39;s guns-for-cocaine Black Ops in South America.. I don&#39;t accept the official line on 9/11 and I believe the probability is that WTC7 was brought down by a preplanned controlled demolition.</p>

<p>But I just don&#39;t buy into chemtrails. People say they&#39;ve only been happening in the last 20 years but I remember them from my childhood, and there are plenty of pictures on the Internet of <a href="http://depletedcranium.com/the-realities-of-contrails/">World War II bombers</a> turning the sky white with persistent contrails over France and Germany. Back in 1944 these contrails were a serious problem for strategic air command. They pointed like huge arrows in the sky at the incoming bombers.</p>

<p>In the past 30 years there has been an explosion in budget passenger and freight air traffic with 7  to 12 percent year-on increases. Where once there might have been one or two contrails there are now dozens which merge to cover the whole sky in a persistent artificial cloud. This may be a very bad thing. The reduction in sunlight reaching the ground is having an effect on plants and is messing with the weather. If you understand anything about chaos theory you will realise that even the slightest tinkering with the weather can lead to devastating and unpredictable results. </p>

<p>There is a simple scientific explanation for the trails you see criss-crossing the skies. They are plumes of ice which are left when a jetliner burns fuel in a cold wet atmosphere. A large 20 mile long contrail may contain several thousand tons of ice and there isn&#39;t a plane ever built that could carry that amount of any substance to that height in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon. When it burns in air the carbon part combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (Dihydrogen Monoxide, H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is already saturated with water vapour then these crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through a process called deposition and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. </p>

<p>Water is an amazing substance with some unique properties which defy logic. It is important to realise that water does not freeze at zero centigrade. It will freeze at any temperature from zero degrees down to minus 40 (zero degrees is defined as the point where pure frozen water melts, not freezes). Suspended in air it can co-exist as vapour, liquid, and solid simultaneously. Liquid water droplets, ice crystals, and invisible water vapour (cold steam) are found together in clouds where the temperature is minus 40 (centigrade or Fahrenheit; it&#39;s the temperature where they both agree). Even clear air will contain a lot of sub-zero water vapour. It&#39;s not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.</p>

<p>What nobody in the chemtrails camp seems able to do is to explain why and how they are happening. Just that &quot;they are&quot; and that it should be &quot;obvious&quot; to anybody who looks up in the sky (And if you don&#39;t see what they are seeing you are &#39;sheeple&#39; that needs to &#39;wake up&#39;, or you are stupid, or you are a government shill). If it&#39;s being done for rainmaking then &quot;they&quot; picked a peculiar time and place to do it earlier this year. After the wettest winter on record in Southern England, why would anybody want to make more rain when the rivers and reservoirs were already bursting their banks? If it&#39;s for some form of nefarious mind or population control then &quot;they&quot; are doing it to themselves and their families as much as to us. Where is the logic in that? Could it be a benign program to combat global warming? Probably not because that kind of seeding needs to take place in the stratosphere, way above the height that commercial airliners fly at. The theory that it is used in conjunction with HAARP to create tornadoes and earthquakes is intriguing, but again there is no solid evidence – just speculation.</p>

<p>&#39;How?&#39; also goes unanswered. If commercial jetliners are being loaded up with toxic chemicals to spray behind them as they fly then it involves a conspiracy of hundreds of thousands of  people worldwide who own, fly, refuel, maintain, and design aeroplanes. With all those people and all this time do you think that not one person would stand up and blow the whistle? How how many tons of chemicals would it take to create a 20 mile long trail across the sky? Where is it stored on the aircraft, and how is it dispersed? How is it replenished? Who pays for it? Who decides what days are going to be Spray Days? Are the pilots in on the plot, or is the spraying done automatically or controlled remotely? How do crews account for the weight discrepancy when takeoff weight is such an issue that easyJet are disciplining pilots who land with more than 100 kilos of fuel above their emergency minimum? And possibly the most basic question: Why not just do the spraying at night when nobody can see it? </p>

<p>If you are a government wanting to deliver a chemical agent to the population there are far easier and more precise ways of doing it; the Syrians just weld a calor gas cylinder to the front of a rocket and fill it with sarin. If you are pumping chemicals into the jet stream at 30,000 feet over Europe, which country, approximately, do you think they will come down to earth in?</p>

<p>And who are the &quot;they&quot; that are doing it? The illuminati? The lizard people? Reverse vampires? The questions go on and on and never lead to any answers – just more questions.</p>

<p>All of these conspiracy theories could be true, but there&#39;s actually no evidence to support any of them. What evidence is offered can often be traced in a big circle straight back to where it originated in the mind of a another conspiracy theorist, quoted and repeated until it takes on a life of its own. No matter how many times they get debunked, some myths just refused to die, such as the <a href="http://metabunk.org/threads/debunked-chemtrail-plane-interior-ballast-barrels.661/">&#39;secret photos&#39;</a>  of chemical tanks on board aircraft. Just because there&#39;s 100, or 1000 people claiming the same thing doesn&#39;t make it the truth.</p>

<p>Nobody is doubting that <a href="http://englishrussia.com/2013/05/13/moving-clouds-away/">geo-engineering</a> is taking place. The Chinese use it extensively to control rainfall and it was used during the Beijing Olympics to target rain on the capital to help clear the smog. But it was done with specially modified aircraft, rockets and artillery, not commercial airliners flying at 39,000 feet. There are numerous patents for different uses and methods of geoengineering, but no evidence for most of these ideas being taken beyond a proof of concept. Recent research into using a reflective heat shield to combat global warming, for instance, suggests that it may actually make things worse.</p>

<p>Chemtrail campaigners claim that raised levels of aluminium and barium are evidence for artificial spraying, but these are chemicals naturally found in the environment and their raised levels can be explained by mining and <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nKulgztuzL8C&amp;amp;pg=PA408&amp;amp;lpg=PA408&amp;amp;dq=barium+in+atmosphere+explained+by+fossil+fuels&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=QRZQafAhXq&amp;amp;sig=f1_YmX9r_sJap1jvBvdLlMjrM84&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=Cq1kUvrFIYPA0QWftYGwBA&amp;amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=barium%20in%20atmosphere%20explained%20by%20fossil%20fuels&amp;amp;f=false">fossil fuel burning</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, here&#39;s how the chemtrail theory goes:</p>

<p>1) We ignore the physics of jets flying at various tiers of the atmosphere, the relative temperatures of those tiers, the relative humidities of those tiers, and what unaltered jet engine exhaust does in those very diverse conditions.</p>

<p>2) Someone with a shitload of power and money has created the significant infrastructure required to load hundreds of jets daily with the ability to spray ... something ... into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>3) That someone with the same shitload of power and money somehow benefits from the nation being over-sprayed with whatever it is they&#39;re spraying.</p>

<p>4) The infrastructure somehow manages to maintain the relative silence of thousands of aircraft mechanics, technicians, pilots, office workers, etc. who all would have had to have come across the spraying compounds and equipment at some point in their careers. Seriously, it&#39;s harder to find people to rat this conspiracy out than to find people to tell us what&#39;s happening at Area 51 and the population of people who ought to know something about this outnumbers the people who ought to know shit about A-51 by more than 10:1.</p>

<p>Here are the specific questions I have:</p>

<p>1) Who benefits from the over-spraying?</p>

<p>2) How do they benefit?</p>

<p>3) How is the benefit of the effort and expense of maintaining this secret over-spraying benefit <strong>better</strong> than the benefit they could achieve by investing the same effort and money in more legitimate ways?</p>

<p>4) How are they keeping the many thousands of people who would encounter the physical evidence of such a conspiracy silent?</p>

<p>Chemtrails are observed year round in a variety of climates and temperature ranges. Something that seems to be consistently ignored by skeptics. </p>

<p>Weather modification is a decades old science. Also ignored by skeptics. </p>

<p>Further, contrails do not form clouds &quot;almost exactly&quot; the same way they normally form. Any 5th grade Earth science student can tell you that.</p>

<p>The science between the two formations is different. Again, basic accepted science disagrees with you. </p>

<p>Basic science has also determined that weather modification is possible utilizing the same methods that would result in chemical trails showing up across the skies where an operation in under way. Anyone who lives under a flight path or near an airport can tell you the very noticeable difference between chem and contrails, even when they show up in the same area on the same days. </p>
