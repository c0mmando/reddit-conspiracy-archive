    <div class="md"><p>When we went to the moon it was because the USSR was in the position to get there first. Now we have nothing &quot;interesting&quot; to do on the moon. NASA has a limited budget so going to the moon to get some rocks isn&#39;t high on their list of things to do. Now if china was trying to start a moon base.... that would get NASA the funding required to do some shit.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I think NASA should have a much bigger budget so we can explore space. I just understand that the gov would rather blow up a 3rd world country to make a few people rich then try and better man kind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m torn on this topic and ill tell you why but this will not be brief. In my opinion this has gone one of two ways. Either we have never actually been there or when we went there we found something worth immediately classifying. It doesn&#39;t add up for the government to not try to siphon money from us for return trips for &quot;research&quot; based on the limited access we have to what really happened. They could have played this and robbed us for trillions since 1969 if they didn&#39;t really discover anything. What makes me lean more towards evidence of life beyond our planet is EXACTLY your question. Why haven&#39;t we been back? Because either it was a huge publicity stunt or we saw something that would negate every control tactic put in place since the birth of Christianity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s wrongfully assuming that I&#39;m making claims to facts, whereas I&#39;m having discussions about topics that interest me. I don&#39;t claim to know the absolute truth to anything. I have my beliefs, but it&#39;s not my place to convince skeptics that my beliefs are the correct ones.

<p>And don&#39;t try that &quot;poor guy is only trying to help out&quot; bullshit. People that ask for proof of everything are annoying as fuck. Seriously. It&#39;s annoying.

    <div class="md"><p>The thing with being an academic is that you can not just make wild claims and then expect the world to accept them. The world of intelligent people does, unfortunately, not function that way. </p>

<p>While I agree with you--I, myself, believe in some far out claims that I can not substantiate to anyone--I also respect the academic process: the demand for proof, repetition of claims, and statistical analysis are key aspects of how the world of serious thinkers operates.</p>

<p>I only called you out because you are being a dick. You have made multiple denigratory mentions of mentally handicapped people and are quick to jump into name calling. What this usually represents is the inability to actually prove your claims, and then the frustration that results from that. It&#39;s all good, man. We&#39;ve all been there. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll assume you are either a child or uneducated; in which case, I will not spend too much time getting bent out of shape over your &quot;shove things up my ass&quot; quips. Grow up and relax, dude. If your wild claims didn&#39;t exist within a community of those who challenged your ideas, your mental shit would run rampant and your claims would border on the absolute fucking ridiculous.</p>

<p>No, if you explain claims you&#39;ve made to someone who has asked, it&#39;s called having a conversation. &quot;Proselytizing&quot; is making it your goal to convert someone to your belief. </p>

<p>So far you&#39;ve called out shills and trolls like they are actively harassing you, but so far no one has done anything of the sort, at least in this thread. You&#39;re very defensive of the beliefs you hold, if you know them to be true why don&#39;t you enlighten us skeptics who are highly doubtful of your claims. </p>

<p>The thing is, I&#39;m not here with the express intent of convincing you of jack shit. I&#39;m here to talk about an interest of mine with like-minded individuals. </p>

<p>The problem with that is you are actively putting yourself in a position where you are surrounded by people who are affirming your belief. You and your posts reek of insecurity. If you post something publicly then you should have the balls to back it up instead of arrogantly talking down to people who question you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve read about that. It&#39;s kind of weird, considering the moon is (believed to be) made of a large chunk of the Earth, including the heavier elements of the core. Unless it&#39;s been hollowed out due to mining over the past couple hundred thousand years. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a book titled &quot;Who Built the Moon&quot; and the hypotheses it puts forward are pretty fascinating. They go into the correlations of distances and sizes of the moon and Earth. They also talk about how the moon could have possibly been built by humans from the far future because of something something the Earth is an incubator for life and without it life couldn&#39;t have began in the primordial seas on Earth. It&#39;s worth a read if you&#39;re interested in the moon.</p>

<p>Disclaimer for &#39;tards, shills, trolls, and skeptics: it&#39;s not my job to prove anything to you. I didnt write the fucking book, I only read it. I also am not declaring that I blindly believe everything I wrote. If you want proof, I&#39;ve given you enough information to start your own research.</p>

<p>What was it already? I can hardly remember. It&#39;s also connected to our star if I remember correctly, which I probably don&#39;t. It&#39;s peculiar that Sun and Moon appears to be exactly the same size to us. It&#39;s food for thought.</p>

<p>Maybe shes fat? </p>

<p>Besides the asshole-ish joke i just made, and removing the analogy, maybe there isnt much up there? </p>

<p>i find this an extraordinarily interesting question, but i struggle to find any plausible conspiracies with it.</p>

<p>Or, and im just speculating here, maybe there is much up there, that makes us not want to go back. Ive heard of theories about alien bases there, but eh. Not too sure about that one.. </p>

<p>Or, maybe we have been continuing our presence on the moon, but secretly, unbeknownst to the people? With all the secrecy in our government, this might be plausible, but still. Not sure about it.</p>

<p>Is that an original quote? Fricking brilliant.</p>

<p>Imagine a kick ass telescope and science lab at a pole. Could probable do all the experiments they do on the space station at half the cost. There must be something else going on besides &quot;we don&#39;t wanna go back&quot;.</p>

<p>once we find vast resources and the economic forces realize the wealth they can create from space then we will have bases on mars and even trips to habitable planets its a long way off</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing#Manned_landings">There have been 6 manned missions to the moon</a>.</p>

<p>I cannot deny that we have been to the moon, but I can sure as hell deny that the footage that they gave for their first landing was real. I think it was staged entirely to ensure that nothing was to go wrong and to make sure the USSR knew damned well we had made it before them. The trips afterwards would assure that we had gone (whether we touched down with Apollo 11 or not) and would explain why there is a mirror on the moon that can reflect lasers back (from a Mythbuster episode). </p>

<p><em>edit</em>: 6 missions not twelve... it was too early sorry.</p>

<p>The bases are varied. There are bases, as you would call them, undersea in your southern waters near the Bahamas as well as in your Pacific seas in various places close to your Chilean borders on the water. There are bases upon your moon, as you call this satellite, which are at this time being reworked. There are bases which move about your lands. There are bases, if you would call them that, in your skies. These are the bases of your peoples, very numerous and, as we have said, potentially destructive.</p>

<p>as its been postulated, if the technology/knowledge existed way back four/five decades ago, why do we have to reinvent it all again !? this critical knowledge would not be discarded, its priceless. the various NASA and other tech people all talk about how we need to research and perfect high earth orbit technology, it doesn&#39;t make sense from a historic perspective.</p>
