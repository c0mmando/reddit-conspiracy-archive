       This post is for me to disclose some things I know about the bust of alleged Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht.  Not everything, for now, but some things.
      </p>
      <p>
       It centers around
       <a href="http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/10/03/ross-ulbricht-google-f9423f6d10ca93b19d4fa544a0b5e29a4a940e5f-s6-c30.jpg">
        this photo
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I've never been to Silk Road.  I've never consumed or dealt illegal drugs.  I've never met Ross Ulbricht.
      </p>
      <p>
       A copy of this information can be found on the
       <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=316811.0">
        BitcoinTalk forum
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       For the last several years, I've been privy to some inside information on a few public events.  I've never mentioned most of them publicly.  They are simply too crazy to believe.  Frankly, I'd rather not be discussing this one either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first time I saw this picture of Ross Ulbricht was long before his arrest.  I had noticed him on the BitcoinTalk forum, based on some comment he had made, and Googled around and ran across his photo.  The photo told me all I needed to know.  I made a mental note, dismissed him as a troll, and forgot about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortly before the Silk Road bust, I made
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1nnyzi/the_limits_of_propaganda/">
        this post
       </a>
       , which I think is relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second time I saw the photo of Ulbricht was when news of the Silk Road bust broke.  The photo jogged my memory.  I knew I had seen it before.  And I knew the reason such a comical photo was being used so prominently.  I was still not sure, however, exactly who Ross Ulbricht was, or what his involvement was.  I intended to wait until his eventual trial to decide, though I expected there would be some kind of plea deal, and not end up being a trial at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, when Silk Road users such as
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1nqcx6/copy_and_save_this_before_a_mod_deletes_it_they/">
        this one
       </a>
       started coming forward with their own information and experiences, corroborating what I suspected, I felt that I would have to say something.  I sent a
       <a href="http://i36.photobucket.com/albums/e49/benjamindees/silkroad_zpsb2a95b81.png">
        message
       </a>
       to one of them, trying to get some more info on what they thought might be going on.  And now that
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkroadUNcensored/comments/1p0ogt/time_to_let_the_cat_out_of_the_hat/">
        some more irregularities
       </a>
       are beginning to come out, I need to throw in some of what I know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what I can add to this, for now.  Ross Ulbricht is not who he claims to be.  This photo of him is not only altered, but staged.  I have gone back and forth, considering whether he could simply be an unwitting dupe in this, whether someone could have convinced him to
       <a href="http://bitcoinexaminer.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/0420_gavin-andersen-bitcoin_398-1.jpg">
        pose for a photo
       </a>
       in a way that could be used against him.  But considering that the photo is not only staged, but altered as well, I have to assume that he is actively involved in what is, at the very least, an elaborate hoax.  Now that others have come to the same conclusion, I can confirm that I believe this to be the case as well, based on my own evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps I will disclose more at a future date, but I think that's good for now.

       Pretty simple, and happens everyday. You get robbed by your drug dealer. Usually it's only for a few hundred or maybe thousand dollars. In this case, it's plausible the owners of Silk Road staged their own seizure, and made off with the currently-missing $80 MILLION in hard-to-trace Bitcoins that were in escrows and accounts they had unfettered access to.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are you to do in this situation, call the FBI and complain the guy you were committing felonies with buying heroin (for example) online from over state lines stiffed you?

       Why haven't they confirmed either? Why no perp walk for busting one of the biggest drug dealers in history? 
Where is the dude in front of a big logo in a kevlar and cuffs for the big spike-the-ball press conference? When is the last time they skipped that?

       I love a good conspiracy theory as much as the next guy, but this one is just
       <em>
        nuts
       </em>
       .  Aside from the fact that the specific agents, prosecutors, and judges named in the news amd criminal complaints would have already spoken up after seeing their names plastered all over the news for two weeks, I can tell you with 100% certainty that Ross Ulbricht is in Alameda county jail.  I looked him in the eyes at his 10/9 bail hearing in SF, and I'm pretty sure the 15 or more reporters there from places like the associated press and ABC were legit.  His name was on the docket and I found the courtroom just like you would for any defendant.  Nothing out of the ordinary whatsoever.

       Isn't it logical that the silk road was only a starting point for people to make relationships and then never get back on the silk road? And doesn't it also lead to reasoning that the silk road was only one of many? Logics.

      <p>
       I know Ross personally. Check my posting history, I did an AMA and posted proof pics from our high school yearbook. I haven't come across any photoshopped pics of Ross on the web... The one where it looks like he has no teeth is weird but could just be a super awkward photo, I dunno.

       I also know this, Ross IS indeed in custody. I know someone who has been in contact with his family.

       Not sure what you're looking for exactly? All I was saying is that I was friends with Ross, knew him fairly well and I do know he is in custody. I don't think any of the pics are photoshopped. I just linked to a site that court filings said he was chatting with a cooperating witness -- I don't know what court papers are available, if any, to verify this in any way but I was just sharing that with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't want to believe what I've said, that's fine. I know how impossible it is to prove anything to people in this subreddit without being accused of being a shill.

       Forgive me for not providing you with satisfying evidence. Maybe there is more to the story, I can't say, but I know Ross Ulbricht and I know he's in custody.

       Dude.  It's a public process.  Anyone who wants can go to the hearings.  I attended his bail hearing and I can assure you he's in jail.  Whether or not Ross Ulbricht=DPR=Silk Road is the only question.

       I was really good friends with him throughout high school. Hung out several times a week outside of school.

       Edit: not sure if you were referring to Ross when you said SR or the actual site Silk Road -
I had no knowledge of Silk Road the website before he was arrested.

       If your friend is being set-up, which is a possibility (however remote), then the photo is key.  Who took it?  Who modified it?  Who owns the copyright?

       I couldn't tell you where the pic came from, or who took it, but I personally don't think it's been altered. Knowing him first hand makes me confident that I would be able to identify any alterations. The only part of the pic I find weird is his mouth, because he looks like he doesn't have any teeth haha but that could possibly be explained -- maybe he was mid sentence when the photo was snapped? It's odd they chose THAT pic to attach to all the articles online, but who knows. My question is, what do you feel their motive would be to use a photoshopped or altered photo of Ross?? I just don't see the motive behind that? If you check my AMA post, you can see some pics of him I posted, which might help you as a comparison?

       Not sure why my post in the other thread isn't showing, I guess it's buried somewhere.

       I have to admit I thought there was some sketch involved just for the fact there was no Perp Walk. The cops always parade the perp in front of the cameras and have a big press conference, and this would have been one of the biggest drug dealer arrests in history.

       Why haven't they confirmed either? Why no perp walk for busting one of the biggest drug dealers in history? 
Where is the dude in front of a big logo in a kevlar and cuffs for the big spike-the-ball press conference? When is the last time they skipped that?
