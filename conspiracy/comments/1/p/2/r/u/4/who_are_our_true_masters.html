<p>So who are the people at-the-top? Who are the people we can&#39;t make fun of? Who are the ones pulling the strings of members of every government on this planet, because the power surely does not lie with the voters/citizens/people, and it is easier to corrupt a member of any government to have them &#39;do the dirty work&#39; than it is to convince everyone in the nation to become working zombies/slaves.  </p>

<p>Perhaps the banking leaders?</p>

<p>How about the members of OPEC?</p>

<p>Maybe the people profiting off arms sales?</p>

<p>I am sure that I left out many other possibilities, but we need more light shone in dark places, to see the faces of those that have shaped this world of ours to somewhat resemble &#39;1984&#39;.</p>

<p>We have enough say in our destinies as we have free will. Thing is for most of us it&#39;s easy to choose the darker side and be a self serving ass hat but that will only do for a time.</p>

<p>There is still virtue and beauty in the lowliest sorts just as ugliness and harshness exists in the more &quot;civilized&quot; upper crust of society. Black and white and shades of grey. We can still choose to be of service to decent and good hardworking people. That is what a true master does. Everyone else is full of shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well since you can make fun of the people you&#39;re trying to talk about are people you don&#39;t know about. However the quote &quot;If you want to know who is in control then find out who you can&#39;t make fun of&quot; applies to explicit dictatorships moreso than our western democracies, though it still applies. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t only mean that men in a black van will come to get you if you start making bad puns about dear leader. </p>

<p>Think about social media, if you post a political joke on your profile and someone gets offended, reports it and it gets taken down, then that&#39;s a person you can&#39;t make fun of. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not because of a D-notice from the government, it&#39;s because your peers sold you out. The people at the top care little for what your opinion of them is, and wouldn&#39;t care if you were laughing at or with them. </p>

<p>Since you mentioned 1984 I wanted to point out that yeah, it could be like that, but you&#39;re still thinking that it&#39;s a government policy that you can&#39;t make fun of X-leader and Y-executives. It&#39;s actually the people you&#39;d share your jokes with who aren&#39;t laughing at them that makes it impossible for you to poke fun at them in a real manner. </p>

<p>As an anarchist I&#39;d make fun of all kinds of leaders, even ones that have respect on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. If I can&#39;t make fun of Alex Jones, or the moderators of AboveTopSecret.com because someone here will object and make a fuss, then they are leaders I can&#39;t make fun of, because my audience isn&#39;t laughing. </p>

<p>Well, let&#39;s not call the group &quot;The Hidden Hand&quot; per se.  Let&#39;s, instead, phrase the question this way:  Do we know anything about any group as powerful as the Hidden Hand group is said to be besides what is mentioned in this interview?</p>

<p>In <em>that</em> manner, we can begin to <em>certainly</em> wrap our heads around such an influence on this planet.  We know for a fact that there is a group on this planet so powerful that it is above every law and above every government - a group that, as I&#39;ve mentioned before, can (among other things) rape and murder children with seeming impunity and entirely get away with it even AFTER they get all but caught in the act (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvl6kO1Vo8">Conspiracy of Silence</a> as but one example of what certain groups are capable of doing).</p>

<p>This, again, is but one example, and it alone seems to illustrate sufficiently that, again, there is a force on this planet that works above and beyond what <em>most</em> humans would consider even possible in a civilized society.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No idea actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can the webmasters get the posters&#39; IP address?</p>

<p>I would imagine they might be able to, but I&#39;m not certain if the webmaster would be willing to do this.</p>
