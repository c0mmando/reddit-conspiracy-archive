        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, didn&#39;t get to watch Survivor tonight, local news was covering this in <a href="http://www.king5.com/news/local/May-Day-march-Seattle-Central-Capitol-Hill--205690431.html">Seattle</a>.</p>

<p>I kept getting very irritated as the anchors at the TV station kept talking about the &quot;highly trained&quot; police and how they were showing a <a href="http://media.king5.com/images/600*338/050113timesflashbang.jpg">lot of restraint</a>. Curiously this was somewhat undermined when one of their remote journalists got fragged by a flash-bang and was reporting it.  </p>

<p>I saw on camera an older man in a red t-shirt get pushed three times by police onto the sidewalk when all he was trying to do was grab his bicycle that was leaning up against a building.  </p>

<p>I did see one guy on the news camera holding a rock and wearing a bandana, but nearly everyone else visible in the coverage was what you&#39;d expect people to look like on the streets of Seattle.</p>

<p>The Examiner headline:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/anarchists-cause-may-day-riot-downtown-seattle">Anarchists cause May Day riot in downtown Seattle</a></p>

<p>You know what? I saw thugs in body armor causing a riot and people reacting in various ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take away for a moment the very real possibility of what you are saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>probably agent provocateurs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even without such manipulations, we have reached a point in the powder keg where these things are going to happen routinely and grow in intensity. This is how things progress once the aggression is unleashed. </p>

<p>Recipe for instant riots: add cops in body armor, a little shove or some dictatorial words to one or two individuals.</p>

<p>This is how the police state &quot;resolves&quot; conflict: <em>it doesn&#39;t</em>, it thrives on it and grows stronger for it. </p>

<p>So more bombings, more protests, more fear, more unrest, more discontent, more poverty, more war, the whole sum of human suffering brings more power to the State.</p>

<p>The pump has been primed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt they were agent provocateurs, police don&#39;t need things like that too often, and more likely than not, it was just a small group of jackasses that always try and stir shit up. The police react, then people over react, and then this causes panic to quickly spread among both the police and the crowds as both sides start losing order, thus the chaos ensues.</p>

<p>there&#39;s never a shortage of assholes anywhere that will always start shit unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>both can be true, but according to Occam&#39;s razor, it is more often the simpler assumption that is correct. and while a provocateur is possible, we should assume the logical idea first that it was most likely a few people in the crowd that started a chain of events that lead to this, and unless there is sufficient evidence that proves otherwise instead of just hearsay, we should accept this as the most plausible answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A week ago we see posting about increases in DHS presence on the streets of Seattle.  Everyone says nothing to see here.</p>

<p>Now we have riots in Seattle, lucky for us there was increased police presence to control the &quot;anarchists.&quot;</p>

<p>Cue police apologists coming in here to say there isn&#39;t any evidence that anyone not actively involved in the disruption was harmed in any way.  Police maintained their cool the entire time, only used necessary force etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Olivia One Feather of Covington joined the crowd Wednesday night because she wanted to see how police handled the protest. She said she wasn’t impressed, adding that she was pepper sprayed in the face while trying to video record officers.</p>

<p>Other demonstrations and rallies in Olympia, Mount Vernon, Spokane, Vancouver, Walla Walla, Wenatchee and Yakima went along peacefully.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course you would expect that.....of course, that surely is the most obvious and simple answer.  That is always the best option.</p>

<p>No, no.  That&#39;s what they tell you, and that&#39;s what you regurgitate.  </p>

<p>What is happening really is, they tell you that because it gives them perfect opportunity to get more police and security there to &quot;protect you&quot;.  That&#39;s all.</p>

<p>They just gave you the easy answer so they can justify their presence.  </p>

<p>There are other ways to dissuade protesters and rioters.  An increase in the police state will do nothing but ramp up the issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh.</p>

<p>I listened to the Seattle Police with my two-scanner, two-SDR, digital decoding setup.  Mostly they were pretty chill.  When 8pm rolled around and the protesters started smoking joints in the park, the police were completely psyched to go home.  The SWAT team got demobilized as soon as possible.  The extra units got sent home same.  </p>

<p>I actually felt a tiny bit uncomfortable with how quickly the police demobilized once the protesters were dispersing throughout Capitol Hill.  I thought maybe some roaming around the outskirts of Capitol Hill would be nice (15th-19th, James-Yesler,  the area north around Prospect, and the Melrose corridor on the west.  So, SPD, if you&#39;re reading this, the community is looking for a little more visible presence during the wind down.</p>

<p>Seattle May Day went a lot better this year than last, in terms of property damage.  It was unfortunate that this year the property damage was funneled into the streets (Pike St) which happens to house a number of bars.  The windows got broken on bars this year instead of on banks.</p>

<p>The number of people injured by protesters was less this year.  Unfortunately, some injuries were severe (skateboard to the head, ouch).</p>

<p>The number of people committing the violence was WAY down from last year.  It sounded as if no more than a dozen people were responsible for pretty much all the injuries.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have been out to watch the SPD in riots several times.  So have my buddies.  Over the years since WTO, their response has been getting more and more effective, and less and less violent.</p>

<p>At WTO, I saw police departments of the region completely lose their cool and hurt innocent people by the scores.  My neighbor is a cool observer who saw the riots break out in that incident.  He states that poor policing allowed rioters to throw gasoline bombs at the police, causing confusion and inciting a conflict between the crowd and the police.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have seen thugs in body armor.  In fact, during WTO I was at one point chased by a baton-wielding thug who was restrained by his sergeant.  I didn&#39;t see any thuggery in body armor last night.</p>

<p>Also, the stove-piping of the Seattle Superhero Phoenix Jones was itself a beautiful thing.  His crew got into an altercation with a clown brigade.</p>

<p>WTO was crazy.  Last year&#39;s May Day was extreme, but less so than WTO.  This year&#39;s May Day was unfortunate.  Except for the part with the superheroes and the Clowns in action, which was the best part by far.</p>

<p>An iron hand in a velvet glove is far more effective than a brute squad bashing skulls not caring who sees them. The end result is the same: people are labeled unreasonable if they disparage the response to such protests as being heavy handed. The reply is that the police are &quot;show restraint and are well trained&quot; and that the &quot;hooligans&quot; had to be dispersed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I agree with that sentiment.  On the other hand, I have to balance it with the actual vandals that are part of the situation.  The people who were hitting bystanders on the head with skateboards were basically nobodies -- just the usual criminal thugs that roam Seattle&#39;s streets, pretty much drummed up by the display of force.  So in a sense you are correct, but the presence of the thump-head-with-skateboard types (of which there have been a few lately, it&#39;s not just a May Day thing), is also an issue.  I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a <em>conspiracy</em> b/c I don&#39;t think yesterday&#39;s thugs were agents provocateur.  That&#39;s as opposed to the WTO riots, which to me sounded like a possible conspiracy by trained persons instigating them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fair point, I used the Examiner headline as an indication of how reporting (if it is reported) such things is done in a particular way. </p>

<p>To be honest, I didn&#39;t catch the date of the Examiner post, I had been searching for coverage of the Seattle events and came up with very little. For instance, Drudge Report and CNN had nothing even several hours after the tear gas and flash bangs were being used. So I found the same local news channel that had been broadcasting live and used their story as the primary link.</p>

<p>These protests on May Day are somewhat of a tradition now and outside of the local news not really on the national radar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are actually protesting corporatism and the government it employs; I don&#39;t think they know what freedom and free-market system actually means, and I see them as conflating it with this monstrosity we have striding over the world today.</p>

<p>If someone told me what we have at present is a capitalist system (and I didn&#39;t know any better) I&#39;d be thinking its <em>opposite</em> would probably be an improvement. <strong>Capitalism was never meant to be a form of government</strong>. You can&#39;t sell justice and influence to the highest bidder. I see what we have like a cancer; cancer cells take something good and it goes out of balance: cells that normally thrive and maintain structure start destroying the cells around them as they grow. The tools of capitalism were never made for government, a system in itself which needs to be contained and balanced.</p>

<p>If you boil it down, one comment made by a person there sums it up rather nicely:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“They don’t have any manners. They don’t say please or give you time to get out of the way,” she said. Of the protesters, she added, “They’re doing what we need to do to stand up to ourselves. These are our streets and we have the right to take them.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>She came there to bear witness and see for herself. What she saw is what more and more Americans and others around the world are seeing: corporations/elitists using the police state.</p>
