    <div class="md"><p>Yes. People may disagree with his ideas economically or whatever; however it is most likely they have not spent as much of their life reading into those ideas so meh.</p>

<p>But one thing that is very important, is that people cannot find a corrupt side to him. They may disagree with him- but they cannot find a way that he was bribed or has ulterior motives- there just aren&#39;t any. For any man to go for years and years and have that be the case is one of the strongest testaments to good character I have seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually he only wanted to end <strong>federal</strong> involvement with public schooling, <strong>federal</strong> parks, and <strong>federal</strong> funding of medical research. </p>

<p>If you believe the federal involvement with schools, which is unconstitutional and otherwise shown to be a net negative - be my guest.</p>

<p>If you would prefer the warring and torturing section of the us government to be in control of vast swaths of land- be my guest.</p>

<p>And if you would like the federal government making it nearly impossible for researchers outside of the ones the federal government supports to make a living, be my guest. </p>

<p>But unfortunately, when you look into the reasons why those things are controlled federally- you will start to see why it isn&#39;t such a great idea. The federal government does not care about the education of the youth, nor does it care about the health of the populous, nor does it care about nature. It cares about money, and power. Once you start reading between the lines of these things heralded as &quot;great achievements&quot; and the &quot;glorious and giving federal government&quot; you will see it is fraud, and their actions are not pristine nor with pure heart. They are manipulative and power grabbing actions. </p>

<p>Shut them down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a very long time Paul wanted to end <strong>all</strong> public schooling, not just federal involvement.  When he landed on the national stage he had to tone down the craziest of his crazy ideas to avoid being laughed out of debates, so he did.  He long opposed all publicly mandated and publicly provided schooling.  </p>

<p>The federal government has done an outstanding job with the national parks for over a hundred years.  Why would we want to end one of the few things that we can nearly all agree they do well?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>However there is a difference in political choice and plans and personal views. If you can find one instance of him stating he wanted to mandate that towns and cities can not provide public schooling I&#39;ll wear the hat of shame. But you will not be able to. Stating a personal viewpoint and hope is much different than saying or implying that states or cities cannot choose to do what the citizens of that district wish.</p>

<p>You are correct in that he would like public schooling to return to private. </p>

<p>The national parks are just going to be used by the federal government for  war efforts someday. They are poorly managed, cost shitloads of money when they can be run for free, and perpetuates the idea that the federal government can steal land from people legally.</p>

<p>There are two private parks in my city. Guess how much they cost to people? Guess how natural they are? They are full of animals, no zoos, and are quite beautiful. There is no pavement, just trails. They cost no money to enter, yet are able to be kept clean by volunteers. National parks cost money to enter which is just fucking insane if you think that they are public- they are not. They are just a business that could be profitable by any company if the company wasn&#39;t taxed. </p>

<p>Edit: What I realize is that I had originally interpreted the first response I replied to with assuming want = political wants and not personal wants. If you meant personally, I misunderstood you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, you do realize that we (our local and state government) got along just fine without the giant federal governments involvement for 150 years?  Our test scores and level of education was vastly superior (and cheaper).  Poor people didn&#39;t PAY anything, it was done with local and state tax dollars.  </p>

<p>Ron Paul wants to destroy the Board of Education (the giant money sucking machine) that does NOTHING but put every student into the same box and dictates what our children should be learning.  They have failed miserably.  Again, he&#39;s not for the abolishment of education (what a silly thing to suggest) he for letting it go back to the state and local level.</p>

<p>In regards to your privatizing parks that news to me. I&#39;ve never heard him say anything like your suggesting, and to the best of my recollection, it should again, be LEFT to the STATE to decide.</p>

<p>Why should the government decide who and how much of our tax money gets spent on medical research.  The vast majority of money provided for medical research already comes from PRIVATE donations.  Leave it to the private sector.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Education: The idea that the average American 150 years ago had a level of education &quot;vastly superior&quot; to the average American today is a blatant falsehood.  Many children did not attend school at all, or only attended until they were 10 or 11 and old enough to work on the farm full time.  Public schools are not great these days of course, but abolishing them is ludicrous. </p>

<p>National parks: Many parks cross state lines.  Paul absolutely wants to abolish all federal land.</p>

<p>Medical research: The government uses our tax money for many purposes.  One that I thought we could all get behind is the use of that money to cure horrible diseases, including those which do not get enough private funding.  Paul specifically opposed funding for AIDS research in the 1980s.  He&#39;s a kook.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brave opinion to have around here, my tin-foil hat&#39;s off to you and your testicular fortitude.</p>

<p>While I generally agree with parts of Paul&#39;s general message, I do think many forget the devil is in the details.  Big ideas take cooperation and even compromise to come to fruition.</p>

<p>When he first ran in the primaries, I really liked that he spoke strongly against US imperialism and other similar ideas - but once he made it clear he would intend to gut the EPA, FDA, Dept. of Education etc. immediately, many don&#39;t realize the kind of instability and chaos that would cause.  Regardless if those institutions&#39; existence is right or wrong, their <em>immediate</em> disappearance would likely be catastrophic IMO.</p>

<p>All in all, I&#39;ve since considered him an idealist and Libertarian figurehead.  I&#39;d like to think he is at least sincere and well-meaning, but who can really tell?  He at least seems to get people to think, which cannot be overlooked.</p>

<p>I like what I&#39;ve seen and heard out of Sanders, but were he elected to the highest office of the land, he would likely be blocked at every turn by the establishment-run House and Senate - worse than Obama has been.</p>

<p>Sucks you&#39;re getting downvoted so much - even if one were to disagree with your opinions, you&#39;re not being rude or saying anything irrelevant to the topic, moreover politely elaborating your position; so thanks for contributing.</p>

<p>Personally I would like to see Judge Napolitano run. He has great insight about the rights of man vs government rights regarding US Constitutional law.</p>

If they did manage to change the population and win the system would break them and I mean that in the sense that they could get nothing done. It is time for us to realize that as long as we have a monetary system true democracy with the intent of the freedom and well being of the people is impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a great way to convince skeptical people that voting might actually matter.  It has failed before, it will probably fail again.  The system is broken, voting won&#39;t change a thing this point.  Your vote is a pathetic plea to an elector in a desperate attempt to persuade them to vote your way - <em>if</em> it is even properly accounted.</p>

<p>In my mind, it&#39;s like receiving the death penalty and asking to get it swifly and painlessly - you are still going to die, and it&#39;s still up to your captor how it will be done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually he only wanted to end <strong>federal</strong> involvement with public schooling, <strong>federal</strong> parks, and <strong>federal</strong> funding of medical research. </p>

<p>If you believe the federal involvement with schools, which is unconstitutional and otherwise shown to be a net negative - be my guest.</p>

<p>If you would prefer the warring and torturing section of the us government to be in control of vast swaths of land- be my guest.</p>

<p>And if you would like the federal government making it nearly impossible for researchers outside of the ones the federal government supports to make a living, be my guest. </p>

<p>But unfortunately, when you look into the reasons why those things are controlled federally- you will start to see why it isn&#39;t such a great idea. The federal government does not care about the education of the youth, nor does it care about the health of the populous, nor does it care about nature. It cares about money, and power. Once you start reading between the lines of these things heralded as &quot;great achievements&quot; and the &quot;glorious and giving federal government&quot; you will see it is fraud, and their actions are not pristine nor with pure heart. They are manipulative and power grabbing actions. </p>

<p>Shut them down. </p>
