       I do think that the Boston bombing stinks to high heaven of something shady going down. The story just doesn't add up. Same with Sandy Hook, something about it doesn't seem right either. I don't have proof or a shitty youtube video to outline my theory, that's just what I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now. In regards to crisis actors involved with either event, I think it is mostly bullshit. Here is why.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any of you have been following conspiracies for a while, you will know that the people who design any false flag don't give a fuck about hiring actors to make things more believable. Why do that when you can just kill them?
      </p>
      <p>
       An actor involves too much secrecy and too big of a chance that something will leak. The idea that the government would plan a false flag and hire actors is ridiculous. If they plan a false flag, people are dying. They won't even bat an eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOW.
I do think there is a possibility that actors are placed for witness interviews or something like that. Or maybe someone is planted to control the narrative for propaganda purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, from everything I have seen, there is absolutely no reason the government or it's agencies would care if anyone died or not. 9/11 anyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, 9/11 did happen and A LOT of people died. And yes, I do think we in the very LEAST let it happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's move on from the whole crisis actor theory. Shit's weak.

       Notice that in this actors theory no one has ever articulated a conspiracy theory to explaiin the elephant in the livingroom - the lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do they interrupt real lives? People died. People that were know to be full bodied are now amputees.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you make that happen without it being real?
      </p>
      <p>
       So- to attempt a conspiracy theory, for the sake of argument, lets pretend that the "spy agency" part of the job is to conjur up fictitious people. SO the idea would be that the victims never really existed and no one really knows them they just assume other people do.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the case of a Jeff Bauman, under this conspiracy theory? He has to I guess go on with this identity? There has to be a Jeff Bauman with no legs from now on?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't imagine a conspiracy to explain that last problem.  You would have to have a guy who lost his legs recently and people didn't know,  about it, and haven't seen him recently and this new thing is spliced over the real event in his life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone got any better tricks to make that happen?  This is where the Actors thing totally just falls apart, and you end up looking like a fool for even considering the ugly idea.  I hate to put it that way.  I don't want to discourage anyone's conspiracy theory, I want to encourage them. Do you just need a core team of liars that claim they knew him and live the lie from now on?

       A disaster drill does not a crisis actor conspiracy make.

       Just because disaster drills exist does not inexorably lead to the fact that all events are just played by actors.

       disinfo clown is very stable job, you will not believe how well it pays. And with more people finding the truth everyday, there are more of us hired all the time, I just got my friend a nice cushy job, government benefits and the promise of a private FEMA trailer once they round everyone up and make them share living spaces to make room for the dolphin overlords.

       Madmalloy, you still truly believe that the government employs a team of flashmob actors, a group that includes media, ambulances, gays doing costume design, spfx guys, all that which was reheresed to go off without a hitch.

       Yet this team of well prepared government agents fucked up so royally, you and a team of internet sleuths were able to figure it out...
      </p>
      <p>
       My god I can't believe bad acting almost took down the government. They need to send more FBI actors to acting school, I think Juilliard is taking applications.

       Again, do a search on disaster drills and pretend casualties and get back to me. They are told to pretend to help for practice.

       I did it, I cannot believe you are right. They used crisis actor to train EMTs! they used them for the military. I had no idea, thank you,,

       OMG&lt; we need to expose this right away, fuck the internet. Who wants to come with me to Boston and lets harrass all the actors until they tell the truth. Drag them from their hospital beds where they are pretending to be injured. lets drag them into the streets until they stop acting and give us our country back.

       No, I can't, you are telling everything I ever believed or held true was a lie. Have some more compassion for someone waking up? Did they treat you this poorly when you first saw the truth?

      <p>
       We should do something, fuck just talking on the net. Let's go to Boston, drag these actors from their fake hospital beds and throw them into the streets to show them the farce they are. Are you with me?

       Oh of course you're not because you couldn't possibly take action. You are afraid, and I get it, maybe the man has talked you into shilling? I mean your account is so new.

       That doesn't prove anything. Look, I am with you on the fact that Boston doesn't add up. To be it looks like an FBI or CIA situation. Dude was probably "radicalized" by an agent over a period of time and talked into doing the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hiring actors to pretend they are hurt to make it believable isn't necessary when you can make it look super real by actually hurting/killing people
      </p>
      <p>
       Hiring actors is too nice. Why would they give a fuck? They already killed thousands during 9/11. What's 3, 4 more?

       This would be very easy to find out. Go to Boston or if you live there ask the hospital or police for the guy's identity, if they deny you, submit a written request under the FOIA act about his identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you find out his full name you can easily track him and find out if he was an amputee before or not.

       I just wish we had journalists who would investigate this, from either MSM or alternative news and the reality is we don't have any real investigation from MSM or alternative.
