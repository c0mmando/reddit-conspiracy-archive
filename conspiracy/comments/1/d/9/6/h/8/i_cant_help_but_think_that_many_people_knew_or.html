       I find it hard to believe that noone knew this kid was a danger or was up to something.  If he was storing these "pyrotechnics" on a college campus, surely ALOT of people knew.  Did he live in a solo dorm? It just doesn't make sense...   I am not big on conspiracy theories much, but you certainly have to think a fairly successful  pot dealing student storing "pyrotechnics" on campus in college dorm said to always smell like marijuana would have drawn flags somewhere.

      <p>
       Two college friends of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev who were jailed by immigration authorities the day after his capture had nothing to do with the deadly attack and had seen no hints that he harbored any violent thoughts or terrorist sympathies, a lawyer for one of them said Friday.

       How is it not plausible that someone could not hide something from their friends? If you can hide a significant amount of weed from your friends and your RA, you can certainly hide some fireworks. Even if their friends did see the fireworks, who would really give them a second thought? If one of my college roommates had fireworks under his bed, I'd just assume he was shooting bottle rockets out of his butt on weekends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as an aside, not everyone who disagrees with you is a 'disinfo agent'. Saying so is not conducive to actual rational and civil discussion.

       Yeah, that's exactly what I said. Oh, wait. No, it isn't even remotely what I said. Pretty classic strawman argument.

      <p>
       What I said was that just because the dude was social and had friends does not prevent him from hiding a large firework under his bed in his dorm room. If you can hide shit that will get you kicked out of school, you can certainly hide fireworks. I made absolutely no claim as to any other details of the conspiracy.

       No, I'm claiming that it is both possible and plausible that he hid fireworks under his bed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your original argument was this in response to a comment about hiding weed and thus the ease of hiding fireworks:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He was social and had friends, not a loner. How many pounds of fireworks do you have squirreled way?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Followed by this, again doubting that he could have hid said fireworks, or he wouldn't have fireworks because he was sociable:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I bet he hid it in the attic And he pretended to be a nice guy in the mirror every night. You are amazing in the BS you try to push.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What I have subsequently demonstrated is that it not only is there copious room in which to hide something under a dorm bed, readily purchasable firework mortar charges would easily fit and be easily concealable in any range of containers under said bed. I cannot say whether or not that is what he actually did nor did I say that the scenario I gave was what definitively happened. Conversely, you cannot say that he did not hide fireworks under his bed. However, I have provided a very plausible scenario that easily contradicts your argument that he could not have hid such a thing as fireworks because he was not an asocial loner.

       You continue to blatantly mischaracterize my argument and state I have said things I have explicitly not said. Again, pretty standard logical fallacy strawman.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have claimed that I have said that my scenario must be true. Nowhere have I said or argued that. What I have argued is that a plausible explanation exists as to where he could hide fireworks in a dorm, and that being a social person would not lead to a disqualification of said explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, in the response you just replied to claiming I was stating it had to be true, I explicitly said the exact opposite. So, either you did not read my comment or you are deliberately misrepresenting my words.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I cannot say whether or not that is what he actually did nor did I say that the scenario I gave was what definitively happened.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What you replied:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He might've in some imaginary scenario, so it must be true by your BS.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And earlier, you attempted to construct yet another strawman of my argument by saying I claimed to have commented on his motivation, when I made absolutely no mention of any motivation or any such thing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So you're saying this kid was turned into a Terminator by the internet in between music lessons and getting high.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So yes, this is really stupid. What's stupid is your boldfaced and continuous attempts to insert words opposite of what I have explicitly said into my argument in some attempt to make your own argument look less retarded.

       Yet, you continue to refuse to acknowledge my statement directly opposing you stating that I said this must be true. I said that I didn't know whether or not this is what had happened, just that it was a plausible explanation to contradict your original claim that because he was social and had friends, he couldn't have hid fireworks. I can't argue with people who continuously resort to logical fallacies and mischaracterize the opponent's arguments repeatedly. Good day, sir. I hope the Federal boogie man doesn't jump out of your closet and pump you full or mind-control drugs and fluoridated water.

       Ok, so we've seen friends of his say that he was completely normal, chill, and would never be a terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you turn in a completely normal friend of yours in college if you saw he had fireworks and weed in his dorm? That's assuming that he didn't sufficiently hide them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know how spacious his room was, either. Not only did I have a separate, lockable room, but I had a huge closet when I lived in the dorms. My friends didn't come into my room because we had a common area / living room. It's really not hard to hide things.

       All he did was make an observation. He didn't claim to know what happened. What was he supposed to do? "Let me keep this to myself, lest I incur the wrath of hawkspur1". Dismissing things that dont fit your idea of what happened makes you just as bad as the "conspiracy theorists".
