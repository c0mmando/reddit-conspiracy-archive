       : I have taken a minute to calm down, and banning people under 1 month may be extreme, but we should at least seriously consider banning people with accounts under 5 days old, who only have a history of Boston threads.

       Go ahead, make a post undermining the official story, you are at zero within three minutes and at -3 in under five minutes. Every. Time.

       redditors who are not here with a covert agenda, begin to upvote you (because you are just asking questions), and you arrive at 1 after five or more upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same is happening with posts, not just comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, its one of the biggest admittance of guilt in the history of this subreddit. They have recognized that this is the place where the critical thinkers have gone, and it is now a battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you see a fishy comment that seems to be made for the purpose of diffusing an argument or bashing a question-asker, click on the username. You will also see the pattern.

        EDIT
       </strong>
       : Also, has anyone else noticed that the only place to get updated coverage on the Boston event is on r/conspiracy? And I am obviously not talking about the conspiracy stuff, I am talking about simple updates like the one about #2 not having a gun in the boat. That isn't a conspiracy, that is an updated media fact. Yet, I see none of these updates hit the main reddit page, ever.

       I've yet to see any legitimate evidence that the Boston bombing official story is a fabrication or a cover-up. In fact most of the evidence I've seen presented has been barely even circumstantial, so that's why I've downvoted it.

       I'm anti-gun in general, to be honest so I am in favour of gun control. Of course I do not support marshal law, but how can you argue that the tactics used by the police departments involved in the manhunt were not effective? Putting an area on lockdown for a temporary period of time (less than 24 hours) for the safety of residents is far from being malicious or sinister.

       why would we care about your opinion on gun control, you don't even live here. how do you even know what it's like? from reading reddit? you basically peeking into people's windows and trying to give them advice. turn off computer, go outside and deal with issues in your own country.

       This is a joke isn't it? Throughout the history of the world there has always been a clear distinction between the armed forces and the common citizens but suuuure let's be Oprah in this bitch and give everyone automatic weapons and tanks! Fearmongering xenophobes like you are much more detrimental to our society than what you claim to be against.

       he may be bit of a troll. the best way is to ignore them. they whither up if not paid any mind. He doesn't do any justice to his cause but then again he is part of the masses, and the masses do not make policy decisions. Thank God.

       Well I know how I behave. If someone suggests a theory I think is dumb I don't immediately start calling them a delusional conspiratard etc. like some here love to, I either won't say anything or I'll try and civilly point out the holes out in their claim.

       Whenever I click a link here at r/conspiracy I go into it with an open mind.  You have to, otherwise what's the purpose of questioning everything?  Unfortunately, I'm the type of person who links evidence and sources to support their claim.  The thing is, many users are either too lazy to do it or have no source.  When that happens of course someone is going to call them out on their bullshit..  If somebody doesn't do it, what is keeping some innocent and easily convinced person from reading and believing?  I'm sure there were some people who believed the claims in r/conspiracy that Sunil Trapathi was one of the bombers, while there was no evidence to back those claims.  I can see how these claims could cause people to get upset and say something out of line...  Because the claim itself was completely out of line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, there are those awesome users who have links to everything known to the internet.  Those dudes, they fuckin rock.  The ones with open minds at least!

       This was in reference to the previous comment (now deleted) that suggested this. Your reply of "than dont come here," suggests that if you dont like debating conjecture, you shouldn't visit the subreddit.

       Nope. The " ridiculous claims without reasoning or debate" was directly from the comment that was deleted. That's why I posed the question.

       Im trying to point out that there are a significant number of people in this sub (or perhaps a handful of REALLY vocal people) who immediately throw the "shill" word around to anyone who disagrees with their comment. It may not have been you, but it is prevalent in this sub.

This isn't about questioning opinions it's about people berating others for their opinions, kinda like you just did by saying 99 percent of the people here are stupid and illogical.

       I got your back man.  That's how the majority of "veteran" users here are.  Also, their theories don't have to have evidence, or sources.  But if you don't believe them?  You're working for the CIA/FBI trying to infilitrate r/conspiracy in hopes of gaining all the identities of every user so we can round everyone up in our FEMA camps.  lol

       To be fair you guys do a lot of the humiliating yourself by making outlandish claims, and not providing sources.  I've had 2 discussions in the past 24 hours where the user wouldn't send me a link to their source(one being the aunt of the boston bombers saying that was the oldest brother who was stripped and arrested).  The guy said I should look it up myself, and that I don't really want the truth anyway.

       Just coming here to say I visited here only after the bombings. I'm not a full fledged conspiracy theorist by any means, but I love hearing people's ideas and opinions and being given stuff to sit around and think about.  I've learned a lot of interesting stuff, some of it may or may not be true, while other stuff seems pretty legit. I have encountered nothing but calmness and civility while discussing things and asking questions, so I just wanted to post to ask that not all newbies get lumped together like this? I never downvote here myself, I just come here to read and upvote when people give me their insight. I also have noticed the downvoting, but from what I've seen so far people aren't downvoting my posts for some reason even though I am continually questioning what the hell is going on (maybe because I'm late to the discussion, I don't know). Sorry some people literally have nothing better to do than get on here and downvote. I'd be really sad if it was made private...

       No, the solution is to have moderators who ban obvious trolls. Banning all users under 1 month would do more harm than good.

       I agree, you can't just ban people who's accounts are less than one month (that would seriously harm Reddit, and is unfair to people who are legitimately opening accounts).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it would be far better to simply limit the number of accounts in a given calender year.  I would suggest 3 per IP address.  That way, when a troll is removed, he can't just create a new account over and over again.

       So you want to ban the people who are making posts containing common sense, evidence, and most importantly sources?
      </p>
      <p>
       But lets keep around those who continuously call those who disagree with them a "shill"(I've been called a shill more than once).  The kind of users who change the subject, or refuse to post their source.  I've even seen someone say they weren't giving up their source because the person has only been on reddit for 6 months.  Give me a fucking break.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although those close minded users(probably 90% of this sub) are fun to debate with.  I enjoy linking sources while they call me a shill, yet them having no proof or sources for their argument.  That's fun.

       Really?  You've never seen someone call another a "shill?"  You've never seen someone change the topic, or decline posting sources?  We must not be looking at the same subreddit..
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I will hunt down these few most recent arguments I've seen, and even copy/paste a couple conversations I've had with users that won't post sources and call me a shill.  Give me a lil bit to find em, and get them in order.

       I assume you don't have the link to the interview where the aunt says that it was Tamerlan that was forced to strip before being arrested. If you did you would have no problem proving me wrong.

I would but the kooks here at r/conspiracy are more entertaining. It's also too easy to debunk some of the theories, and it's SO funny when you ask for sources. 90% of the time they just make an excuse like you did. Which just validates my presumptions

FBI has been reported visiting people and taking their cameras and deleting photos. The teacher for example.

      <p>
       [–]AdviCeSC2 1 point 14 hours ago
The teacher went to the bombsite a few days later and was taking photos. That is when he was confronted by someone from the FBI who personally deleted the photos of the scene. The FBI DID NOT visit him at home to delete the photos.
Who is your source for the reports of FBI visiting people at work/home to delete photos?
      </p>

Find it yourself.

I don't care what you think. The bombing was staged, actors were used and patsies were killed and shot at unarmed. Boston experience a taste of martial law. And they cheered the police for all of their incompetence. Rubes.

Can you hook me up with sources, please? I'm very interested in this whole crisis actor thing.. I mean they had to hire A LOT of people for the Marathon, and had to make sure NO civilians were around the finish line. Also I am surprised they hired an activist(Carlos Arredondo) to "help" Bauman stop from bleeding out and get him to an ambulance.
      </p>
      <p>
       can you link me to your sources?

       The complaints are not because people don't want to have discussions about topics the problem is this sub is being overrun with arseholes who're just making sarcastic arrogant comments about how stupid certain theories are.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is with generally insulting condescending behaviour that is bringing the whole sub down. Why would people want to suggest ideas if others are just going to insult them? Instead of creating somewhere for free thought that atmosphere creates exactly the opposite effect.

       I just made this same argument over on R/UFOs, complaining about that sub and this one. This one is much worse but UFOs is getting to be just as bad. I was told by 3 different people to stop whining. I was told that the Trolls are necessary to "police" the sub to stop "UFO nuts and Conspiratards" from making wild unsubstantiated claims and being dicks is necessary to weed out the weak and either make them stronger people or make them go away. There seems to be quite a bit of hostility brewing in this post. Lots of fuck you's and fuck off. Sad, sad people.

       What is this society coming to when rational discussion is shunned and juvenile name calling is considered the proper way to refute someones claims. Reddit is really going down hill, I wish there was another site to go to.

       The super rude jerks should just be banned, calling people names it not in anyway showing evidence or logically disproving what someone else has to say. But thanks to the mainstream media these people have learned that calling someone crazy or stupid = disproving their argument.

       Here's the thing..  Most of the new users are here because of what happened in Boston, not because theyre on the FBI/CIA payroll.  Most of them like a little bit of evidence to go along with a persons' claims.  Now, most of the time the person suggesting the theory would have no problem posting sources...  Unfortunately there have been theories coming about like the whole thing being staged, and it was all actors.  Do you not understand how that theory could upset someone?  I honestly hope you do..
      </p>
      <p>
       This theory might actually upset some people because people actually died, and were injured.  So, those of you claiming they are all actors is kind of like hitting those victims while theyre down.  Most people find that sort of thing wrong, and not cool.  So, they might get bent out of shape that users are suggesting this as INNOCENT PEOPLE WERE INJURED AND KILLED.  When the only source they provide is a video to a
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpIkY24xmKQ">
        Military Training involving actors
       </a>
       on youtube, of course people are going to look at you like "wtf," because there's no fucking evidence to support your claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, when you make outlandish claims and don't have evidence how can you expect people to be intrigued enough to actually debate it?

       I've been seeing a LOT of messages in the sub from fresh faces calling for all kinds of self-censorship; banning new users, creating yet another r/conspiracy splinter sub, and the persistent calls to make the sub private.
      </p>

       I'd only note that the people calling for these things aren't discussing how to keep robust conversation alive in those cases. And I feel like that's the point.

       I actually had messaged the mods last night. I do have some thoughts about the bombings but decided not to post them because of where I work at UMass and what I know, I do not want my job at risk god forbid anyone at work sees the post and ties it to me. (Even thought its nothing too crazy, just something that hasn't been mentioned at all since the bombings and I just do not want to chance it) I was going to use a throwaway to throw out the questions I had, but I do see where you are coming from, trying to keep the trolls down. For now I will keep the questions in my head.

       I sincerely hope you reconsider that decision, because according to the sidebar, this is a subreddit where we should welcome that. One person scaremongering and starting a witchhunt should not be enough to prevent you from having a discussion here.

       I am still contemplating it. I'm sure one day I will, maybe when my contract is up and I am no longer working there. Plus I am still trying to decide if i need a throwaway anyways, its just a question, know what I mean? But yet you never know in this day and age what could get you fired esp in an at will employment state.

       There are plenty of non-constructive contrarian accounts here older than a month. This problem is a lot older than the Boston bombing, although it certainly has intensified since then.
      </p>

       reddit's design really doesn't allow for conversations without interference from non-constructive participants.

       Keep in mind that some of the people posting the "official" story are likely questioning things. I think the Boston bombings have served to wake up a lot of people, and those people are teetering on the edge of the rabbit hole and falling back "in line".
      </p>
      <p>
       While I don't disagree there are shills and trolls in record numbers, there are also legitimate, curious people who are ignorant of a lot of things.

       It's hard, but we all need to show some patience, and report trolling to the mods. It's all we can do. We have to harbor free speech in this sub, and banning new accounts will only hurt us, IMO.

       Ignorant to what?  Wanting sources?  It seems like the majority of those who have been here for a while are more close minded than the newbies..  The newbies don't call others names, or try to get the seasoned users banned(kinda the opposite goin on here huh?).  The newbies also have no problem linking to a source, while many users will immediately call you a shill and then proceed to not provide sources because theyre mad you don't support their theory.

       "we have to harbor free speech in this sub" really?  a sub that is suppose to support the U.S. constitution through thick and thin, yet you make a comment like that?

       I'm new to this subreddit, but when you said
To me, its one of the biggest admittance of guilt in the history of this subreddit. They have recognized that this is the place where the critical thinkers have gone, and it is now a battlefield. -  do you really believe that this particular internet chat space is a battlefield where conspirators come to discredit and discourage the critical thinkers? That's what they want you to think.

       "Banning" is a strong word, but creating a consistent pro-truth message across
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is important. So I believe that the removal of truth-suppressors is vital if this subreddit is to survive the onslaught of shill accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can keep the process transparent by keeping lists of members who promote truth-first agendas, and those who post anti-truth rhetoric, and allowing those on the blacklist a chance to defend their comment history before final removal.

       I think it would be better too allow only 3 accounts in a given year.  It doesn't take too many reports to have someone's account closed, but then they just come back over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you put a limit on the number of accounts (per IP) and everyone keeps reporting obvious shills and trolls, the problem would work itself out pretty quickly.

       What is a fallacy about noticing that brand new accounts are swarming a conspiracy subreddit after a complete sketchy bombing event (with long-term political implications) with the sole purpose of trolling people who are asking questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two kinds of responses to sketchy information.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Wow, that is an interesting and new development, I wonder what it implies
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Wow, you conspiracy nuts should just believe the official story and move on with your lives
      </p>
      <p>
       The first calls for critical thinking, the second is trying to prevent said critical thinking from happening. The first has no agenda but discussion, the second could clearly have a large agenda with more menacing undertones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it so hard to accept that there are entire departments with the capabilities and desire to stop people from thinking critically? It has been happening over and over again as far back as recorded history exist.

       What's so dangerous about so many Conspiracy theorists on this subreddit is that you refuse to be told that certain things don't seem to be conspiracies at all, i'm not just talking about the Boston events here. You need to be ready to have a dialogue with someone who disagrees with your theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, just create a subreddit named
       <a href="/r/conspiracycirclejerk">

        It is relevant because "eye" witness testimony from people hearing "bombs" is ridiculed if it's not in agreement with the official story, so why is it accepted 100% when it is?

       Because it aligns with what hundreds of others also witnessed and reported on? That's a good time to trust the official story.

       The super rude jerks should just be banned, calling people names it not in anyway showing evidence or logically disproving what someone else has to say. But thanks to the mainstream media these people have learned that calling someone crazy or stupid = disproving their argument.

       Im trying to point out that there are a significant number of people in this sub (or perhaps a handful of REALLY vocal people) who immediately throw the "shill" word around to anyone who disagrees with their comment. It may not have been you, but it is prevalent in this sub.
