       He just seemed so level-headed.  I looked at all of his information and it scared my family and I because I am exactly like this kid in so many ways.  His habits, the way he talks, the people he hangs with, going to a major university, and a love for spongebob and lions:/  it tears me up to think he's probably a patsy.

       I think the same thing when I hear people talk about how they had no idea. Of course you didn't. Someone planning to bomb a public place isn't just going to tweet it up. "@DzhokarTsarnaev settin up da bombz next week! Can't wait for blowing shit up! I am a terrorist to the max!"

       if he had tweeted it he would have been caught before hand. if you don't want people to know your intentions then you don't express them.

       I'm just saying that someone who is seemingly fucking normal in every possible way is being made something he's not.  CNN is making it sound like they grew up in a broken home and their entire lives have just been a fucking wreck.

       Theres been a HUGE influx of new redditor accounts that they all reject clear and obvious "weird" stuff and facts, rejecting it almost in a religious matter, like you do...

       Well, I can't deny that the bombing certainly stoked my interest in reddit starting with r/findingbostonbombers. But I would deny that I reject obvious weird stuff and facts in a religious manner. What I find infuriating is people thinking his "normal" life is evidence that he didn't do this. It really isn't.

       I think no one is saying they are innocent... they are saying that is SO weird for a terrorist that planed and killed inocent people to seem SO normal...

       I honestly cant recall a terrorist or similar that just seemed SO DAMN NORMAL AND COMMON, usually they say "he was a quiet guy who didnt talk much" or something of the sort, these guys... they were full fledged americans and enjoying it...

       Normal people, live normal lives for years and everybody thinks they know who they are, but it's not until they do something crazy that everyone is left wondering "How could he have done that, he was such a nice kid." Well I guess you didn't know him that well, then again you never know anyone 100% anyway. Your best friend/wife/husband/family members can be killers for years and we'd have no idea.

       Look at his Twitter, there's also lots of things he said there that are not typical of a terrorist. However, the evidence seems overwhelming that he is a terrorist, carjacked someone, and murdered that MIT cop in cold blood. It is quite possible that he could have left comments aimed at dissuading people from believing he could be a terrorist, because he knew what he was planning to do.

       I just don't buy this explanation. If these guys had been plotting for years to the point where they were subverting relationships with friends and family, then how did they seemingly have no real plan of escape? No plans to explain their motives or claim responsibility?

       If these guys had worked so hard for so long, and younger brother especially seems bright, then why do they appear to be such incompetent criminals?

       Oh really? You have a lot of experience studying the tweets of terrorists and know what "typical" is??? News flash: my twitter stream presents an extremely limited slice that I choose to share.

       Read his tweets and then you'll understand what I am referring to. He specifically condemns the murder of innocent people, violence, and even bullying. It's extraordinarily ironic considering.

       I've read all of his tweets. They constitute no evidence of anything really. People are complex and can display both admirable qualities and evil ones. I know it's troubling, but it doesn't it make it not so.
