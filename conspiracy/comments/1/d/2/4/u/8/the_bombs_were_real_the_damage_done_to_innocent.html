       I wouldn't say so. I'd say it's very distasteful and disrespectful to phone up and harass victims on the matter, but to just ask the questions? Nothing should be off the table for discussion, but people should also realise when to drop it and when they're purposely being mislead.

       Calling victims who have just had their legs blown off 'actors' trivializes and even demonizes them and their suffering and is distasteful and disrespectful.

       People explicitly and publicly accusing specific victims of being actors and 'in' on the whole situation, yes, could be seen as disrespectful. Discussing the possibility that the events were staged and that actors were involved, is not. It's just discussion. Unfounded and bordering on the ridiculous? Probably.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same sort of attitude is commonly put across when discussing 9/11, "how disrespectful to the victims!". Not in the slightest. This situation is slightly different, as you're involving and almost accusing innocent people if you're wrong, but taking the discussion off the table just because some people's feelings might be hurt just isn't a good enough reason not to explore something.

       We have zero evidence of deaths in Sandy Hook.  That still appears to be a staged crisis actor event and we never saw any pictures or one shred of evidence of an actual casualty.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the Boston attack was done in public makes it (near) impossible for it to be a similar hoax, but it is still worth asking.

       It's nothing new. People have been calling this "actor" theory a planted story for long time. With few exceptions, most of them are so badly done that it takes only a simple google search to prove it is bunk. It reminds me of the "no planers" early on in the 9/11 truth movement.

       Interesting defense, but it's a strawman argument.  Because you don't see a need doesn't mean it didn't happen that way.  Seems closed minded to me.

       Sandy Hook had legit questions about crisis actors, Boston had someguy make a meme that an amputee looked like someone else.

       Big difference.

       Less than 1% of people in here think actors were used in Boston, at a guess. Are the brothers patsy's is the big question there.

       Just because you're in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to argue (for the lack of a better word) on why you think another person lacks evidence. A big part of debate is stating an antitheses and proving that you're correct. Sometimes, there's a lapse of anti-thesis which others promptly supply and disprove.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of, "they're just actors," it would be really hard to cover up in my opinion. As somebody has mentioned in another thread, it is a lot easier to kill the people who are "actors" rather than keep them alive. I hate to speak with such certainty but I don't think the government would be afraid to kill, especially with the passing of NDAA.
      </p>
      <p>
       To say, "my theory is the only right theory without any hard evidence of my own" is completely selfish and the thing people complain about most with the media. It's a downright contradiction, and everything you say should be said with at least some degree of doubt, although it is your right to not express that doubt openly. That's how justice
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judging from your other posts, you're probably criticizing the sub, instead of actually defending these theories. Also, you expressed your feelings in the other thread so I'm sure I misinterpreted what you said. Despite that, I think my point still stands for others who think you're able to post "theories" with the lack of proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Just 'cause you're in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       doesn't mean you should hold your opinions and theories as accurate or as some people say it, "truth." Your posts here shouldn't be excused just because of the mass hysteria and paranoia many subscribers feel.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       You think it's a coincidence that there haven't been any massive attacks since then, only small-scale ones? Look at how hard they tried not paying the victims of 9/11 too, and all the people that came down with leukemia and have better luck at hospitals when they don't mention 9/11. They do care about money, yes you are right about that. Human life, not so much.

       What do you mean?  No massive attacks in USA, but that's ok  Sept 2001 did it's job well.   There was also the anthrax attack just before the

       The FBI/CIA regularly sets up "terrorists" that they meet online, they pump up their egos, they sell them fake bombs and wait for them to attempt to use them, then they arrest them. Its makes more sense for the govt to secretly radicalize people like this and help them carry out attacks than to stage the whole thing.

       I dont know why people waste time making up theories from home when all they see is pictures when there is already proof of other ways the govt gets involved in these things.

       I agree.  I can't imagine the amount of people that would have to be involved if this was all staged with actors.  Also.  Why would "the powers that be" have a problem with killing a few people and injuring dozens?  It would certainly be a lot easier if they actually hurt people.

       No way that piece of fence was casually placed across the street, splattered with blood seconds after a bomb blast with out a single person noticing.  Someone would have to have been dropping a lot of shoes with human feet still inside, hoping nobody would pick them up and be like, "Where'd this fake foot come from?"  I think the people who came up with this idea did not exam the photographic evidence close enough.

       Yes, discussing plausible theories and such, and the shooting down the ridiculous ones, like the idiots that keep talking about crisis actors, actors hired to celebrate the capture, etc.  I would like to think most people visiting this sub are seeking the truth, and idiots promoting asinine "theories", if you can even call them such with absolutely zero evidence is a total waste of time and gives a bad name to anyone who does not accept the "official" story.  Show me something credible, or even a motive for hiring crisis actors that makes a half wit of sense and I will listen.  So far Ive seen nothing of the sort.

       I disagree that it is distasteful or disrespectful to ask these questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have zero evidence of deaths in Sandy Hook.  That still appears to be a staged crisis actor event and we never saw any pictures or one shred of evidence of an actual casualty.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the Boston attack was done in public makes it (near) impossible for it to be a similar hoax, but it is still worth asking.

       I wouldn't say so. I'd say it's very distasteful and disrespectful to phone up and harass victims on the matter, but to just ask the questions? Nothing should be off the table for discussion, but people should also realise when to drop it and when they're purposely being mislead.
