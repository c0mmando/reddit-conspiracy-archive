<p>I wouldn&#39;t say so. I&#39;d say it&#39;s very distasteful and disrespectful to phone up and harass victims on the matter, but to just ask the questions? Nothing should be off the table for discussion, but people should also realise when to drop it and when they&#39;re purposely being mislead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People explicitly and publicly accusing specific victims of being actors and &#39;in&#39; on the whole situation, yes, could be seen as disrespectful. Discussing the possibility that the events were staged and that actors were involved, is not. It&#39;s just discussion. Unfounded and bordering on the ridiculous? Probably. </p>

<p>The same sort of attitude is commonly put across when discussing 9/11, &quot;how disrespectful to the victims!&quot;. Not in the slightest. This situation is slightly different, as you&#39;re involving and almost accusing innocent people if you&#39;re wrong, but taking the discussion off the table just because some people&#39;s feelings might be hurt just isn&#39;t a good enough reason not to explore something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree that it is distasteful or disrespectful to ask these questions.</p>

<p>We have zero evidence of deaths in Sandy Hook.  That still appears to be a staged crisis actor event and we never saw any pictures or one shred of evidence of an actual casualty.</p>

<p>The fact that the Boston attack was done in public makes it (near) impossible for it to be a similar hoax, but it is still worth asking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because you&#39;re in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t be able to argue (for the lack of a better word) on why you think another person lacks evidence. A big part of debate is stating an antitheses and proving that you&#39;re correct. Sometimes, there&#39;s a lapse of anti-thesis which others promptly supply and disprove.</p>

<p>In the case of, &quot;they&#39;re just actors,&quot; it would be really hard to cover up in my opinion. As somebody has mentioned in another thread, it is a lot easier to kill the people who are &quot;actors&quot; rather than keep them alive. I hate to speak with such certainty but I don&#39;t think the government would be afraid to kill, especially with the passing of NDAA.</p>

<p>To say, &quot;my theory is the only right theory without any hard evidence of my own&quot; is completely selfish and the thing people complain about most with the media. It&#39;s a downright contradiction, and everything you say should be said with at least some degree of doubt, although it is your right to not express that doubt openly. That&#39;s how justice <em>should</em> work.</p>

<p>Judging from your other posts, you&#39;re probably criticizing the sub, instead of actually defending these theories. Also, you expressed your feelings in the other thread so I&#39;m sure I misinterpreted what you said. Despite that, I think my point still stands for others who think you&#39;re able to post &quot;theories&quot; with the lack of proof.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Just &#39;cause you&#39;re in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> doesn&#39;t mean you should hold your opinions and theories as accurate or as some people say it, &quot;truth.&quot; Your posts here shouldn&#39;t be excused just because of the mass hysteria and paranoia many subscribers feel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know. All these independent thinkers need to STFU AMIRITE? Wtf op? Looking at your history you post &quot;this is a huge distraction&quot; on every other conspiracy thread. Even get this </p>

<p>&quot;Big Gov is good. It is just controlled by such a small minority because wealth is concentrated. Government is a great tool to allow the people to organize and work together.&quot;</p>

<p>YOU are the distraction.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree that it is distasteful or disrespectful to ask these questions.</p>

<p>We have zero evidence of deaths in Sandy Hook.  That still appears to be a staged crisis actor event and we never saw any pictures or one shred of evidence of an actual casualty.</p>

<p>The fact that the Boston attack was done in public makes it (near) impossible for it to be a similar hoax, but it is still worth asking.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say so. I&#39;d say it&#39;s very distasteful and disrespectful to phone up and harass victims on the matter, but to just ask the questions? Nothing should be off the table for discussion, but people should also realise when to drop it and when they&#39;re purposely being mislead.</p>

<p>yes they do. look at all the shit they had to put up with the victims families of sept. 2001 attacks.  and the expense to the state.</p>

<p>it&#39;s much cheaper not to have to pay off real victims families.</p>
