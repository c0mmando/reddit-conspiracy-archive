        You are being downvoted because this subreddit has been recognized and deemed as a battlefield, then flooded by the same propaganda trolls (most with new accounts) who got everyone riled up about believing the "official story" whenever a Boston post hit the front page.
There presence alone is another huge red flag in my opinion. And only gives me motivation to keep digging for the truth.
       </p>

       With all the shilling and random down-voting of well thought out, evidence-backed theories on here I cant help but think of a Ghandi quote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, and then you win
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They're fighting with us because ridicule has not broken our resolve; Sending shills to downvote and 'discredit' fact-based theories. There is growing evidence that what the media is telling us and what actually happened in Boston are not the same. Day by day the gaps in their stories widen like a chasm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I, for one, just want the truth...whatever that truth may be.

       Thanks for the reply. You post is really interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you make a lots of claims that I have never heard of before such as buildings being in the wrong position in staged photos. I, as well as others I'm sure, would like to see the photos and analyses thereof. Is there a link or something you can provide?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree it that these 'events' are staged and orchestrated to enrage people to further a political agenda. Not only are they going to impose martial law as you suggest but they are quickly removing your ability to effectively fight back. "

       Employees within military structures are scared of the chain of command above them, it's basically that scene from movies where everyone has a gun to eachothers head. The only reasonable way that I can see to defend yourselves from the billionaire tyrants america is beholden to is to spread comprehension of the threat posed by clandestine agencies and the hyper wealthy.

       I think one of the more important, less discussed aspects of this and things like this, in refefence to Boston or Sandyhook or Katrina or whatever is the 'frog in a pot' theory of media "fact formation".
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been references to "the Cambridge man" or "the local man" or what have you, refering to Sus #2, in the news for days. Thissets a precedent for believing the emotional tie to a locale, giving the right to refer to him s "domestic terrorist x" if the winds blow favorably hat direction. However there is also the references to his "chechen background" an the multiple mis- and mal-pronunciations of his name. Hse give us an alienation factor that allow him to be "foreign terrorist x".
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, fear is mongered, fury fed, and whichever theory holds true to the money paying for your airtme is served.

       I have noticed that. I heard one description over the police scanner and while I'm listening I had the TV on various news stations. I would hear two completely different things on the scanner vs the TV and the usual differences between the different networks on the TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       i must know, what happened to the 60 year old man that had a supposed bomb strapped to him and a detonator in his hand? It was mid afternoon friday, maybe just after 1. They used robots to strip him down. Over the scanner they repeated that he was NOT the suspect they were looking for and I never heard anything about it since.
