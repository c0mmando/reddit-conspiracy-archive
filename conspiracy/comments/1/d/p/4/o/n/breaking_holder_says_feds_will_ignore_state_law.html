       Kansas Secretary of State Kobach's Response to Eric Holder in the last two paragraphs were scathing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kobach spoke of the Fast and Furious scandal, how Holder is currently in contempt of court and how the administration has violated the constitution for 4Â½ years and "that abuse can not continue"!

       The problem is that we have fucked up longstanding "legal" precedents that completely obliterates the position.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court ruled in 1942 that a farmer who produced and and consumed his own grain could still be governed by Federal Regulations via the authority of Interstate Commerce clause:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn">
        Wickard v. Filburn
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court interpreted the United States Constitution's Commerce Clause under Article 1 Section 8, which permits the United States Congress "To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes". The Court decided that Filburn's wheat growing activities reduced the amount of wheat he would buy for chicken feed on the open market, and because wheat was traded nationally, Filburn's production of more wheat than he was allotted was affecting interstate commerce. Thus, Filburn's production could be regulated by the federal government.

       They also ruled that by producing his own wheat for his own consumption (ergo
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       participating in commerce via purchasing his wheat) that act was defacto in itself engaging in commerce. So even when your not engaged in commerce, you are. The supreme courts circular logic is used to take power away from you and the states. Whats even more amusing is they didn't fall back on the commerce clause re: Obamacare, they knew they had gone to the well one too many times, so just came up with the taxing authority portion to grant cover to the federal gov. Sickening.

       God damn I wish someone would blow that asshole's brains out. We just need to get rid of everyone who is a threat to humanity. I'm tired of waiting around for things to get better. Not that I would ever kill anyone obviously it's fucked up to do that. But the powers that be would kill and have killed to retain their power without hesitation. I wish I didn't take the red pill, our world is a purgatory.

       He's not a moron, his position is correct and constitutional; but the "legal" precedents the feds operate under are far afield from any constitutional constraints.

       I can say that the sky is blue, and you may point out that the Supreme Court has ruled that the sky is green; objective reality has not been changed by a court's ruling.

       If the Constitution doesn't say what the Supreme Court says it does, then who gets to decide? If everybody is allowed to have their own interpretation, and the Supreme Court's is not definitive, then we have no rule of law. The power of the federal judiciary to determine the meaning of the federal constitution has been well-settled since Marbury v. Madison.

       The Supreme Court declared that it was the sole definer of constitutionality
       <em>
        very early on
       </em>
       in the history of the US; so that was a first step leading us down this road.

      <p>
       Before that there had been no intentions that secretive robed priesthood  was to be the chief interpreter of the founding document. The States and the people were to also have that job as well as the simple right to nullify laws that they deemed illegitimate as the ultimate check and balance

       <p>
        The power of the federal judiciary to determine the meaning of the federal constitution has been well-settled since Marbury v. Madison.

       Well settled? No, the body of a once free country is just now floating to the surface, and it stinks to high heaven.

       No it didn't, and in fact, it still isn't. But it does have the final word. Every court in this country, whether it's a state court, or a federal court, trial level, or appellate, can interpret the US Constitution and can make determinations on issues of first impression. However, every court is also bound by the precedential decisions of appellate courts above it, all the way up to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has the ultimate say-so in how the US Constitution is to be interpreted, but other courts have a role too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court's position at the top of the system is not by its own dictate. It's by design. It's in the text of the US Constitution itself, in Article III, Sections 1 and 2:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court . . . The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution . . . the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction ...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Article III, Sections 1 and 2.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Before that there had been no intentions that secretive robed priesthood was to be the chief interpreter of the founding document.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Citation needed. This is directly contrary to the text of Article III.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The States and the people were to also have that job as well as the simple right to nullify laws that they deemed illegitimate as the ultimate check and balance.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, citation needed. The idea that states can "nullify" anything the federal government does is directly contrary to the supremacy clause contained in Article VI, Clause 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was ever any legitimate ambiguity(which I don't believe there ever was) about the supremacy of the federal government when it comes to any disputes between federal and state law or whether the federal or state judiciary systems have the final say in what the Constitution means, that ambiguity was resolved in Ablemen v. Booth, 62 US 506 (1859) and Cooper v. Aaron, 358 US 1 (1958). Not to belabor the point too much, but if you read Federalist Papers #78, it's also very clear that it was the original intent of the framers, and the understanding of the general public at the time that the federal judiciary is the final arbiter of constitutionality. You can also look at Section 25 of the
       <a href="http://www.constitution.org/uslaw/judiciary_1789.htm">
        Judiciary Act of 1789
       </a>
       , enacted by the 1st United States Congress and signed by President Washington and it's pretty darn clear.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Well settled? No, the body of a once free country . . .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Ok, so what are you saying? The Constitution was ratified in 1789 and Marbury v. Madison came down in 1803. So what, there were 14 years that we had it "right" in your view? And the system has just been fundamentally perverted for the 210 years after that?

       It was an apt response to dribble like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       Having "the final word" is kind of a big deal and the whole point.

       Calling somebody a bitch just because you disagree with them is never an "apt response." It's elementary-school level argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       I explained how and why the supreme court is not technically the "sole definer constitutionality" but why nevertheless, its decisions are controlling in any cases where there is a dispute. There are lots of situations where the Supreme Court just has not considered the constitutionality of something yet, but there is a lower court decision, either from a state supreme court or from a federal circuit court of appeal which has. In those situations, those lower courts are the determiners of constitutionality, and their decisions are binding authority until and unless there is a Supreme Court decision which contradicts that decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       I explained all this in detail, with citations. There is nothing about what I said which is "dribble." What I wrote was a basic and accurate description of constitutional structure and the interplay between state and federal judicial jurisdictions.

       You simply gave the government's justification for why it can do anything it wants. All intelligent reasoning went out the window when the government started driving holes through every clause of the Constitution to justify any activity it desired. This pretty much started within the decade of the nation's founding and has simply gotten accelerated every year since.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Constitution was intended to distinctly limit government power, it clearly does not based on the rather open interpretations being applied.

       I don't think that's what I did, because it's not my opinion that the government can do "anything it wants." There are many things which the government cannot do, even if it wants to, because it would be unconstitutional. But even if that is what I did, what did you give to counter it and explain why my explanation was incorrect? All I saw was name-calling.

       That answers one of my questions I guess. You think that things got off track pretty much right after the Constitution was ratified, even though the same people who wrote the Constitution were still very much active and involved political leaders of that day. Doesn't really make much historical sense to me.

       I think it's all rubbish, the Constitution as well; it's all essentially like the arguments about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mass delusion is what people are caught up in, there are still some people who are trying to work in the system, naively believing that the system even plays by its purported rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are different layers of perception to all this, it simply depends on where the observer is located.
