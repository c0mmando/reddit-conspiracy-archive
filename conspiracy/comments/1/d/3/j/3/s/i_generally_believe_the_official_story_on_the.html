       OK i havent seen any reddit posts about this specific thing and believe me when I say I've been obsessed with anything and everything Boston bombing since it happened. I've combed thru all the different theories in detail, and I still think I generally agree with the official story, or at least i've been trying to convince myself of the brothers' guilt since the blog with the shootout pics surfaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, my opinion on the events is 100% irrelevant and not the point of this post. Whether the brothers were guilty or not will not be the focus from here on out. Please focus ONLY on the evidence that is presented in this link, and let's discuss.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cluesforum.info/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=1602&amp;start=525#p2383558">
        HERE IS THE LINK
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, forget about the brothers and the bombing for a moment here. WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT HUGE SCREEN?! why is it in plenty of official marathon photos but none of the bomb footage? could they really dismantle that huge thing that quickly (meaning between the time the race winners photos are snapped with it in the background and the bomb footage with it clearly not there)?!?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is REALLY bothering me and I can not come up with a rational explanation for it.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: as people have brought to my attention in the comments, it appears the sign was brought in attached to a truck, and was mounted to a pole/bracket type contraction which can indeed be seen in the post explosion footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Top comment has a picture of the sign from someone standing across the street from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sign was easily removable, and the popular theory below seems to be that once all the famous runners were finished, the screen was no longer needed as the "main attraction", so to speak, had concluded. Also things like excessive wind, etc are mentioned. Either way, I think we all agree they simply came in and took it down at some point. I just didn't realize how "portable" it was.

       I walked past the truck the screen was built into two days prior to the race and I can confirm it's literally a screen attached to a truck.  Very easily moved around + packed away.

       But is it the same one or is this a second big screen? Because at these type of events there are usually more than 1 big screens, so was the one moved or were there two or more to begin with?

       Based on the buildings, same one. It makes sense that they'd remove it. It was showing a feed from whoever broadcast the event. By the time the bombs went off, the winners were long, LONG gone. Marathons are generally only televised until the mens and womens notables and winners are finished.

       The professionals cross the line after 2.5 hrs or so, and then the rest of the amateurs will be crossing the line up to 8 hours after the start of the race.  There has to be a cutoff point where it's no longer worthwhile to have a big screen setup and using power.

       I have worked in an industry that involves rigging and de-rigging. De-rigging can be done amazingly fast, whatcould take and hour to put up could be packed away in 5 minutes, depending if your getting paid overtime or not.

       Plus, they may not want or be able to pay the live camera crew to shoot for the whole span of several hours from the first person crossing the finish line to the very last ones. And as far as I know, the attack happened a fair time after the winner crossed the line, right?

       But that's just be an idea as to why they may not keep the screen up until the end of the race.

       You think so?  All the best and notable runners had finished the marathon hours before the bombs went off..  Do you think they are going to pay someone to film your neighbor til they cross the finish line?  They probably thought like any other company, they didn't want to spend more money on labor..

       super long shot, but maybe someone viewing this will know something about the company contracted to provide the screen? or maybe someone knows an employee of said company who could either confirm or deny?

       It looks like the screen was covering the lead runners. The pictures of when it's up for instance are when the lead female runner was finishing. The bombing took place two hours after the lead runners finished, I'm assuming by that time the camera crews covering the race had  largely packed up and there wasn't anything for them to be showing really so they had taken it down because there was no reason to keep it up with no video feed to show.

       If it is an international event, it would make sense for it only to be there for the leading runners. Amateurs would complete the marathon in four extra hours, that is an expense by the organising committee that is not warranted.

       The marathon organizers are in business with the companies that want advertising that is always shown on the big screen.  Those advertising companies would likely be scheduled for the entire event rather than only the first quarter, though.

       I know cameras were still rolling when the bombs went off, was it still being televised live. Or was it more b-roll? It might be that the board was in,y up for the live telecast, who knows.

       I've also done this kind of work and have worked with those screens.  They're on trailers and go up and down in minutes.

       They're rental units.  I'm sure that after the major runners finished they pulled it down and left.

       Who is the sponsor on the monitor frame? Could ask them how long the monitor was meant to be up there. I'm guessing there would be contracts for that sort of thing and they would want their name up there for as long as possible ie. not taken down before the race ends.

       Looks to be on a street between the two blocks.  I'm actually guessing it was still there and the angle of the photos means you don't see it.  I mean I hate to be giving a simple explanation, but I believe that's the correct one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, and I believe less likely, they moved it between the time the race was won and the time the bombs went off.  I imagine they point of the monitor was to give a live feed of the race, and once everyone's coming in for the finish you don't need the monitor to do that any longer.

       You're getting downvoted because you're thinking progressively.  Ignore the downvoters.  You are on point with that, there's no race anywhere on earth where they only keep the big screen up for the first quarter of the race.  People and their families will fly from across the world to compete in the event and their family watching them would want to see them on the big screen.  It's not fair to the people that want to see how their family members are doing in the race.  It just doesn't make sense to exclude the other people.

       Exactly. Just because you weren't one of the elite runners that doesn't mean you couldn't have won it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes the favorites don't win. And when that happens, when the local middle-aged dad running for charity smashes the world record, we're supposed to believe the TV wouldn't want to show him up on the big screen?

       So you're telling me that the
       <em>
        only

       reason anybody would want to watch the race, is to see the winner? That makes no sense whatsoever. If they paid that much money for a huge screen, why take it down mid-race? It's not about the winner, it's simply about watching the race.

       No I'm not saying that at all. I agree with you that something's fishy.

       On marathon day Boston TV stations show uninterrupted coverage until the last person has crossed the finish line.

       To tell you the truth the people finishing at the end are a helluva lot more interesting to watch then the so-called 'elites'.  Sometimes they shit themselves.

       Haha! Thank you for having a little bit of humor. I actually don't think anything is fishy about the monitor itself, I just question the timing of taking it down. It seems a little dangerous to take a huge screen like that down, with a couple hundred people milling around, while the race is still in progress.

       Well I know absolutely nothing about how they take that monitor down or how much it costs per hour to keep it up and running or how much it costs to pay the support staff that have to man it while it's up, but I do know that something is definitely fishy here.

       They wouldn't take it down.  No marathon on Earth puts the big screen up for a quarter of the race.  The
       <em>
        entire

       Re: the missing screen, the elite runners will be HOURS before everyone else hence the empty streets. The bombs went off at the almost 4 hour mark and these elite runners were at the 2 hour mark.  I had a friend about 100m from the finish line and his gf had just crossed so that is the timing of an 'average' runner....
      </p>
      <p>
       There is plenty of time to take down the screen showing the elite runners in that time span. I can ask him if he recalls a screen being up when he was almost to the finish line but he is pretty traumatized and hasn't been interested in talking about what happened...
      </p>
      <p>
       I am open to many of the theories about the bombing, I'm just trying to stick to the facts around the missing screen.

       it is all definitely from the 2013 race, last monday.
      </p>
      <p>
       look at the pic of the girl bursting thru the finish line, it clearly says Boston Marathon 2013 on the finishing ribbon she breaks thru.
      </p>
      <p>
       the next pic is obviously taken a second later, and you can clearly see the huge screen behind her in the background.
      </p>
      <p>
       FACT: the screen was still up when this woman finished the race. the screen is nowhere to be seen during bombing footage. anyone know what time she finished the race? will give us an exact time window of when the sign must have been taken down....

       as you can see, even i was beyond confused. i just went ahead and assumed both races were ran on the 15th and had different timer boards. i wasn't even sure what you were getting at initially, but it's obvious you were right. good catch homie.

       There was a bomb drill that was going on during the marathon, so maybe they had to take it down because of this.  I'm only speculating.  It is a bit weird that a bomb drill is going on the exact same day the bombings happened.

       GarrioValere pointed out that the "5K" was from a 5K race the day before, he's right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never mind...
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two different races in these pictures.  The one that has "5K" under the time indicator shows that the top big monitor is just above the top of the third story windows, the picture that has additional text under the time indicator shows the top of the big monitor right under the bottom os the fourth story windows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe that could be parallax given the two different camera locations but if it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       parallax it means that the big monitor isn't mounted on the building, it would be some distance away.

       If you generally accept the premise of what transpired in Boston, then why are you trying so hard to find a conspiracy amongst these events? Sounds like you're on Alex Jones's payroll to me! Haha

       Their main picture evidence doesn't acknowledge that the building with the monitor on it is not shown in their "monitor missing picture."
      </p>
      <p>
       The building with the monitor on the side would have been the next building just to the right out of the frame.  Just compare the building faces.  Theres a red building with a white outcrop thing 2nd to the right on the "photoshopped picture" but on the "real" picture its 5 buildings down.
