       So I guess if America was invaded, all the invaders would immediately be US citizens, and they should be subject to all the civil liberties of citizens who weren't "born yesterday" before the invasion?

       You don't get to squash other peoples' voices and then pretend to be victims. If the discussions hadn't been drowned out by new accounts and trolls, this wouldn't have been a problem.

       I've had some very high quality posts in the top 3 positions on this subreddit several times and my account is only 7 days old.  I made this account to post here when the Boston bombings happened.  Anyone who looks through my post history can see that I'm neither a troll nor a shill.  I've spent countless hours researching, gathering information and photos, studying photos, watching interviews and videos, listening to the police scanner recordings, and stringing together narratives based on what I've found in an attempt to bring real and legitimate content to this subreddit.   Not really fair to keep me from posting.

       I gave you photos yes? But you didn't just initially ask for photos, you questioned my ability to differentiate between explosions larger than a gunshot explosion. You had already made up your mind that the exchange didn't happen and that any witnesses must either be shills or mistaken. If you are challenging the official story then you should be the one to provide proof of the contrary. That you challenged what I heard and demanded photo evidence (which you received) from states away while I was blocks away is why this subreddit is in the turmoil that it is. Do research yourself before challenging others and calling them liars and shills.

       I think the boat story is fucked. I do think that it's possible they were legitimately confused as it seemed like they we're trying to pinpoint officer location on the scanner. Someone may have got trigger happy and others got scared and fired as well. We can only speculate, things will be answered in the trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that one instance isn't 99 percent of the story being wrong. This subreddit is questioning actors, fake blood, dead Brown students, Craft agents, Navy Seals, prosthetic limbs, FBI entrapment, uncle being on fed pay, photo shopping backpacks, specs of dust, "Chill out we didn't do it" primed audio, whether people that live there heard things etc. I get it, I used to be a theorists myself. But not every single thing is a lie.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I asked for photos at the very beginning. You posted links 3 days later.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sorry I didn't have photographic proof of the crime scene while it was still under investigation. Evidence takes time to collect. Things will be answered in the trial. Then make some theories, not before the evidence is presented.

       Im at a loss here, I dont understand.  Supposedly if your account is less than 30 days old you cant post now?  Why does this not apply to me?  My account is 6 days old and I have no problem posting.  Also, I agree that it is ridiculous and frankly a little alarming that there is an attempt to censor

       While this is a possibility, I doubt it is probable. Based on his moderation in
       <a href="/r/chicago">
        /r/chicago
       </a>
       and elsewhere, he tends to leave decisions up to moderators democratically. And if the moderators in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       want to do something a certain way, I see him as a person who stays out of their way and in instances like this, undoes dictator like moves such as this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually never visit
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , and happened upon this through subredditdrama. I don't care either way, to be honest. But there is some bullshit going down and no one mod should be able to say "ITS MINE, GO HOME FUCK YOU ALL!".
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually think that reddit should facilitate moderators of at least default subreddits in a way that are user voted. We've seen time and time again moderators of such subreddits as
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       selling their influence on the subreddit for gain at least twice. Last year around March, and then again this year it recently happened.

       We do this to our content, why not to the maintainers of content.

       I don't post much (ever really) on this sub but I can really see where he's coming from.  In the wake of the Boston incident I had several conversations here with people who were quite obviously shills and I found that pretty disturbing.  One had posted seven times or so, all of them running interference.

       up to here?  Is it just for the lulz?  His comment history would suggest so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely he's not actually receiving any kind of compensation for this.  (Or does he really believe there will be some kind of pay out if he keeps it up?)  Is he trying to "teach" us methods covert advertisers might use so we can be on the lookout for them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it anti-advertising?  Can these techniques be used reliably to create a backlash against the corporation in question?  Or is there really no such thing as bad publicity, and will all of this conversation about OG inevitably boost their sales?

        I think you see where this is going. The Admins know that the meta verse is typically disregarded as pointless...throwaway drama. You might think that circlejerking about Olive Garden is harmless, and frankly, it is. Who gives a shit if they have unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks? Who cares about their house wine, or their family-friendly atmosphere, or their locations nationwide? None of that matters. And that's the point. The fact that you think it is harmless means you forget about the stupid jerking, maybe you even laugh at it. Maybe you upvote the random person who shows up in your
        <a href="/r/Anime">
         /r/Anime
        </a>
        thread to talk about Zuppa Toscana and breadsticks or whatever. And then you forget about it.
       </p>
       <p>
        But that's why this is so insiduous. Because it plants that seed in your mind, and the following Saturday you find yourself at Olive Garden. Or you're like the person who I showed above, who went to go get Olive Garden. All of this is translating into backdoor profits for Reddit, namely the Admins.

       I love the irony.  He starts off talking about how "the meta stuff" keeps things interesting ... and then proceeds to post a comment that is meta in and of itself.  "Here, let me make you aware of how OG is gaming the system (while I game the system)."

       Yes, he is advertising as he literally tells us he and others have been advertising. He wasn't trying to be subtle. You don't need to take AP English to "get it" when the OP is being blatant.

       OP's advertising technique is blatant but it is not at all overt.  The bulk of his comment pertains to esoteric subreddits and melodrama.  It is perfectly plausible that someone absent-mindedly skimming through his comment would not take note of the covert manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       My comment isolates the specific surreptitious statements in OP's comment to present them for consideration on their own.

       Sometimes it is helpful to state the obvious in order to drive home a point.

       I got the exact same feeling. Jokes on them though, I'm in China and there's no way this reverse, reverse meta psychological advertisement is going to get me to fly across the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all it makes me feel slimy and gross. Of course as we get more and more popular these tactics will combine with anonymity and the site's lack of ads to target us. It will almost certainly work for a period, but remaining vigilant we can at least stomp it out, unlike billboards or harassing TV/radio ads (you could turn the TV/radio off, I know).

       Even better. When the masses of Reddit get their hands on this and it makes the front page, Olive Garden will once again be getting the advertising it wanted even if it's with torches and pitchforks.

       Of course this shit works because I want bread sticks now. It's manipulating a lower psychological function that is present in all of us. It should be comforting to know how similar and relatable we are as humans. Now go read a book and have a glass of water.

       Reminds me of The Aristocrats where a comedian (I can't recall his name) is being interviewed in a park (I think he was on or near a swing) and he refuses to tell the joke because it's disgusting and pointless and so on and so forth. He goes on this rant about why he won't tell it and in doing so, inadvertently (or possibly very cleverly) tells the joke.

       Slow down for a second and realize this is a story about a restraunt paying a bunch of idiots to circlejerk over their chain. Process that statement in your head for a few seconds and than compare it with the drama and mystique this person writes about it with.

       It's the drama and embelishment he puts into his story that makes it cringeworthy for me. Like it's some major earth shaking deal.

       If he just used a more 'Yeah they wanted to pay us to do this and here's how it happened' tone I would probably be pretty interested.

       It's a story about greed. A story about educated men who sold their souls for mediocre Italian food. And a story about one lone soldier who stood his ground, IN A WORLD where scruples are torn like soft breadsticks -- tossed like a fresh crisp salad -- and devalued like unlimited soup.

       Nope, as all the forums are taken over by marketers, which will inexorably happen, reddit will be over, as over as Digg.  Well, I guess it is harmless to us, we will move on, but not harmless to corporate reddit.

       And the great thing about all this is now that they've been exposed, we're still talking about it, and even though I don't approve of what they did, I decided we are going tomorrow around 4:30 for their new Mezzaluna Ravioli and buy-one take-one special!

       I asked you to remove and much like your chilidish deleting of posts that disagree with you here you replied rather vitriolic. I informed illuminatedwax of my decisions and let him know he can remove me if he wants but this place did just fine with little to no moderating and can not understand how you ever thought a 30 day rule in here would make any sense that clear lack of judgement and the deleting of posts in this thread that called you out are the reasons why I removed you all. I understand maybe your intentions were good but making rules like that in order to stop shills is ridiculous.

       This is the truth. 9k was not a good moderator, he was very very pro censorship, and was outted for it many times.  I've been on this sub since it had less than 2000 members and there is a lot of truth to the statement: "this place did just fine with little to no moderating".

       i think what you did was necessary, there has been so much crap here and no-one seemed to be dealing with it (or if it was being dealt with, the amount of crap must have overwhelmed whoever was dealing with it).
      </p>
      <p>
       I can understand being really strict with moderation for a few days, but banning new accounts obviously goes against people wanting to ask questions or submit news which might be sensitive or controversial, the whole foundation of this.

       Please don't reinstate them, really don't. You could be the savior this subreddit needs. I won't lie I have nothing against your average oddball conspiracy but what I really hate is the rampant racism and hate speech that gets posted and upvoted here by the mods. And then when an outside force like conspiratard comes in and calls out the ignorant racists the mods ban the instigators but do nothing about the underlying problem, and eventually it leads to stupid things like the 30 day rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       I urge you to just be a one man team here or get some others who are level headed and will actually enforce the rules in the sidebar and ban the blatant racists that have to insert their hate speech into every single thread (I'm talking about users like tttt0tttt and bumblingmumbling specifically, Occidentalist also comes to mind, basically the entire white supremacist/nazi crew).
      </p>
      <p>
       I can almost guarantee that the amount of flak and trolling/"shilling" this place gets will substantially decrease once it stops being a haven for neo nazis and fascists.
      </p>

       Thanks for listening and I hope you do the right thing.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       that make all conspiracy nuts look like even bigger idiots. I also think that the old moderator team wasn't a really good one.

       Is this really the type of attitude this place is supposed to promote? One person is banned for racism after a remark to an actually offensive comment which isn't reprimanded at all, it's disgusting.

       His relationship is that he's owned by the EPS crowd.
And adding to the awfulness, he has no problem smoking dope. I'm sure that leaves him with a clear, rational decision-making ability.

       yeah, one of the greatest things about this sub are the throwaway account self posts that say shit like, "i'm in military intelligence, i don't want them to find me, here's what i know..."

       forcing all accounts to be a month old kills those posts.

       You know what else kills those? Downvotes. The fact that people think increased moderation is needed to fix that just goes to show how many gullible paranoid nutjobs we have here that upvote the most idiotic posts.

       no, increased moderation is not the answer.  i don't think posts from those crazy sites should be removed. but i only have one downvote to give them, and they end up towards the top more often than not. this is a problem every subreddit faces when it reaches a certain size, quality content starts getting drowned out by the noise of easily digestible and sensationalized bullshit.  i think i'm just going to have to try to get approved in

       hopefully it's less of a circlejerk, and they take the time to do actual research instead of blindly believing everything they hear.

       First off, bold text is horrible at making an argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, "No abusive/threatening language." from the sidebar.  Calling someone a shill is an abusive attempt at removing their credibility.  Do you understand what the word shill even means?
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, yes it should be discussed.  But this is a subreddit and those above have control of those below.  That is what was signed up for here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please calm down.  Most here understand it was an action that should not have been made.  But screaming angrily will do nothing.  You are actually derailing arguments that make sense in this thread with such actions.

Most of you bitches that pretend to be smart by using derogatory language are 12 year old multi chin mouth breathers, with pizza pocket permanently lodged between your sweaty ass fingers. You are a fat fuck aren't you? I can tell. You have to poke the fun at random Internet schlubs or you will start thinking about how utterly shitty and fat your own life is. Larking through Walmart fantasizing about under age kids. Yes I know your type bitch. It's sad.

       Could it be the amount of insane theories posted here recently have increased immensely, and the more rational minded people here disagree with those theories? The only people I have seen called shills or trolls are the people with a dissenting opinion. Pretty all have been because they disagreed with that person.

       Do you believe there are shills that you don't see, simply because you agree with the message they're shilling? I wonder if Alex Jones, David Icke, Ron Paul pay people to submit pro-conspiracy posts to this sub, and sit around in the comments calling everyone Zionists and shills?

       a shill is just someone who by and large lacks independent thought, and uses pre-thought canned excuses provided to them by their culture/society to explain their poor behavior/outlook rather than personal responsibility or being proactive to change said behavior/outlook

       I say if you're account is new, and your comment history is antagonistic, made up of character attacks, semantics, or condescending, and not objective, it's a troll. If you attack someone's mental health, you're a troll. If you stand up a strawman next to someone's argument, you're a troll. If you politely objectify why someone's wrong, elaborately detail the facts, instead of just criticizing someone for their curiosity, you're providing totally valid dissent.

       This is not correct. The term "troll" is derived from the fishing term "trolling" and means much the same thing, albeit in the context of online discussions. A troll is someone who drops "bait" in the hope of provoking an emotional, off-topic, or otherwise active response. The goal is to get a "catch" and string them along. Trolls can and do troll without character attacks, inflammatory language, or insults.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are describing is more commonly known as an "asshole," and while trolls can be assholes, assholes are not necessarily trolls.

       Yes, seriously. Some people think "troll" comes from the creature, but in fact it comes from the fishing term. It's been kicking around for longer than many redditors have been alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       On some message boards, when longtimers spot a troll or engage in trolling themselves, they'll remain silent about it just to see how many newcomers they get. When someone takes the bait, "got one" is a common refrain.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very
       <em>
        best
       </em>
       trolls are fairly artful about it generally steer clear of clumsy insults altogether. Just thrashing at people is easy, lazy, and obvious. Much harder is getting people to take the bait when you're NOT obviously pushing their buttons. There are a few ardently pro-conspiracy people here, for example, who are clearly trolls.
       <em>
        Very good
       </em>
       trolls, but trolls all the same.

       If they can troll without being assholes, they're not likely to be called trolls. Are you saying trolls are making valid points and being constructive and being undetected as trolls? Then they're not trolls. There's nothing wrong with harping on your point as long as you don't keep repeating yourself when someone engages you.

       Then wouldn't they be missing the point if they couldn't get someone fired up? Isn't that the whole point of trolling; to get someone to just lose it and start wrecking their own case for them, not even with an agenda necessarily, just because they think it's entertaining?

       I'll give you an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say someone spends a decent amount of time constructing an elaborate conspiracy theory--not that hard, and authors do it all the time for their novels--and posts it here.  Perhaps it has links to various pictures with plenty of red circles or boxes (particularly popular these days) and notations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, they just completely made up some stuff and don't believe a bit of it.  They post it on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to see if anyone will take their bait; that is the actual definition of trolling.  Just like when you go fishing, sometimes you catch some fish and sometimes you don't.  In this case, sometimes people see through your bullshit and sometimes they don't.  Or maybe only a couple do, but others buy it and downvote the people who were able to catch on.  Particularly good for the real troll is if the people who criticize this fake theory get called shills or trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever heard "for the lulz"?  There are plenty of bored people out there who find it fun just to
       <em>
        fuck with
       </em>
       others on the internet.  All the better if they're actually
       <em>

       I'm totally sure that goes on. I'm totally sure at least half the stuff posted here is bullshit. I think a lot of people here would accuse Alex Jones of being a troll in that respect. However, it's no reason to roll in and start calling people names, and NOT meticulously making the points of evidence for bullshit. I'm entirely sure that there are plenty of trollbait original posts in here. No doubt. However, there is a lot of legitimate concern for things beyond the bombing being a conspiracy in itself. A lot of stories aren't straight, not just the conspiracy theory people. You could troll religious subs the same way by making some big racist religious rant and watch people buy into it. The Daily Show made an artform out of this at the RNC by saying outlandish things and getting people to just go right along with them. If a troll posted disinformation and then the submitter let them in on it after the fact,
       <em>
        I'd
       </em>
       find that hilarious and it would also be productive, because it might create some self-awareness. Again, that's not the entirety of the purpose of this kind of sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I listen to Coast to Coast AM on occasion knowing that at least half the people are kooks, but it's a moderated kook show and a forum for fringe ideas alike. All lines are blurry when the topic of discussion is fringe in itself, so it's not like the bar is very high for trolling.

       Aaah, but the inverse is true. The majority of the people here, regardless of their gullibility are here because they believe the mainstream media are guilty of the same level of trolling. Granted, not always from skill, but definitely some of the mainstream media news reporting is blatant trolling by that definition. Alex Jones trolls some of the time. I don't think he's explicitly trustworthy. I think he regurgitates what he hears and manufactures the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you see something like that here and objectify it. I doubt anyone is going to mind. There is a mixed consensus on the whole "no real bomb" thing. I think there's not even a need to follow that, when there would be so many other things. Why drag someone's pain into it? I do feel like the character witnesses, nature of the arrest, and nature of the pursuit the night before to be extremely suspicious, and that's apart from someone being insensitive about other people's pain. I have no interest in that. It seems extremely tangental.

       I was giving a contextual definition. I know it wasn't literally a troll in the most generic sense of "someone trying to get a reaction for the sake of the reaction, and to cause disruption." That also seems vague. The strawman and the insults are the hallmark of this crop of trolls.

       It's a fact that a troll is not merely someone who attacks you or who never makes a point. In fact, many trolls

        often

       make points because that's an effective way to keep stringing people along.

       I'm on... to you. ;) A troll doesn't HAVE to make a point, but you're right that they can make unrelated points or related points alike and not have any interest in constructive communication. We're still talking about the same kinds of trolls. Are the possibly racist anti semitic conspiracy trolls here, probably, but they're in the minority right now, that's for sure. They aren't making much noise.

       You're right. You're a troll. Your entire comment history is either making fun of people who comment here or playing the victim. You almost never offer a point of view beyond that. You're not engaged in any discussions. You're just trolling and pretending to be a victim about it. It's not any more complicated than that.

       I haven't offered a clear point a view because I haven't gotten any clear evidence. I make my assumptions based on the information I'm given. That's called being rational. Now if there is something in particular you would like to debate, I'm all ears.

       You're here just to argue about it being a community for silly conspiracy theories. You're blatantly trolling. I haven't made any claims except that if this were any other subreddit, you'd still be trolling. You're not making any claims or defending any points except to discredit everyone. You're spinning wheels. I'm not pointing it out for your sake. You clearly don't give a shit. I'm pointing it out because you deserve some of your own medicine. You probably won't get it here, and tonight, but who knows? You are definitely a troll making no points and defending no ground.

       I think it's a lose/lose situation. I, personally, have a two year old account but I'm not about to post all my batshit (to other people) ideas on my main account where people in real life know me. I respect that people are so confident in their ideas, but I'm really not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe this problem runs deep and simply downvoting might not be enough. I don't think there's any perfect idea. It's tricky.

       With all the SRS people doxxing redditors (they hate the site and its users with extreme prejudice) I have delinked anything personal I can to my account. Therefore I just say what I want. Reddit has become a coo-coo's nest of 4chan irl stalking tactics and the admins won't do a fucking thing about it

       They were taking over, upvoting themselves to the top of threads, down voting the regulars and utterly destroying the sub. It was a good idea and the product of consensus amongst the mods because they saw the problem progress and it should still be in place. The mod who didn't like it was not involved with the sub, did not understand the problem and therefore thought it was an over reaction, his stance was the product of ignorance.

       I am almost completely anti-conspiracy. I believe that almost none of the mainstream conspiracy theories have any real scientific or rational basis. I am certain that most people who do believe in generalised conspiracies, are psychologically challenged. I do not believe in such a thing as a government "shill" - such individuals are so rare they can be almost ignored as non-existent.

       Why thank you, sir. Such measures are necessary if one truly desires to "get to the bottom of things" - to find out the actual nature of things. In this way, we have a better chance of shoveling through the mountains of conspiratard cognitive dissonance and general logic failure, and find our way to the truly pressing issues of our time. These issues may not have the fantastical pseudo-romance of an off-the-wall conspiracy theory - but they are a whole lot more important, and conspiracies nonetheless.

       I don't have issue with an opposing opinion/judgment/theory/idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the constant barrage of insults, attacks, and spammed one-liners doesn't add anything to the discussion. It's merely a common tactic used by simpletons to drown out a voice.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was one poster who spammed the same one-line, something along the lines of 'Well, you guys are stupid, if they wanted to the Gov't would have just planted a gun on the boat, so trololol'.

       Serious question... What exactly is a shill?? As far back as I can remember my father has been a conspiracy theorist and one of my sisters &amp; myself discuss things with him often, but the term (name?) shill has never been brought up. Can someone please explain this for me, without attacking me for honestly not knowing...

       A shill is generally used to describe someone who is paid to promote a product or a cause, usually without disclosing that association. That guy who just won at three-card monty is a shill, he's in on the game, to draw in the marks.

As this whole Boston thing was going down, Reddit became my go-to news source because of the real time updates / analysis. This event has made me want to contribute my ideas to fellow Redditors.

       why not just ignore those being asses and engage those looking for a conversation, regardless of when they decided to join this site?  despite what your internet ego may think, no one else on the internet is judging you as having lost face (or anything else meaningful, for that matter) for not bothering to engage or wittily insult every troll.

       Can you define the problem in a way that it isn't ultimately about ego, though?  Why else care about an influx of trolls?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: 9000SINS deleted his/her above comment, which stated something to the effect of "the policy was enacted to deal with a problem and it isn't about his/her ego."  Deleting such a germane comment just strikes me as silly.  It's bad enough that he/she will not clarify or defend that comment, but to remove the record of it is an even further disservice to those trying to understand the rationale for the policy.

       The people that have been posting here for a while, that's who. I don't think an opposing view is bad but the constant shit posting and trolling has become a problem that has grown larger over a period of months and its gotten to the point of it becoming a major distraction to discussions with people from the outside even suggesting mods being removed based on poor excuses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a tough call but imagine you've been posting on one of your subs for over a year and there's a massive amount of trolls just causing shit and dragging the discussion down into a flurry of insults every few posts. What would you want to happen?

       I'm a regular here also.  I think it's a bad idea because people that are banned can still cast downvotes.  If they're banned they'll just create sock puppets and then they'll be encouraged to have multiple accounts to downvote us with.

       I'd say it's very interesting that so many people are going along with this AND defending 9000sins decision to do this without any input whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially considering the reasons WHY he is allegedly doing this. Of course the people he's allegedly trying to eliminate would agree with this. if they haven't already, all they have to do is cook another account for 30 days, with the promise of less people to countermand their agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it had been implemented, 9000sins would have finally succeeded in killing off
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , which would have made the joke sub

        /r/conspiritard
       </a>
       the go to for the uninformed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you don't think that conspiritards would see that as a total victory, you have no idea how lame and sad those people are.

       I did not accuse you of anything, I simply asked a question.  You are suggesting people like me should be censured? At a time when time is of the essence, people are discovering new information everyday and you want to make people wait 30 days to post?  This is an attack on our ability to contribute information, in hopes that people will just forget and walk away after 30 days.  Shame on anyone supporting this idea, and for what purpose?  Do get rid of trolls and other pesky and annoying users?  Sound familiar to you?  Does it sound like "liberties" are being taken away to protect the innocent redditors from "evil doers"? I think it sounds exactly like that.

       On one hand, yes, there was a flood of either trolls or clueless posters clogging up this sub. That they did downvote many interesting things (as some poster said, check your '
       <em>
        controversial
       </em>
       ' tab...) can be a sign this wasn't a random occurrence or just a byproduct of the influx of new users due to the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other... closing this place, making it an echo chamber will stiffle opinions and dialogue. I've seen this happen in many fora, and whatever the theme or interest, once only a cabal of usual posters is left, communities whither and die.

       Why not post what you want to say on the one account? If you are ashamed of what you want to say - (which most of the time is backlash because you want to troll or generally be a dick head) then you shouldn't be saying anything.

       Exactly. People who ACTUALLY frequent this sub have been calling out to mods to do something about posters who are obviously here to disrupt, flame, anything but converse. Our complaints fall on deaf ears.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the largest false flag in the nation's history happens. People get curious. This sub's members count soars almost overnight. The sub becomes internationally famous because it gets media attention for crowd-sourcing investigation. Something this sub does on the regular and has been getting better at for months now. Suddenly the prevailing narrative in the comments is that 'we have to do something', and the call goes up from NEW ACCOUNTS that we MUST 30day comment ban. Then, suddenly and with no vote or consensus, a previously suspected corrupt mod institutes this asinine rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Total, corrupt horseshit. The whole thing stinks of a calculated move to further discredit this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       And every time an active, rational, participating user points this out, they are derided by a bunch of NEW ACCOUNTS and trolls talking about how this sub already has no credibility and is a joke. None of them have anything to say about the ACTUAL joke conspiracy sub,

       That's impossible, its already divided.

       The trust in the mods has just evaporated.

       I don't trust illuminatedwax, donbueno. Th others were removed.

       And this subreddit cannot function with just two and whatever new mods are place they will be suspect.

       Whether you agree with donbueno or not it was a stupid move either way.

       There are also very abusive users who come and they are regulars on reddit. They are not trolls, but well to put it simply... they're assholes. They never contribute anything, not even devils advocate. They lash out at every members here, post many many replies in a single day and have a very personal vendetta against the ideas and thoughts discussed here. It disturbs them greatly, or they are already quite disturbed and mere words have rattled them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think letting them stay may be a good idea actually. If we ban them they will just grow more malice to us, but if we let them vent and say what they want then well meh... that is what the downvote button is for, maybe they will become a little more open minded instead of more shut in too by coming here often.

       This is kind of stupid. I regularly delete my account every 2 - 3 months (and personally think nobody should be attached to their username for long). If you institute this rule you'll get the dedicated karma farmers and long-term accounts. Think about that for a while. That's what you want, fine, but bear in mind who and what you'll actually be encouraging.

       Bear in mind that many people use one account for commenting on some things, and others for commenting on other things. Furthermore, if someone is continuously rolling over accounts every 2 - 3 months (and a lot of people do it), that means you're effectively silencing security-minded commentators with this short-sighted policy every other month.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, this encourages the long-term accounts to post freely, and some of those are some of the worst offenders where it comes to agendas and trolling. Like karmanaut, davidreiss666, warphalange, Mind_Virus, violentacrez. That's the kind of poster that this policy is going to give free reign to, and actually encourage.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that said, you're right, this policy doesn't really affect me that much since I'm not a strong contributor here... but I can see how it's effectively shooting this subreddit in the foot and how it's going to work to accomplish exactly the opposite of its stated intention.

       It's quite true that the mods are going to do what they want, anyway. However I do find it ironic that it says in the sidebar that "we respect everyone's opinions" and "our intentions are aimed towards a fairer, more transparent world" while effectively putting a ball-gag in the mouths of commentators with newer accounts.

       The idea that one has to put up with haters and trouble makers in order to demonstrate an affinity for free-speech is bullshit. The government has a responsibility to protect free speech and as a private group we have a responsibility to protect the integrity of our speech.

       you mean like leaving r/conspiracy all together.  yes, I consider that often.  Reddit isn't really worth it, and it's pretty much a dead site.  all sockpuppets SEO's and shills.

       Amazing.  A mod that wants the top contributors to leave because he can't moderate the sub.  Fine.  Enjoy your shill board troll circle jerk.

       I think the troll/shrill issue is being misunderstood slightly, there has been a wave of new accounts which soul purpose has been to essentially DDoS the comments section.  This is not free-speech its an attempt to disrupt it, its like creating an account just to sit on
       <a href="/r/religion">
        /r/religion
       </a>
       and just post one liners that believing in god is dumb etc, that's not how reddit works.  I agree that's why we have mods and 9000sins has been trying his best but its too much for one man and temporarily having a mechanism to block this malicious activity is acceptable in my view as long as the process is transparent and ban logs are open etc.

       I dislike the trolls and shills as much as anyone but I don't think this is the way to go. I suspect it will only have an effect on the drive-by trolls/shills which are relatively few. The dedicated trolls/shills will create numerous new accounts and in a month we'll be right back in the same place. It's not a solution, just a postponement.

       Downvote brigades effectively censor users from posting.

       I think this is a pretty good idea, keeps a lot of newcomers that are hell-bent on downvoting posts that go against the MSM's story. But, as

       Seems fine, not the best idea, but I think it's fair on the grounds that this sub has become a war ground of pro vs anti and the discussion is lost amidst making this sub worse than if it has a limitation to post.

       Sooner or later excluding new accounts will stop working.
Shills get better and better in disguising. Keeping multiple accounts etc.
The only way to keep them out is to make a splinter sub for invited only as you suggest, but then sub itself may go into a decline. Vicious circle...
If this shill/troll/distraction situation lasts for a while and the moderators have to deal with it manually, the rocks will be on the moderators... Thank you for your sevices.

       <a href="/u/donbueno">

       Hey Dude.  I've been trying to suggest an alternative to outright banning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible to limit the number of accounts that can be created in a calender year (per IP address)?  Let's say, you were allowed 3 accounts per IP.  Would this not reduce the number of trolls?
      </p>
      <p>
       As I understand it, once a troll get's banned, he simply creates a new account (and it's unlimited).
      </p>
      <p>
       This would allow for newbies to comment right away, without having to wait 30 days.  It would also not limit the number of legitimate subscribers by making this an invite only forum.

       This is an excellent idea. Sometimes it's not even worth it to post theories or ideas here because for some reason thinking critically makes you a basement dwelling neckbeard. I am all for civil discourse, but to write off an entire group of people as "crazy" for thinking differently is beyond wrong, it's dangerous.

       Well even though if I were a shill. I would create an account and use it after 30 days. However it will probably cut down on the trivial shill. Thumbs up on the mods efforts to make a dent.

       This is actually a brilliant idea. You are forced to read and educate yourself about the culture of the subreddit, the older general content, and generally assimilate - or don't and move the fuck on. There's so much pouty redirection going on. And the hilarious part is that most of the people bitching are people with more than a month old accounts. What's the deal? Sounds like they want to just troll on newer accounts....

      <p>
       In another light - we'll just get trolled 30 days from now.

       Reddit is not some private club for seasoned "redditors" to circle jerk. you sound like a southern white man who's great great great grandpa was an Irish immigrant yelling about how we shouldn't let anymore immigrants into 'Murica.  Nice work.

       And exactly what about your own post was in any way different? You attacked the commentator based on his account age; your post contributed nothing of value to the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the age of the account has absolutely nothing to do with how long a person has been active on reddit. In fact, some of the worst offenders with an agenda on reddit are those who keep a username chugging on over the years, notable examples like (the late-not-so-great) violentacrez, karmanaut, davidreiss666...

       This thread is about banning accounts under 30 days, making his/her account age perfectly relevant. The banning of these young accounts is to prevent people from trolling. Every single post I've seen from this person in this thread is of him/her attacking someone; that's ridiculous.

       lol, yes, it's quite obvious how hard I'm trying to 'grow my karma'. People like you are so silly. You think you know how other people work, when in turn it actually is a reflection of what you would personally do in that situation. That's it. You don't know what I upvote or downvote, that's a pretty wild assumption to make of people with aged accounts.

       I never claimed the assumption that all new accounts were trolls, no one did, but I wasn't against the idea of the 30 days at the time. Yet again, this thread was about banning new users for a mere month because of the increase in new accounts trolling. I pointed out how the retort* fit the reason for the thread perfectly.

       Now that I've looked at their post history, they seem a little guarded in their personal stance, but they do make some contributive posts as well. I usually don't filter through people's histories.

       What they should be doing is disabling voting. That's really what's the issue here. If they disable the ability to upvote and downvote, then you'd have to go to someone's comment history to do that. And then it would become very clear who the shilling karma farmers really are. The trolls are self-evident and can be controlled with a little moderating.

       Doesnt contribute?? Have you even checked out my account? I have a post on the front page and I do not contribute?  Blocking new users for 30 days to prevent "trolling" is a blatant attempt to stop the rapid rate at which viable information is shared on this sub.  Can you not see the parallel to sacrificing our civil liberties to feel "safe"?  You are supporting the exact notion that this sub is fighting against.

       Battlesack. I pointed out your exact comment as an ad hominem, please stop taking this so personally. I didn't venture through your post history at that moment, I took that specific statement at face value.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 30 day ban is not going to happen anymore, we all know this. At that moment in time, it seemed like a GREAT idea because I had to filter through tons of crap to get to anything worth reading- I've never seen such blatant disrespect directed specifically at this subreddit the whole 2 years I've been here, and it was most of the top comments. I was quite shocked, it was so consistent. And I know nothing is permanent, it would've progressed back to normal over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never once said you are not a contributor, I pointed out how that specific statement didn't and how it related to the topic of the thread. But nobody's perfect, you were obviously angry and I do it as well. We're all human here. I'm not trying to personally hurt you, I keep replying so my original intent is not skewed.

       Do you even know what you are saying? Why does the age of this particular login I am using have anything to do with my credibility?  I have contributed, and my post is on the front page currently.  If anyone is a "shill" it's the folks who are trying to block new accounts, and free speech.

       Are you telling me this isn't a personal attack that contributes nothing? I don't see the point in stating such offensive things to someone you know nothing about. An ad hominem is when you attack a person's character to discredit them. Whether you did it on purpose or not is none of my business, just calling it out for what it is.

       Im glad you googled "ad hominem" after you used it to support your argument.  You attacked me, for a post that challenged this idea of censuring new accounts.  This is just masturbatory back and forth, so Im going to leave you alone.  Your replies are obviously unpopular, and you should sit down and think about what you are doing.

       Why in the hell are you people against this measure? Are you all absurd?

       Why should we allow it to be as simple as new account instantly and you can instantly post whatever you want?

       I am, when you can prove that you actually intent to contribute to an informed conversation by maintaining an account for more than 30 days, rather than just being able to create 10 accounts on the spot in order to go in and completely disrupt any exchange of ideas.

       The ability to sit on an account for 30 days proves absolutely
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       about someone's intentions. You know how easy it is to just create a new account every week or so, then start phasing them in when they're ready for use?

      <p>
       What you do is frustrate people who genuinely want to take part in discussing the topics popular here. Someone fresh and new and excited about talking conspiracies will find somewhere else to do it, while those determined to merely disrupt will find one of the many easy ways to get around this.

       It's non-intrusive, non-indicitive ( other than that the user is new ), and it allows others to make an opinion on their comment based on as little bias as possible ( you should always be wary of brand spanking new accounts it's just common sense we all know how reddit works it's a for profit company with vested interests ).

       I've been on Reddit for over a year, but admit that I've mostly been a spectator rather than a contributor. As this whole Boston thing was going down, Reddit became my go-to news source because of the real time updates / analysis. This event has made me want to contribute my ideas to fellow Redditors.

       So I guess if America was invaded, all the invaders would immediately be US citizens, and they should be subject to all the civil liberties of citizens who weren't "born yesterday" before the invasion?

       You don't get to squash other peoples' voices and then pretend to be victims. If the discussions hadn't been drowned out by new accounts and trolls, this wouldn't have been a problem.

       If they can troll without being assholes, they're not likely to be called trolls. Are you saying trolls are making valid points and being constructive and being undetected as trolls? Then they're not trolls. There's nothing wrong with harping on your point as long as you don't keep repeating yourself when someone engages you.

       I'm totally sure that goes on. I'm totally sure at least half the stuff posted here is bullshit. I think a lot of people here would accuse Alex Jones of being a troll in that respect. However, it's no reason to roll in and start calling people names, and NOT meticulously making the points of evidence for bullshit. I'm entirely sure that there are plenty of trollbait original posts in here. No doubt. However, there is a lot of legitimate concern for things beyond the bombing being a conspiracy in itself. A lot of stories aren't straight, not just the conspiracy theory people. You could troll religious subs the same way by making some big racist religious rant and watch people buy into it. The Daily Show made an artform out of this at the RNC by saying outlandish things and getting people to just go right along with them. If a troll posted disinformation and then the submitter let them in on it after the fact,
       <em>
        I'd
       </em>
       find that hilarious and it would also be productive, because it might create some self-awareness. Again, that's not the entirety of the purpose of this kind of sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I listen to Coast to Coast AM on occasion knowing that at least half the people are kooks, but it's a moderated kook show and a forum for fringe ideas alike. All lines are blurry when the topic of discussion is fringe in itself, so it's not like the bar is very high for trolling.

       Do you even know what you are saying? Why does the age of this particular login I am using have anything to do with my credibility?  I have contributed, and my post is on the front page currently.  If anyone is a "shill" it's the folks who are trying to block new accounts, and free speech.

       And exactly what about your own post was in any way different? You attacked the commentator based on his account age; your post contributed nothing of value to the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the age of the account has absolutely nothing to do with how long a person has been active on reddit. In fact, some of the worst offenders with an agenda on reddit are those who keep a username chugging on over the years, notable examples like (the late-not-so-great) violentacrez, karmanaut, davidreiss666...

       I think the boat story is fucked. I do think that it's possible they were legitimately confused as it seemed like they we're trying to pinpoint officer location on the scanner. Someone may have got trigger happy and others got scared and fired as well. We can only speculate, things will be answered in the trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that one instance isn't 99 percent of the story being wrong. This subreddit is questioning actors, fake blood, dead Brown students, Craft agents, Navy Seals, prosthetic limbs, FBI entrapment, uncle being on fed pay, photo shopping backpacks, specs of dust, "Chill out we didn't do it" primed audio, whether people that live there heard things etc. I get it, I used to be a theorists myself. But not every single thing is a lie.

      <p>
       Sorry I didn't have photographic proof of the crime scene while it was still under investigation. Evidence takes time to collect. Things will be answered in the trial. Then make some theories, not before the evidence is presented.

       Doesnt contribute?? Have you even checked out my account? I have a post on the front page and I do not contribute?  Blocking new users for 30 days to prevent "trolling" is a blatant attempt to stop the rapid rate at which viable information is shared on this sub.  Can you not see the parallel to sacrificing our civil liberties to feel "safe"?  You are supporting the exact notion that this sub is fighting against.
