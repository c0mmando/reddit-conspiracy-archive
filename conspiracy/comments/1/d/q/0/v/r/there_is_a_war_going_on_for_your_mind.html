       Although I don't trust Alex Jones, I do agree 100% with this statement. Today my husband and I were discussing how powerful the perception our realities are, and he lead me to
       <a href="http://www.preterhuman.net/">
        this site
       </a>
       . I may be wrong about it's origins, but from what I remember him telling me is before the internet people would type up text files with their personal knowledge and these are what they are. You can find their dates of origin listed within the text files, but some unfortunately don't have any. Some are current as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       To peak my interest, he pulled up one about the "Illuminati" and the first sentence was similar to, "The goal of creating one reality." and I just can't shake it. To be clear, I perceive the Illumaniti as a concept of sorts, I have no clue if this group from history still contributes to society today. When I first started college, I wanted to be a psychologist and I came across
       <a href="http://www.simplypsychology.org/carl-rogers.html">
        Carl Rogers' humanistic theory
       </a>
       and it rings truth. But as school continued on, I started seeing how his theory is silently swept under the rug in the field, so I then turned my sights to sociology and anthropology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe
       <a href="http://www.marketingpsychology.com/psychmktprobpge.htm">
        psychological marketing
       </a>
       is the reason why his insightful theory is disregarded in psychology. Growth of people doesn't lead to high profit margins. But creating 'problems' and offering products within the subcultures creates very HIGH profit margins. I don't believe this was done on purpose, to create a reality specifically for marketing, but a flaw in our human species. We are not acknowledging as individuals the effects this type of marketing has on us as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am against prescription drugs because they are simply the answer to all of the problems this type of marketing has on our society. Carl Rogers' theory is about exploring why you feel the way you do, and addressing it in a neutral manner so you can solve it
       <em>
        in your own mind
       </em>
       . To have someone listen to you with out pushing their own judgments on you, and help you grow as an individual. That crazy concept that people like to use sarcastically against one another, "You're an individual snowflake.", helps in making people feel they need to contribute to society in a specific way in order to be valuable. The power of global capitalism, backed by this Western view of 'individuality' will be the death of this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The destruction of world cultures is happening at an alarming rate. Our 'Western values' are leaking into other countries, therefore effecitively creating one reality. Global capitalism wouldn't be so bad if there weren't specific thinking patterns connecting to products.
      </p>

       This has been nagging at me lately, so I needed to get it out. Thank you for reading if you did. By the way, thank you
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . You've helped me grow into the person I've always wanted to be.

       Edit: I should've proofread what I typed, had to remove an extra word.

       Hm, it's difficult to explain. In order to be an attractive female, you have to wear make up, or have a specific body type. Or to be a successful person, you need to know how to manipulate people and have a lot of wealth. If you're poor, you're probably on food stamps. If you're rich, you're probably an asshole. If you're black, you probably listen to rap. If you're a lawyer, you're a paid liar. If you're a conspiracy theorist, you're crazy and reject reality. These types of concepts don't give people as individuals enough credit AS individuals. It seems like social interaction happens as: Judgement, manipulation, and then the busting down of multiple barriers within a person to find out who they really are. Even after various barriers are torn down, they're usually put back up to protect our ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the barriers are the thinking patterns that these products create. Instead of going within yourself to find out more about who you are, you can buy a product that gives you the definition attached to it by the marketing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, mainstream music is complete crap. It allows you to blame all of your problems in relationships on the other person, or the failure of a relationship on your SO. How about instead of blaming someone of how they don't meet our standards, we realize that we weren't able to put in what was needed to continue it? It isn't anyones fault, it's just life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality created is basically you can solve your problems outside of yourself. Labeling other people or ideas offers the immediate gratification of your ego built off products, services, whatever it may be that you choose to define yourself with in the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still not doing this concept justice, it's a work in progress. I hope this makes some sense.

       This is just ridiculous. No one is creating problems as you put it to create things to sell, you have an inherited problem of dying from starvation and instead of eating the same food all day long (say tomatoes and rice) people started trading rice for flour, tomatoes for potatoes, but they found this to be inefficient because there were certain materials that couldn't be traded or were too hard to sort of move around and thus as gold, silver, copper became more valuable they started being used as intermediaries for the trades.
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead of offering berries for meat, you offered gold or silver or copper for meat and traded that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       This lead to a great abundance of all sort of food, before people barely survived and most died from starvation at one point or another, but this development created such abundance of food, that people started caring about other things like their clothes, so people who could saw really good started selling there clothes to those who wanted, this created even more prosperity so the next step was for people to care for other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       We use our god given creativity to create all these wonderful things that have enriched out life like sofas, medicine, fast food, computers, heaters, air conditioners, cars, you name it. So we've left the survivability phase where humans died en mass from starvation and gone to the big problems being not having a car and stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       While some countries are still poor, its because they've had tyrants rule them that stiffed freedom, freedom to choose, freedom to create, freedom to trade, freedom to use their god given creativity to do whatever they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those countries who've been the freest have been the most prosperous and the only thing limiting freedom is tyrants and governments.

       I think she means manufactured demand, like new clothing trends and any materialistic products. The things that marketing campaigns convince you that you need in order to be accepted as part of the mainstream society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Food is universally demanded because without it we die.

       I haven't graduated yet, and thanks for the criticism. I do need to work on my writing. I use to be a great writer, not sure what happened, but I really should take advantage of the free writing classes my college offers while I can.
