<p>Like this they wanted to blame Cuba for a series of terror attacks that the US carried out so the motive would be to kill Castro, invade Cuba, set up new war fronts against Communism etc. if you&#39;re sitting round waiting for an excuse and it doesn&#39;t materialise, make an excuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that people don&#39;t seriously consider the option.  We are told that the public opinion is to not question official federal reports.</p>

<p>If you are free from this mass delusion and approach the reports with skepticism, it is clear that the FBI is not truthful and impossibly secretive.</p>

<p>With this case in particular, all of the anecdotal and even official reports from right after the accident disagree with the official story.  Reports which don&#39;t substantiate the official story will be omitted and suppressed moving forward.</p>

<p>The powers at be have the media as their mouthpiece, so as long as everybody just listens to them without questioning their version of things, the &#39;official public opinion&#39; upon which policy is based can manipulate the masses to support whatever the powerful forces want.</p>

<p>My question for you:</p>

<p>Why do people who believe that our media is used to manipulate the truth need to defend their sanity rather than rationally argue?  Look at every large military power in history and you will see that the rulers lied to the people for the means of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On wikipedia look up &quot;Operation PBSuccess&quot;, &quot;Operation AJAX&quot;, &quot;Operation Condor&quot;, and &quot;Strategy of Tension.&quot;  Basically what it boils down to is this: the US government has been deposing of legitimate democracies using &quot;State Terrorism&quot; (another term you should look up) and replacing them with pro-business dictatorships in foreign countries for years now - at least since the 1950s.  All that is happening is they are now going to do that in America. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t even look at what I posted.  I thought you came here to be &quot;educated.&quot;  Okay, you need it spelled out for you - they don&#39;t believe in freedom.  All they care about is money and control.  Freedom gets in the way of them being able to efficiently make money and gain control, which is why they have gotten rid of freedom in foreign countries and now our going to do it in the US as well.  Exact same principle.  We are their serfs and we will do what they say to serve their interests - that&#39;s how they see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does an abusive parent continue to strike fear and trauma into a child after that child&#39;s will is broken? Why do rapists commit their crimes? Why does a violent, controlling husband beat, threaten, isolate, and intimidate his battered wife long after she&#39;s submitted? Why doesn&#39;t the bully leave the kid alone once he has taken lunch money and pride pride from the victim?</p>

<p>All abuse stems from that desire for power and control. Other things may shroud that desire, but that is the heart of it.  At a certain point, though, control is an illusion that can never be held as fully substantial. So, the abuser, depending on circumstances, impulse, or desire, escalates the abuse as an attempt to achieve that greater power, that tighter control. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the compulsion of the violent person. It&#39;s the compulsion of the violent entity. </p>

<p>That how the conspiracy crowd frequently explained how the &quot;North American Union by <del>2005</del> <del>2007</del> 2010!!!&quot; and  &quot;Amero by <del>2005</del> <del>2007</del> 2010!!!&quot; would happen, despite a lack of support for the idea from citizens and elected officials.  </p>

<p>They claimed that a false-flag terror attack would lead to the NAU.  This despite 9/11 having the <strong>opposite</strong> effect - passport controls and other obstacles on the borders for the first time ever.  How often does a terror attack lead to a cry of &quot;We Must Open The Borders With Canada And Mexico!!!&quot;?</p>

<p>They claimed that an economic crisis would lead to the NAU and the Amero.  And yet the 2008 economic crisis had the <strong>opposite</strong> effect - increased protectionism by the US, and Canada distancing itself from the US economy as fast as it can.</p>

<p>WorldNetDaily ran headlines like &quot;U.S. UNDER U.N. LAW IN HEALTH EMERGENCY&quot;, with a tale of how the government has agreed to martial law backed by U.N. troops.  And yet we had SARS.  We Had H1N1.  No martial law.  No UN troops.  (When the lock-down didn&#39;t happen with H1N1, WorldNetDaily even switched to <em>demanding</em> it instead.)</p>

<p>Problem-&gt;Reaction-&gt;Solution is a real political trick in the real world of course, but it has a very poor record of correlating with Alex Jones&#39;s conspiracy theories.  </p>

<p>It all relates to Agenda 21</p>

<p>Yes. Because the instant you rotate your crops or leave trees along the side of your field so the top-soil doesn&#39;t blow away, you&#39;re under the control of Them / They / The Elites.</p>

Also population reduction, by about 90 percent, which they are already working on through using starvation and disease as weapons in third world countries.
