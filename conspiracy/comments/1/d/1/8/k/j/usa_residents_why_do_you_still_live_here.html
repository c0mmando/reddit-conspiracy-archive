        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This title of this post makes it seem a little more hostile than it is meant to be, my apologies. This is just a sincere question to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> about your severe distrust of the government.</p>

<p>Is it financial reasons? Hoping to rebel? Trying to expose truth? Start a rebellion? I don&#39;t believe in the conspiracy theories I see presented here, but since so many do, why not get up and leave if this country is in immediate danger of being a police state? If I believed that, I would be booking a one-way flight out of here.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is our home. You don&#39;t realize how much you love your home until you start watching it being burnt to the ground. </p>

<p>My ancestors on both sides of my family fought and died for this country in the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. If I turned my back on my country - in what is its darkest period since that time - I would be a traitor to my family as well as my country. My forefathers had the courage to fight for these values of freedom and liberty, and sought to establish that as a precedent - no government has the right to take from you the unalienable rights you are given at birth. What would my forefathers think of me if I said, &quot;Well, they took our freedoms, so I guess we&#39;ll just go back to where we came from.&quot; </p>

<p>Every generation since has spent their whole lives reaping the benefits of the battles these men fought and won, and it was glorious for a while, but now that it is unraveling, should I flee at the first sign of trouble? Hell no. </p>

<p>There is nothing to be proud of in watching it all happen, being aware of the evil that is taking over this country, and doing absolutely nothing to stop it or make it right, and just fleeing the scene to save yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yea, its an opinion largely not held by a single person I know across about 20 different states.</p>

<p>Most people I know thoroughly enjoy their lives here. They are healthy. They are active. They go out and see all the things their various cities have to offer. Have you seen the amazing cities we have in America?  </p>

<p>I mean I understand your system floods the media-verse with fear-inducing, panic, chaotic propaganda.... but look... ultimately its dishonest.  If people actually were that scared and fearful, this would have been a lot more effective... but no one fucking bought it.  In fact, it just kind of disgusted us that this was the idea ya&#39;ll came up with. Checnyans bombing the fucking Boston Marathon? Jesus christ what fucking idiots.  I&#39;m proud to be an American. I&#39;m just ashamed I have to share it with you dumb asses. What a colossal waste of human energy.</p>

<p>The only people that are scared at this point is Iran, who&#39;s pumping the god damned Caspian Sea into the middle of their country right now.  Be honest with them. Jesus if you want them to take down their fists and embrace us like brothers, then be honest with them.  Offer your help and compassion. Jesus christ, what is wrong with you people?</p>

<p>And you see, that&#39;s where you are wrong. I&#39;m not ignorant. I&#39;m wise to this bullshit. And just about every single person I know is wise to this bullshit. You want so bad to prove to people that evil exists and you want them to be afraid of it. It&#39;s old. And its disingenuous. Evil exists. It exists in a the form of a comet thats going to hit us one day. It exists in the form of some other calamity we simply haven&#39;t been around long enough to even know it exists.  It doesn&#39;t exist, however, in fabricating and/or deliberately manipulating people to do evil acts. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you know the current state of this country? The unemployment rate? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea, I see the state of it. Its pretty wonderful and shows a lot of great growth opportunites for the ambitious.  Unemployment has fundamentally been redefined because the need for unskilled labor has collapsed. The notion of our nation&#39;s species being dumb and easily manipulated by fearmongering is simply is unsustainable.  Our nation needs to be intelligent and fearful of the real dangers of our existence.</p>

<p>Seriously. Grow up. </p>

<p>I...don&#39;t even know what to say.

<p>WUT. How fucking dumb are you? Really? Jesus, you are very ignorant. Just because you don&#39;t know any unemployed people doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t people unemployed.

<p>Probably one of the most stupid things that I&#39;ve heard in awhile. I&#39;ve never met someone so out of touch with reality. There are people put there who were highly educated in college yet cannot find jobs. Not to mention, student debt. If someone is in debt and doesn&#39;t have a descent paying job, what are they supposed to do? I guess in your world, happiness and wealth just come out of nowhere. I&#39;m really wondering about your mental capacity. I am honestly concerned for you. What troubles me is that there are probably more who think like you.</p>

<p>Debt to whom? Ourselves? Debt is our own creation. Its just one of those thing this guy</p>

<p>Likes to bring up when he wants to try to control us, like we had anything to do with it. In the end... you know what happens to that debt? It grows. It grows. and it grows. And when the last human being dies. It simply disappears.</p>

<p>Yet, nowhere around me do I see this droves of unemployeed. I don&#39;t see them flooding our unemployment offices. I see them surviving and evolving to a new society that doesn&#39;t require high levels of employment. I see them changing, and I see you singing the same song. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>then that must mean we&#39;re doing just FINE!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea, on the whole I&#39;d say things are doing alright. You know we&#39;re really working on bring things back down to a more local non-giant conglomerate of bureaucracy kind of society... you know that yeoman farmer kind of society that Jefferson had in mind... Yea... I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re shooting for. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are people put there who were highly educated in college yet cannot find jobs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they were taught by you the shitty idea that being &quot;highly educated&quot; would automatically equate to them getting jobs.  That&#39;s simply not true. Being able to do something someone values in our society equates to getting a job. Spending 4 years of your life learning Jungian psychology doesn&#39;t do squat for you. What these people are suffering from is your very very nieve and idiotic understanding of the world. What they are supposed to do is learn how to be valuable to those around them. There are literally thousands of ways they can do this today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess in your world, happiness and wealth just come out of nowhere. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. Happiness and wealth come out a result of my decisions and my hard work. Happiness and wealth come out of a rational understanding of the world that is not manipulated by irrational fear of the unknown. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;m really wondering about your mental capacity. I am honestly concerned for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t give a shit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What troubles me is that there are probably more who think like you. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all think like I do ultimately. We all act in competent manner. Your time is over Pieces. Aquarius is here.</p>

<p>Can I get some proof? Or is that just speculation? Because last time I checked, an industrialized nation needs jobs.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t an industrialized nation anymore. This is an information services nation. The eCommerce landscape is growing the opportunities for employment by the day. This growth is <strong>accelerating</strong>. Our future marketplace is 100% virtual. We have created such new and novel employment opportunities for anyone. Fivrr is one the most beautiful concepts man has ever conceived of.  Kickstarter is another creation of this new type of nation, that allows anyone with a dream and a good plan , the ability to get the funding to bring their dream into reality. Its fucking gorgeous. And you are too busy people trying to tell people how scared and terrified they need to be, to help them see the amazing opportunities are all around them, they just need to reach out and grab them. </p>

<p>I...don&#39;t even know what to say. Do you know how hard it is to find a job today? <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/mounting-unemployment-in-america-hundreds-of-thousands-drop-out-of-the-workforce/5330086">Look at this</a>. To be honest, I can&#39;t believe you think that this nation is headed toward greatness. Based on how brainwashed you are and your grammar, I can tell that you aren&#39;t the sharpest tool in the shed. But you don&#39;t need to bring that bullshit here. If you can provide me a link to how you believe this country is going to get better, then by all means do it.</p>
