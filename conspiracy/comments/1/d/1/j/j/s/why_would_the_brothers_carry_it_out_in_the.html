       Multiple witnesses and photos have confirmed the increased security measures at this year's marathon. Surely these guys would have noticed the bomb dogs, right?

       well to be fair he did escape through a police barricade in a town that was filled with every alphabet agency known to America and hide in a boat for 2 days undetected by dogs and all of those cops....a few hundred yards away from the shoot out....yeahhh.

       My friend I was driving around listening to my police app through the speakers of my cushy 2001 Marquis. He was in there less than 24 hours. The police were convinced they had him contained into a particular geographic area of 20 blocks. As it turns out he was contained within 25 blocks.

       I guess that's a possibility. I just can't imagine a radical terrorist doesn't think things through a bit more. If it was a suicide bombing, then sure, why give a fuck? I like your examples, have an upvote.

       If radical terrorists thought shit through they'd bomb schools and other targets that have fantastic emotional response and are tied to the government they are attacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       By and large, terrorist attacks are illogical. Trying to apply logic to them is a common failing that makes conspiracy theories seem likely. We want to think the world makes sense and that everyone acts logically. If that was actually true, entire branches of study, like economics, would be a hell of a lot easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to believe that everything makes sense and that shit like this was part of a bigger plan. Experience says that's far more unlikely an explanation than simple incompetence, though. Being rational means accepting that the most likely explanation is probably correct. That's not to say accept everything you're told, but rather to ask yourself what the probability what you're told is true as compared to other theories. In some cases, the official story seems to be the best explanation.

       It is better for everyone to understand that Mujahideen are fearless. Muslims defend God in the face of the invader and oppressor. Without Islam, NOBODY would stand against evil in the US and occupied territories, nobody would retaliate for drone attacks killing thousands of innocent muslims.

2) if the gov was alerted to a possible attack and they failed to stop it, well fuck them, they failed either way. Refute that, please.

         Our security teams are either fucking idiots. Because they got outsmarted by 2 19 year old college students...

       I thought about the bomb sniffing dogs and the dog(s) they used to attempt to track Dzokhar down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it has more to do with the dogs abilities or training for those extremely high density events.  A dog can track someone through the woods but it's tougher through a neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still though I think it's something worth looking into.  There are a lot of different variables in this case.  Gaining knowledge by breaking down each facet can only be beneficial in uncovering the truth.

       Not what I'm talking about. I'm not wondering why the dogs didn't detect the bombs. I would be very impressed to see the dogs detect anything from any sort of distance at an event like that.

       The dogs did sweeps.  They likely came in after one of the sweeps.  We're talking about a 26 mile event.  There wasn't enough dogpower to maintain a constant presence.  Granted the finish would be elevated in terms of importance.

       "Why would the brothers carry it out in the presence of bomb sniffing dogs and enhanced security?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do bank robbers rob a bank? 
Why do people grow weed when they know the DEA is after them?
Why do people steal things from stores when they know there are cameras and loss-prevention officers there?
      </p>
      <p>
       The brazenness of the act itself answers your questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's an inherent risk to any act like this.  And to counter that question.  How were the brothers able to carry the bombing out in the presence of bomb sniffing dogs and enhanced security?  They were successful, right?  If they had disguises on, who knows, we might still be searching for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: just noticed evildead posted the same questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also " I just can't imagine a radical terrorist doesn't think things through a bit more. "
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, but look at the 2nd "Phase" of their attack (thursday and friday 18&amp;19th).  It is possible they were lucky, and that security was good, but not good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the last thing.  The effectiveness of a bomb sniffing dog does relate to your question.  If the dogs aren't effective, and we remove them from the equation.  The Tsarnaev brothers only had to worry about security.  And in a sea of people, I would imagine it would be possible for even highly trained people to fail.  One person's sight and mind can interpret only a certain amount of data, a lot, sure, but this was a massive event.

       If you're dumb enough to carjack, shoot and throw bombs at the police, and bomb innocent people, I don't think the presence of dogs and security is going to play a large role in your decision making process.

       Because I don't think they are dumb as more of a tool. In such that MK Ultra was involved. All you have to do is watch this video of

       Let's look at it. They were doing well in college with paid grants, and doing well in school. They were on the Fed payroll and watch list. Supposed to have so called connections to an unknown radical Muslim cell to which no evidence of such. One just had a baby. Shooting out in a cell phone video "we didn't do it". Like they just came around and wtf happened memory kicking in? Hiding and acting irrationally in evading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah sounds like Scopolamine to myself. Just a little whiff, and it's a done deal. These kids had a lot going for them. Why would they flush it down the toilet? IMO they didn't. They were used as a tool by the CIA with a higher agenda.

       I doubt he is MENSA level.. this is the same kid laying in a hospital bed answering questions about his motivations and accomplices.. he has no idea he has the right to remain silent? None at all??

       Quick story about working security at Harvard. While walking through a parking lot one night I find a Ford Probe door ajar expensive camera equipment and laptop laying on back seat. I have HUPD run the plate and tell me what dorm the guy lives in. I lock up the car and go to his dorm for a well being check. I wake him up tell him what I found with his car and he says "fuck I did it again?"

       Ya bro.. you did it again.

       He actually didn't have the right to remain silence in this instance, as much as I wish he did. They revoked that because it was an act of terror for safety reasons and all that jazz.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know you are going to be famous when you are caught/killed, so I imagine they would think it through. And if they didn't wanna be caught, they would probably have thought it through more as well.

       This is simply retarded.. because they didn't tell him for what probably would have been the one millionth time he heard it since he has been in the country that he had the right to remain silent he lost that right? You are saying he was FORCED to speak because no one told him he did not have to? Thats double fuck retarded.
