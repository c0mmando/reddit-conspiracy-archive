    <div class="md"><p>If radical terrorists thought shit through they&#39;d bomb schools and other targets that have fantastic emotional response and are tied to the government they are attacking.</p>

<p>By and large, terrorist attacks are illogical. Trying to apply logic to them is a common failing that makes conspiracy theories seem likely. We want to think the world makes sense and that everyone acts logically. If that was actually true, entire branches of study, like economics, would be a hell of a lot easier. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to believe that everything makes sense and that shit like this was part of a bigger plan. Experience says that&#39;s far more unlikely an explanation than simple incompetence, though. Being rational means accepting that the most likely explanation is probably correct. That&#39;s not to say accept everything you&#39;re told, but rather to ask yourself what the probability what you&#39;re told is true as compared to other theories. In some cases, the official story seems to be the best explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought about the bomb sniffing dogs and the dog(s) they used to attempt to track Dzokhar down.</p>

<p>I think it has more to do with the dogs abilities or training for those extremely high density events.  A dog can track someone through the woods but it&#39;s tougher through a neighborhood.</p>

<p>Still though I think it&#39;s something worth looking into.  There are a lot of different variables in this case.  Gaining knowledge by breaking down each facet can only be beneficial in uncovering the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Why would the brothers carry it out in the presence of bomb sniffing dogs and enhanced security?&quot;</p>

<p>Why do bank robbers rob a bank? 
Why do people grow weed when they know the DEA is after them?
Why do people steal things from stores when they know there are cameras and loss-prevention officers there?</p>

<p>The brazenness of the act itself answers your questions.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an inherent risk to any act like this.  And to counter that question.  How were the brothers able to carry the bombing out in the presence of bomb sniffing dogs and enhanced security?  They were successful, right?  If they had disguises on, who knows, we might still be searching for them.</p>

<p>Edit: just noticed evildead posted the same questions.</p>

<p>Also &quot; I just can&#39;t imagine a radical terrorist doesn&#39;t think things through a bit more. &quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, but look at the 2nd &quot;Phase&quot; of their attack (thursday and friday 18&amp;19th).  It is possible they were lucky, and that security was good, but not good enough.</p>

<p>And the last thing.  The effectiveness of a bomb sniffing dog does relate to your question.  If the dogs aren&#39;t effective, and we remove them from the equation.  The Tsarnaev brothers only had to worry about security.  And in a sea of people, I would imagine it would be possible for even highly trained people to fail.  One person&#39;s sight and mind can interpret only a certain amount of data, a lot, sure, but this was a massive event.</p>

All you have to do is watch this video of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToQ8PWYnu04">&quot;The Devils Breath&quot;</a> to get an understanding. A drug cultivated that can turn you into a good little zombie, and get you to do anything they want for several days on end before snapping out of it.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at it. They were doing well in college with paid grants, and doing well in school. They were on the Fed payroll and watch list. Supposed to have so called connections to an unknown radical Muslim cell to which no evidence of such. One just had a baby. Shooting out in a cell phone video &quot;we didn&#39;t do it&quot;. Like they just came around and wtf happened memory kicking in? Hiding and acting irrationally in evading. </p>

<p>Yeah sounds like Scopolamine to myself. Just a little whiff, and it&#39;s a done deal. These kids had a lot going for them. Why would they flush it down the toilet? IMO they didn&#39;t. They were used as a tool by the CIA with a higher agenda.</p>
