       Seriously that is 3 million psychopaths in the US alone. Even if you assume that just 1% of psychopaths are highly intelligent and sufficiently manipulative that is still leaves 30,000 people. Then if you assume that just 1% of them seek to get into powerful roles in government and corporations, that still leaves you with 300 people who are possibly playing massive roles in policy making. These people have the opportunity to control the lives of millions of people. How the US or any other government not fallen apart by now is a mystery to me.

       It's even worse than that.  Sociopathy helps one rise in government, so the concentration of sociopaths at higher levels is more than 1%.  I'm guessing at minimum triple, and for Congress there's a good chance of at least 1 in every 20.   Since many in the Senate are wealthy people who gained their money with the help of sociopathic business activities (or their spouses, like Dianne Feinstein's husband), the proportion is even higher there. The Senate does NOT represent your interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does sociopathy help one rise? Because the lying, cheating, and lack of guilt help a sociopath win out over an honest person running for office.  Once in office, these help keep them there. Plus, sociopaths will cooperate with other sociopaths to keep themselves in power. So someone will vote for a bil another sociopath is pushing for his owners, to get beneficial quid pro quo.

       Well, I gotta partly agree with you, but I have a bit of faith that some of us can rise above the limitations of animals and exist at a higher level where sometimes we're smart enough to foresee our futures, and realize that if we support each other in a reasonable way, we can all have a better existence.

       There is really no evidence that lying, cheating, or lack of guilt are characteristics that help someone in politics. If anything, I imagine those qualities aren't going to get you very far in

       I'll add another fact. Psychopaths (or sociopaths) move very quickly up the corporate ladder because they are willing to be ruthless. They concentrate in higher positions in certain work areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically, surgeons have a high incidence of sociopaths. Perhaps it's easier to cut someone open and hold their life in your hand when you lack empathy.

       Psychopaths and sociopaths are not the same thing. This is something that should be understood. Many sociopaths can lead normal lives, just without the feeling of empathy toward other people. People who are psychopaths, (anti-social personality disorder), are a completely different breed and have a hard time functioning in society if they can function at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest difference in the two is a sociopath can understand pain and pleasure, using that to help him or her go forward in life. These people usually don't know what is wrong with them and often seem like regular everyday people. A psychopath doesn't quite get pain and pleasure; this leads to violence as they try and understand the world around them.

       This should definitely be stressed more. I've come across a few sociopaths in my day and was very skeptical when I began to see signs because I assumed that meant they had to be killers or just plain nuts. But they definitely live normal lives, they just like to push the limits of said lives to see what they can get away with.

       I dated an oral surgeon once and he was really really oddly into blood and gore.  Needless to say  I ended that relationship.  But he was extremely wealthy and extremely good looking and chose a profession where he cut open people on a daily basis and he loved every second of it.

       Power is a psychopathic culture and if you go along to get along it becomes a more psychopathic culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       To measure the psychosis of the power you simply asses who would do the things that are being done that we discuss here and what basic motivation they must adhere to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surveillance, police state tendencies, prison population out of control, preparation for war against ordinary Americans, spy culture, too big to jail, unending war, all come from psychopathic mindsets.

       Another interesting thing is that being manipulative is a trait of psychopaths.  No conscience and manipulative pretty much hits the nail on the head.

       There have already been studios that show those in power are dangerously psychotic. Listen to their debates, they clearly have ZERO grasp on reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though consider this, people can be fooled but ones actions will immediately betray their farce. So the real problem isn't psychopaths, the real problem is the apathetic masses.

       You can't just make a blanket statement about successful people like this. Thats no different than saying, "The only reason why I'm not Rich, influential, and powerful is because I'm not a sociopath."
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think there are some powerful shitty human beings who consider themselves more important than the rest of us. That however, doesn't make them a psychopath. Just a shitty human being. And I'd hope that there are some good people in positions of power as well.

       Nobody was making that statement. How did you come away with that interpretation? Was that an attempt to try and justify all the backstabbing you do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust me, there are plenty of rich people who aren't sociopaths. The main argument here is that sociopaths THRIVE doing things or jobs that normal people would never do. This allows a socio/pyschopathic person, with even a low IQ, to thrive and become powerful.

       Evil can influence society much more easily than Good.

       I suppose they could have just listed psychopathy as a job requirement for working in the big house but a person who was headstrong &amp; steadfast, willing to do what it takes , tirelessly hardworking, charismatic &amp; charming, an eloquent speaker, quick witted and decisive and who is completely adaptable to an ever changing world sounded slightly more marketable.

       <em>
        shakes had sadly
       </em>
       Having read through your comment history I just have to say, you need help. I believe that you are literally paranoid, a frightened little boy in the body of a man. Please seek counseling.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are suffering from several delusions. Primary among them is the idea that you are more intelligent than other people, or more conscious / alert / discerning / shrewd - that only you and maybe a select few share your powers of observation. Otherwise why would only you few see through this masterfully constructed charade that is your enemies' conspiracy to keep you down?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is possible that you are of above-average intelligence. It is also possible that you are of below-average intelligence. But it is a
       <em>
        certainty
       </em>
       that there are
       <em>
        smarter
       </em>
       , more perceptive people than you and the vast majority of them - of all races, religions and backgrounds - do not share your point of view. You must ask yourself how that's possible. Especially if the group you believe is behind this great conspiracy is inferior to your own race, how is it possible that such a group could pull the wool over
       <em>
        so many superior peoples' eyes?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this the reasoning that brings you to try to explain your point of view to others? Is the idea that this reasoning is flawed and you
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       it to be flawed the reason that you hide your identity while doing so? I think you know yourself to paranoid. I think you know you're wrong. I think you know that your ideas are an impossibility, and that frightens you more than anything else. It's just too convenient to blame someone for the world's problems, for your
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       problems. It's just too convenient to not blame yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must know that constructing reasons in your mind to deny anything that contradicts your established beliefs is not logical. You must know that contradicting science, history, philosophy in order to blame the world's problems on a small group of people makes no sense. There is a sickness inside you that is causing you to hurt yourself and may cause you to hurt others if it hasn't already. Genuinely, you need treatment, perhaps medication. You need to question your ideas regarding Jews. You need to actually learn to view things with your own eyes instead of believing nonsense that you read or are told - it is obvious you have never met an actual Jewish family by what you've written.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, please get help. Get evaluated. Find out if your problem is only cognitive or if it's neurological and chemical as well. That can be genetic.

       Seriously though, for your own mental health, check into a clinic, talk to a psychiatrist, do something. Living this way is unhealthy and is undoubtedly shortening your lifespan, and for what? For some imaginary internet points and pats on the back from others with your condition? Don't you have friends or family that would like to see you go back the way you were before, happy and healthy? Not living in a paranoid delusional bubble?

       I see everyone in this topic moaning about "our evil psycopathic overlords" and realize that apparently people are not aware that psycopaths are
       <em>
        necessary
       </em>
       for occupying the top niches of any social/political/economic power structure. Touch-feeling, empathetic people simply wouldn't work well there, and would be quickly crushed by psycopaths in rival power structures. So, our misunderstood friend, Natural Selection, always will keep psycopaths in power, and for a good reason.

       By the way there is even a book about that:

       I couldn't disagree more. Actually my perception is exactly the opposite: the school system is designed to be a sheeple factory, creating people that share the same opinions about the same subjects, don't question any "truth" and, above all, program into the children blind acceptance of authority.

       Except Jews, right? In that case your nature is extremely psychopathic. Just from the fact that you don't even realize how your blatant revisionist history and racism could be offensive to others and yet you describe yourself as an "empathetic individual" it is clear you are 100% full of shit and are most likely a sociopath and compulsive liar to boot.

       I think you should tone it down a bit. By calling Ashkenazis psychopaths, you are crossing the line between religion and racism. We all know that the US government is controlled (mostly) by white Christians. So by using your logic on this topic, the same could be said of white Christians. We enable the psychopathic government of Israel to do their deeds, so ultimately who is more evil? I don't think evil or psychopathy is neatly confined within racial boundaries like that. Long story short, please tone it down. I like having you around. You are super knowledgeable about alot of subjects and you are generally respectful and obey the rules of the sub. If you start talking about Ashkenazis being psychopathic, you are crossing a line that was drawn in the sand a while ago. I'm sorry but I can't bend the rules on this one.

       I really think you're projecting your psychopathy unto others. If I had to share a cabin in the woods for a weekend and my choice was you, Alan Dershowitz or Bibi Netanyahu, I'd choose the latter 2 before I'd ever choose you because you're a scary fascistic individual trying to force your beliefs onto everyone around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact having a nice long conversation with Dershowitz or Netanyahu is something I'd pay to do because they are so full of knowledge and personal wealth and wisdom that can be spread. I can't say the same for you however, I'd most probably pay to keep people like you away at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't do anything to Finkelstein btw, you're just projecting again.

       Where are you getting information on a transition from "Divine Female" to "male God of War"? Most cultures of the time were polytheistic and it's quite possible to find what we might consider gendered roles in their opposite gender. Enki (or Ea), for instance, was a god of creation and fertility because it was his semen which created the Tigris-Euphrates.
