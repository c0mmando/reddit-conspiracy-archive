    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m friends with a few of these so-called billionaire banker elite, and I have yet to see anyone transform into a reptile or worship giant flaming owls.</p>

<p>I once had drinks at a patio bar with said mega-banker friend.  We were having a cigarette when low and behold an Alex Jones fan sat next to us sharing his infinite wisdom on the banking elite, even making the suggestion that all the banking elite worship a giant owl and shape-shift into reptiles.  </p>

<p>My point is, instead of believing kooks like David Icke or Alex Jones or Glenn Beck, THINK FOR YOURSELF, AND STOP BEING A DUMBASS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somebody explain why being more in tune with the most primitive, worthless part of the brain leads to a secret society. The only animal even capable of something similar to shapeshifting in the wild is the mimic octopus, and they&#39;re classified as cephalopods, not reptiles. </p>

<p>The concept, from what I can understand, is that those who use the reptilian portion of the brain more are basically prone to anti-social, aggressive, territorial behavior. That&#39;s where the similarities end and the bullshit begins. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that kind of what I&#39;m asking?</p>

<p><em>The Biggest Secret</em> purports to have accounts of people who saw reptilian transformations, but those accounts aren&#39;t evidence. Anyone can spin a story. There are videos on Youtube that claim to capture brief transformations. You have to decide for yourself whether or not they&#39;re hoaxes.</p>

<p>So the question is, how would we get actual evidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It may not be &#39;solid proof&#39; of anything, but if I may, I would like to relate a friend&#39;s personal experience he had.  He told me about this experience long before he or I had ever heard anything about reptilians or conspiracies.  Take this for what it&#39;s worth.</p>

<p>My friend travels to the US on a fairly regular basis.  Something like 15 years ago he was in Florida at a mall walking around inside.  When he said he suddenly felt a chilling feeling coming from a very specific direction.  He said he turned his head in the direction he felt like it was coming from and instantly picked out a taller man in the crowd.  The man was simply walking along.  He said he either blinked or looked away and looked back and the man was standing facing him looking directly at him.  His face looked like your classic &#39;repitilian head&#39; drawing you can find online.  Maybe something like 5 years ago I showed him one of those pictures you can find kinda like <a href="http://www.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=http://alien-ufo-research.com/reptilians/Reptilian.jpg&amp;amp;imgrefurl=http://alien-ufo-research.com/reptilians/&amp;amp;h=599&amp;amp;w=491&amp;amp;sz=71&amp;amp;tbnid=orIfmwwYVyHnEM:&amp;amp;tbnh=98&amp;amp;tbnw=80&amp;amp;zoom=1&amp;amp;usg=__XwdtPYO7l_yHOIM9Et8708uc4dw=&amp;amp;docid=Wc7GluDT5ZqbEM&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=bWWAUdDQNYuyqQGf3oDICA&amp;amp;ved=0CD8Q9QEwBA&amp;amp;dur=120">this!</a>  He said that pretty much yeah that was it.  He said this thing looking at him accross the crowd was just terrifying and he felt like he had to just leave as quickly as possible, which he did, walking outside almost immediately afterwards.  As he was walking away he said he looked back and the man appeared normal again.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you honestly that at that time in my friend&#39;s life he smoked a bit of pot, but never did anything harder and he definitely doesn&#39;t chalk the experience up to halucination, he remembers the experience very vividly and intensely.</p>
