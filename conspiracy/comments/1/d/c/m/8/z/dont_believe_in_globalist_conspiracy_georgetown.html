        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any  other groups, and frequently does so. I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960&#39;s, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies, but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known. --pp 950</p>

<p>&quot;In addition to these pragmatic goals, the powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. <strong>This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences.</strong> The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world&#39;s central banks, which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank, in the hands of men like Montague Norman of the Bank of England, Benjamin Strong of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, Charles Rist of the Bank of France, and Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbank, <strong>sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world.</strong> --pp 324</p>

<p>&quot;The chief backbone of this organization grew up along the already existing financial cooperation running from the Morgan Bank in New York to a group of international financiers in London led by the Lazard Brothers. --pp 951</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>This front organization, called the Royal Institute for International Affairs, had as its nucleus in each area the existing submerged Round Table Group. In New York, it was known as the Council on Foreign Relations, and was a front for J. P. Morgan and Company.</strong> The New York branch was dominated by the associates of the Morgan Bank. </p>

<p>For example, in 1928 the Council on Foreign Relations had John W. Davis as President, Paul Cravath as VP, and a council of thirteen others, which included Owen D. Young, Russell C. Leffingwell, Norman Davis, Allen Dulles, George W. Wickersham, Frank L. Polk, Whitney Shepardson, Isaiah Bowman, Stephen P. Duggan, and Otto Kahn. </p>

<p>The academic figures have ben those linked to Morgan, such as James T. Shotwell, Charles Seymour, Joseph P. Chamberlain, Philip Jessup, Isaiah Bowman, and more recently, Philip Moseley, Grayson L. Kirk, and Henry M Wriston. The Wall Street Contact with these were created originally from Morgan&#39;s influence in handling large academic endowments, that at Harvard.</p>

<p>Closely allied with this Morgan influence were a small group of Wall Street law firms, whose chief figures were Elihu Root, John W. Davis, Paul D. Cravath, Russell Leffingwell, the Dulles brothers, and more recently, Arthur H. Dean, Philip D. Reed, and John J. McCloy.&quot; --pp 952</p>

<p>--Dr. Carrol Quigley, author of Tragedy and Hope: A History of the World in Our Time, Macmillan, 1964, Professor of History at Georgetown University, and self-professed insider who was granted access to study and document the private correspondences and records of the families of the anglo world&#39;s financial and industrial elite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Small plug: a friend of mine wrote a great, highly literate book on the history of conspiracy theory and its treatment by the establishment, centered around the events of 9/11. Would recommend anyone interested in a serious discussion of the subject to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Reign-Terror-Re-Thinking-ebook/dp/B0055LL0DA">check it out</a>. Looks like he lowered the price and the Kindle version is only $1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read all 1300 pages of Tragedy and Hope.  Only about 150 of them are really relevant to what is discussed here, but boy are they important.  I&#39;ve been meaning to read The Anglo-American Establishment.  If you look hard enough on youtube etc., there is (was?) a multi-part interview with him in which he, among other things, discusses what the ultimate goal is, based on important people who proposed those goals.  I think the one he was most inclined to believe was a tripartite world almost identical to the world of 1984.  He goes into great depth about why it would be divided the way it was as he was what was then referred to as a &#39;macro-historian&#39;.  A great deal of Tragedy and hope was devoted to things like production capacity, production of pig-iron, political alliances, innovations in technology etc.;hence &#39;macro-historian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly and ultimately I think these goblins are led by a much darker force which the bible has warned us about. </p>

<p>This is why its crucial to expose the one world government and one world currency which will be electronic/internet currency and I believe bitcoin is the beta test for it.</p>

<p>Its private, its unknown who created/runs it, and surprisingly has been allowed to operate where all other currencies have been shut down and all people imprisoned. </p>

<p>Also I believe the current top of EU &quot;officials&quot; are serving their hell master to beta test the EU as a one world government. </p>

<p>I believe the beginning of the world government will start when a large war starts (Iran?, N. Korea?, bigger war?) for which they will make it as such so that the people beg for it. It will be sold as the solution to our problems, free money will be promised to everyone who gets the chip.</p>

<p>This will go alongside Agenda 21, smart growth, smart cities policies, all designed to destroy small businesses and human interaction so that no one has money or even jobs to be independent and uppity and the only solution would be government, in this case world government. </p>

<p>Also supposedly a fake leader will arrive, we don&#39;t know yet if to sell the world government or after promising to get rid of it?</p>

<p>The BTC network is a P2P crypto-based currency and payment system which is driven and operated by its users. There is no central issuer of currency, there is no way to inflate the currency, there is no way to take control of the network, it is anonymous, it is everything the big banks do not want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I don&#39;t know, to buy an airline ticket?  To buy dinner for my wife?</p>

<p>You know, to buy stuff...</p>

<p>But even if it became more widespread for use in purchasing, the fact remains that this currency keeps all transactional history in the fabric of the P2P overlay network that the currency is formed from.  If the goal of a currency such as bitcoin is to enter a new age free from financial tyranny, then it doesn&#39;t make much sense to bet on this one, given that is completely audit-able.</p>

<p>You may think that creating throw-away accounts anonymizes the use of bitcoin, but that is only true for one-off transactions.  If you create any patterns of use, such as systematically receiving income from it and spending it at the same places, modern graph theory can correlate those patterns down to a probabilistic profile of you.</p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t.  Certainly, the type of tyranny will be different, but no less significant.  </p>

<p>A deflationary currency disproportionally enriches the &quot;rich&quot;.  Imagine your salary going down every year at the same rate that bitcoin increases in value.  You may like how this has worked for you so far, but you aren&#39;t thinking ahead far enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, there is no feasible way to do it, and the benefits wouldn&#39;t even come close to comparing to the cost it would take to even attempt to do so. </p>

<p>You would need to control the majority of computing power that makes up the network, and then all you would get out of it is the ability to &quot;unwrite&quot; transactions for the specific block chain that is currently being solved, provided it was one of your servers that solved the block first. </p>

<p>So you could spend a lot of money to essentially double the amount of computing power the BTC network is comprised of, which COULD then in theory be used to untransfer coins, however you do not gain any control over other portions of the network nor other people&#39;s coins.</p>

<p>The only value here is if you spend an immense amount of coins in a short period of time, receive whatever goods you were paying for, then unwrite the BTC transfer history, and then solve the block chain before the other half of the network does with the correct data. The time frame in which this all would need to take place is much shorter than it would take to transfer any item between buyer and seller.</p>

<p>When all is said and done, there is more value and earning potential in being part of the network than in trying to &quot;take it over.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 100 mill number was off by quite a bit... Here are some more numbers for thought:</p>

<p>According to this article: <a href="http://mineforeman.com/2013/02/13/800-giga-hash-per-second-user-just-started-mining-at-btcguild/">http://mineforeman.com/2013/02/13/800-giga-hash-per-second-user-just-started-mining-at-btcguild/</a></p>

<p>Two months ago there was roughly 16,000 GH/s of computing power available on the BTC network. 
The network is designed such that, currently, 3600 BTC per day are generated.</p>

<p>You can get specialized boxes for ~75 BTC (about $10k) which provide 63 GH/s of power. To double the amount of power the network had back in Feb at this price it would cost roughly $2,539,682. With half the computing power of the network you would earn about 1800 BTC a day, or $252,000 at current market value.</p>

<p>If you are at the point where you can earn a quarter million a day by doing literally nothing, would you continue doing that, or try to roll back some payments and possibly sabotage your multi-million dollar per week operation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a suspicion about the two organizations:</p>

<p>There&#39;s an old pre-EU complaint from an American President - I forget which one - that when he wanted Europe to do something there was no one person he could call.</p>

<p>It can be the same with an individual country:  You can complain to the British Prime Minister, but British enterprise does its own thing.</p>

<p>The purpose of such organizations isn&#39;t just to get one country&#39;s government AND enterprise working on one page with regard to foreign policy, in that country&#39;s interests....  It&#39;s to another country someone to negotiate with / complain to.  Some group that more or less represents that country&#39;s interests as a whole, both government and enterprise.</p>

<p>Of course, only large corporations would have the power to be at the table.  And those same corporations would be the ones donating the most campaign funds to the government folks at the table.  And they don&#39;t have YOUR best interests at heart.</p>
