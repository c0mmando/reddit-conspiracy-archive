        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Even if you believe the MSM and their take on what happened to Boston, it still boggles my mind one how the police are portrayed as heroes. I don&#39;t want to turn this into a staged vs what happened topic, so lets say the official story is 100% true for the purposes of this topic.</p>

<p>What did the police officers do to be portrayed the way they currently are. The brothers had 1 semi automatic pistol, yet over 200 rounds were fired that night. There are pictures of bullets hitting inside peoples homes. The police could have just as easily killed an innocent person in their own home, and were a lot more likely too because of their arsenal and amount of bullets fired. </p>

<p>Also, they let suspect 2 get away multiple times through out the night. These trained police officers let a 19 year old college student slip through their grasp. </p>

<p>Then they proceeded to go house to house, because they really had no clue where he was. Whether you want to argue about the whole martial law thing or not, its still a joke that this had to be done in the first place. </p>

<p>But instead of talking about how grossly incompetent the police force reacted that night, they are praised as heroes. Even if you want to acknowledge the risks they took, and their character as human beings, ignoring how poorly they handled the situation is irresponsible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I by no means think the police handled it properly.</p>

<p>To me they looked like kids who got to take their shiny new toys out to finally play. The just looked a little bit too excited to take the Humvee out, and like you said you have them looking for someone who just killed one of their fellow officers so revenge is definitely on their minds. I&#39;ve heard they used some non lethal rounds during the boat part, which might explain how they fired to many times into that boat not not killed him.</p>

<p>So yes the police did not exactly have some shining moment, the FBI were the ones who put the picture out and the suspects panicked and flushed themselves out.</p>

<p>that being said, I think there was alot of fear that they suspects would not be found for a long time, or that they had already been long gone. The knowledge of knowing that the men who did it are no longer a threat, I think that is what people were truly cheering, the fact that it was over and a short term situation, not some lengthy investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought the suspects were said to have two pistols and at least one rifle at the time of the shootout? In addition to explosives...</p>

<p>However I do agree that the search was kind of pathetic. According to witnesses in the area, the police never even searched the street with the boat before calling off their search. The thing you&#39;re looking for is always in the last place you look, and they chose to just not look in the last place XD</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think, increasingly, the powers that be are losing control of the security services--and they know it.  They were afraid of a breakdown in police discipline: another Christopher Dorner situation. Police in particular these days seem really used to the idea that they&#39;re the apex predator and, when they become hunted, they tend to lash out in violent, unpredictable ways. With the threat of shooting as well as bombing, it would have been open season on brown people in Boston. </p>

<p>These kinds of embarrassments don&#39;t stay in the media long, but I would argue they&#39;re deeply corrosive to authority structures.  I would assume that the aforementioned fiasco in LA is the deeply repressed referent for a lot of the hypocritical back-patting.  It&#39;s like killing bin Laden: congratulations. The biggest military in the world killed a sixty-year old man in his bed.  But maybe if we cheer loudly enough, the sound of the entire edifice cracking will go away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this almost entirely. Someone should be fired for how they shot up the boat. Crazy recklessness.  I actually think focusing on trying to find a globalist-esque conspiratorial angle just helps the police get away with their overreaction and internal cover up, as has happened many times before. Police, well intentioned or not, just don&#39;t have the incentives to police themselves and it creates a culture of self preservation where glaring mistakes that endanger the public meet with no real consequences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good point, I feel a reference to the old lady getting shot in the Dornor case would illustrate this quite well. One car not matching the description getting shot at multiple times and only one on target. I still struggle with what is worse. Shooting innocent people or missing a sitting target multiple times. Thankfully she lived but then again she should have been riddled with bullets. I&#39;m glad I live in the UK, as US police training seems to be highly ineffective. Not many of them seem to handle a high stress scenario at all well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Upon discarding the black Mercedes ML350, Dzhokhar fled on foot...&quot;Police initially tracked the escaped suspect by a blood trail he left behind a house after abandoning the Mercedes, negotiating his surrender hours later in the boat.&quot;

<p>Here is the problem I have with this.  There is this animal called &quot;the bloodhound&quot;, and it was basically made for this exact scenario. The FBI knows this - most Police Departments know this - but they would rather have drones and urban assault vehicles and all other manner of war like toys with which to assert over the public (I keep looking at that photo to the right of this thread of the swat-cop in the turret of the Humvee, sighting in on a hapless mundane.) </p>

<p>More on the bloodhound: <a href="http://youtu.be/DPZXYkFx6nA">http://youtu.be/DPZXYkFx6nA</a></p>

<p>In short, I don&#39;t respect the police or feds as an organization.  As individuals, I treat them with the same level of respect as I wish to be treated, but not one scintilla more.</p>
