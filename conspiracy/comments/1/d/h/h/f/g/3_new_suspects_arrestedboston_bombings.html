    <div class="md"><p>That article states its two men and 1 woman. Here we have three men. While its possible that two of them are the same men , without the names mentioned or any follow up from WBSM its a loose end. (One possible link: Note the neighbor report that &quot;the three who were questioned share the same cell phone bill with the bombing suspect.&quot; Keep an eye out for that link. If the news drops that at any point, then , These are the same people for sure)
The whole news report is coming from the neighbor who knew they were taken into custody so , I wonder who the woman was. ?</p>

<p>Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev, both 19 and of New Bedford, were charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice by plotting to dispose of a laptop computer and a backpack containing fireworks belonging to bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the US attorney’s office said in a statement.</p>

<p>Robel Phillipos, 19, of Cambridge was charged with making false statements to law enforcement officials in a terrorism investigation, prosecutors said. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if those were the same three(which there is no proof of from your source as their names aren&#39;t provided, but regardless we can assume they are the same) then wouldn&#39;t they certainly have had more than enough time to go to his dorm room(one of them lived with him, the others in the same dormitory) and get those things given the fact that they were taken in over 24 hours after the photos were released?

<p>None of the other instances I mentioned were started with &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure&quot; or anything like that. &quot;I remember&quot; is not vague. I was talking about news that was widely available online since April 19th (re: the questioning of the three students). We&#39;re in a sub where users have been staring at photos of naked guys in handcuffs and trying to listen to faint dialog in a cell phone video of a shootout. You think no one here would take two seconds to search what I&#39;m talking about if they thought it was bullshit?</p>

<p>Do you guys think this is why they combed that landfill? Because in the NBC report I just read one of them told police he threw the stuff in a dumpster. That makes me wonder then, how did officials originally know to ask them about this stuff??? Where did it come from? I don&#39;t understand why these kids would talk unless police already had leverage on them. They maybe wouldn&#39;t have searched the landfill without a tip off. I&#39;m making the assumption that the landfill search was because these guys said something, and not because they searched and then found stuff.</p>
