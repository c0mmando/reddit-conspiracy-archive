    <div class="md"><p>Why do they think they do it, or why do we think they do it?</p>

<p>I imagine they think the ends justify the means, and that might is right.. the greater good and all that.   If people don&#39;t want war, and they think it&#39;s necessary or just - then you have to &#39;persuade&#39; them to support something they&#39;d never do..  Even though it comes from a Nazi, this quote can&#39;t be copypasted enough.</p>

<p>Göring: Why, of course, the people don&#39;t want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don&#39;t want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.  </p>

<p>Gilbert: There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.  </p>

<p>Göring: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It frightens the people. The people demand of the government protection from &quot;terrorists&quot; (aka  boogieman). The more frightened the people are, the more willing they are to trade their freedoms for protection. The government is then able to more effectively control the people. Controlling the people means making sure they never rebel against injustice and the systemic thievery by the wealthy of the poor. The Rich (aka TPTB, illuminati, azkenazi jews, Zionists, Rothschilds etc) aim to arrogate all resources to themselves. The TPTB control the government and manipulate the government to do these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I personally don&#39;t buy into it, it&#39;s simple really...with 9/11 you have a faux war on terror in the middle east to try and possibly overthrow a govt, gain influence on major oil owners/over throw them and of course, stimulate the economy (as war often does).  With Boston you have have to remember CISPA was gaining ground so with the internet providing wild speculation and misinformation about the bombing while more importantly showing the bombers learned everything from the internet (support for CISPA and the like)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Global dominance? What else. Allow me to explain.</p>

<p>AFGHANISTAN: Control the world trade of heroine, pre 9/11 they provided 10% of the worlds supply, now it&#39;s 90%. Yeah, wonder who&#39;s behind that, perhaps the US government that we KNOW has the technology to track and stop drug traffickers and who has also been caught running drugs in the past ( Iran Contra Scandal ).</p>

<p>IRAQ AND SAUDI ARABIA: They wanted to get oil off of the dollar standard and just start selling it for gold and such but the US government doesn&#39;t want that so they use their installed dictator, Saddam Hussein, Who was also trained by the CIA, as an excuse to invade the country by claiming he has more WMDs ( which they proved they didn&#39;t ) and linking him to terrorist organizations in Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>It may sound a little complex but at the end of the day it&#39;s really quite simple, the US government did it for their own world advantage.</p>

<p>Now here&#39;s another reason how 9/11 being an inside job is even more beneficial to them. They knew at that time that a majority of people didn&#39;t believe in conspiracy theories as in the past they&#39;ve been linked to such ridiculously ridiculed things ( Like does nobody think it&#39;s coincidence the first hugely reported people to report being abducted by aliens was a white woman and a black man? Think of the implications of that in the racist mind at that time period. ) so even if people do figure it out it won&#39;t matter because a majority of the people won&#39;t believe them. They also know that the conspiracy theorists will take major criticism and can be further criticized by doing things like linking them to other completely bogus theories like we never landed on the moon, which we most certainly did it&#39;s easily proven.</p>

<p>People who actually lost loved ones and those who knew them etc. would just be extremely offended because of emotional heartstrings and what not. How many people say &quot;Well why would the government attack its&#39; own people, the government LOVES the people right?&quot;. It&#39;s ludicrous, because basically every government in the history of all time has killed its&#39;  own people.</p>

<p>I mean seriously we know the government has conducted secret testing on both our citizens, their employees, and peoples of other nations. We know they&#39;ve been involved in federal crimes and cover them up ( MLK, JFK, Malcolm X, WACO, etc. ). Clearly the government doesn&#39;t care about the people, if they did we would all have free power.</p>

<p>Seriously, if the government truly cared about the people they would take care of our basic needs. They would ensure proper water supply systems with integrated home rain water collection and other rain water collection systems that feed into the system. They would provide solar power to every town to be used in the most efficient manner possible, basically on every structure that it will get adequate light on.</p>

<p>They would engineer a new farming strategy that has more sustainable farming integrating into counties in a manner that provides a local variety of foods. Like every town should have an egg hatchery that sends out fresh eggs to the stores every morning. You should as a citizen be able to visit that farm and see it yourself.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what a transparent and progressive society is like, because it&#39;s run in the interest of the people, not corporations.</p>

<p>But this isn&#39;t a progressive society, and another thing the government gains from 9/11 is the patriot act, the ability to warrantlessly wiretap any citizen it wants at any time. It basically rips you 4th amendment to shreds. They then gained the TSA and the DHS and other increased police, military, and security budgets and measures.</p>

<p>The government benefited in so many ways it&#39;s absurd, it truly was a terrible event, I tell you what.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As evidence and further backing of your claims, there&#39;s a NY times article from 2001 - the Taliban put a ban on opium production in Afghanistan early that year and opium production went through the floor. There&#39;s a later publication showing this, then showing opium production skyrocketing post-9/11. </p>

<p>Looking at governments that DO keep the citizens in mind, the Scandinavian countries are prime examples. Finland powers so much of their citizens by incinerating garbage that they are starting to import garbage from other countries. 80% of Iceland&#39;s power is geothermal. Iceland also charges no tuition for college - the only cost of education at the university of Iceland is an annual registration fee equivalent to approximately 500USD. I&#39;m sure the rest of the Scandinavians have similar costs of education, and health care is equally affordable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting that you&#39;d assume 9/11 and Boston are both extensions of the same thing. That&#39;s the most absurd part I think. </p>

<p>Individually, I guess, you could look at any event and decide it may not be what it (officially) seems - 9/11 is the most obvious as it served as the cornerstone of so many things from the various wars to the creation of the DHS. But to assume that all these events are the result of a grand conspiracy and executed by the same people just seems to be baselessly reactionary.</p>

<p>When you see Alex Jones crying False Flag on Boston before the smoke had even cleared it&#39;s obvious that he&#39;s forming his opinion first, from a paranoid position of assumption, and then collecting &quot;evidence&quot; to support it afterward.</p>

<p>Be skeptical of individual events if you wish, but immediately lumping all these horrible things into a single timeline of conspiracy is ideological not observational.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As evidence and further backing of your claims, there&#39;s a NY times article from 2001 - the Taliban put a ban on opium production in Afghanistan early that year and opium production went through the floor. There&#39;s a later publication showing this, then showing opium production skyrocketing post-9/11. </p>

<p>Looking at governments that DO keep the citizens in mind, the Scandinavian countries are prime examples. Finland powers so much of their citizens by incinerating garbage that they are starting to import garbage from other countries. 80% of Iceland&#39;s power is geothermal. Iceland also charges no tuition for college - the only cost of education at the university of Iceland is an annual registration fee equivalent to approximately 500USD. I&#39;m sure the rest of the Scandinavians have similar costs of education, and health care is equally affordable. </p>
