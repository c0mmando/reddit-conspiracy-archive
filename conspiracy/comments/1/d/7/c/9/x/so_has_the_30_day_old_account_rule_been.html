        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This appears to be the case.</p>

<p>Just curious for an official mod response on this. It seemed a pretty polarizing rule change, clearly, and it&#39;s not one I entirely agree with as I tend to make new accounts a lot and know others who do the same. Of course, it&#39;s not my place to make the rules, I am simply voicing my opinion on the matter in a way I hope is acceptable.</p>

<p>edit: I have work in the morning so I&#39;m going to bed. Hopefully the small comment graveyard and the few screenshots I collected are enough indicator that the rule has been implemented. I hope to see a mod response soon, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they chose not to back down from the idea and I don&#39;t blame them for trying to cut down on trolls even if I don&#39;t 100% agree with their methods.</p>

<p>Edit2: Okay I said I was going to bed, but now all comments in this thread appear to have been restored. Mod response, please? I promise I&#39;m not trying to raise a new fuss, I just want an official response.</p>

<p>edit3: I am really, seriously going to bed now. If anyone wishes to and is able to grab more screen shots of comments from young accounts, feel free, though I realize those aren&#39;t exactly infallible evidence. Hope to see some sort of official notice about what the mods have decided to do by the time I am online tomorrow.</p>

Maybe it&#39;s stopped happening, I don&#39;t know.

<p>Edit: Home and on a computer again. I just counted the number of visible comments in this thread. At the time of this edit, there are 59, and the post says there are 70 comments. Deleted comments that had no replies do not show up as [deleted]. Also entire comment chains that have been deleted won&#39;t show up.  So that would be 11 that are not showing up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with some of the posters here that will genuinely want to post when a situations arises and they can&#39;t but people have been taking the piss here recently. As its been said by the long time users, no one wants any comment that offers a different point of view to be removed. What we want removed is those people that don&#39;t discuss, don&#39;t debate and use personal attacks to undermine the discussion. The fact is that the number of those type of accounts increased dramatically over the course of a week and the mods felt that the number of those comments were detriment to the sub (which it was).</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry for the genuine people who want to offer their position even if I don&#39;t agree with it but I feel like the rule is necessary to maintain the integrity of the discussions. Its not censorship because views aren&#39;t being deleted, its comments that offer nothing other than inflammatory, anger filled trolling that promotes others to do it and drags everyone else into fighting. Other subs have got rules, it was already in the rules and before the 30 day account rule was applied the mods were already dealing with trolls and doing the exact same thing they have always been doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is the stupid posting. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think chemtrails hold the same validity as say...the CIA officer the Pakistanis arrested for killing ISI agents in broad daylight who was snuck out of there...and then in conjunction with how ISI allowed bin Laden to live, you can see there might be actual enemies in the state agency. 
That&#39;s a legit conspiracy. Reptillians are not. </p>

<p>People who are unhinged and post 4am Art Bell shit are trolling. The mods let that sub be dominated by fantasy. </p>

<p>There are real conspiracies. If anything, this sub should be for actual Illuminati discussion. </p>
