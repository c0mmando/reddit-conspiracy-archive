       Why don't you welcome argumentative people?
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone disagrees, embrace this as a chance to strengthen your argument skills? For years I have always taken opposing sides in conversations, just so that I can develop better debating, reasoning and oratory skills. (well in this case, it would be written, but you get my point.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe something, you should be able to argue in favour of it. Back it up using evidence.

       Stop the name calling, grow up and learn to argue.

       That's the perfect suggestion for most of the trolls that infest this sub. The same trolls come here again and again and again using every logical fallacy in the book and, in spite of being called out on it, they just keep coming with the same distraction tactics and disinformation. One gets tired of trying to have reasonable discussions with such people.

       Edit: I tried for years to engage them politely but nowadays I mostly ignore or call them out, downvote and move on.

       I don't mind counter-arguments, but when the opposition to "truthers" stereotypes and mocks r/conspiracy for the "idiotic" views it presents it makes me angry. Especially when posters get down voted for their arguments. Just because an opinion seems ridiculous there is no reason to downvote it. If anything upvote it if your point is to show how "ridiculous" this comment it to everyone.

       I love counter arguments.  They're the life blood of actual learning.  This subreddit has thus far disappointed me, not because I'm sitting around and unable to dismiss conspiracies so I attack the theorists, but because if I state I don't believe in a popular theory, I am actually attacked for it.  I'm not a big follower of conspiracy theories, but I am open to new ideas.  One way not to convert me to your ideas is to attack me, rather than provide how you came to disagree with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, if conspiracy theorists want to not be attacked by those they disagree with, can we agree it is wholly reasonable for them to not attack those they disagree with?  A discussion, or an argument, has two sides.  As a skeptic, I'd like to be able to post and know that my comment will be judged by the arguments and content I present, rather than whether or not I'm agreeing with a popular theory.
       <br/>
       PS: Shill accusation is a stupid thing that shouldn't exist.  Whether they exist or not is completely irrelevant, because if we would judge comments and posts by how they provide evidence for their case, they'd simply be downvoted into oblivion every time they claimed something without evidence.

       Yes there are other annoying tactics as well.  Usually fallacious arguments.  If people can't win an argument they bring up "Crisis actors" as if everyone here believes in that.  They chide everyone for believing something so heinous.  However, I've never seen a legit post on here making that argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you say "I don't think that's even true, that's a strawman" they tell you to learn how to argue.

       Exactly. Crisis actors. Who really gives a shit about them? I don't buy it first, and second, it would be like a dollar waiting on a dime. They wouldn't be in charge, nor would they be a credible accusation. They would not be the lowest hanging fruit by any means. I refuse to speculate on other people's pain. I know the government oversteps bounds and takes other people with it.

       i wish more people had this perspective. too many people will just report to name calling or just calling someone shills or trolls when really they just dont have the skills to argue a point in a meaningful way without calling someone out.
      </p>
      <p>
       to be fair in real life this happens as well. i consider every conversation an arguement of some sort. my girlfriend hates this. haha.  i have a friend who i have debated with for years and still it will come to a point in our conversations where he will resort to - you said something stupid once when you were 15 and i still remember it, im going to attack with that instead of arguing -
      </p>
      <p>
       usually thats when our arguements end. i believe in all arguements, that when someone name calls or resorts to devaluing your own  person, then you already have won the arguement

       I agree. I think that if there are facts that contradict the theory, there is needs to be a new, better theory. This is the scientific method as I'm sure you are aware.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also would like to see more expertise. We've got 130k people subbed. There HAS to be people here that are experts in something relevant to what we talk about. What we need is a set of official goto people.
      </p>
      <p>
       A prime example is all of the photos looking at blast damage. I hope we can all come to agreement that someone drawing with MS paint should not be considered reliable or accurate. If we had a person who was actually an expert in this they could be like hey..  something doesn't quite look right here. Or this looks more likely to me. Or something to that effect.

       Exactly, and if it does, then it strengthens your conviction in the idea. This subreddit is meant to be about approaching things with an open mind, thorough analysis.

       Unfortunately, what it seems to be is instantly dismissing the 'official story' without actually providing evidence the contrary. I am in favour of discussing alternative views, but I don't know why 4chan is accepted as fact, and not MSM. Shouldn't it be that nothing is accepted as fact at first?

        handful of giant corporations

       own the majority of global mainstream media, this fact is indisputable.  Those corporations often have a direct conflict of interest about the news they are reporting on.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        MSNBC
       </strong>
       - Owned by General Electric, makers of military hardware, GiJoe, Barbie and consumer appliances.
      </p>

       <strong>
        CBS

      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Fox
       </strong>
       - Owned by Murdoch, also owns Dow Jones and was on the board of directors at Phillip Morris. Currently facing corruption charges. Went to court in the US and won the right to lie in the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Disney/ABC
       </strong>
       - Produced America's WW2 Military Propaganda, Disney also personally testified to the FBI against alleged hollywood communists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you trust "Westinghouse News"? How about "General Electric 24/7"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to that the
       <em>

       that the US government has been

       There's a few things here -
      </p>
      <p>
       NBC was owned by GE (is no longer), but they have nothing to do with Mattel or Hasbro (makers of Barbie and GI Joe)...
      </p>
      <p>
       CBS hasn't been owned by Westinghouse since 2000. It's now independently owned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fox is owned by Murdoch, and he does also own Dow Jones. But his ability to control the narrative of FNC is somewhat limited - evidenced by his personal support of gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're connecting ABC's activities with things that the Disney corporation did 60+ years ago, and personal actions of it's long-dead founder?
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes the media organisations obviously have large corporate interests, but if you've ever worked in the media you'll understand how unlikely and impractical it is that the content of news can be influenced on a day-to-day article-by-article basis by corporate owners. They exercise their influence in their hiring mainly (see Ailes as head of Fox News) but that is broad strokes.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the most part they are driven entirely by ratings and advertising revenue which in turn requires that they report engaging news in a timely and exciting fashion. When there is broad consensus between news organisations it seems fairly safe to assume they are reporting honestly (with a trade off for timing etc - as seen by absurd inaccuracies reported in breaking new situations when information is confused and unclear).
      </p>
      <p>
       To simply write off everything that comes from a mainstream source is then, surely, to suggest that literally thousands of journalists are somehow in on something and all conspiring together to report the same misinformation, right? That seems implausible on balance, and absurd if you actually know any journalists, or work even remotely close to the industry.

       It's obvious that the officials frequently don't accurately communicate everything they know, and even lie or mislead at times, but I tend to think you do yourself and injustice by immediately declaring anything from an official source to be disinformation or spin.

       My point is that in the last two weeks, all these images were coming into this subreddit from 4chan, and being pretty much accepted:

       The comments criticise the posts, rightly so, because that should be the starting point. If the theory stands up to criticism, it is worth holding on to. But the titles '4chan solves the Boston Bombings', c'mon. That is just juvenile.

       Frankly, my fear is not being killed in a bombing, it is looking concerned in a still photograph near a bombing, because the internet might label me a terrorist.

       That is a valid concern, certainly vigilantism is a horrid business. I'm afraid it is what happens when citizens no longer trust in the criminal justice system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such distrust is not unfounded, as I am sure you are aware. The governmental-military-financial system is
       <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/everything-is-rigged-the-biggest-financial-scandal-yet-20130425">
        corrupt at the highest levels
       </a>
       . Millions are imprisoned for non-violent crimes, while vast criminal enterprises are deemed too big to fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       In such a situation, where "the people" are receiving taxation without representation, while the rich wage class war against the poor, is it so surprising that so many doubt the official line?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt that the bombs exploded, I have no doubt that people were hurt, I have no doubt that this is a tragedy. Which is exactly why it would be so upsetting if the tragedy were being manipulated for political gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, even if everything went down exactly as the MSM says it did, whichever way they finally decide upon, there are some really important questions that need to be answered here. If the suspects really were

       Maybe I missed something but did any of the 'internet investigators' and their photo speculations lead to any arrests? More importantly, I don't see how realistic it is to worry about being labeled a terrorist by internet sleuths, surely there are far more important things to be concerned with.

       The identification in such an open medium and the subsequent labelling as a suspect is significant enough, certainly enough for people to track down the suspects and make life miserable for them, never mind the lack of actual evidence.

       I am saying that this subreddit, or many of the subscribers, are so quick to throw out any kind of 'official' story, that they are implicating numerous others who are labelled as suspects.

       I think a lot of times it isn't argument so much as putting up with being insulted or abused. Then of course we have the troll theory, where people pose as conspiracy theorists and respond poorly when their pet theories are challenged, thereby giving a bad image to the subreddit overall.

      <p>
       As a tangent, these are two distinct things.  All too often people label straight insults as an ad hominem attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Insult - "You're a douche because you're wrong."
      </p>
      <p>
       Ad Hominem - "You're wrong because you're a douche."
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because someone calls you a name doesn't mean it's an ad hominem.  There needs to be the backwards reasoning that because of whatever attack, you're therefore wrong.  If you logically refute someone's claim, then call them an idiot that's just adding an insult on the end of your argument which while rude, isn't an ad hominem.

       Sure, happy to discuss and debate with anyone who enters into a debate ingenuously. Thing is, shills enter into an argument disingenuously, they are essentially trolling.

       I don't like the labelling of shills and trolls, but what you are saying about parroting their opinion happens on both sides. There are those that believe in certain conspiracies which are very close minded, and refuse to enter into an open discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I provide counter arguments for beliefs I don't hold, or arguments to which I don't have a vested interest, just for the hell of it. I don't believe it to be trolling. I think it is good to test theories. I don't blindly refuse to accept other positions, I don't name call, but some would still call me a shill or troll.

       Reddit is the biggest social news site on the net,  it drives global news cycles, it is big business.  Barrack Obama did an AMA for fucks sake.  Do you really think the PUSA would show up anywhere without the SS and PR?
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that there are closed minded people on all sides, but there is an important distinction between being closed minded, and being paid to have an opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone is paid to say the sky is red, it doesn't matter how much proof you show them, or how eloquently you raise your points.  They will keep saying the sky is red, and show you industry statistics to prove it. It won't win you over, but they don't care, because you aren't the target audience. Its all the people who read without commenting who are the target audience. All those people come past and see a debate going on, so naturally the truth must be somewhere in the middle.  Suddenly you have thousands of people doubting whether the sky is blue, and a general consensus forming that its probably purple.

       Crazy blue skiers, nuttier than a bag of fruitcake. Can you believe they actually think they know better than the experts?

       If asked politely with a real and fair discussion in mind, then they should not. If asked  in a demeaning or condescending manner, then they should. In all my years in this sub, the second has seemed to be most often the case. And no, I'm not going to try to provide evidence for that belief.

       I'm sorry, but this a hopelessly naive and ignorant comment. Is this your first time in r/conspiracy? There has always been plenty of argumentative discourse in this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/conspiracy is like an ecosystem - a certain balance develops between "conspiracists" and "skeptics". When there is a sudden influx of people who are intent on disruption, it throws everything into confusion. The newcomers (who are largely clueless about this subreddit) are not here to discuss, or exchange ideas (a two way process).

       I have a couple of friends who are into conspiracies, but when I try to debate shit with them logically they just get frustrated and stop talking to me. They like to preach "THE TRUTH" but it seems to me like they hand-picked their own truth. Pretty much like religious people in that regard. I also find people who are both into conspiracy theories AND are religious to represent a fantastic irony.  (and at the same time, it makes sense. It's marvellous, really.)
