<p>Prove that there has ever been a hurricance, before HAARP was created, which has tons of solid evidence of being the US Government&#39;s worldwide hurricane generator (and earthquakes too, which happened in Superman 1, surprise surprise). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy. Hell. This tops the cake right here. Fine. Here is ONE wikipedia page from a &#39;historical&#39; hurricane. 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Hurricane_of_1938">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Hurricane_of_1938</a></p>

<p>Mind you, this is ONLY one page for ONE hurricane. Are you proposing that the Government wrote hundreds and hundreds of wikipedia pages detailing each and every hurricane, along with doctoring devastation photos for each? And we haven&#39;t even gotten past wikipedia, we could start talking about the countless <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=1938+New+England+hurricane&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=1938+New+England+hurricane&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.57j60.250j0&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">articles</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=1938+New+England+hurricane&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=eBp6UaHDGdKqqQHvuoBA&amp;amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&amp;amp;biw=1254&amp;amp;bih=702">images</a> for this ONE huricane. But wait! There is more! Let&#39;s not forget about the countless <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=1938+New+England+hurricane&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;tbm=vid&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=vRp6UaqOAcn8rAGUzoCQAw&amp;amp;ved=0CA0Q_AUoAA&amp;amp;biw=1254&amp;amp;bih=702">video depictions</a> of this one hurricane.</p>

<p>Now, comb through all this material, multiply it by several hundred and imagine the amount of work it would be to &#39;doctor&#39; up these fabricated hurricanes of the past. This would be thousands upon thousands of man hours to fabricate all of this. </p>

<p>Think with your brain man, seriously. It&#39;s ok to question things you don&#39;t understand. You just need to use some common sense and think things through before you make a decision in your mind on your chosen fabricated theory. </p>

<p>I did already. They made it up much more recently, and put it in all of our history books. DUH.</p>

<p>Again, if you know how to <em>read</em>, it&#39;s made up. Added to our history textbooks way after hurricanes were invented with HAARP.  You&#39;re starting to sound like you think even last year&#39;s hurricanes weren&#39;t caused with HAARP. Are you a shill, bro?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explain the difference between this photograph of Whale Rock lighthouse, RI, compared to this more modern photo. </p>

<p>There could be a million different explanations. Are you seriously just comparing photos with no information and jumping straight to the conclusion of &quot;hurricane&quot;? Sorry but here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> we use critical thought and proper investigative techniques.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Gee, I don&#39;t know, only 9/11, JFK, RFK, Bilderberg, the Titanic, Sandy Hook, Abraham Lincoln, the 1985 Blue Jays, flouride, vaccines, juice boxes to make children be gay, the Illuminati flashing all their clues in Batman and Superman movies and Beyonce concerts, not to mention the Olympic opening ceremony, oh and that Dead Kennedys album with Freemasons on the cover (way to blow your cover, Jello Biafra, <em>who I might add</em> disagrees with our 9/11 Truth Movement!!!)... Need I go on or are you finished being an NWO-hypnotized stupid person??</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To get oil and to take away our guns, smart guy. Pay attention!</p>

<p>It is the same reason the government caused millions, if not billions of dollars in damages, and kill large numbers of people, on 9/11</p>

<p>If it&#39;s the illuminati, what the fuck drugs are you on? </p>

<p>I smoke a lot of weed but if you have any education like I do you know it&#39;s not addictive and also cures cancer, so if you&#39;re so smart, how come I&#39;m going to live longer than you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I had a weather machine, I&#39;d not make hurricanes, because they are really terrible for business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Excuse me, as I pointed out in my original post, the whole point is they&#39;re terrible for business, you send hurricanes to where the business you want to fail exists. Like, as i already fucking said, in &quot;Superman 3&quot; where the hurricane laser from the satellite causes all of the coffee in Colombia to be wiped out, so the price of coffee has to go up, setting the stage for there being a giant computer in a cave, that can destroy Superman, when they trick him into going inside the cave. Don&#39;t be so dense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, can you give more specifics about your &#39;conspiracy&#39;? The post text thing has been removed,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I think the moderators in here are probably disinfo agents, they are known to delete posts, and the reason could be that I uncovered a conspiracy that&#39;s actually true (like how Julian Assange has a target on his back, while no one bothers Alex Jones... I might be the Julian Assange equivalent of r/conspiracy)... Anyway I can still see my original post for some reason, so here it is:</p>

<p>For some reason my grandpa kept all his old high school textbooks, and looking through them, I realized.... Not one mention of hurricanes anywhere! I showed him and he told me something amazing: He said he never heard of hurricanes in the news, EVER, until only the last couple of decades, seeing them on TV. They were never in the news before. And then suddenly there are all these big &quot;historical&quot; hurricanes he could read about, that supposedly happened over the last centuries. These stories were all planted and they&#39;re everywhere now.</p>

<p>What&#39;s worse is that they&#39;re so smug about this, they even show us how they do it, it&#39;s a pivotal scene in the movie &quot;Superman III&quot; where a satellite fires an energy beam into a cloud, creating a hurricane that wipes out all the coffee in Colombia, to drive the price up or something, anyway it doesn&#39;t matter, I&#39;m just saying Batman movies aren&#39;t the only DC Comics movies where the NWO&#39;s plans are &quot;unknowingly&quot; rubbed in our faces.</p>

<p>I wonder what we&#39;re going to learn in &quot;Man of Steel&quot; this summer...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, you did not provide sufficient evidence (that is, to prove beyond reasonable doubt) of anything. I do not find it self evident, unlike you, so if you could actually attempt to argue your position, that would help.</p>

<p>Second, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070102010929/http://www.workingwaterfront.com/review.asp?storyID=20060436">citaiton 1</a>, <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/galleries/2005/0724/hurricane1938?pg=4">citation 2</a></p>

<p>Third, my grandfather is not a CIA plant, as the American Central Intelligence Agency was founded Sep.18, 1947. My grandfather was born in 1925, before a centralized intelligence agency existed in the United States. In addition, please refrain from personal attacks on my grandfather, as per your rule 10.</p>

<p>Fourth, 13.3% (40.8 million people), according to the US Census Bureau, of the US population are over 65, meaning born in 1947. This is old enough to have memories of 1951. </p>

<p>Fifth, no, I&#39;m not a shill, but I&#39;d like to get me some free government money for posting on reddit. I could use the cash, and it&#39;d probably be a steady income. Oh, also, don&#39;t call me bro. If you do... It won&#39;t be pretty. </p>

<p>Sixth, the lighthouse is near population centers, and if it was demolished, there would be a record, say, of an explosion. Or markings, explosive residue, or perhaps a large amount of rubble nearby, as opposed to almost the entire lighthouse not being there.</p>

<p>Seventh, the records are held either by the Crown, or the Spanish government. Neither of which, you might notice, are the United States Government.</p>

<p>Eighth, how are these unspecified, unbacked, unverifiable claims evidence? And how is calling me a hypnotized stooge, or whatever the specific language you used was, not a personal attack? I detest this insult, sir.</p>

<p>Ninth, How do hurricanes, which routinely cause millions of dollars in damages to the oil industry from work stoppages, and the firearm industry, by disrupting the sale of such commodities. The disruption of governmental control caused by hurricanes is also detrimental to the (alleged) confiscation of firearms. </p>

<p>Tenth, some bearded fucker in pakistan ordered 9/11, not anyone in the US.</p>

<p>Eleventh, I&#39;d like to see the research and sources you have for your claims on Marijuana.
I&#39;ve got some sources of my own here, on the subject:
A 35-year cohort study published August 2012 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and funded partly by NIDA and other NIH institutes reported an <strong>association between long-term cannabis use and neuropsychological decline, even after controlling for education.</strong> It was found that the persistent, dependent use of marijuana before age 18 was associated with lasting harm to a person&#39;s intelligence, attention and memory, and were suggestive of neurological harm from cannabis. Quitting cannabis did not appear to reverse the loss.
A July 2012 article in Brain reported <strong>neural-connectivity impairment</strong> in some brain regions following prolonged heavy cannabis use initiated in adolescence or young adulthood.
Cannabis can also cause lung damage (including cancers) similarly to unfiltered cigarettes.</p>

<p>Non sequitur: Were you stoned when you wrote this? It seems like you were.</p>

<p>Twelfth, are you really using movies as your basis for scientific information?! This is highly irregular, especially as there is no documented method of causing hurricanes with anything other than a large quantity of hot water, several  billion gallons worth, probably. </p>

<p>Thirteenth, calm the fuck down. There&#39;s no need to get excited, I&#39;m just trying to be rational. But seriously, don&#39;t use Superman III as a basis for your scientific knowledge. Read up on it. </p>

<p>Fourteenth, where did your grandfather live? If it wasn&#39;t the East Coast, his textbooks probably didn&#39;t cover hurricanes. Mine sure as hell don&#39;t. In addition, hurricanes were not reported in other parts of the country than the areas that they affected directly. </p>

<p>Fifteenth, I haven&#39;t given up, I&#39;m not done yet, and you underestimate my determination. </p>

<p>Sixteenth, I did not mean that as a personal attack. </p>

<p>Have fun, you delusional ass!</p>

<p>On another note: I am not an employee of the Federal Government of the United States of America. I am not posting this under duress, or for profit. I am stating my knowledge of the facts, and my opinions of you and conspiracy theorists in general, as I see fit. In addition, I find your references to me as a &#39;shill&#39;, which I understand means a person believed to work for the government to espouse certain beliefs, highly offensive, and in violation of the very rule that you request me not to violate, concerning personal attacks. I may have made my attacks in a more straightforward manner, using foul language, et cetera, but you use the lingua franca of this subreddit. I used English. </p>

<p>And in reference to your stating that I need constant reminding not to violate &#39;rule 10&#39;, it is not that I forget, it is that I am consciously violating that rule. </p>

<p>Have a nice day, and do not reply.</p>

<p>Part of your job is to say your job isn&#39;t your job.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am stating my knowledge of the facts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You think you are but these are not true facts. As I&#39;ve already pointed out, they are false stories implanted in school textbooks an faked &quot;old newspapers&quot; in libraries and on Wikipedia. Haven&#39;t you read 1984? It happens all the time in 1984. It&#39;s happening now with the history of hurricanes. They are an invention of HAARP. Fact. Full stop.</p>

<p>Believe me, I am not happy to hurt your feelings, and this is for your own good, and you&#39;ll be happier once you&#39;re awake like I was awakened by my grandfather and his preserved textbooks. It was like a moment straight out of 1984. I&#39;m trying to help you, my fellow American.</p>
