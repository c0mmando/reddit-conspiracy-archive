       Prove that there has ever been a hurricance, before HAARP was created, which has tons of solid evidence of being the US Government's worldwide hurricane generator (and earthquakes too, which happened in Superman 1, surprise surprise).

       Holy. Hell. This tops the cake right here. Fine. Here is ONE wikipedia page from a 'historical' hurricane.

       Mind you, this is ONLY one page for ONE hurricane. Are you proposing that the Government wrote hundreds and hundreds of wikipedia pages detailing each and every hurricane, along with doctoring devastation photos for each? And we haven't even gotten past wikipedia, we could start talking about the countless

       Now, comb through all this material, multiply it by several hundred and imagine the amount of work it would be to 'doctor' up these fabricated hurricanes of the past. This would be thousands upon thousands of man hours to fabricate all of this.

      <p>
       Think with your brain man, seriously. It's ok to question things you don't understand. You just need to use some common sense and think things through before you make a decision in your mind on your chosen fabricated theory.

       Way to turn the whole thing around on me. YOU never DISPROVED what I posted. Therefore, it is you who is not the winner. I didn't start a debate. I started the Truth. And this is the thanks I get? I hope you can look yourself in the expensive mirror your NWO shill money bought you. You will never know what it's like to sing Rage Against The Machine songs at karaoke and mean it, and own it. Have a nice life, troll. I tried to warn you about HAARP. You probably work for HAARP.

       Don't you get it? HAARP controls the weather NOW. It didn't before. Historical hurricanes are all a hoax, so we won't question them NOW. Get your head out of the sand. Get awake like me. I've already shown how the Illuminati admits everything in a superhero movie. Prove me wrong. You can't.

       Sorry but the burden of proof is on the one who makes the allegation. That's you, saying the Galveston Hurricane, which clearly happened long before HAARP was invented, was real, when all we have as "evidence" is a Wikipedia page. News flash, internet boy, I can make a Wikipedia page right now about a "hurricane" that happened between your man boobs. I wouldn't do that because I come to r/conspiracy because I believe in TRUTH and JUSTICE. I hope the Bilderberg Society paid you a lot to try to fight me and lose.

       Please, enlighten me as to how the government (or whoever) faked the 1938 new england hurricane. Explain how upwards of 680 people died, how 57,000 homes were damaged, how my grandfather, who was 13 and living on Long Island (Rockville Center) at the time, remembers a massive hurricane. Explain the damage to trees and homes that lasted until 1951. Explain the (adjusted for inflation) $4.7 billion in property damage. The water damage in almost every coastal city in New England. The destroyed Long Island Rail Road tracks near Napeague, where the storm surge turned Montauk into an island. Explain the difference between

       more modern photo. Please, if you can, explain the 1631 atlantic hurricane that wiped out a Spanish treasure fleet. Or the 1661 St Christopher hurricane that flattened all the buildings on the island of Nevis. I want detailed descriptions, more than just 'the government faked it'
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also like to point out the extreme coordination you have alleged of the US Government. Since when has it been this organized and capable. And where is the benefit, and to whom? Hurricanes routinely cause millions, if not billions of dollars in damages, and kill large numbers of people. Why should the boogeyman you blame be doing this? If it is the government, there is no reason. If it's the illuminati, what the fuck drugs are you on? If I had a weather machine, I'd not make hurricanes, because they are really terrible for business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, can you give more specifics about your 'conspiracy'? The post text thing has been removed, which means I can't try to disprove you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, though, who benefits from hurricanes? And how the fucking hell did you come up with this crap? Are you high or just nuts? Or bored, and being an asshat?

       Excuse me, as I pointed out in my original post, the whole point is they're terrible for business, you send hurricanes to where the business you want to fail exists. Like, as i already fucking said, in "Superman 3" where the hurricane laser from the satellite causes all of the coffee in Colombia to be wiped out, so the price of coffee has to go up, setting the stage for there being a giant computer in a cave, that can destroy Superman, when they trick him into going inside the cave. Don't be so dense.

      <p>
       Yeah, I think the moderators in here are probably disinfo agents, they are known to delete posts, and the reason could be that I uncovered a conspiracy that's actually true (like how Julian Assange has a target on his back, while no one bothers Alex Jones... I might be the Julian Assange equivalent of r/conspiracy)... Anyway I can still see my original post for some reason, so here it is:
      </p>
      <p>
       For some reason my grandpa kept all his old high school textbooks, and looking through them, I realized.... Not one mention of hurricanes anywhere! I showed him and he told me something amazing: He said he never heard of hurricanes in the news, EVER, until only the last couple of decades, seeing them on TV. They were never in the news before. And then suddenly there are all these big "historical" hurricanes he could read about, that supposedly happened over the last centuries. These stories were all planted and they're everywhere now.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's worse is that they're so smug about this, they even show us how they do it, it's a pivotal scene in the movie "Superman III" where a satellite fires an energy beam into a cloud, creating a hurricane that wipes out all the coffee in Colombia, to drive the price up or something, anyway it doesn't matter, I'm just saying Batman movies aren't the only DC Comics movies where the NWO's plans are "unknowingly" rubbed in our faces.

       Firstly, you did not provide sufficient evidence (that is, to prove beyond reasonable doubt) of anything. I do not find it self evident, unlike you, so if you could actually attempt to argue your position, that would help.

       Third, my grandfather is not a CIA plant, as the American Central Intelligence Agency was founded Sep.18, 1947. My grandfather was born in 1925, before a centralized intelligence agency existed in the United States. In addition, please refrain from personal attacks on my grandfather, as per your rule 10.

       Sixth, the lighthouse is near population centers, and if it was demolished, there would be a record, say, of an explosion. Or markings, explosive residue, or perhaps a large amount of rubble nearby, as opposed to almost the entire lighthouse not being there.

       Ninth, How do hurricanes, which routinely cause millions of dollars in damages to the oil industry from work stoppages, and the firearm industry, by disrupting the sale of such commodities. The disruption of governmental control caused by hurricanes is also detrimental to the (alleged) confiscation of firearms.

      </p>
      <p>
       Eleventh, I'd like to see the research and sources you have for your claims on Marijuana.
I've got some sources of my own here, on the subject:
A 35-year cohort study published August 2012 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and funded partly by NIDA and other NIH institutes reported an
       <strong>
        association between long-term cannabis use and neuropsychological decline, even after controlling for education.
       </strong>
       It was found that the persistent, dependent use of marijuana before age 18 was associated with lasting harm to a person's intelligence, attention and memory, and were suggestive of neurological harm from cannabis. Quitting cannabis did not appear to reverse the loss.
A July 2012 article in Brain reported
       <strong>
        neural-connectivity impairment
       </strong>
       in some brain regions following prolonged heavy cannabis use initiated in adolescence or young adulthood.
Cannabis can also cause lung damage (including cancers) similarly to unfiltered cigarettes.

      <p>
       Non sequitur: Were you stoned when you wrote this? It seems like you were.
      </p>
      <p>
       Twelfth, are you really using movies as your basis for scientific information?! This is highly irregular, especially as there is no documented method of causing hurricanes with anything other than a large quantity of hot water, several  billion gallons worth, probably.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirteenth, calm the fuck down. There's no need to get excited, I'm just trying to be rational. But seriously, don't use Superman III as a basis for your scientific knowledge. Read up on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fourteenth, where did your grandfather live? If it wasn't the East Coast, his textbooks probably didn't cover hurricanes. Mine sure as hell don't. In addition, hurricanes were not reported in other parts of the country than the areas that they affected directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fifteenth, I haven't given up, I'm not done yet, and you underestimate my determination.

       Sixteenth, I did not mean that as a personal attack.

Also, FYI, the US Government is not out to get you. They can't even cover up Clinton, Kennedy, and most of the rest's inability to keep their pants zipped. 
In addition, the CIA were a bunch of incompetent LSD-addled idiots for quite a while. It was actually an occupational hazard while working there in the '50s, '60s, and '70s to have your coffe laced with it.

       You're the one making the allegations so it's up to you to provide proof. I am not responsible for gathering evidence to disprove your false claims. This is why I am the winner. I lost a lot of debates in high school last year by acting like you are acting now. If you want to have your eyes opened, I can recommend some very well-made citizen journalist documentaries on YouTube

       It's America, motherfucker. We have God-given, constitutionally protected rights to say what the fuck we want, to disagree with whatever the fuck we want. Don't be such a fucking whiny asshole, and deal with it. Also, turn off and unplug your computer, and go take a walk. See what sort of country you live in, and stop being so fucking paranoid about the government.

       The point of that was to get you to stop talking to me. Please stop, I don't care about your points. I know they are wrong. You do not. You may believe the opposite-that is what freedom of expression means-but do not think, for a second, that I believe you to be correct. I do not. I will not.

       On another note: I am not an employee of the Federal Government of the United States of America. I am not posting this under duress, or for profit. I am stating my knowledge of the facts, and my opinions of you and conspiracy theorists in general, as I see fit. In addition, I find your references to me as a 'shill', which I understand means a person believed to work for the government to espouse certain beliefs, highly offensive, and in violation of the very rule that you request me not to violate, concerning personal attacks. I may have made my attacks in a more straightforward manner, using foul language, et cetera, but you use the lingua franca of this subreddit. I used English.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in reference to your stating that I need constant reminding not to violate 'rule 10', it is not that I forget, it is that I am consciously violating that rule.

       You think you are but these are not true facts. As I've already pointed out, they are false stories implanted in school textbooks an faked "old newspapers" in libraries and on Wikipedia. Haven't you read 1984? It happens all the time in 1984. It's happening now with the history of hurricanes. They are an invention of HAARP. Fact. Full stop.

      <p>
       Believe me, I am not happy to hurt your feelings, and this is for your own good, and you'll be happier once you're awake like I was awakened by my grandfather and his preserved textbooks. It was like a moment straight out of 1984. I'm trying to help you, my fellow American.

       Way to turn the whole thing around on me. YOU never DISPROVED what I posted. Therefore, it is you who is not the winner. I didn't start a debate. I started the Truth. And this is the thanks I get? I hope you can look yourself in the expensive mirror your NWO shill money bought you. You will never know what it's like to sing Rage Against The Machine songs at karaoke and mean it, and own it. Have a nice life, troll. I tried to warn you about HAARP. You probably work for HAARP.

       I will not put that GMO chemical in my body. What else you got? Fluoride?  Telling me to poison myself is a personal attack (Rule 10)
