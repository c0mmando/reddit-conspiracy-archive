       We see it every day, whether it be family or friends, we definitely see the seesaw of reality in people's minds teetering between fact and fiction due to the flow of information and awakened minds talking some sense into them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Waking up was difficult for me, as I became highly paranoid at first and had irrational thoughts. This has all left me and a peaceful persona has enveloped my being because I found that I was not alone. It is communities like this that seem to be gaining more attention and ground with the average person which is why I enjoy discussing what is and what isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first, many people thought I was just crazy and that I was listening to Alex Jones too much and I was listening a little too much...but through rationality and logical approaches to my friends I have gained many listeners to how I think and why I think the way I do. That is power...and I am sure many of you have gained this in your ventures of being a theorist. To me it is power  because many people go throughout their day without anyone to talk to or listen to them about how their day was, or what they think about this and that.
       <em>
        With power comes great responsibility
       </em>
       and I think it is up to us to make sure and light the paths of those that are now seeing what we have seen for some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason for posting this was more of a thank you to the community for broadening how I assess what is and what isn't and to address how to better handle how to assess future information if another event arises that people don't fully trust
       <strong>
        the narrative of told by the MSM
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As a community, I think we should tone down buying into
       <strong>
        ANY
       </strong>
       evidence and posting it because of a hair trigger acceptance of something that someone else may not know. We must first address the
       <em>
        source and the accountability
       </em>
       of whatever it is we are posting, meaning, above all
       <strong>
        research
       </strong>
       into what you have seen a little more to be sure it's not someone spreading a massive amount of misinformation to discredit the accountability we are gaining. This "truther fever" is in our side for now but it can easily be blasted if we allow it to because we trusted something a little too much before assessing what it is we are spreading.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS. I don't listen to Alex Jones anymore because he is just as much a fear monger as the MSM to a degree. He gives us a bad name.

        The litmus test I use is the theory that explosive charges were planted in the Twin Towers and set off on 9-11. That is an absurd theory. Those who are unable to see that it is an absurd theory cannot be trusted or taken too seriously about other theories.

      <p>
       I use a similar litmus testâ€”people who blame everything on Jews or a Zionist conspiracy. I have yet to come across one who wasn't either intellectually inferior to a starfish or a rabid neo-nazi (99% of the time it happens to be both.)

       I'm afraid there's just too much racism and bigotry in the conspiracy movement for it ever to go mainstream.

       I used my brain and concluded that you're a racist and full of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't you deny that the Rape of Nanking happened? Or the Holodomor? Or the Armenian Genocide? The genocide in Rwanda? All these happened but the Jewish one didn't, even with all the first hand accounts from Nazis, victims, allied soldiers, pictures and documents that were kept by very efficient Germans? Keep in mind this is magnitudes more evidence than is provided for all of your crackpot conspiracy theories you deluded morons think up COMBINED.

       Wtf is this? The holocaust clearly happened. What so youre sayin the Nazis were cool and then because they lost ww2 the western powers came up with a story that they killed 6 million jews just to make them look morally corrupt?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not as if the basic ideas werent discussed in Mein Kampf, which came out in the 1920s, and its not as if the jews werent discriminated against since the nuremburg laws, and its not as if we dont have evidence from the wanasee conference where "evacuation", which included of course nature taking its toll on the imprisoned jews, was heavily discussed and even taken down in minutes by Adolf Eichmann.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you dont think the holocaust happened, youre a fucking idiot. of course it did, its so widely documented by so many historians from all over the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       and as well as being an idiot, i agree with lolcatsbelow that you are a fucking racist.

       That's a brave card for you to play. From your own posting history:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        JIDF shills downvoting like crazy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The MSM is run by the same people that run the false flags.
       </p>
       <p>
        Directed energy sounds plausible, unless it was a faster than sound stealth drone.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sounds like you're an expert in baseless accusations.

       JIDF is a real thing, the MSM is well known to be under govt. control, and surely there's faster than sound drones.
