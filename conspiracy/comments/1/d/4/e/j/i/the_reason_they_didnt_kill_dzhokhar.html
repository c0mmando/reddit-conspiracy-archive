They don&#39;t have to release any information or evidence that could hurt their supposed prosecution of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Now, if it will ever come to trial is a whole different question.  </p>

<p>How about: Every person working in the FBI is a secret sleeper agent (who of course lives and grew up in the USA but secretly hates it) and for some reason wants to see the place they&#39;ve grown up all their life go to hell? </p>

<p>FBI incompetence (like we are seeing again with the douchers in Boston), excess government bloat and slowness doesn&#39;t mean in any what whatsoever they somehow &quot;let it happen.&quot; That is idiotic because it won&#39;t help the FBI in any way, it only makes them look worse and therefore should have MORE government oversight to make sure they are doing their jobs properly.</p>

<p><a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/burden-of-proof">https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/burden-of-proof</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The burden of proof lies with someone who is making a claim, and is not upon anyone else to disprove. The inability, or disinclination, to disprove a claim does not render that claim valid, nor give it any credence whatsoever. However it is important to note that we can never be certain of anything, and so we must assign value to any claim based on the available evidence, and to dismiss something on the basis that it hasn&#39;t been proven beyond all doubt is also fallacious reasoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t a conspiracy. It&#39;s a catastrophic fuck-up of an operation. It has loose ends because the entire event took place as damage control.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re expecting a smoking gun on a target and you find it&#39;s not there after you&#39;ve pulled the trigger, you&#39;re in trouble. Death penalty kind of trouble. Assuming you don&#39;t want to die you will do whatever you can to &#39;fix&#39; it.</p>

<p>If this looks like anything it is the desperate attempt to scramble resources and affirmations to support a narrative which could not be proven. The missteps along the way are what happened when the two people they picked did not go quietly into that good night. No one in their right mind would ever intentionally contrive this series of events as a conspiracy.</p>

By him being there this whole thing has blown open and exposed a whole heap of shit that is way too messy to cleanup. Maybe he unwittingly did the people a favour but what price will he pay.</p>

The Chinese man, who escaped when the armed Tamerlan went inside to pay for gas at a gas station, told authorities and the media that when the brothers carjacked him they confessed all their crimes and told him they were heading for New York.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true. You bring up a valid point, but with Sandy Hook I don&#39;t think they had such a demand for the evidence. With this ever changing story and all of the public photos already out there, there will soon be a very vocal demand of the FBI to reveal the evidence. In the case of Sandy Hook, there was no surveillance video, and I didn&#39;t hear many people asking for pictures of dead children. I was not on Reddit when that happened so, maybe I&#39;m completely wrong. We will have to wait and see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to only look as far as this sub to see there is a large number of conspiracy theorists who believe Sandy Hook was a false flag and as such there has been a fair amount of demand for that kind of evidence. It is particularly acute in that case, because Sandy Hook initiated the biggest push for gun control legislation in recent history, which is a sensitive point for around half the country, which personally owns a gun. </p>

<p>I agree with others; the cleanest way out of this for people executing a conspiracy theory would have been to also kill Dzhokhar, which would have been easy to accomplish during the `firefight&#39; in the boat. Or, if I was conspiring and had to choose one brother to keep alive for some reason, no way would I have chosen Dzhokhar of the two brothers. The kid is obviously much more sympathetic than his brother - Tamerlan would have been the far better pick to put on trial as a &#39;scary Muslim.&#39; Why in the world would you intentionally frame a 19 year old kid who seems normal, who isn&#39;t an Arab Muslim, who is a well integrated American citizen with lots of friends? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether he goes to trial or not, the evidence will ultimately be available when his case is closed.  But, by capturing and formally indicting him, now the US prosecutors are opening themselves to disbarment and criminal penalties if the evidence they attested to in their affidavits does not, in fact, exist.  It thus seems like taking him alive would be a horribly short-sighted strategy if their goal was to protect the conspiracy or themselves or even just prevent the evidence from eventually being available; it would have been much easier and safer to kill him and claim the extant evidence was implicating individuals still at large.  Moreover, the entire narrative that has emerged about the brother&#39;s acting alone completely undermines their ability to suppress the evidence&#39;s release beyond Dzhokhar&#39;s case.  I can&#39;t see anything consistent here with a planned cover-up, honestly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious why you&#39;re so eager to believe that your own government intelligence agencies are so incompetent they were unable to prevent a man from launching an attack while watching him, identify him after the attack or even locate him. An untrained civilian with knowledge from a magazine, no support, no resources, nothing. And the only reason they caught him was because a drugged-up post op victim identified the man wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses as &#39;making eye contact&#39; while planting the device.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what you want to believe, is it? That these multi-billion dollar agencies are so fucking awful doing their job they couldn&#39;t catch a pair of pissed off kids who didn&#39;t even wear disguises while planting bombs at a massively documented public event.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an expert in the field of intelligence. I&#39;ve never been formally trained. But even I could tell you, right now, off the top of my head, how to run a better investigation. Checking cell phone records made to the nearby tower, analyzing flagged risks, tracking all persons wearing backpacks that at on point intersected with the center of the blasts, evaluating my local field office roster for potential risks.</p>

<p>It may seem like a conspiracy to you. It seems like one to me that anyone could willfully believe that veteran intelligence experts could be so shitty at their jobs that they universally forgot their own SOP.</p>

<p>The part where it took more than 48 hours to identify the suspects that ended with a public broadcast of their faces. This might&#39;ve been relevant if tehy were in hiding but we know from witness accounts that wasn&#39;t the case. They weren&#39;t hiding from anyone.</p>

<p>According to the FBI&#39;s statement to the Washington Post, Bauman&#39;s account was the first confirmation they actually had. Ironically this comes after announcing they had been sitting on the identity of the suspects, who weren&#39;t hiding, for a day. They took the photos to the White House but not to ask for permission. Obama personally commented and said, &quot;These are the suspects? Before you show these to anyone you better be sure.&quot; - No authorization was given or requested to publicly display the photographs.</p>

<p>Following this event the grainy images of the Tsarnaev brothers were released to the general public. Another day passed and they eluded capture while the FBI was actively seeking them. Following that, Bauman saw them on TV from his hospital bed and pointed to identify. He clarified the identity of suspect #1 at that time.</p>

<p>In 2002 I was introduced to the NSA Carnivore system by a member of the NSA. It was at the time and remains to date one of the most advanced database systems I&#39;ve ever known. It interlinks the various agencies and can rapidly cross reference data and tags established by analysts. The sheer volume of information available to it to reference is difficult to put into words. The system was designed to build data transaction timelines of all priority individuals that covered of interest. Or those not even yet known of interest.</p>

<p>No, real life isn&#39;t an episode of 24. Calls trace instantly, GPS is always on, I have access to a program that can cross reference purchases and accounts for all known service providers of my suspects. In fact right as it stands right now every IM, every e-mail, etc, is being stored in the data transaction warehouse the NSA system. If they want to know something about someone, they will know. In fact they can go as far as guessing what you finally got your rocks off to when you were jacking off.</p>

<p>I realize you may not know this, so I remain patient with you in this dialogue. </p>

<p>Bauman did not provide his account of the individuals until Thursday, after the information had been released to the public. The statement clearly noted that he had observed the suspect images on the television in his room before making the identification.</p>

<p>Conversely Mrs. Tsarnaev contradicts the narrative timeline by stating that she was contacted on Tuesday by the FBI. This is rather glaring disagreement of your presentation of facts on behalf of the official narrative which can be easily proven with a record of calls to Mrs. Tsarnaev&#39;s phone.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it&#39;s not easy to say they&#39;re incompetent. I&#39;ve had the pleasure of getting to know some of the men and women in our intelligence agencies on good terms. The persons I&#39;ve known in the NSA, DOJ and DHS were all sharp, professional and effective. I&#39;ve never personally known an FBI agent but one does not simply bumble into becoming one and I know this. I respect it with the sincerity it deserves.</p>

<p>That is part of why I know that it is incredibly unlikely they fumbling in the dark in violation of their own SOP with the entire nation watching. The whole reason the SOP exists is so that while they&#39;re overseeing a country of 311,000,000 people, they can focus easily on the most likely 1,000.</p>

<p>The limitations on their resources exist for passive tracking of persons who aren&#39;t POIs. The moment one is a POI and on a joint watchlist, the resources dedicated goes up several orders of magnitude. That&#39;s the point of having the watch list. That&#39;s how it works.</p>

<p>Organized terrorism is actually not at all that incompetent. Given their lack of resources they often make incredibly efficient use of whatever is available. The reason the organizations are so prevalent in other parts of the world is because they are, surprise, not that stupid. They may be insane, misguided and evil, but they aren&#39;t stupid. And if you really want to get into that the reason they aren&#39;t stupid is our doing; we made a great number of them into what they are starting with Kuwait back in the 1950s.</p>

<p>The government is actually rather fantastic as sharing, tracking and compiling information on PERSONS OF INTEREST. To the degree that if you&#39;re on the wanted list the only way you can avoid it is to actively work at it. And while I know you may find this hard to believe, someone on the terrorist watch list local to the regime with a warning flag raised by multiple foreign intelligence queries hiding at his apartment after a terrorist attack is not, in fact, succeeding at hiding.</p>

<p>If it helps, think of Batman. He doesn&#39;t really keep track of all Gotham but he sure as fuck knows the Joker or some other super villain is involved. Why? because he keeps tabs on them and makes a point to study their patterns.</p>

<p>It remains very clear to me that you are misinformed on the capabilities of the United States intelligence agencies, their SOP for identifying suspects and why these events which transpired are outrageous. That is why I am patiently trying to inform you.</p>
