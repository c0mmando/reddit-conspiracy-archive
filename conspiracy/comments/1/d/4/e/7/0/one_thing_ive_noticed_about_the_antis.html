        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been checking the history of all of the anti-boston conspiracy commentors here lately. A pattern is starting to emerge.</p>

<ul>
<li>They all have a low link karma, and a disproportionately high comment karma.</li>
<li>Of the few links submitted by these individuals, none have ever been submitted to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></li>
<li>Most of their submissions before the bombing that aren&#39;t in superthreads like <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> are directed at sports and community subreddits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just an observation.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Every person who has posted here saying &quot;OOO that describes me!&quot; and keeping the conversation light hearted haven&#39;t been agressively anti in their history. Some of them are actually pro even. Like I said, just an observation. The back and forth here is freaking hilarous, though.</p>

I did some ridiculous trolling just started typing indiscriminately. Making shit up left and right. It seems one of them got access to a fake e-mail account I had set up. It doesn&#39;t even work anymore, I&#39;m not much on hacking but this dude seemed to know the name I used and the server. It was a friends company email server. Do Mods have access to the e-mails you use on reddit or was he doxing me? If you want to see some crazy shit just go through my comments. This nutty bastard is making sockpuppets for every comment. Reddit is appearing to be completely compromised.</p>

Theres a whole swarm of pro-america hackers out there who are just troll douchebag jocks. A lot of them have worked or do work in the security industry and actually make it their life goal to dox anonymous. I&#39;m not really worried about getting doxed. If you google dataphreak, you&#39;ll find all i really do is play video games and watch pr0n.</p>

I only go into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>[1] [1] to make your comrades my bitches. I have a certain set of skills that makes guys like you delete your comments. I&#39;m more uncomfortable than corn in your pisshole. Most of you bitches that pretend to be smart by using derogatory language are 12 year old multi chin mouth breathers, with pizza pocket permanently lodged between your sweaty ass fingers. You are a fat fuck aren&#39;t you? I can tell. You have to poke the fun at random Internet schlubs or you will start thinking about how utterly shitty and fat your own life is. Larking through Walmart fantasizing about under age kids. Yes I know your type bitch. It&#39;s sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll come out (controversially) and say I&#39;ve been anti-Boston conspiracy on here (although I&#39;d delegate my position to &quot;skeptic&quot; of the Boston conspiracy). I have really low link karma because I don&#39;t really feel the need to post links on Reddit. Everything important to me has already been posted, and all I do is comment on issues I am interested in. Recently, the Boston conspiracy has been interesting to me (mostly because my friend was there). </p>

<p>So yeah,</p>

<ul>
<li>I have low link karma because I don&#39;t have anything to post.</li>
<li>I never submit links to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because I&#39;m not a firm believer in conspiracies, but I understand the appeal.</li>
<li>I post in smaller subreddits because you don&#39;t have to deal with the constant circlejerk on Reddit, and have just become interested in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because of the recent Boston Bombings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope you guys can appreciate an outsider&#39;s input. I&#39;m guessing a lot of the so-called &quot;anti-Boston conspiracy&quot; posters have the same mindset as me, or at least similar. You guys are honestly a pretty cool bunch, but a lot of you seem to think that everyone who provides counter-arguments are anti-conspiracy or shills (or whatever you guys call them) and it&#39;s really intimidating.</p>

<p>edit: I can&#39;t bracket stuff for the life of me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit does not like spiders for some reason. Its difficult to aggregate data beyond the front page of major subreddits. It is, for lack of a better term, primarily deep web. I think that&#39;s sad, because when you step back and look at it as a whole, it is the embodiment of the collective consciousness of its entire user base.</p>

<p>The things that we find most interesting, humanity as a whole, are the most active subreddits. <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a>. But everybody has those inner voices, and they&#39;re all different. Things like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are a great example. Every human has the paths in their brain for conspiracy. Some of us focus on it daily. Others only when outside sources stimulate that part of the brain, like the media. I give the anti&#39;s a lot of flack. I&#39;m also not an active member of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. But what I see when anti&#39;s come here and give people a hard time is not negative. It&#39;s positive.</p>

<p>When you present someone with a conspiratorial situation, they exercise that portion of their brain. They take all of the information available to them at the time, and run it against the conspiracy theory, and make a decision. Ultimately, the outcome of that decision doesn&#39;t matter. It can be for or against. The results are purely based on information gathered before the processing on the theory began.</p>

<p>But what has really happened here? A person has exercised the critical thinking part of their brain, and stored new information. Ultimately, it is a good thing.</p>

<p>For laughs or &quot;for the lulz&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>people address the issue of conspiracy evidence in different ways. imo it makes sense to disprove it first. if numerous, logical explanations exist then the theory has to be taken with a pinch of salt. if no explanation is apparent then dig a little deeper and see where it does. the reason you will see so much &quot;debunking&quot; and &quot;anti-conspiracy&quot; is because SO MUCH of the material used as evidence to prove a theory is so easily explained with obvious, logical, objective, critical, common sense thinking.</p>
