    <div class="md"><p>yeah, you&#39;re right.</p>

<p>i just see people posting negative comments syncing up w/ downvoting.</p>

<p>i can&#39;t tell for sure obviously but it&#39;s pretty apparent what&#39;s happening--just a lot of new guys from the boston thing.</p>

<p>funny thing is some reposted my links in a non-conspiracy sub and it did better! i can just notice a new presence here that&#39;s anti &#39;conspiracy,&#39; that&#39;s all, so was kinda making an assumption on the downvotes. regarding the negative comments though, that i can def see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of it has to do with common violations of reddiquette, and fear.  I&#39;m going to completely ignore the possible presence of shills, and try to show how a major event, especially something that looks like terrorism, would cause people to migrate here.</p>

<p>Reddit was a major source of information for the Boston events.  That&#39;s pretty indisputable.  Since it was actually mentioned, especially in a negative way, on main stream channels, you can expect an influx of new users.  This would give us a large number of new users that already disagree with Reddit because the TV station said Reddit was doing bad things.  </p>

<p>Most of these people would get caught up in a default subreddit, or a major thread, about Boston.  But not all of them.  This subreddit was quite a bit more popular than normal while the events were occuring, and was often linked to in larger threads.  This brings some of them here.  They already disagree with conspiracy&#39;s take on Boston, and are new to reddit.  </p>

<p>They proceed to downvote posts they disagree with, which is the vast majority of conspiracy.  These are folks that are here because CNN or whatever said Reddit&#39;s ruined lives and suck at detective work.  They&#39;re not going to be pleased with more detective work, especially when it goes against their primary news source (TV.)  </p>

<p>Fear brings in additional users, who probably won&#39;t stick around for more than a few months, who simply want an alternate explanation that gives them some peace of mind.  What that means varies from person to person, and some will disagree and downvote.  And of course, there&#39;s those who believe conspiracy is behind the poor conclusions drawn by many redditors in the early hours of the suspect hunt, and wish to punish that behavior.  Whether or not that behavior actually occurred is irrelevant to their desire to punish conspiracy for allegedly engaging in it.</p>

<p>Shills might explain it too, but I&#39;d like to think it&#39;s explainable without the need to suggest the government fears a subreddit that, to be frank, isn&#39;t exactly the number one source in trusted theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well said. </p>

<p>The sad thing is that while there might very well be cointel and paid manipulators among us (it would be nice to think that this community is rattling the cage loudly enough [but it isn&#39;t]), it&#39;s most likely what Xenks is describing. </p>

<p>The average citizen will gladly insult you for trying to speak up on their behalf. Same shit happens to you, too, if you comment with alternative views in a mainstream sub. </p>

<p>Conspiracy:Politics::Psychonaut:Atheism</p>

<p>That is of course assuming any of this ideological in nature. Many of the posters see drama in the sub and immediately get involved irrespective of their opinions. They likely lack real opinions in either direction. My guess is that these are the ones who have the word shill or some such thing in their flair. It&#39;s just a massive joke. </p>

<p>When the next INTERESTING INTERNET THING happens they&#39;ll be sure to do whatever is expected of them then too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory on whats happening is the main stream media is painting all conspiracy theorists as followers of people like Alex Jones and Glenn Beck etc, and people see this sub as a place filled with their followers. Naturally people like Glenn Beck have a lot of enimies, and I think a good chunk of the dissruption here lately is just people coming to downvote a community they see aligned with people like them.  </p>

<p>there is most definitely a presence here &amp; on other similar forums that exists solely to try and disrupt legitimate discussion by downvoting, making sarcastic comments towards &amp; disagreeing with anyone that questions the mass media &amp; government, and trying to imply any conspiracy theory of any kind is crazy and implausible.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s great that you ask questions about these situations, I really do. I think when we become complacent with what we&#39;re told, that&#39;s when problems begin. But some of the connections you try to make are just outrageous. It&#39;s not even questioning at that point.. it&#39;s just outrageously ignorant. You&#39;re bending your own perception because you <em>want</em> to believe that what you&#39;re saying is right.. that there&#39;s some sort of conspiracy because you have a very strong distaste for the government, which is a fact many of you don&#39;t try to hide</p>

<p>Things like the Boston Marathon Bombing and that idiotic imgur post on Facebook throw massive amounts of attention towards your subreddit. I know that many of you are just trying to have genuine discussions about things you weren&#39;t told and questions you have, but some of your members make very <em>very</em> easy targets for trolling, which affects you as a whole.</p>

<p>better assume he has ridiculous theories and can&#39;t accept opposing views.</p>

<p>are you not seeing these new guys on here as well? they&#39;re not necessarily gov&#39;t--not sure where you got that from &#39;cause my post doesn&#39;t mention shills or gov&#39;t. but they&#39;re definitely new--i&#39;m thinking it&#39;s related to the influx related to CNN mentioning &#39;reddit conspiracy&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a lot of people who were drawn here by the Boston Bomber stuff that was going on.  They&#39;ll go away soon.  Maybe.</p>

<p>The bottom line is you guys are downright fascinating.  I&#39;ve been lurking around for a few years, and I rarely comment.  The way you perceive the world is just so different.</p>

<p>Before the internet, you would find a conspiracy theorist here or there--ranting at you while you pumped your gas.  Slowly bending a casual conversation into a diatribe about chemtrails.  And it was really uncomfortable.  Conspiracy theorists had faces on them, and they were kind of alarming.  Besides the fact that they are aggressively trying to convince you of some outlandish theory, a lot of times you could tell there were some other issues going on as well.</p>

<p>Now, there are forums where you congregate, and we can listen to your theories every day from a safe distance.  <em>We</em> can come to <em>you</em>.  It&#39;s almost like a zoo.  If a hyena came up to me in the wild and starting snarling at me, I would be alarmed.  But from a safe distance, I can just observe and appreciate the beauty of such a strange beast.</p>

<p>My personal favorites are the FEMA death camps.  I&#39;ve worked closely with FEMA before, and anyone who thinks they&#39;ve got it together enough to orchestrate such a huge conspiracy has clearly never met a FEMA employee.  And my favorite piece of evidence is the coffins.  Because why would an agency tasked with responding to catastrophic disasters need coffins unless they were planning on opening concentration camps?</p>

<p>Can we get some more FEMA stuff going again?</p>
