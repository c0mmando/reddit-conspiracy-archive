<p>imo, donbueno has erred, but on the side of what, i&#39;d really like to know. </p>

<ul>
<li>there is a massive infiltration going on in here right now. i hope some long time users here get hip to what&#39;s happening, or this ship is going to go down. </li>

    <div class="md"><p>No, just no.  It is wrong to punish people who haven&#39;t done anything wrong.  You shouldn&#39;t have to be told that and the (former) mods of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> should never even be thinking along such lines.  </p>

<p>Using the actions of shills to justify preemptive action against all newer accounts is indefensible.  It&#39;s just flat out wrong.  </p>

<p>They can&#39;t <em>know</em> why someone is on a newer account.  I almost made a new one ( I sometimes worry that the &#39;tardy&#39; thing might not have been the best reflection of what I choose to say).  Having forgotten my password I would have been effectively silenced by this rule.  There are other reasons. Many people started flooding to this sub in the wake of recent events.  Many here change accounts fairly often for privacy reasons.  </p>

<p>Have we such little value to you that you would silence us just to quiet the shills for a short time?  </p>

<p>the mechanism of the organized and casual trolling efforts here is a reality. </p>

<p>by restricting instant availability, the mods were attempting to use the technology to preserve an arena for real people, which is an admirable effort, imo. to turn it into a free speech suppression concept alone is disingenuous at worst, and at best stymieing to solving the real issue. </p>

<p>the solution, at any rate, needed to be flexible, and respond to the demands of the community here, and maybe it wouldn&#39;t have been 30 days, but several hours, or one day. other options could have been explored. but the action taken against the mods, who had a consensus, was a unilateral one, by one person. and no solution to the forum manipulation will be reached, and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will go quietly into that dark night. </p>

<p>to believe that intelligence services would not have operatives in online forums, where people meet and discuss ideas, is completely irrational. you would lose your job as an intelligence director to someone who would think to put people in there. take your time with that, if you need.</p>

<p>are you really that naive to believe forum manipulation isn&#39;t real?</p>

<p>But no, I really don&#39;t think the the intelligence community cares about what people say on a subreddit devoted to conspiracies. Why would they? Conspiracy theories, such as those that get posted on here, are typically reactionary; very rarely are they predictive, and almost never are they of importance to anybody outside of the conspiracy community. </p>

<p>In the event of an actual conspiracy being perpetrated, I could <em>maybe</em> see planting somebody just to see what kind/how much exposure you were getting, but at that point, the conspiracy has failed because it has been leaked into the public.</p>

<p>The intelligence community couldn&#39;t care less about reactionaries. </p>

<p>here is only a handful of conspiracies that are more important than you have allotted time to discover, and they are also why investigative journalism is so damn important, so that there is a chance that at least some of the people don&#39;t walk around with ideas like you&#39;ve expressed.</p>

<p>it is impossible to spend any amount of time investigating conspiracy and maintain such a diminished view of its role in your entire worldview. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, nothing is ever a closed book. Theories (you called it history) are always ongoing and constantly evolving, and as such, I tend to withhold judgement on most things.</p>

<p>As humans, I don&#39;t believe that we are ever capable of knowing &quot;whole truths&quot; about anything. We are inherently subjective beings. Because of this, I don&#39;t believe that we are ever able to come to completely logical, rational conclusions about anything, whatever those conclusions may be. Your opinion may differ. </p>

<p>But back to my main point in all of this, why again would the intelligence community take an interest in r/conspiracy? Please don&#39;t tell me it is to spread disinformation, because the true believers will automatically discard all dissenting information so it won&#39;t affect them. </p>

<p>The only people the disinfo agents could affect are those that are unsure about something. Those people are the types that are inherently not cut out for this board anyways.</p>

<p>what disappoints me is how establishment forces attempt to paint just such a picture of theorists, as a thoughtless angry herd, and go out of their way to study and find the most laughably pathetic individuals to support this fallacy. by debunking and ridiculing such individuals and their beliefs, they seek to debunk and ridicule theorists as a general group, which is intellectually dishonest, and patently deceptive. </p>

<p>being skeptical of historical events as they are reported by the state and media services is not inherently dangerous, and to portray such a believe is either an unconscious internalization of establishment propaganda, or a willful use of it. the establishment promotes from the highest mountain any story of a mainstream individual or group being &quot;targeted&quot; by conspiracy theorists, because it supports the conditioning they&#39;ve developed for us. </p>

<p>the alternative to such &quot;dangerous&quot; skepticism is complete obedience to those messages that are developed and delivered to us by powerful financial and political interests--a reality i find exponentially more dangerous.</p>

<p>additionally, not everything circulating within conspiracy circles is genuine or organic to those circles. one of the traditional methods for marginalizing and suppressing historical skepticism is to go find the most ridiculous and unsupported claims and then debunk them in something with mainstream distribution. not everything posted here comes from legitimate conspiracy researchers, and not every theorist around is legitimate, themselves. It is a fallacy to believe that everything within forums such as this are believed by all theorists equally, but it is one that MSM would encourage you believed, without question. </p>

<p>there are, however, many people who do buy into the garbage concepts, or express otherwise groupthink mentality, which is just as dangerous as being willfully &quot;asleep&quot;. not much can be done about it, but such people should be approached as individuals, not described as you have, as a general, like-minded herd, which is just as juvenile, and just as foolish. </p>

<p>anyone who spends half a day looking into real life actual conspiracies will be unable to continue on with a diminished view of their role in one&#39;s worldview. real ones like these:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>describing sins&#39; promotion of this story as proof of his being attached to power is absolutely disingenuous, and propagandist. at best, you are passing off your opinion as fact.</p>

<p>once instated, the rule most certainly would have gone through a period of trial and error, and adjustment by us here. by opening it originally to community discussion, the same thing would have occurred then that is occurring now, namely the mass swarm of accounts coming in here to express crude propagandist framings of defending freedom. </p>

<p>our ideals in this community are being wielded against us, and simplistic descriptions of what freedom is or should be here often omit any attempt to acknowledge or describe the reality of organized forum manipulation, which is preserved by doing nothing. </p>

<p>sins knows what is happening to this place, as do others. it seems it is very easy for unscrupulous attackers of sins to throw power words around describing authoritarian power grabs and censorship and attacks on freedom, as many here are susceptible to such conceptual frameworks. but they are being manipulated. </p>

<p>they don&#39;t realize the unfortunate ironic reality that it is precisely the enemies of information literacy that scream the loudest for free speech. </p>

<p>without relying on invasive increased moderation, it would be possible to use the technological apparatus of reddit itself to fight these forces. a waiting period would have performed this function. but there are possibly other ways, too. this is a discussion we could have all had here. </p>

<p>but what happened instead is that a unilateral action was taken, a truly authoritarian action, which has removed a group of people who were active watching what happens here every day, who had come to a consensus about something to try, <em>within</em>, not <em>upon</em> the community they were part of. it&#39;s not like they would have been tyrants, determining how the rest of us behave. to paint that picture would be disingenuous. </p>

<p>and now no change will be made, and those moderators taking steps to battle forum manipulation are now gone, too, leaving wide the floodgates, and preserving the rather successful techniques used to game this sub.</p>

<p>the idea that reddit corrects itself, and you can simply vote the problem away is fraudulent, and in the light of technology where agents can pilot dozens of accounts at the same time, is ignorant. </p>

<p>i can only hope people continue to ponder the consequences of these recent events. </p>

<p>no, no it doesn&#39;t. i&#39;ve been using this system here for almost three years, and i can definitely say, this is bullshit. </p>

<p>but it&#39;s the same kind of bullshit that come out and gets evoked everytime this type of conversation arises here. it&#39;s similar to the way so called skeptics and debunkers will evoke the concept of peer review, as though it were an impervious, incorruptible process resulting in objective truth. well, thinking idealistically about ideals does not do due diligence to the actual use of these ideals in reality. </p>

<p>reddit is easily gamed, and downvoting suspect posts is pointless if agents or downvote groups have access to dozens and dozens of screen names. avatar infestation is not the result completely of individual people, but of individual people piloting countless brand new accounts, as well as accounts created a while ago, but left to &#39;age.&#39; <strong>the technology being wielded against members of online forums is sophisticated, covert, and designed to work successfully while staying hidden within otherwise transparent process. it&#39;s not designed to be easily defeated by people exercising vigilant voting.</strong> </p>

<p>to think we will correct this by voting is an untruth, and one that is constantly promoted the loudest each and every time someone attempts a method for stopping the flow of sockpuppets. </p>

<p>something has got to change. we can&#39;t constantly be defeated by unscrupulous psychopaths or agents that use our own ideals to manipulate us covertly, <strong>which is exactly what is happening.</strong> </p>

<p>I believe I&#39;ve already made my case as to why framing this debate as a censorship of free speech is not erroneous, but ignorant, specifically of the fact that that new software being used by corporate and state shills/agents allows for the piloting of literally dozens and dozens of accounts at the same time. I&#39;m not making this shit up. If the mechanism by which we are being pwned is the open door policy, we need to find a way to address it. many websites use preventative measures against trolling. it&#39;s not unprecedented, and people wouldn&#39;t be closed out of the society, but encouraged to watch (maybe not for 30 days) and learn about the people, culture, and topics discussed. Once trolls were indentified, banning them would be more effective than it is today, where they simply turn around a new account and turn back up in 30 seconds. Surely, preserving this ability for organized trolling by doing nothing is as ethically questionable as putting up firewalls. Ultimately, something needs to be attempted. The techniques and software being used are <em>designed</em> to be effective within open frameworks, and are designed to be impervious to nominal forum voting.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Just watch and learn. Anyone who has been using it long enough can determine voting trends. Yes rando people disagree. But also yes, controlled voting is real. That&#39;s right, despite the best efforts of most people who use this angle, both are most likely true, rather than it being erroneously framed as one or the other. A five minute google search will reveal half a dozen articles talking about state and corporate forces hiring battalions of online public relations people. To believe that this does not happen is to choose to be willfully ignorant. </p>

If this rule was 10 days i would be absolutely for it; literally half the comments on every thread are coming from new accounts; whether they are just not well versed in conspiracy, are shills, or are trolls, they make it seriously difficult to have an intelligent conversation a lot of the time. If someone was truly intent on understanding conspiracy, do you really think they would care if they couldnt post for the first few days? I wouldnt care. Of course, as i said, 30 days may be harsh, but removing them from the mods list is way more harsh imo. </p>

<p>For what subreddits is this the case? Honest question.</p>

<p>The rule ultimately doesn&#39;t make sense, people should be banned for inappropriate language or obvious flaming, but if they&#39;re posting their opinion civilly there is no reason for them to be banned. I have a dream that reddit users will one day live in a website where they will not be judged by the age of their account but by the content of their comments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was referring to other forums, not subreddits, where new accounts cant post or can only post in certain subforums until they acquire certain credentials. Also &#39;banning&#39; is really not an accurate term. Its not like you cant view the subreddit or never post; just not for the first 30 days after making a new account. you  If you are new to reddit and are interested in conspiracy, you have hundreds of other sub reddits to comment on and post in. You can still view all the information, you just cant post your opinion for a little. For anyone who was banned and needs to make a new account, there was probably a good reason for that and being on &#39;probation&#39; for 30 days might give them time to think about it or at least keep them from doing what got them banned for a little bit (or at least make it more difficult to do so). </p>

<p>Is such an act a perfect answer to the problem? No not at all. But at this point this subreddit isnt even navigable, and anyone who is new to it and <em>honestly</em> interested in conspiracy will most likely be turned off due to the immense trolling and the dis information. And i&#39;m sure i&#39;m not the only vet here who is constantly annoyed ; it is to the extent of wanting to leave this forum all together. I, nor anyone here, has a problem with honest inquiry or legit evidence for an official story. In fact we absolutely welcome and need it. This change, unlike many seem to believe, was not to prevent competition of information, it was meant to return to competition of <em>legitimate</em> information and discussion. Very few here, if any at all, are so deluded as to want for no opposition in their line of thought. We got here in the first place by questioning everything and if we didnt continue to do that we would be just as hypocritical and misguided as the &#39;sheep&#39; we scoff at. This forum is no longer a legitimate discussion, it is just a &quot;you dumb ass conspiracy theorist stop believing stupid shit&quot; vs &quot;you dumb ass sheep wake up!&quot;. Honestly in its current state, this forum would almost be better if comments from all users were banned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The long term users aren&#39;t asking for opposing posts to be removed, they are asking for the mods to be given a better layer of mod-ship so the name calling, personal attacks and general trolling can be easier dealt with. Its gotten to the point of people on both sides calling each other shills and trolls and the discussion is completely directed into a shouting match. People that have come here to intentionally do that should be limited as much as possible. Make accounts with 30 days activity available to comment, if anyone continuously uses personal attacks or does not contribute in a meaningful way, ban them. No one would like it if there sub was turned into a slanging match while the topic gets left by the way side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am constantly on here, and I have never seen such a huge surge in troll activity over the last 2 weeks in the (almost) 2 years that I have been here.  It has been so difficult to simply discuss anything without having 3 or 4 trolls attacking you with vicious insults, and disruptive behavior.  The one things that nearly every single troll has in common...accounts that have been open less than a month (in most cases less than a day).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t blame the mods for trying to clean house (I would constantly report the really bad ones).  Now, the solution is to simply ban the mods?  How does this even begin to help the problem?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>30 days seems a little much. But I think a 10 day waiting period is pretty reasonable. This place seemed to be cleaning up in the past week. Also this kind of buffer would prevent trolls and shills to some degree. There seems to be spikes and influxes of them after a big event or tragedy. This way a conversation could get a head start by the community away from users that would subscribe only to harass on those occasions. And if possible a &quot;vetting&quot; system could be put in place where a user, if they feel they have something to contribute and they fall before the 10 day buffer, could PM a mod to bypass the waiting period. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really think removing all the mods will help in this situation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just finished skimming over all these wonderful comments. I rarely comment, but I&#39;ve got to say I agree with 9000sins on this one. However, the game theory in this whole situation is just beautiful. I wonder if donbueno or even all the mods are &quot;agents of disinfo&quot;, because as pointed out several times, this is r/conspiracy. We cultivate healthy paranoia here in order to hone our critical thinking skills. We are presented with a problem, like Boston, and told the &quot;facts&quot;. Sometimes those &quot;facts&quot; are blatant lies. Why? Control. Power. The struggle between donbueno and 9000sins seems too convenient. Textbook Oligarchical Collectivism. It doesn&#39;t matter who is &quot;right&quot; as long as the consumers of r/conspiracy feel like they know the truth when all the sheep stay asleep. Brilliantly manufactured catharsis.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>...9000Sins, you should probably comment on this and state some of your reasoning. Justification for your position needs to emerge with a fair explanation of what transpired.</p>

<p>It is our duty to remain impartial while you make your case. It is yours to make that case without dodging questions or side-stepping uncomfortable admissions. Even if you did something kind of douchey,  context is everything. Just calmly explain the the truth and don&#39;t hold to hubris.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t or won&#39;t do that, I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s not much any of us can do.</p>

<p>This is R/Conspiracy...</p>

<p>you are always, always, going to get moronic and pointless posts. It doesn&#39;t matter if you make people wait 30 minutes or 30 days. People will still find a way to clutter R/Conspiracy up with absolute garbage. </p>

<p>On top of that, it would be hard to grasp how you would moderate the already countless users who can&#39;t find their ass with both hands, and post like it. You can&#39;t just kick everyone and start fresh.</p>

<p>Rules like this have to be implemented at day dot. There is sensibility in the concept, but not the timing. </p>

Make a new site and take your community THERE. That will get much more done than MAKING TITLES IN ALL CAPS. That will show them to mess with you and your beloved community!

<p>Does the ban stop you from subscribing? I know for me personally It would not stop me checking out this place If I knew I couldn&#39;t comment for 30 days as a measure to stop trolling, I can still read everything. If anything it might make it a bit more exclusive. </p>

<p>Given the fact that reddit doesn&#39;t even require so much as an email to register an account, and things like RES will save multiple accounts with login information for you, it really isn&#39;t much effort. It&#39;s just really unlikely the ban does anything actually beneficial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in this sub every day. I see the persistence of the trolls, and I can tell you. A 30 day rule will change nothing, troll wise. But it WILL prevent actual discussion. </p>

<p>For instance, 9000sins is known, very well known, for deleting and banning that which he does not personally agree with. Say a new user subs and doesn&#39;t know this. He posts something 9000sins, or any moderator, disagrees with. </p>

<p>With a 30 day rule in place, it&#39;s academic to silence that voice until such a time as the conversation is irrelevant. </p>

<p>Also, because of how much I frequent this sub, I can assure you: NO TOPIC stays relevant 30 days at a time. Some barely last three days. </p>

<p>It was a bad idea and a bad move to just institute it without discussion. And while we&#39;re on the topic, I&#39;ve been in this sub enough to see PLENTY of threads talking about 9000sins malfeasance. Suddenly today there&#39;s a huge outpouring of support where it previously did not exist. </p>

<p>Proving my point that no action or rule can curb trolls. </p>

<p>We want a discussion here without being sidetracked having to deal with trolls, and yes there has been a lot of them. Some come right out and tell you to fuck off/nut job etc but some are more subtle using the more extreme conspiracies in attempt to mock while spamming the same links and the same comments over and over.</p>

<p>The mods were doing the best they could, I had no problem with them removing obvious trolls and they came under attack on several occasions when they did remove those posts with people attempting to remove them implying it was censorship to remove the shit.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;d like to add the people that want this rule enforced are the people that have been long time, genuine posters. Most of the other people are against it because they want to fuck this place up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel bad for the mods, but honestly I&#39;m glad that rule isn&#39;t going to be implemented. I am a new member, but even I can appreciate that such activity makes people distrust this place and it gives people ammunition to discredit any discussion that goes on here. Censoring people&#39;s posts is not cool on any forum and overall it makes everyone look bad. Aren&#39;t we supposed to be exercising freedom of speech to say anything on here so long as we remain respectful? I am new, but I&#39;ve had nothing but nice and interesting convos with people about the bombings. I think the ignore option is good for people who do want to personally censor what they see. Just my 2 cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is the 30 day rule so terrible? I like it, it means that people who are serious about being here will end up being here. 30 Days is a month, its not that long. This Sub deserves people who are dedicated and there has to be some way to keep others who are trying to bring it down out. 30 days is a safe number, its 4 weeks. Thats not going to destroy the Sub, if anything it could make it more desirable to be in here. Wait 30 days to get in, its like an exclusive conspiracy country club. Its really not that long to wait. People creating new accounts should have to earn some credibility on some degree or level. 30 days is really nothing guys...its not going to destroy conspiracy and if it is which can be measured than people can change the rule.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need a site in onionland.   We could avoid all the fratboy and willfully ignorant* types.  They&#39;re overrunning Reddit in general and making it suck.
And when I say that I just want to point out I&#39;ve been  on the internet since the mid 90&#39;s so I know what I&#39;m talking about.  And I was into BBS&#39;s before that.</p>

<p>*this includes the persona management folks which I think is the big problem here; IMO we&#39;ve been targeted because of our potential to attract interested people new to this subject.
Actually, I just thought of another reason for the concerted attack.  If you think of 2 recent news stories, I think it explains a lot.  And the current problem did start around the end of last year.</p>

<p>EDIT:   for people that haven&#39;t been there   You will not just accidentally see kiddie porn.   You really have to look for it.   There&#39;s the cleaned or censored hidden wiki. Even on the normal hidden wiki, it&#39;s very clear if it has objectionable content.   There are existing multiple topic forums (not imageboards) which aren&#39;t good for us because they are open to ALL topics.</p>

<p>Also, of the conspiracy sites already there, I haven&#39;t seen anything that was similar to r/conspiracy or any of the good forums here.   And by good forums, I mean the one that you see good discussion.   Some of the one&#39;s that we have here on the clearnet that people know about aren&#39;t really what I consider quality sites.  You can find forums with actual published writers; they tend to have intelligent, thoughtful discussion.</p>

<p>everyone who has been in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> since before the episode in Boston knows there is an entirely different atmosphere that is completely the opposite of what it should be(truth-seeking) in this forum.</p>

<p>9000sins took a slightly drastic measure(sorry, the one or two legitimate people who make new accounts all the time?) but did the right thing. The only people who should be complaining are ones who make shill accounts with less than a month specifically to post <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, or who have been banned for trolling/shilling and then need to immediately make an army of brand new accounts to keep posting.</p>

<p>What do you know - MASSIVE amount of complaints, less shilling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds like my account.</p>

<p>Yes, I am longtime reddit lurker who registered on a whim to make a single comment a month ago, but then didn&#39;t post for a month.  And, yes, I started posting more yesterday after stumbling on a thread about the boston bombing where I thought I had some relevant points (other redditors thought so too, based on the karma, by the way).  But (1) no one is paying me to post anything, and (2) I have broken no rules with any of my posts.</p>

<p>I&#39;m disappointed that someone would want to ban my account or an account like mine simply because they disagree with something I, or that other account, have said.  If you disagree with anything I posted, you are free to explain why and we can discuss it.  I&#39;ve enjoyed politely discussing my interpretations of and evidence for events on this sub with many who do not agree with me.</p>

<p>but the reddit system works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>no, no it doesn&#39;t. i&#39;ve been using this system here for almost three years, and i can definitely say, this is bullshit. </p>

<p>but it&#39;s the same kind of bullshit that come out and gets evoked everytime this type of conversation arises here. it&#39;s similar to the way so called skeptics and debunkers will evoke the concept of peer review, as though it were an impervious, incorruptible process resulting in objective truth. well, thinking idealistically about ideals does not do due diligence to the actual use of these ideals in reality. </p>

<p>reddit is easily gamed, and downvoting suspect posts is pointless if agents or downvote groups have access to dozens and dozens of screen names. avatar infestation is not the result completely of individual people, but of individual people piloting countless brand new accounts, as well as accounts created a while ago, but left to &#39;age.&#39; <strong>the technology being wielded against members of online forums is sophisticated, covert, and designed to work successfully while staying hidden within otherwise transparent process. it&#39;s not designed to be easily defeated by people exercising vigilant voting.</strong> </p>

<p>to think we will correct this by voting is an untruth, and one that is constantly promoted the loudest each and every time someone attempts a method for stopping the flow of sockpuppets. </p>

<p>something has got to change. we can&#39;t constantly be defeated by unscrupulous psychopaths or agents that use our own ideals to manipulate us covertly, <strong>which is exactly what is happening.</strong> </p>

<p>Why not? They&#39;re all links to your censorship actions as a mod. You were asked in a polite manner to please explain why those actions were appropriate in your eyes and to not sidestep the request. </p>

<p>Which you then did by giving a canned response that was totally off topic. One might assume you didn&#39;t even bother to notice what the links actually were. In evidence by your off topic response in the thread in question, and your flip response here that a link to a list of links pertaining to YOUR mod actions, when it&#39;s YOUR mod actions being called in to question, is irrelevant. </p>
