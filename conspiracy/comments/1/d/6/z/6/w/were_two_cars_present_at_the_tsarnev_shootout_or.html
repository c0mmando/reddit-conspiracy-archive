        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>...and a second car jacking could have very well occurred, that I didn&#39;t hear about. If so, just let me know. Just looking for some clarity here. </p>

<p>In the following interview, &quot;Danny&quot; states that the younger of the two left the Sedan on a side street after unloading several heavy objects into the Mercedes: <a href="http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/04/25/carjack-victim-recounts-his-harrowing-night/BhQWGzarWee8MZ6KtMHJNN/story.html">http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/04/25/carjack-victim-recounts-his-harrowing-night/BhQWGzarWee8MZ6KtMHJNN/story.html</a></p>

<p>Danny goes on to say that the two sped off in the Mercedes and were involved in a firefight within the hour. Mind you, this is after they have driven for approximately an hour AFTER leaving the sedan behind. </p>

<p>CNN and other news sources reported that the brothers showed up in a single vehicle - the stolen Mercedes. </p>

<p>However, there are several photos of two vehicles at the scene of the shootout. The second vehicle? A sedan. Specifically: <a href="http://www.getonhand.com/blogs/news/7743337-boston-bombing-suspect-shootout-pictures">http://www.getonhand.com/blogs/news/7743337-boston-bombing-suspect-shootout-pictures</a></p>

<p>Did &quot;Danny&quot; lie about the sedan being left behind, or did the brothers have time (after Danny&#39;s escape) to return to the sedan before engaging the police? Why would they choose to do this after all weapons/explosives had been transferred to the Mercedes?</p>

<p>Edit: if, perhaps, I am missing some important bit of info that has already answered this question of mine, or provided a detailed description of what I am missing, then please kindly let me know. May I emphasize the word &#39;kindly&#39;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were driving the Sedan when they carjacked the SUV. Allegedly, Dzhokhar was driving that vehicle and pulled up behind SUV, while Tamerlan got out and carjacked it. Allegedly confessing, very quickly too. Then Dzhokhar followed the carjacked &quot;Danny&quot; for some time until both vehicles stopped and Dzhokhar got into the SUV. Read his eyewitness account...widely available via the Boston Globe. Believe what you will. I have plenty ideas about what may have happened after and why they ended up back at the other car at the time of the shootout. But that&#39;s just my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they claim that when dzhokhar got into the SUV, they unloaded several bags into the trunk.  Then they went to the ATM.  Then they cam back to the honda and again loaded several bags into the trunk.  Then they went to the gas station and Danny escaped.  Then, when they were in the shootout, the eyewitness who was photographing from his house says that there were two cars, the mercedes and the honda, and that they were going back and forth to the honda to get bags of weapons out.</p>

<p>How many bags were in the green honda?  And what ever happened with the grey honda that they were still searching for after the shootout, on Friday morning?  And what happened with the white mercedes wagon that they supposedly picked up from the mechanic after the bombing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember seeing the interview with the mechanic who worked on the Mercedes wagon you&#39;re talking about.  He said that it was a friends car, and that he needed it right away.  Maybe his friend needed the car back?  We will likely never know..</p>

<p>I also remember the guy saying Tamerlan had brought many friends to his shop for car work, and many of them had really nice cars..  I know he said one of them brought a Hummer to be serviced, and mentioned Tamerlan having friends from Turkey.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>but theyre saying now that tamerlan was poor and on welfare.  Not that you can&#39;t be poor and have rich friends, it&#39;s just an interesting note.</p>

<p>They&#39;re also saying that the two boys lived together (in squalor) and that the wife and baby didn&#39;t appear to live with them.  Has anyone heard from the wife?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I saw some photos of their place, and it looked like a typical house shared by 2 guys(source: I&#39;ve had many roommates much more lazy than I, and it got messy).  I didn&#39;t know he got welfare benefits..  But yea that doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t have rich friends.</p>

<p>I wonder what the situation was with Tamerlan and his wife..  I find it odd that he was living with his younger brother, and not his family..  I also wonder what the wife knew and what she&#39;s told authorities..  I honestly wish I were like the head of the FBI/CIA or something similar so I could know the real truth! &gt;&lt;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what is being said now is the NYC thing was very spontaneous. They maybe only thought about it after their photos showed up on the TV. From Danny&#39;s account of the night&#39;s events, Dzhokhar was driving the sedan for a while. And wow, I just realized that in Danny&#39;s account there is a point at which all 3 of them are in the Mercedes. So where did the Honda come from? Did they go back to wherever they left it to get it??? Makes 0 sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah - thinking the same thing. But its not the only dumb thing they did that night if they did go back. But this is my take from reading the story (mind you I&#39;m not familiar with the neighbourhood so I don&#39;t know if this is logical):</p>

<p>Dzhokhar was driving the sedan that was following Tamerlan and Danny.  After transferring whatever they were transferring to the trunk, they left the sedan there (in Watertown?) and did whatever they did.  They went back to the sedan once with Danny and finally again when there was a shootout.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>sounds super efficient- these guys were masterminds. Carjack a Benz because you had to get to NY to bust out some terror in time square. Not worrying about drawing attention to yourself after you just bombed the marathon. An idiot could have planned this out better on a piece of toilet paper sitting on the bog for 5 minutes and still would have had a better chance of getting away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way they write this makes me feel like they&#39;re implying the police said only one car was at the scene: <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/27/17944133-police-eye-second-car-in-watertown-shootout-after-boston-bombing?lite">http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/27/17944133-police-eye-second-car-in-watertown-shootout-after-boston-bombing?lite</a>
But then again it strikes me as weird they say eye witnesses placed the Honda behind the Mercedes. In those photos of the shoot out the Mercedes was behind the Honda, and the Mercedes is how they took cover.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you asking whether they had two cars or <em>why</em> they had two cars (in other words, why did they go back to the sedan when they had transferred everything)?  If you read the report, they went back once with Danny (to pick up a cd?). After Danny escaped, its safe to assume they went back again.  Why they did that?
