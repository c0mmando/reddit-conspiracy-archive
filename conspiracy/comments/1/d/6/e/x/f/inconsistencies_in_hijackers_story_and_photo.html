<p>Tamerlan is in the background... I assume this was taken first and Tamerlan is asking Dzhokhar to hurry up. I&#39;m assuming the car owner had fled by then so they probably knew they had to leave. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There can be dozens of ways these pictures can match the story.</p>

<p>But what’s more inconsistent is the timeline. </p>

<p>Here: 
“<em>The 26-year-old Chinese entrepreneur had just pulled his new Mercedes to the curb on Brighton Avenue ….. It was nearly 11 p.m. last Thursday.</em>”
“<em>Danny described 90 harrowing minutes</em>” . Those “90 minutes” were repeated like 5 times on CNN interview with the reporter.</p>

<p>So, did he escape at 12.30 am?</p>

<p>Now look at the scanner:
“<em>1041pm EST, (i.e., 1141 pm EDT): Age on suspects; low to mid twenties. Possible make on vehicle related to MIT Shooting: 2013 Black Mercedes ML350W; reportedly en route to</em>”</p>

<p>So how do the “90 minutes” squeeze in?</p>

<p>Was it 10pm really when Danny stopped at Brighton Ave?</p>

<p>But then how does it jive with “*investigation of the death of MIT Police Officer Sean Collier…</p>

<p>…would like to talk to anyone who happened to be near the corner of Main and Vassar Streets on the night of Thursday, April 18, between about 10:00 PM and 10:30 PM*”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The stamp on the photo at the ATM is 11:18, they said the MIT officer was killed at around 10 or 10:30? So I guess it makes sense that they picked him up around 11, but yeah... what time did they go to the store? And why the heck were they driving around wasting gas for 90 minutes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw ATM photo with both 11.18 pm and 12.18am stamps. I bet the former is correct. So he escaped at around 11.30pm I think, and his whole ordeal in reality took about 45 min, that&#39;s the only explanation i can see.
But then another strange thing why it was so difficult to find open gas station before midnight?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FOR ME, IT WAS THE FLAGS THAT ALL MY DOUBT STARTED WITH. (&lt;-Not false flag) 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=046MuD1pYJg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=046MuD1pYJg</a></p>

<p>1-Flags start blowing just before explosion 1. They&#39;ll see it starting with the last couple of flags opposite the direction of the camera view.
&quot;Ok, so what?&quot; What direction do the flags seem to be blowing from? The direction of the finish line. &quot;Ok, and?&quot; It keeps going and seems to be as if a wind (fan?) Is blowing toward where the runners are coming from and swiftly turning outward and pointing at the street. &quot;Ok, there was just an explosion&quot; A. It starts with two flags furiously blowing BEFORE the blast, direction slowly turning, as it moves down the street, kind of like an oscillating fan. Then the blast happens and flag in front blow straight out , again, so what? B. And they keep blowing, and blowing, and blowing! Odd did the blast magically just keep happening? Strange!
OK SO WHAT, WEIRD WIND, IT HAPPENS: keep rolling the tape!
Watch blast 2. Doesn&#39;t it seem much bigger, faster, and to have more and much heavier+darker smoke? Ok, maybe it was bigger than the other one, or its just the perspective? Maybe? ;)
Enter cop: &quot; they fucked up over there&quot; or &quot;they&#39;re fucked up over there&quot; not positive which, but IMO it&#39;s the former. Either way it could mean anything, but to me it seems he knew something was happening, and went terribly wrong. (Note how the law e enforcement doesn&#39;t jump right to the victims, almost as if in shock, but again they could just be in wtf just happened mode aka &quot;shock&quot;)
No clear footage of the victims. Doesn&#39;t mean that they aren&#39;t there or they&#39;re trying to hide anything. Also note that the Narrator seems level headed at first, but then seems to realize something&#39;s wrong. Again could be &quot;wtf mode&quot; because it didn&#39;t sink in a first.
WINDOWS. Now, is it just me, or would you expect an explosion OUTSIDE of a window to blow the glass in the opposite direction of said explosion?
NOT FROM VIDEO: I haven&#39;t noticed ANY random crowd pics with ANY of the said first explosion victims, further more there are these pics that show it from a distance after what looks like most people have cleared the area, but people are just arriving to help, as if everyone cleared out lightning fast, which they did quickly, but I saw the size of that crowd, did you? Then there&#39;s the famous interview with the track coach, who said it was a drill. Maybe he was confused?
<a href="http://www.abc12.com/story/22008030/mi-track-coach-reflects-on-boston-marathon">http://www.abc12.com/story/22008030/mi-track-coach-reflects-on-boston-marathon</a></p>

<p>And the tv interview where the commissioner accidentally says actors then corrects to suspects. Could be a Possible slip or just pure exhaustion getting the better of him. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceiJjqFufIU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceiJjqFufIU</a>
And the &quot;fiery exchange&quot; in congress.
<a href="http://m.youtube.com/index?&amp;amp;desktop_uri=%2F#/watch?v=L78UNg14yVU">http://m.youtube.com/index?&amp;amp;desktop_uri=%2F#/watch?v=L78UNg14yVU</a></p>

<p>YES those Saudi nationals. In Boston, never left boston ehen supposed to be in Ohio? And we&#39;re also told he is family of an important official there. So wouldn&#39;t SOMEONE have known where he was? It&#39;s highly unlikely us security didn&#39;t notice this highly important student showing up for his school? One word: oil. Haven&#39;t we had multiple major pipeline/oil spills?? In the last couple of years. Aren&#39;t we demanding all of our US oil companies be fined to high heaven and much stricter guidelines to follow? Not that they shouldn&#39;t, but I believe at this someone up there on capitol hill thinks our relationship with the Saudi&#39;s is much more important than we may realize. Then the MSM has changed their many &quot;unnamed official&quot; reports that are CONSTANTLY changing, so much so American s are fighting almost aimlessly to validate what they are being told.
I BELIEVE: that the drill did happen. Something went wrong, and people panicking, but the show must go on! We&#39;ll play this as out. MSM can sell anything right? 1st bomb drill, second bomb real with very real fatalities and injuries. The govt. Knows it the Saudi&#39;s did it and happened upon the perfecting pasties with Putin&#39;s warning about the tsarneav brothers. Local law was not in on it IMO, THEY were also patsies..
I could point out every discrepancy and conspiracy I do and disbelieve in, but this is exhausting!!!! I DO KNOW THIS: I am no professional, and do not know really any facts to be 100%, but I do believe very strongly that the things going to confuse everyone are not by any chance a coincidence. I would love to believe our govt. Would never frame innocent Americans, naturalized or not, but sadly, it&#39;s looking more like it each day. Where do the facts add up? Someone who knows 100% &quot;without a shadow of and doubt&quot;, please, please please, PROVE ME WRONG!!!!!! Also president had an abrupt unscheduled meeting with Saudi Arabian president. &quot;HEY BRO..&quot;    edit: links</p>
