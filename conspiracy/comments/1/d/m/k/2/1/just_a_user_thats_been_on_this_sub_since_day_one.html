       I've been on this sub years. It's always attracted a crazy element. But you just dig down through the bucket of shit and find the odd diamond of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a hotch potch. The crazy element will comment, you may think them shills. I doubt as many 'shills' exist as you think do and I doubt they are stupid enough to be the ones you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should just follow your own truth, take this place as a source of information and never believe anything, until you have proven it to yourself and not just by what another guy says.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a truth, we are all a little bit crazy in our own way. We like to believe in things to displace or project ourselves. But really you cannot take anything as a truth until you've experienced it. The world is full of lies and trickery.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have opinions, it seems this place would like to be, 'tow the consensus line' or get out. Because if anyone speaks against an established 'theory', then they must be paid shills. That's so stupid I can't even think of a word for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a forum people, a place to discuss ideas. It's meant to be a free place, for free thinkers. Not a paranoid bureaucratic circle jerk.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just my thought's watching the continuous BS on this sub. If you don't like it, down vote it and ffs before you upvote, at least read/view the item and then hopefully make your own choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm honest, 9000sins should step down. He is without a doubt the centre of every controversy this sub has ever seen. Sorry 9000, but it's a fact and I'm sick of the drama. It's a forum of discussion, not a place of controls.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a tough one 9000, giving up what you love in order to help it grow.

       Also, something I'm slowly learning: don't try to convince people of anything. I have to bite my knuckles to stop myself discussing stuff about 9/11 at this stage, because if they've come this far, they're either willing to go further (I'll still recommend reading material and documentaries), or they're just going to dispute everything you say anyway, so it's just not worth it. I don't mind passing views on certain subjects, but I'm just some dude on the Internet, and the best any of us should hope for is that we might make someone want to figure things out for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in the same frame of mind about 'shills'; I think it's a horribly overused term here. "Oh, you're just a crazy conspiracy theorist." "Well, you're just some government shill." - it's the same thing in reverse. I'm not saying they don't exist, just that there are also trolls, people who are arrogantly close-minded, and, believe it or not, people who just have differing theories and opinions on certain subjects. They're not all the same, just like not all 'conspiracy theorists' believe we never went to the moon or that the Jews are the root of everything terrible ever.

       I agree on arguing 9/11 with anyone on here. It just goes nowhere. Rarely has someone even looked at the evidence linked be it a website/video or whatever. They aren't interested in seeing anything that co tradicts their viewpoint. I believe anyone that believes 9/11 was an inside job has read and watched everything they could find on 9/11. They have researched it where as those that support the official story base most of their argument on, Truthers are just nuts so their theory is nuts and I don't need to go any farther than that.

       Agreed. Most of the time, the only source that is quoted is something like 'debunking911.com' - one read of that and they've got it all solved; nothing to see here. Of course, those of us who actually want something resembling the truth need a little more than that. It's 5 years since I started looking at that subject, and I'm still reading about it - although at this stage I'm looking at the whole situation and motive on a global scale, which I'd say is actually more important than the event itself, but it's pretty heavy going haha.

       Someone will be able to elaborate more I hope, as my laptop is currently out of action, so I'm doing this off my phone and linking things is difficult haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'd start with the events of the actual day and the events following it (Afghanistan, Iraq,etc)
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       work backwards. At the most basic level, I'd be looking at 'Architects and Engineers for 9/11 truth'. Their website has a lot of different resources, but they have a documentary on YouTube that is definitely worth watching. Then try to find as many compilations of eyewitness accounts as possible - Barry Jennings would be a good place to start on that one.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also another website that I can't actually remember the name of (hopefully someone will chime in) but it has a good summary of things surrounding that day - the part that stood out to me is the section on the Pentagon, as they dispute a commonly held belief that no plane hit it. I was actually in that camp, and that website and various other sources actually changed my mind about it. Oh, and specifically looking at the training exercises that were happening on and around 9/11 involving NORAD is very much worth paying a little extra attention to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another interesting thing to google, would be 'Lucky Larry'. And since you asked for an opinion... I think this is where Isreal/Mossad may have had the most involvement: the demolition of the buildings. That's just conjecture on my part, but it's what makes most sense to me, given the evidence. There is another documentary on YouTube about Isreal's involvement, but again, I can't remember the name of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm doing now, is reading Mike Ruppert's book 'Crossing the Rubicon'. I wouldn't get into this for a while, as it's extremely detailed and deep, and I'm having a hard time keeping up even after years of looking into things. It is
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       worth reading however, because it's about motives and international connections, rather than things as raw as engineering and physics, which will always be disputed. My point being, you don't need to even
       <em>
        look
       </em>
       at why the buildings collapsed to know that this was an inside job; it just so happens that's a good (and very interesting) place to start, and is just yet more compelling evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that gets you off on the right foot, and I hope someone could be a champ and provide some links to the things I've mentioned.

       Let me know what you think about it. I've recommended it to the non-truthers and before they even listen to it, they point out that Kevin Ryan was fired from Underwriters Laboratory because he spoke out against his employer and the NIST report for whom UL helped prepare their report for the 9/11 Commission because he felt that the report was deceptive. As if that's a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it an amazing coincidence (among a mountain of coincidences on 9/11) that L. Paul Bremmer's Offices were in the WTC right where the plane hit? And he had a meeting that day but instead of going in to work, he somehow ended up on one of the news channels stating that Bin Laden was behind the attacks. The day wasn't even over but he had already figured out who was responsible. And then he ended up being put in charge of Iraq and he did such a fantastic job there (including "misplacing" billions of dollars shipped to Iraq on pallets to pay off Iraqi Insurgents and Contractors) they gave him a medal and then put him in charge over at the World Bank. People wonder how the Government can silence and maintain secrecy with so many people that it would take to pull off 9/11. Cash works pretty good.

       Listened to the interview a couple of days ago; interesting stuff. I don't think we'll ever know 100% how it was accomplished, but connecting the people with the motives is the best way to get a decent picture of the situation, without a doubt.

       It seems to me that there is enough evidence at this point to warrant a new investigation. There have been several informal investigations that have found that the official story is bullshit. One in Japan and recently, one in Canada. The Government has never proved their case and considering their actions following 9/11, they should have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, who was responsible and how they did it because all of the evidence points to Government involvement on many levels. Even training and housing the terrorists that were supposedly on the planes. They don't even deny that more than half of the terrorists lived in and around several military bases. Mohammed Atta's Girlfriend said he was on the base regularly.

       But unless someone in the inner circle decides to come clean. I doubt we will ever find out the truth.

       It's way too big for that to happen unfortunately. If we're lucky we might get some deathbed confessions from these people, but by that point I doubt much will come of it.

       The only one that's on YouTube is AE911. There should be a full video of about 2 hours long I think. Crossing the Rubicon can be found on amazon, and the Larry Silverstein thing is a text-based website. I'll have a quick look and see if I can find the proper links.

       Can't find the Larry Silverstein link I have saved, but there should be plenty of articles on google.

       Something else I forgot to mention - look up the insider trading and spike in put-options on the stock market prior to 9/11.

       Except that this applies to almost everyone. You aren't a special snowflake with secret knowledge fighting against the sheeple. Conspiracy lunatics, legitimate conspiracy theorists, and normal people all tend not to want to see contradictory evidence.

      <hr/>
      <p>
       "Rarely has someone even looked at the evidence linked"
      </p>
      <p>
       When conspiracy theorists are arguing with someone, far too often it tends to devolve into them just linking videos and websites, instead of articulating, defending, and explaining their own argument. If you can't defend your position and have to resort to linking videos to explain your argument for you, you either don't understand the issue, can't defend yourself, or are just being lazy.

       And come up with multiple different 'theories' of what happened. Reading websites and watching youtube videos aren't quality research. Notice how some people who are against vaccines have 'researched' the issue and concluded that vaccines cause autism.

       I believed the official story initially and it wasn't a video that made me suspicious. It was the Bush Administrations actions following 9/11 that made me suspicious. At first I thought that they just fucked up. They had all the warnings and did nothing. Bush seemed to be on permanent vacation. Then I saw David Ray Griffin's talk and that's what made me go back and look at everything again. I started by watching the news reports again, which I hadn't watched since 9/11 and watching the towers come down just seemed pretty obvious that the planes did not bring down those buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then I saw Loose Change and although I felt that much of what they presented was closer to the truth than the official story, I still took the time to read more before I just accepted their version of events. Architects for 9/11 Truth were the ones that convinced me that the WTC was brought down by explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also very involved with politics and read quite a bit about it so just reading up on the Bush Administration and following their actions before, during and after 9/11 gave me a pretty clear picture of their motives and what they had to gain from 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike most people on both sides, I am perfectly willing to look at all sides of the picture. Initially I thought that a cruise missile hit the Pentagon but the more I look at it, I think that it was in fact the plane that hit the building. I've also had the discussion with someone on here about Larry Silverstein and his comment about pulling it. You mention strawman arguments and that is certainly one of them. He could not have given the order to pull it because it would be impossible for anyone to have wired that building up on 9/11 and he was talking to the fire captain, who did not have the equipment or resources to bring down the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have argued with plenty of people on this subject and have found most of them stick to the official story, avoid arguing specific facts and usually resort to name calling when they start losing the argument.

       " the WTC was brought down by explosives."
      </p>
      <p>
       What gets me is that people think that explosives are necessary to bring the tower down, when you have planes crashing into the tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not just rig explosives, detonate them, and blame it on terrorists? Why bother with planes? Why all the extra stuff that could go wrong?

       "The official investigation concluded that mr. terrorist blew himself and other explosives up on floor x, causing a collapse."

       Could you please tell me, in your own words, why you think the tower could not have collapsed from the impact of the plane alone? IE why are explosives necessary?

       He said recently he was only there to assist with CSS and would be de-modding as soon as that was done. That conspiracyx is not his pet project and he doesn't want to be involved in it beyond the technical help he was providing temporarily. Whether this is true or not, I couldn't say. But it is the explanation that I saw the other day.

        People have opinions, it seems this place would like to be, 'tow the consensus line' or get out. Because if anyone speaks against an established 'theory', then they must be paid shills. That's so stupid I can't even think of a word for it.

       My take on it is that some "conspiracy theories" are so blatantly obvious that after a while it gets annoying as fuck listening to someone say "it could just be x,y or z."

       Actually theres mounds of evidence. Numerous scientists have analyzed the debris and found evidence of nano thermite. In addition, firefighters reported explosions in the basements of the towers before the 2nd plane hit the 2nd tower.

       WTC7 fell in one piece at free fall acceleration.
      </p>
      <p>
       demolitions blow out the core columns first, and in the case of WTC1 and 2, there appears to be a cascade of violent explosions, destroying the building on the way down.   It's not a typical demolition of course these buildings are so tall, if they toppled a collapse would not prefer to go through the path of

       It was not explained. It was theorized. The article starts off with the words "possibly" and "perhaps". There were no definitive statements that this is how the building fell. Every other building in the history of steel framed skyscrapers were gutted by fire yet they didn't fall. There are no pictures or video of "massive" damage or fires that would have caused that building to collapse and the excuses used to explain the collapse of the other two buildings, jet fuel and planes, were not present in WTC7. 7 contained large fuel tanks to power generators for Guiliani's Emergency Bunker. These tanks were still full of the fuel, a lot of it spilled out after the collapse and had to be cleaned up so it was not used to fuel the fires and the only thing in the building to act as fuel for the fires was office furniture, which does no burn hot enough to melt steel and cause the collapse of the building. One steel beam can not cause the collapse of the entire building. You'd have to be a complete fool to believe that. There are thousands of steel beams in that building and if just one of them failed, you might have a collapse in one section of the building but the whole structure is not going to collapse. The building is designed to not do that.

       Theatrics. Mind Control. How would they explain how these terrorists got access to 3 highly secure buildings to plants these explosives? They needed to show an event that would polarize a nation of people to turn over their rights and permission for them to start wars and enact agendas. They needed people to be afraid.

       They claim that the failure of one steel beam can bring down an entire building. They spent most of that time, trying to play word soup with Larry Silversteins use of the word pull to bring the building down. Personally, I don't believe that Larry gave the order to pull the building so the entire controversy around it is just a straw man argument. It would be impossible for them to rig that building up to implode in one day, while it was on fire and fire fighters don't have the skills or resources to do it.

       You aren't instilling much confidence if you fail to read my comment. I said that Larry was not in on it. The debunking 9/11 page you sent me to used most of the page debunking the commonly held belief that Larry gave the order to "pull it" when talking to the fire captain. I said that it would have been impossible for them to wire that building with explosives in one day, while the building was on fire, and implode the building. There are only a few companies in the US, along with the Military, capable of bringing that building down in the manner in which it was destroyed. Listen to the interview I linked to hear who was in on it.

       Just saying--some of the main supporters of the truth movements are the firefighters who eyewitnessed shit that didn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could see why the top portion might crumble and smash into the bottom--but I don't understand how you seriously believe that a larger, more stable portion of thick steel grid will topple down
       <strong>
        straight
       </strong>
       to the ground because steel floors fell on it from the top?
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, how the fuck was this not a messier collapse if it was "weakening from impact and heat". Bullshit.

       Firefighters can explain the floors that were contained and their belief that they were making progress.

       They can't explain several explosions after the planes struck.

       "First, Richard Gage is an architect. Not a structural engineer. According to his December 2007 newsletter:
"Tell your friends, family and colleagues the truth that you know — particularly the structural engineers!" (bolding by Richard Gage himself). Sounds like a desparate plea for their support.
      </p>
      <p>
       "There indeed is a shortage of actual structural engineers who claim WTC was demolished with explosives. This page lists well over 1000 certified structural engineers, certified by the Structural Engineering Certification Board (SECB) of The National Council of Structural Engineers Association. And that is just certified structural engineers in United States, Puerto Rico &amp; Virgin Islands, certified in 2005 or later. Consider, how many thousands of more of structural engineers there are worldwide. And how many of these over 1000 certified structural engineers question the events of 9/11? You guessed it, not a single one."

       "Architects and Engineers are trained to design buildings that function well and withstand potentially destructive forces. However, the 3 high-rise buildings at the World Trade Center which ‘collapsed’ on 9/11 (the Twin Towers plus WTC Building #7) presented us with a body of evidence (i.e.controlled demolition) that was clearly outside the scope of our training and experience." - Richard Gage
Richard Gage himself admits, that controlled demolition is clearly outside the scope of his expertise. Yet, all his evidence consists of arguments trying to prove the demolition of the 3 towers.

       facts have a well-known liberal bias.   In any case, and the thing that each and everyone of you that I've had the great pleasure of interacting with always fails to understand, I have no interest in the "government's story".  My interest is only on how the buildings fell.   Not who caused them to fall.   And, the only peer reviewed studies that exist on the subject all support airplane damage and fire based collapse.  There is not a single peer reviewed article against this.   Not a single one.  Zero.  Less than 1.

       Realize that I needn't find anything for you because you are a pompous, condescending, snotty waste of my time and any actual structural engineer would immediately lose credibility for disagreeing with you. Good luck waking from your obsession with the "official story".

       there was one outside of amsterdam several years ago.  the buildings didn't do anything like this.   I don't think planes were the cause of these explosions.

       The layperson, when stepping back to actually think
       <strong>
        critically
       </strong>
       instead of
       <strong>
        culturally
       </strong>
       , will realize "oh my word, if that building fell for the reasons they said it did, it wouldn't have looked so contrived, neat, quick, and organized. Again steel bends when weakened, compromised, or heated--if it actually snaps from bending (which it would probably just twist), it wouldn't do it floor by fucking floor. You don't have to be a professional to realize that we are listening to the wrong "professionals" on the official story. w/e as someone said at the start of this, ironically--not even worth my time.

       Steel twists when compromised by heat--it does not snap, floor by floor, in a synchronized 10 second fall. You can use all the backup sources you want, I will talk to a few of my engineer friends. Get real.

       NIST's entire investigation was not an investigation at all. They already had their reason for the collapse. Planes, fuel and fire and they tailored the investigation based on that. 3 different buildings, all damaged differently, all suffered the same result. Total collapse, straight down, explosively pulverized to dust. There was no pancake because there was nothing to crush the floors below. The building literally exploded in mid air. Fire damage would not cause explosion because there was nothing in those buildings to explode. They're standard office buildings, not fertilizer factories.
      </p>
      <p>
       One building was struck dead center. One struck on the corner and one was not hit at all by a plane yet all three collapsed the same. That is simply impossible. Fire burns asymmetrically. WTC 2 Collapsed first even though it was struck second and because ot was clipped on the corner, most of the explosion occurred outside of the building and it should have toppled over in the direction of the damaged corner but it went straight down like the others. Nano thermite was found in dust samples all over the place. This is a highly specialized chemical explosive and would not be found anywhere near those buildings. It was manufactured in a US Military Lab.
      </p>
      <p>
       The steel beams were sheared off diagonally, which is how controlled demolition is done, so that the beam above it, slides over, allowing it to collapse. And all of the steel from the buildings was immediately removed from the crime scene and shipped overseas to be melted down. Underneath all 3 buildings was molten iron that burned for weeks after 9/11. This is a by product of nano thermite, not typical office debris fires.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there's building 7.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no doubt that this was a controlled demolition.

       I am consistent. They had to weaken the core columns and structural integrity of the building. Classic controlled demolition, all buildings in controlled demolition fall from the top down straight into their footprint.

       Of course an actual "reputable" journal is never going to go against the status quo of the official 9/11 story much the same way cnn or msnbc will always parrot washington's agenda as well. Or did you think otherwise?

       Why assume "establishment journal?" These are the same academic journals that those "tens of thousands of architects and engineers" would
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       be published in as a result of their post grad research.

      <p>
       You can't try to lean upon authority by saying, "literally tens of thousands of architects and engineers" and then turn around and dismiss that exact same authority.

       Towers 1 &amp; 2 don't resemble controlled demolitions (CD) in the first place.  Their respective collapses share none of the traits of CD.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) CD collapses go from the bottom upwards - Towers 1 &amp; 2 went from the top downwards
      </p>
      <p>
       2) No audible repeated and successive explosions prior to the collapse.  The explosions from CDs travel for 3-4 miles yet no mic'd cameras picked up any explosions.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) CDs are designed so the exterior walls fall in on themselves - the towers ejected their exterior 'walls' outwards and heavily damaged surrounding buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point you can safely rule out controlled demolition as a hypothesis.

       The demolition of these buildings had to be tailored to match the airplane impacts. It was not a standard controlled demolition. This would be a "Hollywood Style" demolition because it had to appear that that collapse occurred due to the impact of the planes. However they did blow the basement columns first as evidenced by witness testimony and video of the firefighters entering the lobby of the building. The windows were already blown out and large slabs of marble had been blown off the walls. There is plenty of video with the sounds of explosions prior to the collapse as well as smoke and dust plumes rising up from the basements of the buildings.
      </p>

       Barry Jennings was inside Building 7 and as he was trying to evacuate the building with another man, he was in the stairwell on floor 8 when an explosion collapsed the stairs and he was forced to go back up into the building and find another way out. This explosion happened prior to any of the building collapses. When he was finally rescued by firefighters, as he was exiting the building through the lobby, he saw that the lobby, which was in perfect condition when he entered the building, was completely demolished and he had to step over dead bodies to get to the exit.

       this is not a typical CD.  how many such buildings this tall have been demolished by CD in history?   There is no reason to assume that only top down demolition occured.  Buildings this tall could require both internal column (bottom up) CD and top down CD.  This might be necessary to stop the buildings from simply toppling a bit, as you'd expect.  The complete demolition of the buildings is clearly explosive, and violent.

       Many first responders report the explosions, there are many witnesses of explosions.  that explosives weren't tested for because nobody heard any is bullshit.

       These are tall buildings, besides, nobody posits that they are standard CD jobs.   WTC7 on the other hand...

       You rule out what you like.  If you can't look at this critically and come to the conclusion that explosive demolition was the cause, then I'm at a loss.

       1) Your point? Just because it's not typical does not rule out anything.
2) Nano thermite (confirmed by multiple researchers doing wtc dust analysis), obviously ACTUAL explosives would be too obvious as they are quite loud you are correct.
3) Nano thermite sure is messy, not as clean as a CLASSIC cd.

       I can say that the theory of gravity has been debunked too.  Doesn't mean that it's true.  Just because you've been upvoted means nothing.  This place has attracted the attention of a lot of special interest groups.  That in itself is very revealing as are your upvotes.  There's a lot of people that want to rationalize that what they believe is right.

       If you've been here for a while and haven't noticed a huge change...    At one time there wasn't the adversarial atmosphere that's here now.  Before the tard subreddit and before the influx of certain groups with an agenda.  And yes, there are people who want to stop discussion.  This isn't a dedicated conspiracy site.

       There are many theories about 9/11. Many of them contradict each other. Some of them may be correct. Others are obviously not, as they contradict the correct ones.

       I agree wholeheartedly. However, we have reached a consensus already that the "terror attack" of September 11th was orchestrated on behalf of the US government to begin the removal of many of our constitutional rights. This is no longer a theory, this is historically factual. Now, as to
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       they did this, that remains in the theory stage, and will likely remain that way for many years to come.

       I'm not sure what your definition of "consensus" is, but I can assure you, one has not been reached. Maybe within a small group of people categorized by "who agrees with Alex jones 100%" or something off like that, but not within the American public, or even within this sub for that matter. Saying it is historically factual doesn't make it so (well, unless you've got the power to eradicate competing thought... but let's stick a pin in that one for now.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don't think it was orchestrated by or on behalf of the US government. However, I do think that the US government knew fairly certainly that it was going to happen and chose to not act on that information.

       Firstly, I think its unfair that you have lumped 9/11 naysayers into the same category as "Alex Jones listeners", as not all of us listen to or believe anything that nut has to say. As far as my use of the word consensus goes, I think it is appropriate given the sheer number of subscribers this sub, and other alternative news websites have. And the the general opinion among these groups is, yes, 9/11 was a staged false flag terror event.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no denying that many of our constitutional rights as American citizens have been limited or stripped away in a post 9/11 world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I verily appreciate different thoughts on this matter, because through discussion we gain a better understanding of the events that will ultimately lead to uncovering the truth of what really happened, and for what reasons.

       Thanks for saying what I was thinking. The term, "theory", includes some hard data that has already passed close, scientific evaluation. 9/11 has fascinating hypotheticals surrounding it. I'm drawn in, and I'd love to know the undeniable truth about what happened-- and how.

       But 9/11 and the death of Salvadore Allende are not repeatable phenomena which can be tested by the scientific method. Bullet trajectories are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much of scientific theory is, still, speculation. For instance, we know that gravity and electromagnetism exist as forces, but what's the theory behind why they happen? Theories about
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       are speculative, and some such theories escape scientific explanation. Gravity is a force, but what animates that force? We can hypothesize about it. At that level, we are theoretical physicists, speculation about gravity but not testing what we know is true about it.

       The thing is, theories in science have to go through rigorous testings, experiments, evaluations and maybe most importantly peer reviews from experts in the same field. For every scientist that tries to prove something, there are thousands who try to prove him wrong. This all makes scientific theories robust and highly reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       With conspiracy theories, most of the time it's the exact opposite. The nature of conspiracy theories are highly speculative and the goal posts won't stand still. Theories still exist, even after being thoroughly debunked point by point. Conspiracy theorists latch on to evidence that would help their case and disregard any evidence that would disprove it. This is something you can't do in science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think that the theory of Jeff Bauman being an actor because there wasn't "enough blood" and he didn't seem to "act appropriately" carries the same weight as lets say E=mc²?

       They are certainly different kinds of theories. Both kinds are intended to solve mysteries but employ different mental processes and are satisfied by different conditions/ proof. Some conspiracy theorists casually dismiss evidence which goes against (but not necessarily disproves) their theories. Others try to incorporate that contrary information as plausible alternatives ("Either Joe did, or Bob did it, unless Joe and Bob conspired to blame Lee for it.")
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theories are speculations about hidden or unknown facts which explain events in the past. Because the underlying facts are not fully known and are not testable, they lack reliability and so does the overall theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientific theories/ speculation accumulate and test what is observable of nature. Sometimes conclusively. (For instance, we don't know exactly when and why robin's beaks evolved differently than cardinals beaks but we can speculate as to why that happened).
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracies theories don't really intend to be conclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to Jeff Bauman: well, lots of conspiracy theories are utterly irresponsible. On the other hand, some have employed basic physics, projectile motion, and military theory/ tactics (crossfire) to prove the their JFK theory as scientifically as is possible.

       The Bauman blood theory is one of those frustratingly cockamamie theories I hate.

       Neither are "conspiracy theories" in the same fashion. There is no difference in the use of the word theory between theory of gravity and theory of conspiracy.

       You have actually heard of both, although not by those terms. For example, you could use Newton's law of universal gravitation to calculate the acceleration of a ball towards the ground, and to explain why it did that you would use gravitational theory.

       This sounds like how religious people respond to criticism of the Bible:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Actually believing in what scientists say is more of the crazy religious belief. The Bible is based on facts, the scientists just accept evolution on faith."
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is that it isn't just the "government story." At this point experiments have been conducted, research done, ran through peer review, published in academic journals, etc. All confirming the simple story of hijackers and airplanes. None have confirmed any conspiracy theory (though the conspiracy theories, such as controlled demolitions, have been examined).
      </p>
      <p>
       So it has moved beyond the realm of the media, news and the "official story." We know from a scientific POV that everything can, and has been, explained simply by airplanes and jet fuel.

       I don't think I've ever heard a religious person say this. I think almost everyone that I speak with accepts their beliefs on faith. Sorta like how Obama supporters believe he will give them healthcare for free, they accept it on faith and never take their god's name in vain.

       Is that what you believe about the governments 9/11 report? I think this kinda proves my point. I think this statement proves you haven't really spent much time on the subject, but rather you have assumed that if it's popularly accepted and  from the government, then it must be true.

       The 9/11 report was a governmental inquiry, not academic research that was reviewed and published. That was my point when I said that the 9/11 report was not academic research - simply that it did not go through a process of peer review, it wasn't vetted and published like we require with academic research. This doesn't make it inherently right or wrong, it's just what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, there is quite a bit of academic research on the 9/11 towers - the physics, the health implications for first responders, the impact on survivors and witnesses, etc. None of it asserts that there were explosives involved.

       <p>
        Previous analysis of progressive collapse showed that gravity alone suffices to explain the overall collapse of the World Trade Center Towers. However, it remains to be determined whether the recent allegations of controlled demolition have any scientific merit. The present analysis proves that they do not.

       So the research into the health implications, using peer reviewed papers, proves there was no explosives? Can you link me to a paper with such a conclusion please.

      <p>
       Also, speaking of first responders, their personal accounts contradict your position about no explosives. They have related hearing explosions prior to any collapse, especially surrounding the lobby.

       I'm just going to ask if you read the articles, because most of your questions or objections are actually covered in the publications. For example, thermite found in the debris as the result of an oxidative reaction does not indicate that thermite was used as an explosive material. The research I cited published in the Journal of Engineering Mechanics went into quite a bit of depth debunking various claims of explosives.

       really?  The idea that 4 sets of hijackers took over 4 airplanes in a unique and unprecedented fashion and then crashed them is unbelievable?
      </p>
      <p>
       That 2 buildings hit at speed with fully fueled commercial aircraft and then burned and collapsed is less believable then the notion that they were first wired with explosives and then hit with planes?  That the charges and wiring survived the destruction and fire?

       That WTC7 was also wired with charges and then left to burn for 7 hours before the charges were detonated?  What was the excuse for that going to be if no part of the WTC1/2 collapse hadn't hit WTC7 and set off the fire?

       My contention is that the jets destroying outer and core support plus the fire further weakening the floor supports initiated the collapse.

       Clearly the fires were intentionally set. So lets say they were started with a thermite based ignition system. There was thermite found at the scene, so this could be consistent.

       Like I have said, there are multiple facets to 9/11. If you've never heard about the entire conspiracy surrounding 9/11, then  I would suggesting hanging out here more.

       Will I allow that the govt was involved?  Sure.  They clearly ignored intelligence about crashing air planes.  Does that count?  What if the govt enabled the hijackers?  I can't say with certainty that didn't happen.  But I do feel very strongly that all the evidence indicates the buildings fell exactly the way the "mainstream" explanation says they did.

       Naturally you feel that way. If you felt that the government was working against your best interests, then you'd go into a panic. Thats cognitive dissonance.

       Theory has two meanings in this case. I think most people use it to be "a wild guess". A theory though can more accurately be said to be a contruct of the most plausible explanation. So the theory of gravity doesn't mean that it's a wild guess, just that it's a compilation of everything we know about gravity to date. In the same way, a conspiracy theory is just a compilation of the evidence to date.

       Not quite.  In the scientific context "theory" is an explanation of natural phenomena that has been observed, and is independently verifiable through repeatable experimentation that adheres to the scientific method.  It also should lead to predictive models that are falsifiable in order to demonstrate its reliability in being 'correct'.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Theory" in the conspiracist usage is more akin to 'speculation' or 'conjecture', relying heavily on 'inductive reasoning' whereas 'science' relies on the more reliable 'deductive reasoning'.  At most, conspiracy theories reach the level of 'untested/unproven hypothesis' but many don't because they're not in any way falsifiable.

       Gravity is measurable but we can still theorize about it's causation and have no useful measure, prediction, repeatable experiments, etc. Is it because of ions? Or is it because of electromagnetism? (presenting another problem there) Or are all the earth's protons attracting all of my electrons? Or is it gravitons?

       I disagree. Conspiracy theories (e.g. 9/11) are not merely inductive. I agree that some are, but not all. Staying with 9/11, the government story was inductive actually. They started with the premise that only the airplanes and terrorists were the factors and wrote a report detailing that initial starting point (i.e. inductive). The conspiracy theories examined all the angles and over time have narrowed down to a few credible possibilities (i.e. deductive).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what you're doing is assuming that the government is always right and doesn't make bad decisions. we think that deduction is better than induction, but the way things played out, at least for 9/11, the conspiracy theory is more refined and scientific in it's approach than the governments.

       I'm sorry but "you should just follow your own truth" implies that you can have your own truth.  You cannot.  You can have your own opinions and theories, but you cannot have your own truth.  Part of the problem with this place is remembering this concept.

       Most people generally assume a normal operation of physics and causality, where evidence is usually required for a statement or argument to be given legitimate consideration as truth.

       I'd much rather see evidence of a conspiracy that threatens to harm me and then KNOW it's out there so i can defend against it, rather than be told "I don't need to prove it to you because I'm following my truth" :P

       Distilling some concepts from this submission:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The subreddit has crazy stuff, but there is still good content here if you can filter out the other stuff.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         shills might exist but they aren't as prevalent as the people screaming "shill" think they are.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Just because someone doesn't agree with the popular theories doesn't mean they are a shill.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Exercise critical thinking and evaluate information here as critically as you would anywhere else.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>

         9000sins should step down as he is the centre of every controversy on this subreddit.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I'd like to add that beyond the issue of "shills" we do have people trolling. And trolls can pose both as people who oppose the community, or extreme parodies of the community. They create conflict and drama without advancing the purpose of encouraging sharing of information and critical thinking. Normal people can cause the same effects, getting hyper-emotional and dramatic - that's why trolling works so well because it's indistinguishable from a real person when done well. The point I'd like to offer is that we need to stay away from personality-oriented conflicts. Don't engage in them - AND don't let those sorts of arguments scare you away from participating in discussions about the actual content.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter whether it's a troll or shill or a normal person, we should be attentive to
       <em>
        behaviors
       </em>
       that help and
       <em>
        behaviors
       </em>
       that disrupt, and know how to continue allowing the discussion area serve it's function as a place to share and discover ideas and perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be nice if moderators actively encouraged this without necessarily banning people without warnings.

       re: 9000sins
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know that 9000sins is at the center of
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       controversy here, but then I've been inactive around these parts for a while until the past week or so. I have observed a lot of drama around that user, and a lot of criticism directed toward them. It's hard to know what is trolling and what is legitimate because he regularly deletes his account history, ostensibly to prevent the people who stalk and downvote his posts. In my opinion a moderator should not remove their posts, particularly when they relate to the subreddit being moderated. I don't personally have enough information to say whether his behavior warrants him stepping down or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the positive side, in all the mod mail I have sent to this subreddit, of those that got a response 9000sins was the respondent, and he was professional and helpful. (edit: I was mistaken! enfrozt responded to one of my messages and i had remembered incorrectly. So not as impressive an argument as it had been) I've also observed him respond to the request for the no participation css and implemented it very quickly - that might have been a bit rash without making an official post or soliciting community feedback, but the prompt response to community requests is admirable.

       I agree. It means he is a target, for whatever reason. His character is being assassinated. I have been a long time observer of this sub, and I also monitor
       <a href="/r/uncensorship">
        /r/uncensorship
       </a>
       quite often as well. He does everything he can, and responds quickly to the needs of the subreddit. He also has banned a LOT of really nasty folks from this sub, and it wouldn't surprise me in the least if at least a few of them are driven to extreme lengths to exact their revenge on him in the way of character assassination and downvote brigades. Does it seem strange to anyone else that this all happened right after the marathon bombing when new user traffic was at an all time high? It seems like they were waiting for something major like this to happen to smear him in some of the major subs and to destroy him with downvotes and accusations of rampant censorship, just at a time when about half of the users were brand new to this sub. I'm sure that most of the noobs went along with the anti-9k circlejerk and joined the lynch mobs calling for his resignation. I've only really seen a couple of long time posters here express any doubts about his sincerity or his methods, most others seem to support him. The fact is that he MUST delete his comments to avoid bringing the drama back here for SRDtards to downvote every comment on a particular post. He attracts the drama for doing what he does best, smacking trolls in their fucking heads. The fact that they are even so concerned with trolling him in the first place says a lot. It's like internet gang stalking, and these fuckers fight dirty.

       I'm starting to think that he's doing this shit on purpose.  He makes ridiculous threads with SRS and SRD in the title and then goes on to cry about the 'downvote brigades' that are attacking him, and only him.  He then makes new rules and restrictions on commenting and points to his issues with these other subs as the reasons that the rules are needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       He claims to utterly fail to see how these new 'measures' are hilariously ironic for this sub and what it claims to stand for and then he screams and cries at the people who see the fucking joke for what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       SRS and SRD soon pick up on these threads, being exactly the type of slow arcing pitch that they can knock out of the park and amuse themselves for hours.  Then, as a direct result of his own inexplicable actions 9000sins comes up with more ways of 'combating' his own downvote brigade, by making even more mind boggling rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       He creates his own 'terrorists' and then uses them as an excuse for cracking down on this sub.  From HGT to donbueno to SRS and SRD 9000sins seems to always be under some sort of
       <em>
        personal
       </em>
       attacks that he then turns into his excuse for making progressively illogical rules to crack down on the trolls he creates, invites and seems to all but encourage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not meaning to leave out the
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       crowd but honestly they aren't one of 9000sins bogeymen.  He spends as much time licking boot in their sub as he does making up stupid rules in this one.  He desperately seeks approval from them and only points to them as an issue when people point out that the other problems are his alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Create stupid drama filled issue, implement idiotic draconian response.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a pattern we should all be good at seeing at this point, what 9000sins is doing so directly mimics the 'war on terror' that we would have to be blind not to see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that they are
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       downvote brigades.  They don't care about me, or you, just the stupid shit that 9000sins does all on his own.  They're his fucking problem but his only reaction is to give us more rules and regulations.  They don't pick on him because he's a mod of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       but because his idiocy is comic gold to them.  It's his problem, all self created and he seems utterly unable to deal with that.

        I'm starting to think that he's doing this shit on purpose. No, I was simply trying to clamp down a bit on the trolling that came in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing from zero day accounts, and there was a ton of it. He makes ridiculous threads with SRS and SRD in the title and then goes on to cry about the 'downvote brigades' that are attacking him, and only him. He then makes new rules and restrictions on commenting and points to his issues with these other subs as the reasons that the rules are needed. You got the order of those things reversed. We made the rule first for the reasons stated above. SRD and conspiratard got wind of this new change and sent in the trolls, and possibly even contacted donbueno to step in. He claims to utterly fail to see how these new 'measures' are hilariously ironic for this sub and what it claims to stand for and then he screams and cries at the people who see the fucking joke for what it is. I'm not even going to respond to this. SRS and SRD soon pick up on these threads, being exactly the type of slow arcing pitch that they can knock out of the park and amuse themselves for hours. Then, as a direct result of his own inexplicable actions 9000sins comes up with more ways of 'combating' his own downvote brigade, by making even more mind boggling rules. What other "mind boggling" rules did I come up with after that? I didn't think there were any more. We did begin using no participation mode, which is a pretty widely used used CSS script in heavily contaminated subreddits, and is required for np.reddit.com links to work correctly. He creates his own 'terrorists' and then uses them as an excuse for cracking down on this sub. From HGT to donbueno to SRS and SRD 9000sins seems to always be under some sort of personal attacks that he then turns into his excuse for making progressively illogical rules to crack down on the trolls he creates, invites and seems to all but encourage. Yes I have made quite a few enemies during my time as moderator here. Some people don't like it when you create reasonable rules and then enforce them. Some people feel like taking revenge when you ban them repeatedly. The conspiratard crew hate it when we have a mod team that keeps them at bay. I didn't create them, or any of the other groups that act against us. But they do hate me because I fight back. Not meaning to leave out the
        <a href="/r/conspiratard">
         /r/conspiratard
        </a>
        crowd but honestly they aren't one of 9000sins bogeymen. He spends as much time licking boot in their sub as he does making up stupid rules in this one. He desperately seeks approval from them and only points to them as an issue when people point out that the other problems are his alone. Just becasue I comment there and try to be civil with them does not mean that I spend even a fraction of the time there that I do here. It's frustrating to even try to comment there as I can only post once every ten minutes anyway. I even earned a nice troll flair there about 2 years ago for going toe to toe with herkimer, facehammer and jcm27. Licking boot doesn't fit the bill here. If I wanted to make all of them happy I could just ban tttt0tttt and bumblingmumbling. Create stupid drama filled issue, implement idiotic draconian response. Again, reverse order. It's a pattern we should all be good at seeing at this point, what 9000sins is doing so directly mimics the 'war on terror' that we would have to be blind not to see it. That would seem to be the case if what you said were true. The cause and effect you speak seems to be the opposite. What i see from my perspective is this. this sub has always been actively gamed and trolled. When we took the moderator spots, we had a lot of fixing up to do at first to get this sub off it's feet. Months of zero moderation left the sub infested with more goons than ever at any time I have been here. We went to work dispatching the worst of the worst and implemented a bunch of rules in the process. We found the leaks were the damage was happening and we plugged those leaks. But the trolls evolve with our rules and with our methods. Every time we change course, the find a different attack vector. A few moths back it was pointless meme posts, so we made a rule, no memes. Then it became a flood of nonsense self posts, but the community does a pretty good job of getting rid of those with downvotes. It seems like the new thing is trolling with brand new accounts. Then we came up with the 30 day old account rule to patch this one, but that did not sit well with the trolls. Oh no it didn't. I think we struck a real nerve with this one and this may ultimately filter them into oblivion if properly implemented. The only thing is it requires a ton of trust in the moderation team to ensure that this filter works correctly. We already have worked to put features like
        <a href="/r/uncensorship">
         /r/uncensorship
        </a>
        in place and we have an unprecedented amount of moderator transparency. Maybe if we toned that filter down to just 24 or 36 hours it may work a little better for the community. Not to mention that they are his downvote brigades. They don't care about me, or you, just the stupid shit that 9000sins does all on his own. They're his fucking problem but his only reaction is to give us more rules and regulations. They don't pick on him because he's a mod of
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        but because his idiocy is comic gold to them. It's his problem, all self created and he seems utterly unable to deal with that. Yeah I created some enemies. By doing what is right to preserve this subreddit for those who genuinely use it for the purpose intended. I'm sorry that you feel this way, but ultimately I have no desire to step down. All of this seems pretty orchestrated from my point of view as well, just in different ways. The trolls pounce on any opportunity to make me look bad. Believe what you want but this is the reason I stayed quiet for a few months recently. I want nothing but the best for this sub.

       I think you're going to need to accept that this is going to keep happening so long as you keep responding to it. Deleting the comments and things they link to will just encourage them to continue being attentive to you. It is called subreddit
       <em>
        drama
       </em>
       for a reason - they are seeking entertainment. Not saying all subscribers of that subreddit are the ones posting about you and voting on your stuff, but the ones that are are doing it primarily because they find your reactions amusing. If you go and delete the comments you make that are fairly well-reasoned like the one above, you're just leaving yourself up to more criticism from people here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Please just ignore this stuff, post things like you normally would, and let the drama fall by the wayside. Talk about conspiracies, and respond to discussions about the subreddit and moderation in a professional manner. If you get downvotes, and you will for at least a while,
       <em>
        ignore them
       </em>
       . Stuff I post gets downvoted instantly sometimes too, and yeah it sucks but I'm used to it. They're almost meaningless numbers. I move on, and I maintain a level of professionalism in the subreddits I moderate. If you continue to respond to the drama, it perpetuates it, feeds it, and that gets in the way of what this subreddit is about - discussing conspiracy theories, sharing and discovering information.

       9000SINS is just passionate in what he believes. He also overreacts at times. However he dedicates his time freely to mod the sub, and patience in his growth is needed.

       You will always have drama here and other subreddits, and things will work itself out. Just like it did before on the ban fiasco.

       I would wager that there are more "shills" than we can imagine.  But what exactly are they shilling for?  Who fucking knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I do know is that the JIDF is here in this subreddit, and like you said they rarely expose themselves for what they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       There surely are many other variety of shill aboard this ship, some more destructive than others.  Some yet that we probably agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shills don't have to be paid to operate, they just have to be motivated.  Money is probably rarely the motivation unless its a corperate shill.

      <p>
       That kind of makes anyone who supports (or disagrees with) a point of view a "shill." If individuals are expressing their actual beliefs, criticism, etc. then they aren't "shilling."

       Yep.  I believe that Republican versus Democrat is a lie.  So anytime I find a way to insert that into a political debate, I'm shilling for my own belief system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is when groups like JIDF and EPS organize a campaign to silence their opposition by trolling the everliving fuck out of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I seriously doubt that anyone in the JIDF gets paid.  And I'm sure they all personally believe the group's mantra, but they constantly wage troll wars to silence their opposition.  Hell they even infiltrated several Islamic Facebook groups and eventually hijacked them and started spreading anti-islamic propaganda to all the subscribers. Facebook had to get involved and restore control to the original owners.

       I thought the JIDF was a joke, a troll organization composed of a handful of people at most, while the actual (pro-israel) astroturfers are college students and whatnot working through Hasbara - an Israeli state-sponsored propaganda program. Maybe I was misinformed. That said, I'd be surprised if those working for Israel's interests were the only people attempting to manipulate things on this subreddit.

       Oh great，another antisemetic mod whos part of the antijew conspiracy on conspiracy. Just cause someone fights against disrespectful and hateful statements doesn't mean they are part of a gov agency. I'm tired of the anti Jew shit here disguised as antiisrael. Israel is a small piece of the conspiracy pie.

       If your perception is that I focus my attention on Jewish topics, that is because the JIDF uses tactics that violate the rules of this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, you aren't allowed to make personal attacks.  Like calling people faggots or antisemites.  You can challenge their ideas so long as you do it in a civil/non disruptive way.  Which is exactly why you made a brand new account to take a poke at me with a personal attack, because you are incapable of defending your statements or challenging mine, without resorting to barbarism.
      </p>

       No doubt a direct link to my reasonable comment above will be floating around the JIDF IRC chats for the next several days.

       Slow and steady, my friend, slow and steady.
Vs. Hitler and the Pharaohs.  (two quick and devastating blows)
Perhaps because we don't make a big stink about it...unlike some other ethnicities...that and because our persecution is over, for the most part.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know, it's too beautiful of a day to worry about who's persecuting the Jews at this particular moment...us goys have other stuff to think about, you know?

       It depends on the subreddit. Some of them have a process for selecting moderators. Some just add whoever is helpful and contributes. Each subreddit has it's own moderators who act (generally) independently from the administrators of the site, and those mods can establish whatever rules they want for the subreddit, including how they select new mods. Any moderator can technically add a new moderator, and mods who were added earlier technically have the power to remove the newer mods so there is a sort of hierarchy.

       Ah i'm not certain. I know on reddit's default mobile interface (e.g. a url with a .compact at the end) it provides an option to edit comments. But if you're using a special application like Reddit Is Fun to interact with the site then I am really not sure as I've never used any of those.

       Thanks for this. I've only been paying attention to this sub very recently, but already I've been a bit disconcerted. It seems to me this should be a place for anybody to unload any theory or scrutiny, so why the constant contempt regarding legitimacy? Maybe we're all shills! but at least everyone here can relate about this one incentive: to question everything.

       I wonder what you see in 9k sins that you don't notice a person who is dead set on maintaining control in this sub for his own benefit. If it wasn't for his own benefit, then he wouldn't be banning people that he didn't like because he just felt like it.

       Conspiracy theories are for complete idiots. That's why you're a good mod here. You're too dumb to smarten up and realize you're not wanted. You're too dumb to realize how insanely paranoid you are. You're too dumb to realize how you've made yourself look as a mod.

I haven't accused you of an act, merely an attitude that's clearly present.

       I am afraid I don't agree. It is incredibly tedious having to argue with someone who is so brainwashed they can't think for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely the point of r/conspiracy is that this is a place where we don't have to deal with brainwashed boneheads spouting mass-media  bullshit? Trolls, shills and dimwits should all be told where to get off, regularly and vociferously.

       This sounds like how religious people respond to criticism of the Bible:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Actually believing in what scientists say is more of the crazy religious belief. The Bible is based on facts, the scientists just accept evolution on faith."
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is that it isn't just the "government story." At this point experiments have been conducted, research done, ran through peer review, published in academic journals, etc. All confirming the simple story of hijackers and airplanes. None have confirmed any conspiracy theory (though the conspiracy theories, such as controlled demolitions, have been examined).
      </p>
      <p>
       So it has moved beyond the realm of the media, news and the "official story." We know from a scientific POV that everything can, and has been, explained simply by airplanes and jet fuel.

       really?  The idea that 4 sets of hijackers took over 4 airplanes in a unique and unprecedented fashion and then crashed them is unbelievable?
      </p>
      <p>
       That 2 buildings hit at speed with fully fueled commercial aircraft and then burned and collapsed is less believable then the notion that they were first wired with explosives and then hit with planes?  That the charges and wiring survived the destruction and fire?
      </p>
      <p>
       That WTC7 was also wired with charges and then left to burn for 7 hours before the charges were detonated?  What was the excuse for that going to be if no part of the WTC1/2 collapse hadn't hit WTC7 and set off the fire?

       I would love to hear an end to end explanation of how the whole thing went down in the "science" based version that you seem to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       in any case, I could give a shit as to what the government's version of the facts are.  This is a critical difference between how I think and seemingly how you think.   You seem to believe the government is behind it all by default.  That is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       an open mind.  Look at the gibberish about false flags and the Boston Marathon Bombing on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       literally minutes after the event took place...before there was even a fucking "flag" declared.  How does that make any logical sense at all?

       Firefighters can explain the floors that were contained and their belief that they were making progress.
