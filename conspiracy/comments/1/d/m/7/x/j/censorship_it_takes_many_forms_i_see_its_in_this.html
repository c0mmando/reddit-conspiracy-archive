       I noticed that whenever I post a comment in a thread on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , it registers as zero. No up or downvotes, just zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed this on several other people as well. And when I attempted to upvote a comment that I thought was relevant to the conversation, it didnt register that upvote either.
      </p>
      <p>
       So is this some sort of new policy that the moderators have enacted on people that they disagree with? In addition to judging the comments of a Redditor under 30 days not as important as those that have been around longer, and the new super-secret-extra-special sub-subreddit that limits who can get in and prevents anyone from having a dissenting opinion...
      </p>
      <p>
       By doing so, the moderators of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       have enacted Draconian policies of censorship and the elimination of constitutional rights - the very things they argue against in this subreddit to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and I know that my comments may be seen as a violation of the law that says that we are not supposed to make eye contact with the 300 pound gorilla in room, but the level of irony that this laughing stock of a discussion group creates absolutely astounds me to the point that I had to make a comment.

      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

       I am quite amused by this.

       He is a MOD because illuminatedwax knows him IRL and wants to have an eye on the inside because of the recent donbueno drama.
      </p>
      <p>
       He (Solidwheatstone), incidentally is also the person who called illuminated on the tele and informed him of the hijacking of this subreddit.  He is the person who helped us reclaim this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't trust him at first either, but after having worked with him in moderating this sub for a week or so, I can personally testify that he is a solid individual and we are fortunate to have him on our team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, without SWS, this sub would currently be managed by donbueno, which means it would be a free for all to whichever clique wanted to dominate the discussion by calling everyone insane nutters and spamming the front page with memes about how retarded conspiracy theorist are.

       Why not have a credible, familiar user (such as myself) be a mod?  It would go over a lot better in here than having some random with supposed "connections" that only shows up after a questionable possible "false flag" against this sub...

       If you hover over the [score hidden] mark it tells you. Moderators can set it to however minutes they like. In
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       that is 60 minutes.

       I like it. Unlike what OP is raving about, the votes are still counted. They are just hidden for a pre-determined amount of time so people's votes are less influenced by people that voted before them.

       We're talking about the new reddit feature that hides vote counts for a period of time.  Whatever you're talking about is unrelated to this post.  Even the
