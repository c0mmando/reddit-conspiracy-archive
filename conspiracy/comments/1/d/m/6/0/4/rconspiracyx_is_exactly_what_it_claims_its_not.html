<blockquote>
<p>Almost every president has been involved in drug trafficking. How else would they launder their money? New subreddit ConspiracyX has been created for those interested, shills banned immediately, just truth and great discussions. Grass roots, genuine and no BS. We welcome you:)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which I found to be <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dip6e/is_the_cia_involved_in_drug_trafficking_i_think/c9qq5c6">outrageous propaganda</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People who celebrate the further fragmentation of discussion on reddit into neatly categorized circle-jerks are no better than paid shills.</p>

<p>Post THAT on your sub if it&#39;s all about truth and great discussions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He didn&#39;t. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyX/comments/1dk7q1/people_who_celebrate_the_further_fragmentation_of/">So I did</a>.</p>

<p>Zero votes, up or down. Zero comments. And then this morning, I get:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you have been banned from posting to <a href="/r/ConspiracyX">/r/ConspiracyX</a>: The new and improved Conspiracy where anything goes..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is so perfectly ironic I had to share. Thanks <a href="/r/ConspiracyX">/r/ConspiracyX</a> mods for falling all over yourselves to prove me 120% right about your subreddit. </p>

Anyway, they make these claims &quot;TRUTH AND ONLY TRUTH&quot; on their sub, yet they post theories with no sources.  The moment you question their theories you get banned for being a &quot;shill.&quot;  </p>

<p>OP was clearly stating the hypocrisy of their subreddit.  I don&#39;t think OP should have made that thread in their sub, but instead have just made posts questioning their theories.  That is enough to get you banned there.  If he had done that instead he wouldn&#39;t have looked like he was stirring shit up.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re going to do is cite mass media and try and discredit everything&quot;  You do realize that you have nothing to discredit, right?  You never posted sources, only what you believe happened.  I went to you sub to see if you guys support open discussions, and you didn&#39;t.  So, I haven&#39;t visited it since then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I saw a video that actually used the same webpage to explain how it all went down.  There was no proof there were actors and make-up artists on scene, only speculation.  </p>

<p>One thing I looked for when debunking the theory was whether or not they were letting certain people near the finish line.  That is something that would be mandatory for there to be actors.  They would have had to make 100% sure nobody got into the bombing areas.  It would only take 1 civilian to blow the whistle on the whole operation.</p>

<p>So, they had to do that not only at 1 location, but at 2.  The 2nd location would have been a bit more difficult to keep clear of civilians.  It&#39;d be odd to have a &quot;vip&quot; section a couple hundred yards from the finish line, wouldn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>I think that&#39;d be the most likely place to have a VIP section.  That&#39;s where everyone wants to be to see the winner, or just to see their friend/family member cross the finish line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple hundred yards from the finish line?  I dunno about you, but I&#39;d prefer to be right beside the finish line to snap pictures of my friend/family who was in the race.  Fortunately, there weren&#39;t any designated VIP areas where the bombs went off.  So if they weren&#39;t keeping innocent civilians away from the blast zones it&#39;s safe to say the attacks were real.</p>

<p>You believing I&#39;m a &quot;CIA Disinfo Agent,&quot; goes to show that you believe anything you read on the internet.  That probably explains why you support the &quot;crisis actor&quot; theory people are throwing around on the net with no evidence.</p>

I think it&#39;s a little suspicious how many downvotes some submissions will get, in a relatively short amount of time.

The new submissions page for r/ConspiracyX is flooded with downvotes, as well as any commenting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im sure it&#39;s too late for this comment to get much attention, but i feel the need to interject. </p>

<p>So, by your logic, that any private forum is a circle jerk, you must also believe that any discussion which is not open to the public, including but not limited to class rooms, business meetings, or scientific councils, is a circle jerk perpetuating a stagnant mentality. </p>

<p>Private forums are private for various reasons, and in this case and many others, it is to keep out people who are uneducated on the matters of discussion and are unopen to becoming educated. The fact that you immediately criticized the forum&#39;s carefully designed and clearly laid out guidelines upon entering, knowing full well that it would most likely get you banned, is not at fault of the moderators or the rules. If you had any sufficient education in &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; or had even any significant time on conspiracy forums, you would <em>know</em> that there are a number of topics which  could never get enough attention here to warrant significant discussion (such as theories of the occult or who controls the elite), primarily due to the members of this forum trying to remain credible (by keeping discussion down to the facts as much as possible; something i fully respect and find necessary but we do need a place where we can theorize on limited facts, unfortunately this is impossible in a completely public forum) along with the overwhelming number of trolls or skeptics who, at best, need to be dragged through the basics against their will. Allowing these kind of people in the forum is like allowing a 12 year old into a business meetings, whereby he is convinced that the business must stop making what they make and start making plastic dinosaurs. Im sure you understand how this might be disruptive to coherent discussion. </p>

<p>We <em>all</em> grew up, to some extent at least,  with the official narrative and deemed it to be flawed. Coming to a conspiracy forum and parroting the official story to people who have spent years of their lives studying the alternative and even longer engrossed by the official narrative, without anything more than a basic education in the official narrative and no understanding at all of the alt, and being anything more than respectfully open minded is not going to be greeted with much appreciation. I dont claim to know your position or education but i can tell you that the way you presented yourself to that forum gave the impression that you were not only undereducated on <em>why</em> a private forum is necessary but also critical of conspiracy theorizing in general. The whole point of a private forum is for us to be able to openly discuss ideas where only the evidence is criticized, not the people discussing them, while also not being attacked for simply hypothesizing based on limited evidence. </p>

<p>Of course, r/conspiracy tries to be as unregulated as possible, but anyone whose been here for even a little <em>knows</em> that seriously hinders discussion amongst those who have spent significant time educating ourselves on conspiracy. That is why <a href="/r/conspiracyX">/r/conspiracyX</a> exists, it is not a public forum, for users of any level of education or open mindedness to enter. It is for a specific subset of people to maximize the coherent discussion while also allowing the more taboo topics to be discussed. If you are not open to the words there, or able to be respectful, you dont belong there. Period.  </p>

<p>False. I&#39;ve never stated or intimated that in the least. Also, ConspiracyX is not a private forum. I was able to make a post without being invited. </p>

<p>Oh, let me get out of your way. You&#39;re obviously more interested in debating against a highly vilified caricature of my stance than my actual stance. Let me know who wins. </p>

<p>It bills itself as an OPEN forum where ANYTHING GOES. I think one can be forgiven for being confused on this point, if your dear sub is supposed to actually be private. Why isn&#39;t it invite only then? Save all of us the trouble.</p>

<p>The title of my thread is: </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People who celebrate the further fragmentation of discussion on reddit into neatly categorized circle-jerks are no better than paid shills.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The Body of which reads, in it&#39;s entirety: </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m told this sub is all about truth and great discussions. We&#39;ll see about that.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The ONLY response I got was a ban. I think the answer is clear and it came from the sub&#39;s own mods. </p>

<p>A subreddit that is open to truth and great discussion, as it was advertised, would take that inquiry as a challenge to present it&#39;s views or at least flame the shit out of me. ConspiracyX did neither. It very pointedly did not vote or respond, and then banned me a day later. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to refer to what the sidebar said when I originally read it, but the text there has changed at least three times since I started this post today. </p>

<p>If this level of &quot;criticism&quot; (read: trying to discuss a known forum sliding tactic - divide and conquer in a forum that purports to abhor shill activities) that ConspiracyX sees as a clear and present danger to it&#39;s operations, then perhaps the title of THIS thread is correct?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Pointless insinuations aside, I&#39;ve yet to see how any of this rambling self-important nonsense related to the premise of the thread that got me banned from an open forum that focuses on the truth where anything goes. </p>

<p>What in the blue fuck are you rambling about? I posted a self thread about how the fragmentation of reddit subs was destroying open discussion.

<p>You keep insinuating that not only do I not know what I&#39;m talking about, but that I&#39;m not a frequent flyer of the conspiracy &#39;realm&#39;. All of your formulated opinions about me based on some text you read is inconsequential to the point of banality. If you have to make backhanded insults to make your point, that says more about your point than the person you&#39;re insulting. </p>

<p>Your continuation of the party line that ConspiracyX is some kind of open air market for enlightened individuals is uproariously sad, as the evidence being presented to me in PM&#39;s and my own experience prove otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do have a point.  The thing is not all their theories have supporting evidence.  Maybe that is what upsets people..  It bothers me because what if someone who never read about conspiracy theories were to come across r/conspiracyX?  They see some of the threads and one finally intrigues them enough to click the link.  They get in there, and there is no evidence to back said theory.  The user asks for some information, and they are either rewarded with a good ol ban, or someone calling them a &quot;shill.&quot;  So, these people who may have never met a conspiracy theorist now have a bogus idea that we&#39;re all opposed to discussion, and believe things with no evidence..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well i would say that by no means is conspiracyX for those who are new to conspiracy. It is for those of us who have been studying these things for years to be able to have intelligent discussion with out being mass downvoted for simply questioning beyond the accepted realm of inquiry. In a way, Conspiracy X is to conspiracy  as english 150 is to english 100; it is a pre requisite that you have some basic understanding before you can be much use  to or able to understand the consequent arena. However i do not believe in any sense that a respectful inquiry by someone new to conspiracy, would be met with bans or name calling. Im sure though that they would be encouraged to do some research though. </p>

<p>In regards to anyone who is so indoctrinated to the extent of being immediately hostile to alternative theories, the kind of people who get banned: they would never be convinced by a conspiracy forum anyway, so really nothing is lost. And even if it is possible to do so, the vast majority of us are far too busy with other matters, or far too exhausted by failed attempts to educate people, that we just dont even bother anymore. I believe the fact that in  r/conspiracy a post can get hundreds of upvotes, but within the comments there are only trolls or new comers, is a result of this. R/conspiracy is no longer a place for intelligent debate because there too many here convinced that we are idiots that most of us dont even care to comment anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally come here for the information and to see what people have to say mostly. debate is and had never been my desire (although i always find myself in one). It is by no means a discussion forum anymore, as it seems you realize. However, conspiracy is <em>far</em> more complex than the debate over say religion vs atheism, and that debate rarely ever has a winner. I have come to realize that debate alone, in regards to convincing skeptics, is almost absolutely useless. And most others realize this as well. The only thing that will ever convince a skeptic or a troll is his own research, something most refuse to do. Hence private or heavily moderated conspiracy forums so that debate can be had without having to deal with those thoroughly committed to the idea that we are all wrong and stupid. </p>

<p>Yes, ConspiracyX claims to not adhere to the party line and spreads the Truth. While that is demonstrably false, it is also not germain to the conversation. The topic I posted had NOTHING to do with any governmental conspiracy. I was questioning ConspiracyX&#39;s own propaganda about what it is. And I got exactly the answer I expected: A closed garden of fools having an elaborate desperate snicker at people they consider lower than them. </p>

<p>Nothing more. </p>

<p>And now they&#39;re on this thread, working overtime to call anyone who disagrees with their theology every name in the book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If someone doesn&#39;t like /cx, you are free not to post in /conspiracyX. If you have conspiracy-related things to discuss, you can certainly do them in /conspiracy. So why the attack on /cx?  Isn&#39;t how people run their subs their business? Because if all subs are open to this criticism, then we need to also address how /conspiratard operates as a malicious sub undermining its victim subs, and how it censors all opposition by banning them to silence them</p>

<p>I see some /ctard shills here attacking /cx, one calling it anti-semitic for its actions of cutting shills out of discussion. I guess they&#39;re not satisfied with attacking /conspiracy (which they boast about doing in their sub, which bans anyone protesting their actions.)</p>

<p>No no, see you&#39;re confused. Or trying to confuse. Here&#39;s the message from the sub&#39;s advocate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>New subreddit ConspiracyX has been created for those interested, shills banned immediately, just truth and great discussions. Grass roots, genuine and no BS. We welcome you:)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds like they want people to come and start &quot;great discussions&quot; that are &quot;true&quot;, right?</p>

<p>This is from the sub&#39;s sidebar:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The truth will set you free.</p>

<p>Nothing gets deleted or censored, shills banned immediately. TRUTH AND ONLY TRUTH. If you feel like you need to to &quot;discuss&quot; conspiracies and dissuade people, go somewhere else.</p>

<p>If you are truth seeker, PLEASE UPVOTE all posts, they are doing a fine job downvoting. Lets make our voices heard!</p>

<p>Also, if you like this subreddit, please tell your fellow truth seekers, add it in comments, and spread the word.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So explain to me again why I was banned? If it&#39;s that line about discussing conspiracies, I&#39;d only ask why the hell they try to make it sound like their sub is about discussing conspiracies openly and with truth if the ONE RULE is not to discuss conspiracies? What the actual fuck? Was I banned for discussing the obvious duplicity of the sub? If so, that&#39;s not very truthful or open. And it definitely means anything does NOT go there.</p>

<p>Remember: my entire point is that the premise of <a href="/r/ConspiracyX">/r/ConspiracyX</a> is total horseshit to cover up the &quot;circlejerkers only&quot; sign. </p>

<p>EDIT: You&#39;ll also note that the VERY FIRST THING I DID in the sub was contribute material. I asked for a discussion about the fragmentation of users across multiple similar subs. I didn&#39;t receive any trolling, no flames, no downvotes. Just a ban. How do you explain that from a sub that claims to be about &quot;truth&quot;, that states nothing gets deleted or censored. I feel pretty effectively censored and deleted. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why.  Plenty of subs I don&#39;t agree with, and I don&#39;t charge into them calling them out, I&#39;d probably get banned.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Proof you&#39;re not even bothering to understand my point. I&#39;m sure the mods over at ConspiracyX have the same problem. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with the stated premise of the sub at all, I disagree with the fragmentation of discussion on reddit by the constant creation of duplicitous subs that insulate the user base from one another. The overt hypocrisy was the icing on the cake, this thread wouldn&#39;t exist if they hadn&#39;t been so eager to show their ass. </p>

<p>My ASSUMPTION is that ConspiracyX is the result of trolls taking their ball and going off to play in the corner by themselves. A lot of people came out of the woodwork to talk about how bad <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was going to become after the do-nothing mods were removed from power. Most of these offended indignant posters never or rarely contributed to the sub. Lots of them were accounts less than a few days old. To me, it seemed like they were busy trying to convince all the new members that this sub picked up after the Boston Bombing that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was vile and it was in poor taste to participate. This is AFTER a marked campaign by multiple new and lurker accounts to get a 30day ban on posting in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> after subbing failed out loud to gain groundswell support. Not to mention, it was a terrible idea in context of the time frame it was being implemented. </p>

<p>An administrative move of this nature would only stop all the new posters that subbed out of curiosity over recent events from posting, most griefers and trolls already know enough to have multiple accounts if they&#39;re dedicated enough to raid subs on the regular. <a href="http://emptywheel.firedoglake.com/2011/02/14/the-hbgary-scandal-using-counterterrorism-tactics-on-citizen-activism/">There&#39;s also software on the market that allows one person to automate this process for multiple accounts.</a> You do things like that when you start the sub, not when you have an influx of new members. It smelled wrong, and the actual regular contributors agreed. But they were ignored totally, and the rule went into effect with no structured discussion of any kind. ConspiracyX was one of the alsoran&#39;s that was created in the wake of all of this. </p>

<p>It smells like a duck and walks like a duck, from the moment it was born... and I say out loud, &quot;That&#39;s a duck.&quot; I stand in front of it and say &quot;You&#39;re a duck, aren&#39;t you?&quot; and the duck doesn&#39;t hesitate to quack loudly and with abandon. Then you walk up and spit on me for &#39;white knighting&#39;.</p>

<p>I love how the hits just keep on coming. Some of you can&#39;t even help yourselves, and that&#39;s the best part. In before I&#39;m accused of being a troll for pointing out why these things are happening.</p>

<p>Also ironically, when all those people who didn&#39;t like the direction the sub was taking &#39;left&#39;, this sub instantly got better. Noticeably fewer trolls. Better discussions. </p>

<p>If ConspiracyX can&#39;t handle having a discussion about how the fragmentation of reddit is contributing to it&#39;s ability to control the narratives the public is exposed to, then they shouldn&#39;t bill themselves as open and seeking truth without censorship. Full stop. </p>

<p>TL;DR - I called out ConspiracyX for what it is and they couldn&#39;t wait to prove me right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had the same experience, posted links disproving his &quot; truth&quot; , in a very nice conversational tone pointing out that his theory was food for thought, but patently false. Banned. The comment below mine, in fact, was deleted. So...it&#39;s not what it appears to be, don&#39;t waste your time is my advice.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;d be the most likely place to have a VIP section.  That&#39;s where everyone wants to be to see the winner, or just to see their friend/family member cross the finish line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do have a point.  The thing is not all their theories have supporting evidence.  Maybe that is what upsets people..  It bothers me because what if someone who never read about conspiracy theories were to come across r/conspiracyX?  They see some of the threads and one finally intrigues them enough to click the link.  They get in there, and there is no evidence to back said theory.  The user asks for some information, and they are either rewarded with a good ol ban, or someone calling them a &quot;shill.&quot;  So, these people who may have never met a conspiracy theorist now have a bogus idea that we&#39;re all opposed to discussion, and believe things with no evidence..</p>

<p>You see how some can be opposed to their sub now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But I feel like this is a point being made outside of the body of evidence here. People can&#39;t even look at the sources in the OP before making an opinion. This is an endemic problem when it comes to discussions as complex as this. </p>

<p>Yes, ConspiracyX claims to not adhere to the party line and spreads the Truth. While that is demonstrably false, it is also not germain to the conversation. The topic I posted had NOTHING to do with any governmental conspiracy. I was questioning ConspiracyX&#39;s own propaganda about what it is. And I got exactly the answer I expected: A closed garden of fools having an elaborate desperate snicker at people they consider lower than them. </p>

<p>Nothing more. </p>

<p>And now they&#39;re on this thread, working overtime to call anyone who disagrees with their theology every name in the book.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> is dead. Long live <a href="/r/ConspiracyX">/r/ConspiracyX</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But skeptics are part of the ecosystem, when they&#39;re genuine skeptics. They keep the entire discussion healthy. I&#39;ve definitely changed my mind because skeptics pointed out how bullshit something sounded, and I reviewed what I was buying into. They ground the conversation and help with the ejection of myth and rumor. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s why any group that claims to (or unilaterally wants to) remove all skepticism is a cult or worse. They lie when they say they want free discussion, that&#39;s the hook to get you to submit to their agenda. </p>
