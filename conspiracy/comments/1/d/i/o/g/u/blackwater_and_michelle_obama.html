    <div class="md"><p>You are inferring that creating jobs logically produces conspiracy, when that is not the logic being originally used.  Your sarcasm is not logically accurate...yes, backpedal, even if unknown. </p>

<p>If it makes the point any clearer: I am sure this sub would prefer all those employees to work for Westrich Furniture. Blackwater is a shady, government-whore company. Unless your joke is mocking trolls who come here making pseudo-logical jokes, and actually supports the point being made, then I really don&#39;t understand what is so funny? </p>

<p>Sry that I took it on face value as a quippy troll remark that makes illogical leaps in conclusion and tries to pretend that OP has done the same... Essentially straw man garbage that the majority of opposition (the immature section) tends to use tirelessly. If you are joking about the clowns who do that all day around here, more power to you. If you are one of those clowns, just go away and find something valuable for your time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since when did they claim truth over speculation? Most mature contributors to this sub understand they are doing the work of speculation. Its really just the trolls and immature conspiracy theorists who say anything about &quot;conclusive truth&quot;. </p>

<p>How do you think a government mercenary program is not connected to the government, IE the first lady? </p>

<p>I suppose corporations and their profits are not connected to the government either. </p>
