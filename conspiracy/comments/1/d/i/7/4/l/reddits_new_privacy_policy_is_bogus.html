       So, here we are. May 15th a new privacy policy will be active that will allow Reddit to distribute our information to about anywhere.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Other extraordinary circumstances may require disclosure: we may also disclose your information when we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person; to address fraud, security, or spam; or to protect our rights or property.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This will make it possible for them to just disclose your information without your consent or court order, no questions asked. This makes the entire privacy policy complete bogus.
All the other points could be voided by this single line. Anything could be classified as one of these five 'categories', while two categories (security and spam) are the most easy void-subjects.
      </p>

        link to thread
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They have all your posts, your messages and your upvotes (and e-mail, if you gave it) linked to your IP-address. That's a lot of information for someone to have.

       Last time a conversation like that was had around these parts we saw two things happen:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Reddit, Inc. was formed as a New York corporation and the reddit.com web service was moved from Cond√© Nast Digital's control to this new entity.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         All of the default and influential subreddits had significant changings of the guard amongst the moderation teams.  These new moderation team members all advocated for stricter moderation to "clean up" the subreddits.  New rules were implemented, all with similar open-ended clauses to the one demonstrated above by the OP, allowing for arbitrary interpretation and enforcement of the rules.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Advance Publications knows how much the web service reddit.com is worth.  A billion page views a month is nothing to scoff at.  We made this site successful, so successful in fact that it is no longer our website.  We made someone else a ton of money and we misplaced our trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what they will do to bury the pleas of the rabble rousers this time, but we will see.  Throwing a fictitious entity at us worked for almost exactly a year (1 year, 1.5 months) last time.  Maybe a new privacy policy that actually protects our rights will shut us up for another year or two.

       It's an onion version of Reddit. You'll have to learn more about the deep web before you fully understand what's going on. You can start

       I assume so.

       Reddit inc. themselves could be hosting it I'm not sure. They seem to have the same privacy policy however it's an onion so everyone if forced to connect to it anonymously.

       The deep web is the wild west of the internet. It's filled with hackers, assassins, drug dealers, and human traffickers. Everyone there is anonymous and there aren't really any laws that they follow or even care to acknowledge. If someone was to set up a malicious website no one could do anything about it and you might not have any way of knowing a site is malicious. It best to browse them from within a virtual machine just to make sure.

       it's a well known flaw that anyone operating multiple entry and exit nodes would be able to statistically correlate traffic information such that  it effectively destroyts the anonymity offered by Tor.

       Tor is not a "confidence shield" - it's exactly what it claims to be - an anonymous distributed IP tunnelling project. No one can easily see though it. It would take an incredible amount of international cooperation and research to be able to get meaningful information to trace tor traffic, and it would need to be in near realtime, because interconnections can change frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're in any doubt about that Tor is open-source, you are welcome to research it yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are risks to using Tor, most notably that someone can possible capture your traffic on a Tor exit node (but HTTPS or other protocol encryption addresses that). But Tor itself is an entirely effective anonymiser that, by it's design, makes it effectively impossible for any party to determine the source IP address of any given connection.

       To be honest, if the NSA "broke" AES, they wouldn't use it. You know, probably due to the fact that it would be a liability waiting to happen.

       In 1976, NSA could bruteforce DES.  This is clearly shown by their contribution to the cipher, which was to make the algorithm
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       while specifically demanding that the key size be reduced.  This shows they were trying to take out any possible backdoor, and force
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       to brute force  What that means, .is they were well aware that they had the highest CPU throughput on the planet.  The actions in 1976 clearly show they could brute force the standard at 64 bits in 1976, probably nearly instantly.

       The strength of cryptography isn't the issue. Unless Tor embeds some sort of sidecar data about the source in traffic there's no way to track back to the origin unless you have access to every node the traffic has passed through. The Tor code is open source, you can review if for yourself and see that it doesn't have any such weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that Tor routing changes regularly you'd also need to capture data from all implicated nodes at the same time to be able to get source information.

       </p>
       <p>
        The best defense against this is the fact the algorithms are known worldwide. There are many competent mathematicians and cryptographers outside the NSA and there is much research being done in the field right now. If any of them were to discover a hole in one of the algorithms, I'm sure that we would hear about it from them via a paper in one of the cryptography conferences.

      <p>
       Essentially most widespread cryptographic ciphers are very public. We know exactly as much about them as the NSA. Many very smart researchers devote a lot of time to understanding and breaking these ciphers. If they have weaknesses we'll hear about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NSA has a lot more computing resources than us, for sure, but they are not infinite and even with those resources we can be reasonably assured that any brute force efforts would still take, at the very least, a decent amount of time and in some cases a really really really long time.

       It think you're wrong. While DES may be vulnerable, even the small step up to Triple DES is a huge improvement.

       Several thoughts on this:

         1   All of our speculation about Boston Bombings opened some eyes at the Federal Level. "We done goofed" and totally missed it.

         2   How much do you want to make a bet the Feds could (and would if they needed to) link the bombers to live accounts on Reddit? They already said that the two boys were "Conspiracy Theorists".
        </p>

      </ul>

        3   CISPA has been stopped for now, however now they hit us where we live (post).
