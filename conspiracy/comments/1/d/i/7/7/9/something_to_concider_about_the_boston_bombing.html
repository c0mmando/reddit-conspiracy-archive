       EVERYONE is focusing on the first Explosion.
      </p>
      <p>
       That  "Smoke"bomb is getting all the attention, all the people in it etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       THe media, the Alternative media, etc etc everyones focusing on THAT ONE  "BOMB".
      </p>
      <p>
       All the footage you see focuses on the first explosion, but we never have footage of the second upclose etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But
       <strong>
        NOTHING
       </strong>
       about the Second(and more explosively large) Explosion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets be honest  The First "explosion" that happend  Was for the drill, featuring actors, the undercover guys + the FBI using a some type of device, and the Brothers were litterally at the wrong place and the wrong time, but the  FBI never lets a crisis go to waste.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Second explosion was  Big, firey   and damaging...... yet we NEVER see  Any photos,news, Injured people from that area etc etc   and you guys don't think thats abit...... Strange?
No witnesses of the second area, no interviews etc etc the list goes on and on for the second explosion.
      </p>
      <p>
       ANYONE ELSE FINDING THIS ODD AS HELL?

       The "Craft personnel" in the area were a National Guard CST team, assigned there for the event, it's a common occurrence at large events with lots of people.

       so a CST team was stationed there aswell?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm thinking this drill was a multi agency operation, and the CST  team  was just there  doing there job.
      </p>
      <p>
       But another thing to concider is that  the one thing people suspect less  is  someone  that appears to protect them to hurt them.

       I want you to remember this.

       All groups gather info, some is redundant and repeats,  and others find something that maybe another group didn't catch, and proceeds to point it out.

       I think you're really close here. Add to this the fact that
       <em>
        no one
       </em>
       seems to know the guy who "lost a leg." No family, no friends, no coworkers... No one has heard of this guy. It's as if he appeared on earth for the first time that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who else appeared suddenly before a tragedy? The Sandy Hook families who moved to Newtown weeks before the "shooting" then moved out a week after, perhaps?
      </p>
      <p>
       We're getting close on this.

       That story has been long debunked.  When interviewed, the employees said they hadn't actually worked a shift with him, or even heard of him, and were just there to show support.

       Yeah, the First bomb is focused on so damn much  compared to the abertly Larger more explosive bomb its really strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       It brings up a few Questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Why is the first "Bomb" So focused on, when if it was a true bomb it would have done more damage to a group of people?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Why is the second explosive   Never talked about, and why have no witnesses or footage of it has  been shown When it was a bigger Explosion?

       Somehow that doesn't strike me as being very honest. Every point you made has been debunked thoroughly. How can you possibly believe it was a fake explosion using actors at this point?

       you can't "Fake" an explosion, but you can  change the  Lethality of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, less explosion, more smoke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alot of people think "Actor" means  everyone on the scene was an actor.
      </p>
      <p>
       When in reality modern day Actors are by definition Used infront of a camera   to show or portray.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can have a real event, but its the people who you see on TV is what matters.
      </p>
      <p>

       Why did I focus on the first explosion? Because that's what I quoted from your post! Let me quote it again:

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       And I responded to your claim about there being fewer pictures of the second explosion in the first part of my post. So I did comment on both explosions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you provide any evidence that these bombs were planted by the FBI, which people were actors, that they used a "flashy non lethal low grade" device, or that Craft guys had anything whatsoever to do with the explosion?

       I never said  the  FBI planeted the explosives, The Actors are as i explained on another comment, usually seen on the TV, If you compare the 2  Explosions  it isn't hard to tell which was a higher grade device,  and as I said before Craft  usually does  Drills/training/Exercises with law enforcement agencies.

       EDIT:  it was a CST team there, not craft apparently

       Both of them seem pretty real to me.

      <p>
       Your "smoke bomb" first explosion seemed to have a bit more blast to it then you give it credit for:

      </p>
      <p>
       The second blast had fewer cameras trained on it because of its distance from the finish line, and most photos afterward were heavily censored due to gore, but they are out there:

       From what I see of media coverage the focus on both as a singular event. And as everyone said, there are better and more usable images (especially for American television) from the first because of its proximity to the finish line.

       ^ Key thing to note the Craft SUV and the FBI Truck where the only  vehicles to ever move to the Finish line  after the bombing and then those 2 vehicles were abandoned  shortly after the Craft and the FBI were talking and then for some reason went under the stands  by the finish line.

       so we're still saying those guys were Craft? If that's the case this will bear no more fruit than me telling a Christian that their god is in their head.
      </p>
      <p>
       So because the television media plays the footage of the bombing that is actually good footage, and therefore asks those witnesses questions, in their quest not for the news, but for ratings. Its because they do that its all a conspiracy?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Which bomb site was closest to the finish line 
I'm going to guess the one closest to the finish line?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because the same people who found all the crisis actors, and look at pictures of gore and try to comprehend how in an instant people are doing things that are not what they see on TV and in the movies. (which in itself makes no sense because you'd think the actors would act the most common archetype of being injured) So this analysis I'm also to believe the same CSI stuff that a hat that could easily be a punisher logo is now Craft international although they were later identified as CST. Also have you ever had a concussion? did you act normal after it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let's not talk about how all the goal posts get walked back from they were all actors, to some were actors, to well some of the people giving interviews were actors, to well it wasn't 2 fake bombs it was 1 real and 1 fake. The constant rehashing of the story is what makes it lose credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to use the media coverage as the analysis for a conspiracy is ridiculous.

       Looking at your post history you started out on the actor thing, now you walk it back to one bomb with controlled lethality. On other posts you still argue craft guys,even when you've given it up on other posts where people have brought up the fact that they were CST.
