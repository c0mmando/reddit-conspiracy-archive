<p>You are basically suggesting they commit more war crimes in order to excuse themselves for the war crimes they&#39;ve committed.

<p>I&#39;d say that&#39;s likely because you don&#39;t seem to be very intelligent. I never suggested that there was no state that would give them asylum. I&#39;d imagine there are a number of them.

<p>I think &#39;terrorists&#39; that have been kept in illegal solitary confinement for periods likely near 10 years aren&#39;t going to be able to fend for themselves too easily. Furthermore, you seem to be missing my point. To leave the prisoners in cuba on their own accord would be <strong>another</strong> war crime. There is really little point in discussing things with you if you are only going to offer nonsense straw man arguments. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The whitehouse aren&#39;t going to let the prisoners out without any legal hearings as it would be tantamount to admitting to their war crimes. I&#39;m not sure what about this that you don&#39;t understand that you make me repeat it so often. </p>

The problem is while the president has a lot of control of the military he still has to work within existing framework; he&#39;s tied to budgets, law, timetables.

    <div class="md"><p>... You don&#39;t seem to understand the world you are living in right now. The president has picked up the war on terror, and he has made it his own. Indefinite detention, drone strikes, patriot act, protecting wallstreet and big corporations, unaccountable government, secret government agencies with no oversight, Congressional members bought and paid for by corporations courtesy of Citizens United... </p>

<p>Basically it&#39;s the power and money. He has no incentive to just &quot;let them go&quot;... Do the right thing? by who&#39;s standards? You think all those war on terror hawks want those guys let free? You think the Military Industrial complex, that is forcing tanks down the military&#39;s throat, wants these people free? Hell no. They want to toy with these peoples lives, because they mean nothing to them. Again, even if he closed GITMO down, they&#39;d only wind up somewhere else. American soil, or one of our numerous &quot;allies&quot; might take them. But unless we get someone as president who doesn&#39;t give a damn about the power, who doesn&#39;t give a damn about the money, there will be no justice for those prisoners, nor is there much hope for justice for the rest of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, not a lot I as one person can do about that. A collective sure, maybe something is possible. But no, I&#39;m not crying about it. You seem to be pretty lost though friend. How old are you? 13? Or are you just a butthurt troll, trying to start something here? You have no argument other than &quot;doing the right thing&quot;. And again, that is a perceptual matter. GOP terror hawks think the right thing is to keep these &quot;savages&quot; locked up as long as they can, waterboard them till they tell us what we want to hear. Liberals who don&#39;t want to be &quot;soft on terror&quot; will think they need to stay imprisoned, but treated just a little bit better. Families of the Imprisoned feel they should be returned home. </p>

<p>And re reading your title, of course congress doesn&#39;t have to do anything, Obama signed an executive order for the closing of Gitmo. This should have been enough. BUT Congress actually decided to DO something. They stopped it. That&#39;s not an excuse. That&#39;s not a blame congress issue. That&#39;s congress, actively working to keep Gitmo Open. While Obama may be Commander in chief, Congress is basically the masters of the purse. They dictate where money will be spent, and how it will be spent. Military said, &#39;nah, were good on tanks bro.&#39; And congress was like &#39;FUCK THAT! YOU WILL TAKE $436 MILLION WORTH OF TANKS&#39;. </p>

<p>Again, Congress is responsible for Gitmo being open, Obama is the reason these men will be detained indefinitely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I care about your opinion. I just think you are naive. Again, there is no Incentive to just let them go. Their rights have been &quot;suspended&quot; under the patriot act and NDAA. I know, the rights you are born with, that should be conveyed to every living person regardless of gender, creed, sexuality, ethnicity, location should never ever be able to be suspended, but this is where we are. We let the terrorists win when we said it was okay for our rights to be revoked in return for &quot;safety&quot;. </p>

<p>They could be terrorists. They might not be (I honestly believe most of them are innocent, mistaken identity, wrong place wrong time, pissed off the wrong person, etc.). Even if they are terrorists, it is probably America&#39;s fault anyway for trying to play age of empires in the middle east. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that I don&#39;t agree with you, I do.</p>

<p>But I see this argument here <em>all the fucking time</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A campaign could easily raise enough private money -insert whatever cause being suggested - </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Money doesn&#39;t come from nowhere (fiat currency irrelevant to this discussion!  don&#39;t even start! lol).  Sure, there are rich people with unthinkable mountains of cash, but they are stingy as fuck.  That&#39;s how they got their money.  You&#39;ve gotta sell it to them personally.  They don&#39;t give 2 shits about what you or I think.  Unless it will personally benefit them (read: make them <strong>more</strong> money), they will not do anything.</p>

<p>Its always, &quot;Someone should pay to fix this!&quot;  But its <strong>never</strong>, &quot;Here, I will offer some of my own money to fix this!&quot;  Never.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the issue of international law.  We&#39;ve illegally kidnapped and held hostage hundreds of people who, if not actually innocent, we do not have the evidence to convict.  We, as Americans, prefer to pretend like we abide by the law...at least most of the time.</p>

<p>There it is again.  Its weak reasoning.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not trying to make excuses at all.  I honestly agree with you.  I&#39;ve been pointing out that he didn&#39;t close gitmo for what seems like forever now.  There are people out there who honestly thing its closed now (seriously).  But theres like what, 2 countries without extradition treaties with the US ( I dunno I heard that somewhere ).  Nobody is going to stir shit with the US to harbor a bunch of malcontents that we&#39;ve already demonstrated we&#39;re willing to disregard international (not to mention our own national law) to imprison.  That&#39;d be just asking for drone strikes in their own territory.</p>

<p>I feel like I&#39;m just being a dick and shooting everything down, but I think we&#39;ve dug ourselves a fairly deep hole here and the solution is more complicated than just &quot;let them go!  put em on a boat!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither are <em>personal</em> about OP. It would be personal if I said he&#39;s a jerk (a personal insult) because he&#39;s from California (personal about him) and his mom&#39;s trashy (personal to his life). I don&#39;t know such personal things about him, so I cannot make such statements.</p>

<p>&quot;Shitstick stirring&quot; was describing the submission. Troll is not a <em>personal</em> attack. It&#39;s a description of observed behavior. More to the point, I am suggesting he is a flame warrior: a provocateur for the sake of provocation. That&#39;s what flame bait is.</p>

<p>I may be incorrect in saying so, but that inference was not a personal attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. I think at this point Ibama is too concerned with his legacy as the first half-black president to serve as an effective leader. He has been lead every step of the way, his words are, as Hillary said, just words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, of course.  It&#39;s just the idiot shills saying that crap about &quot;Obama&#39;s hands are tied.&quot;  It&#39;s so full of holes that you&#39;d have to be a 5-year-old not to see through it.</p>

<p>Which is why the shills have to take over mod privileges.  They can&#39;t survive reality on a level playing field.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s Obama&#39;s fault for detaining and holding them indefinitely. Congress shut down his attempt at closing it (which would have put them at Gitmo north in IL, little more insulated from the rest of the world IMO, maybe less bad press if Gitmo closed).</p>

<p>Now the real question is whether or not they&#39;re playing by WWE rules. Working together behind the scenes, but keeping the rivalry alive and well for the cameras and crowds. </p>
