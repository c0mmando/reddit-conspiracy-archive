       A rule which makes no sense. I don't come to this subreddit to read peoples comments. I come to click on all the links, then read and think for myself. The more links there are the better.

       In this case, less is definitely more. Zero would be even better. I really don't see why we need mods at all. The beauty of Reddit is that it moderates itself.

       I have never posted to r/conspiracy before I posted above, but having done so, and watching the thread today, I would like to point out that all of the "deleted" posts in this comment are from donbueno, and that the "deleted" posts below are from 9000SINS. If you are a mod or former mod, you're no different. Type what you want to say and leave it be.

       Two names that I had never come across before a few days ago. Unless I had looked to the sidebar for moderators. In the 80+ subreddits I subscribe to, that thought has never occurred to me. Moderators? What for?

       You clearly haven't been very active during the immediate time after the Boston bombings. The mods reacted the way they did because there was an obvious crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       A surge of new users with freshly made accounts arrived. We saw a clear agenda of trying to make make this subreddit more mainstream by discrediting any and every hypothesis that went against FBI's story. This has already existed here previously, but went absolutely rampant during the whole thing.

       I spend a lot of time on this subreddit reading everyday. I didn't notice a crisis until I started to see links in the top 100 talking about it. I think new users are good, the more the merrier. I want as much information as I can get. I'll be the judge of how or if that info affects my worldviews.

       That's funny if you read news from "hot" instead of "new", because many good and interesting freshly made posts received instant mass downvotes. If you go there now, you'll barely see downvotes on the new ones, showing a more respectful vibe.

       Mr. donbueno, I am new to your subreddit.  I joined just before the Boston bombing attacks so I got to enjoy this sub for a couple of days before seeing its population suddenly jump as the "false flag" accusations drew more and more interested readers/posters who were not as open minded as the existing population.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is simple: do you feel the influx of new redditors is part of a larger plot to discredit the ideas in this subreddit, instigated by any number of possible parties, or do you think it is a natural reaction to the situation in Boston and that, as attention is inevitably drawn elsewhere, the population will ebb to pre-Boston numbers?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am merely curious, and you said AMA.  I enjoy this sub, I enjoy the open flow of ideas and theories, and I appreciate this opportunity to ask a question, whether you answer or not.  Ewige blumenkraft.

       the idea, but some have pointed out that the government has budgeted money towards effecting social media...  It would be relatively cost effective to have a couple agents managing 20 or so accounts each and using them to direct/shape discussions, especially on a site like reddit with up/down votes.  Not saying that's what happened/happens/will happen, I'm just curious what donbueno's opinion is, because it seemed like many people involved in instating the 30 day rule believed this was the case.  Conspiracies within r/conspiracy, etc.

       Maybe not but switft decisive action was necessary. I asked 9000sins to remove the rule and his response was rather ridiculous and childish. At that point I did what need to be done. Fuck if anything we know that powers at hand need to be removed periodically. Now you have a censored

       Without evaluating the need to do so or the merit in doing so,
       <em>
        that was not your decision to make
       </em>
       . If the Mods are not working as a deliberative body, the solution is not for a strong man to disband the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many coups, military juntas, and dictatorships in the 20th century follow a certain pattern. Usually, it involves a small coterie of people, led by a strongman or a puppet strongman, seizing power and deposing those whose power the plotters deem unsatisfactory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care about
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       or the mods. It's the fucking internet. But, you honestly have you look at yourself if you think an overt power grab is the proper solution to 9000sins' hasty rulemaking. Yes, an
       <em>
        overt
       </em>
       and unsubtle power grab. A palace coup. That was your solution based on what was very little provocation.
      </p>
      <p>
       His hasty "emergency" rule did not necessitate your hastier coup. Your response was, frankly, the thing that makes government conspiracies so dangerous. They act with impunity and expect they'll never get caught.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, there's ample proof that you have the same gene. That's fucking scary.

       I was also under the impresison that we were all on the same level and removing only 9000sins would just cause someone else to remove me and therefore putting the entire subreddit in danger of a power struggle. So after asking to remove the rule and getting a vitriolic repsonse I decided to just remove them all.

       Angry?  You did nothing to help this place and once you did arrive you got the wool pulled over your eyes since you lacked any context.   The mods you banned put 100x more effort into here, if you payed any attention you would see this place turning into a circle jerk of epic proportions and you drop the mod team.  Poor choice IMO.

       Don,
      </p>
      <p>
       I get why you did what you did.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said I really think that you jumped the gun and made an ass of yourself.  The 30 day rule sure does smack the spirit of free speech right across her face but so does an organized mob of trolls, jidfs, and drama queens.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we have multiple groups of people in competition over "who gets to speak" and the consensus of the mods is that "everyone gets to speak" and those groups start waring upon everyone and ignoring the rules of the subreddit.  The mods took a long hard look at the situation and the ONE thing that was a common denominator among all the mini-tyrants was that they used brand new accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       We decided to try something new and it appears to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free speech isn't easy, its a lot of hard work.  Just like IRL Klan rallies and panther walks the police have to line the streets or people might get killed.  Now in reddit obviously you can't die from someone's post, but your ability to participate can be killed effectively.  Massive down vote brigades cause your comments to be buried unfairly and then the same people up vote their own garbage to the top, thousands of comments.  Nobody can dig thru that mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       They stalk you onto other reddits and ruin your experience there as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       We just want a place that WE are allowed to talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your input on the situation would have been welcomed and a debate could have been had about it then.  Sorry that didn't happen but honestly, we forgot that you even existed.

       Reading through that post, it seems only the OP is calling for a 30 day rule.  And that's only if you use some tortured logic to make the link that "most accounts are 30 days old" = "we need to ban accounts less than 30 days from posting."  There are a fair amount of upvoted comments that say the idea is dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, that doesn't address my point that it looks like enfrozt went off and had automoderator add the rule without discussing it with everyone else.

       Ah, I misread the mess from enfrozt as being form him, rather than him quoting you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, that doesn't address the other point - you went off and added the rule to automoderator without a real clamoring for the rule itself.  That post you cited as an example of everyone and their mother wanting the rule doesn't ask for that rule to be implemented at all.

       Well, that answer still seems disingenuous.  You're effectively cutting out new users that come here and want to contribute, but this is an old argument that others have already hashed out more eloquently than me.  If you're going to put in a new rule, and you're trying to be transparent about it, why not ask the people that are here and participating?  It just smacks of not trusting your userbase.  Even within the moderators, shouldn't you allow at least some discussion before putting a rule in place?  Maybe a "hey, I'm thinking of adding a 30 day rule to automoderator, what do all you you all think?"  rather than "Hey, I did this, hope you like it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I was also trying to respond to the now deleted commented calling you a pussy, but it was deleted too quickly.  It read: Don't be a dick, that's not going to incentivize him any more to have a vote.
