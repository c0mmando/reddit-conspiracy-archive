       obviously a throw away account so it's brand spanking new, hope it doesn't get banned or anything, reading some of the threads around here looks like it might.

       Ok, so there are a lot of similar companies that do similar work, that is the first thing that you need to understand. And the contracts that we have are very protected, so if you're not working on a project, or with a certain partner you are not privy to very much info, sometimes not any.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no department that works on reddit, or facebook, etc; we work on the message for the partner. So we can follow it around to different sites, or wherever the conversation is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do know a few people do regularly work on reddit, including
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       but you don't need a lot of people to make an impact, sometimes it's a simple 1 liner comment that does it.
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI, most of the people that you accuse of being "government shills" are not. I can recognize them almost immediately by the style of writing and the message.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes there are some that are moderators on reddit.

       The last contract that I worked on was for NOAA, but you have to understand that most of the people that use our company don't want it known and most of the time we don't even know "who" we are contracted with. The company knows but we don't know, we just get the agenda, some talking points, and target sites.

        I'm sure you'll appreciate this one, during both elections we were contracted to push the Barack Obama birth certificate controversy.

       You were pushing the same stuff donald trump did ?

       Interesting coincidence. I guess he was not paying the bills. That would mean somebody else did.
      </p>
      <p>
       And than, question arises.. cui bono (who profits) ?

       Obama did win the elections.

        If you want to think about this another way, it's PR work, much the same way as they are doing subliminal marketing during TV shows by having product labels facing the camera or getting a close up of the manufacturer of a car as it drives away.

      <p>
       I agree. It is PR or propaganda. Whatever you want to call it. Take a look at this

       What are your experiences with a job ? Did you learn something ?

       In what direction do you think they are paying you to push public opinion ?

       And, of course, what do you think about his birth certificate ? I guess you did spend some time talking about it..

       No not at all, and I'm not trying to be rude either. I don't really buy most of what people discuss on this sub but I find it curious how so many go out of their way to mock

       . Probably one out of every five threads (sometimes more, sometimes less) is someone's effort to prove CTs wrong, and more often than not the OP assumes every CT believes every conspiracy.

       Obviously you're not being a dick or anything, but I don't really know what you were hoping would happen with this thread. You mocked the lingo and set yourself up as an opponent right off the bat, not exactly a great way to start a rational discussion

       You say you basically do PR work, and in general I can't complain about that.  In PR work, however, with press releases, TV interviews, etc. it's normally more clear that the information is coming from a company spokesperson.  When you have thousands of created accounts that purport to be some individual out there expressing their own personal opinion, though....don't you ever feel that you are lying and misrepresenting yourself?

       It truly is laughable that you think people will believe shills are paid $26.50 to sit on the internet all day posting liberal propaganda (which is what most of them would've done without their jobs anyway).

       thanks for admitting it. It's a growing industry these days, but how shameful. Propaganda: now legal in America.

       Can't knock the hustle though. You're trying to save face for the most powerful regime in world history. Also, the ones who control the world reserve currency...so there is that, too

       It's just weird, it feels like someone calling himself "hip" when he's trying to infiltrate a drug ring. Sure, I guess some people actually say it, but it's not exactly vernacular so it puts everyone on edge.
