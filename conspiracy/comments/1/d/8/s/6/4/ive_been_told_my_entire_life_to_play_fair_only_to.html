        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sheep teaching sheep, ignorance promoting ignorance. What land of the free? We&#39;re bred like cattle in an invisible cage to work for our masters. And the worst part is, we&#39;re all too brainwashed to even realize it. Too busy running out to buy fancy clothes and new gadgets, made by children in the 3rd world paid 10 cents an hour. Advertisements? That&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg; though I must say the masses these days are so easily influenced. We&#39;re bred into an entire culture that values nothing but materials and aesthetics. We hilariously fall for such illusions of wealth and status over our fellow insects, completely ignorant to the fact of the sacrifice put in to obtain such needless comforts. While our masters stand in the shadows laughing over our stupidity.</p>

<p>The average citizen has never even tried opening a book for the pleasure of glimpsing inside it. We ridicule and demean the idea intelligence and even thought itself. &quot;Education&quot; in this society serves only two purposes. Profit and patriotism. Colleges filled with utterly useless majors that students will spend the next 80 years working at McDonald&#39;s to pay off. Teachers and counselors promoting the idea of individualism and free thought. Telling children to &quot;chase their dreams&quot;, as if somehow personality became completely dependent of the environment. As if saying the brain were independent of the body. The very statement, &quot;Do what you want to do&quot;, is so oxymoronic that it&#39;s as crazy as telling the Sun it has a choice of whether or not to shine tomorrow, or telling the earth it can take a break from rotating for a while. They&#39;re just idiotic ideals created from fantasy and fiction. And should one see through this paper thin facade and work toward something real, in the end, most still only end up as expensive tools. Paid to perform their duties. Brainwashed to purchase even more expensive items in order to show off their superiority among their fellow insects. With illusions of success and wealthy looming in their heads as they live out their pathetic lives. </p>

<p>The game is rigged gentlemen. It was designed to fail from the very beginning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Responding to your title, I&#39;ve thought for a while that:</p>

<ul>
<li>drug dealers on the street have better ethics and a less harmful effect on society than banksters do</li>
<li>urban &quot;thugs&quot; who roam in gangs and carry illegal weapons kill fewer innocents than US soldiers (who are taught/selected to obey orders) do</li>
<li>politicians, monopolists, etc., corner markets, control the playing field, and then tell everybody else &quot;It&#39;s a free market, start your own movement&quot; when they know very well that the game is stacked against them</li>
<li>working within the system is a great way to waste all your energy and actually legitimatize your opponents while you bang your head against the wall</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Somebody&#39;s bitter.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right in the way that it&#39;s all a game and never ends.  Even if you get to the top and are the one who is pulling the strings.</p>

<p>You&#39;re wrong in the fact that it&#39;s a mindless, unchangable system focused on keeping you down.  There are soft corner that you can manipulate.  Personal relationship you can build that will work around the system.  Focusing on the 10 percent you can change after you do the 90 percent of box-checking.  </p>

<p>And before you think how messed up our country is, think about Russia.  China.  We have problems, but we are not those countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is rigged, in a system designed by our fathers to fail. We must recognize that there is only one currency out there... the product of human ingenuity... and we have all been paid for our labors, regardless what the &quot;log books&quot; say.</p>

<p>Wheres the gold at? Its in your cell phones. Its in your computers. Its in your TVs. The gold has been given back to the people... so lets write it off and lets move on to an income source that is both inspirational and limited.... something like pictures drawn by children.</p>
