        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Now I know it is good to question everything but I honestly believe the conspiracy movement has gone absolutely batshit insane lately.</p>

<p>Every event that happens is immediately a conspiracy. Without any proof to back anything up it is immediately classed a false flag. People were calling the Boston bombings a false flag within 5 minutes and they had absolute nothing to go on.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fairly obvious now that it wasn&#39;t staged and isn&#39;t a false flag but people seem to desperately be clinging onto the fiction that is was staged. Not that staging it would make any sense because it would be easier to drop 2 real bombs.</p>

<p>Now with 9/11 the conspiracy wasn&#39;t with the attacks themselves but with how the government reacted to them.  Remember the whole WMD fiasco and attacking Iraq which was just swept under the rug?  However instead of concentrating on that the movement tries to desperately come up with these ridiculous reasons on why the towers fell. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFVoencqfZw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFVoencqfZw</a>
That is the leader for A&amp;E for 911 truth explaining the 9/11 explosion conspiracy when quite frankly anyone that has even had a whiff of engineering in their life can tell you how incredibly wrong he is with that experiment yet you use him as the truth.</p>

<p>I am in no way saying conspiracy&#39;s don&#39;t happen because they do but the whole community seems to jump on these batshit insane ones without a lick of proof and actually hurts government accountability. Since if anyone questions events that are dodgy they are immediately thrown into the batshit insane 9/11 conspiracy movement. </p>

<p>You guys bring up questions now and it is just shrugged off as &quot;these 9/11 fucktards&quot;    </p>

<p>A lot of you say you are truth seekers but you immediately have your angle with every event.   You seek your truth and not the real truth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s honestly saddening to see that a community that in theory should be so skeptical isn&#39;t with anything that backs their beliefs, the default is rejecting anything unless it supports you and even with new evidence coming to light you never update your position. </p>

<p>Anyway you can let your thoughts known here but I seriously don&#39;t want to debate the actually event of 9/11. I studied engineering (Although not my field) and have family members that are engineers and I can tell you flat out that the towers reacted exactly as expected. If you think otherwise you have 0 understanding of engineering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If 290 people are convinced that Boston was a false flag, that is less than 1% of the subscribers here.</p>

<p>People like to speculate about these things man, the reason they do is because of our government&#39;s history of top secret bullshit.  </p>

<p>How many governments does the CIA  need to overthrow for american corperations before the general public starts to distrust everything that happens?</p>

<p>The government has brought this distrust upon themselves.  Same with terrorism they have created conspiracy theorist.  You&#39;ll have to excuse me if I&#39;m not apologetic about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely an issue that deserves some attention, though I&#39;m not certain what the solution is. I&#39;ve taken to viewing <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> quite differently than i view other news and discussion subreddits, sorting mostly by /new/ and learning to identify the garbage posts, the titles that include meaningless hyperbole &quot;Is there something they aren&#39;t telling us?!?&quot;, the things from sites i know are pathos-filled and often have little or no sources (e.g. infowars). It requires a little more investment of time, but there is still good content here.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not a casual visitor. I&#39;m not a non-subscriber coming in to get an impression of the subreddit and community. Those folks get a different image, more like what you&#39;re describing. I think we can figure out a solution there, I&#39;m just not yet certain what it will be. It could be more restrictive posting rules, it could be tags and filtered searches, it could be separate subreddits like <a href="/r/credibleconspiracy">/r/credibleconspiracy</a>. I believe you make some good points, and I promise this discussion won&#39;t die just because your submission was downvoted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Proven conspiracies were often only proven after investigation and action by people who shared and discovered information about those conspiracies before they were proven. Look at MKULTRA for example. Loads of speculation about it, a few leaks here and there. But it wasn&#39;t proven until the people who had discussed and hypothesized about it ad nauseum were able to get documents on it through some persistent FOI requests. Yes there&#39;s a lot of BS here, and there are accounts that appear naive and extremist. It&#39;s a diverse community using this subreddit, and a few minutes sifting through the /new/ page will show a diverse variety of content with some being garbage and others being fairly valuable and interesting. If we were to focus solely on conspiracies that have been proven true, we&#39;d be better branded as something like r/conspiracyhistory or r/historyofconspiracy. Not that that wouldn&#39;t be a valuable and interesting subreddit to participate in and observe, but it wouldn&#39;t fulfil some of the functions this one does which are still valuable.</p>

<p>But you see, this kind of discussion could produce valuable insights for both participants. If we only were discussing proven conspiracies on this subreddit, well we&#39;d just be sitting here saying &quot;yep, that was a derned conspiracy.&quot;</p>

<p>Though if you do want to talk about how people keep conspiracies secret, we can talk about compartmentalization of information, which works exceptionally well for intelligence agencies across the planet, and worked quite nicely for the Manhattan Project just as an example.</p>

<p>What is so obvious that it wasn&#39;t a false flag? And no I don&#39;t think it was staged using actors. Bombs really went off and hurt people. However, it is possible that Craft international, or someone else, was responsible for dropping the bombs. It is also likely this was another FBI sting gone wrong. </p>

<p>The rest of your post just generalizes millions of people into a single group with one line of thinking, which is an outlandish lie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, just to note, 5 vs 500 isn&#39;t a little mistake... that&#39;s a massive mistake. The kinetic energy of five 747&#39;s is RADICALLY less than with five hundred 747s.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s such a significant amount of flaws in your posts here today I&#39;m honestly having a hard time knowing where to even start...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The building had no chance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea well, planes of similar size have hit smaller buildings than the WTC towers and didn&#39;t fall down. The twin towers were literally specifically engineered to not fall down if a plane hit it in the worst possible spot. MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS of dollars were spent just for this particular engineering task. Do you not find it odd that in all of history, there&#39;s never been a sky scraper to just crumble and fall from a fucking fire... and there&#39;s been fires MUCH more massive than the 9/11 fires in buildings far weaker than the twin towers and those buildings didn&#39;t crumble. Sure you can say that just because other buildings didn&#39;t fall from epic fires and explosions doesn&#39;t mean that the twin towers couldn&#39;t have fallen due to those reasons... but dude... I&#39;m not really sure how to put this so I&#39;ll try an example... If I drop a ball from my hand and it falls straight to the ground every damn time (say 99/100), then one time someone runs up and smacks the ball away before it hits the ground and there is lots of evidence of this happening, would you then assume that somehow for some reason a massive super wind gust strong enough to blow the ball away did so just because the person who supposedly smacked the ball says that&#39;s what happened? Is anything starting to sink in yet?</p>

<p>Making a mistake of 5 vs 500 demonstrates that while you may grasp some of the underlying concepts, you aren&#39;t able to accurately visualize or process all the dynamics/physics/math of the WTC building&#39;s destruction. </p>

<p>Nice effort on the math though, I&#39;ll give you an A for effort. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm... check your facts dude. Enough Thermite to take down a WTC tower is EASILY obtainable by any government or other entity with a bit of money and common connections in that sort of market. </p>

<p>Anyways, it&#39;s seeming to me (correct me if I&#39;m wrong) but you don&#39;t seem to have a basic fundamental grasp of math and physics as applied to the real world. I mean... you were talking about 500 747&#39;s worth of energy above in another post (ridiculousness) and now you fail to grasp that with the proper calculations and correct placement Thermite and explosive combos could take down basically any building in the world. </p>

<p>Go ask someone who&#39;s reputably trained in demolition.</p>

<p>No not quite, but I also wouldn&#39;t try to do so and then make a post about it as if the results are accurate before even checking like you did... </p>

<p>Well I honestly figured the towers weighed more but even still the amount of force the tower falling is just staggering, more than enough to take out the bulding.</p>

<p>more than enough</p>

<p>I have... oh and also physicists, and mathmeticians, and demolitionists, and chemists and even biologists (though they weren&#39;t very helpful).</p>

<p>Anyways... you didn&#39;t make any comments about what I said in regards to obtaining Thermite. Did you realize you were wrong about this one? I mean, I just did some google searches and figured out what I&#39;d have to do if I desired to obtain a lot of Thermite... also, you can buy it on the deep web successfully lulz (not huge amounts of course, but still...)</p>
