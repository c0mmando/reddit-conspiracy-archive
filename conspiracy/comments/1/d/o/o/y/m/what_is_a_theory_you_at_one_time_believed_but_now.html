<p>Although I guess the closest thing to what you&#39;re asking, is that I did once think that no plane hit the Pentagon. On balance, I think that&#39;s unlikely. I also think that whole discussion is a purposely placed &#39;carrot on a stick&#39;. I have zero doubt that they have clear footage of what hit that building, it&#39;s just more detrimental to the truth &#39;movement&#39; to have people on either side of that fence, so releasing it is of no advantage to the establishment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think there are still some weird-as-fuck things about it, but the single issue of whether is was a plane or not? The weirdness and unlikely heights/angles/path that the plane took are outweighed by the physical evidence. </p>

<p>Although there is no doubt in my mind that Hani Hanjour wasn&#39;t controlling that plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That people could &quot;learn&quot; psychic abilities willy nilly.  I believed it at the time because I was 12 and I was interested in the subject.  I still am interested in the subject, and I&#39;m interested in the interest our governments had/have in the abilities.  But I don&#39;t think that some 14 year old Dragon Ball Z fan is going to learn how to blow a hole through a wall with a Psi Ball.  </p>

<p>I quit believing when the communities that discussed those topics became overrun with fantasy driven individuals who wanted to be Super Saiyans and X-Men.  The fact that no one&#39;s &quot;abilities&quot; progressed beyond a flickering candle flame and a spinning piece of paper was all I needed to see to realize 99% of the people there were idiots.</p>

<p>More energy was put into coining new terms for abilities than actual research into the more well established phenomena we are familiar with.  It was the same way on every board that discussed psychic abilities.  Nearly 12 years later it looks like not much has changed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sports were newsworthy. Now I realize it&#39;s just a coalition of interests: sporting corporations selling a product to deluded and pacified fans to keep them animated and angry about the wrong things. That sports product is reported on by outside PR agents for the teams: sports journalists. The reason is that it fleshes out more easy content for daily papers and creates a new market for advertising, and it probably sells some additional papers. </p>

<p>I still like many professional sports though. I just understand they&#39;re not important. Human achievement and success are. Athleticism is. Pro sports are not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I didn&#39;t claim to be enlightened. I answered a direct question. You have no direct knowledge that 90% of sports fans feel this way.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a criminal or political &quot;conspiracy&quot; which had me believing in the newsworthiness of sports. It is, however, AS I WROTE, a coalition of like-minded interests. Business journalism is forbidden from being so incestual. Yes sports corporations act under different rules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, he has this bizarre crusade against GR and SR that seems to have originated from his loathing of all things &quot;relative&quot; and his furious allegations that, were any form of relativity to be true, it would somehow prove the Bible wrong.

<p>e: there&#39;s actually a long, drawn-out debate somewhere on Conservapedia where he <em>insists</em> that anyone who thinks that the r<sup>2</sup> term in Newton&#39;s law of universal gravitation might not actually be r<sup>2.000000001</sup> is simply closed-minded; I&#39;ll try to find it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read most of that page, and now regret it. He only wants to discredit relativity, for no apparent reason. Not only does he not know anything about the subject, but he is completely ignorant on how science works. There was a time when I disagreed with SR, but that was when I didn&#39;t know enough about it. Now that I understand it, it seems irrefutable to me. I think this is the situation Schlafly is currently in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few years ago, I believed that humankind might navigate our way out of the rapidly concentrating clusterf**k of means by which our fellow human beings are trying to destroy ourselves.  I hoped some &quot;crash&quot; might happen quickly enough to derail these myriad attempts our fellow idiots are working on to doom us all.  I thought the many clear and hopeful signs of our conscious-evolution as a civilization (which is, undeniably, progressing), might push back the darkness of our 4,000-plus years of self-centered power-struggles.</p>

<p>I no longer believe that.</p>

<p>Like Hugh Howey of &quot;Wool&quot; fame, I see too many &quot;inevitables&quot; clouding our future.  Too many clod-headed idiots working diligently, mindlessly, on ways to destroy us all in the quickest of a heartbeat: self-replicating nanotechnology, super-viruses, robotic flying insects, GMO food-staples...hell, even Kurt Vonnegut&#39;s &quot;Ice-9&quot; is probably sitting in some quote/unquote &quot;scientific&quot; research/Gov&#39;t lab somewhere.  Waiting.  For the inevitable.  (And this doesn&#39;t even address the fuzzy-headed people working on &quot;crowd-control&quot; weaponry, financial &#39;derivatives&#39; scheming, water-&#39;rights&#39; ownership, etc....)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve begun to recognize that, once discovered, these technologies proliferate.  They&#39;re not like nuclear energy...they&#39;re not commensurately expensive and/or difficult in accordance with their ability to destroy vast numbers of human beings.  They&#39;re weapons of guerilla armageddon.  They&#39;re here, and they&#39;re relatively easy pickings, so they are certainly going to find their way into the hands of one-or-another sociopath with one-or-another agenda.  Period.  Therefore, as long as there are righteous Quixote&#39;s with some moderate amount of money and clout, the clock is ticking.  We&#39;re all living on borrowed time...</p>

<p>That said...I&#39;m actually really enjoying my life very much right now.  I delight in my children and my community.  Life is a Blessing to me.  Right Now.  I Hope for the Best, Prepare for the Worst, and work to Accept whatever Comes.  C&#39;est la Vie, you know?</p>

<p>You have no proof of that, it&#39;s just a wild assumption.</p>

<p>And what is it about the Crusades that makes it so special? You do realize that the Crusades were largely a reaction against centuries of Islam encroaching on Christendom? It wasn&#39;t just all of a sudden big mean evil Christians came stomping through the middle east and murdered poor innocent Muslims for no reason. What is different about the wars between Christendom and Islam during the crusades, and lets say, the wars between France and England during the Hundred Years War? What makes one more evil than the other? Killing for king and country is the same as killing for God.</p>

<p>Sometimes I see the opposite - humans are inherently evil creatures that have a purpose: to destroy that which is naturally created. Maybe its to bring on change. Maybe we&#39;st just a destructive force and a catalyst of change, like wind or water on earth creating crevasses and chasms.. </p>

<p>Maybe its all just an illusion.</p>
