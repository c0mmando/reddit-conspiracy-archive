    <div class="md"><p>And yet /conspiratard has no problem with  constantly linking to /conspiracy with obvious intent to disrupt it.  They believe, fanatically, that they have a mission to tell others what to believe or not believe. If you don&#39;t believe in what they say is truth, you get attacked by brigades. with lies, all the usual tools. They want to suppress discussion and they support only the official version of truth. They are the Fox News of Reddit, and run for the same purposes.</p>

<p>Not only that, they even sometimes celebrate disrupting /conspiracy, publicly cheer that they accomplished a disruption of another sub. That&#39;s not standing up for truth, it&#39;s mob crime. But after all, that sub is owned by notorious Neocon shill JCM267. It&#39;s visibly run for the benefit of political forces. So no wonder they want to shut up discussion.</p>

<p>Beware of false-flags posts here calling for attacks on other subs. ctards have no problem with lying to  frame other groups.</p>

<p>I see that the /conspiratard cross post has brown-shirt brigaded this sub, as usual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You still have not provided evidence of me seeking an ego boost. I can provide you a series of academic studies that detail the correlation between ego and conspiracy theories, if you would like me to; yet I have not personally accused you of this. You accuse me of the same yet provide no evidence whatsoever besides an overarching claim about satire.</p>

<p>EDIT: I just looked through your comment history and found you to be repeatedly referring to the Boston Marathon Bombings as an &quot;FBI engineered false-flag.&quot; You talk about the need to put others down? How do you think the families of the victims feel about your opinions? How can you possibly criticise the way I treat others and then hold such sickening and tasteless views yourself? You have crossed the line where you care more about the conspiracy theory than grossly offending other human beings, and therefore you have no right to accuse me of &quot;putting strangers down.&quot;  </p>

<p>Since I didn&#39;t say that, evidence does not support your claim. Don&#39;t bother lying on this again, that&#39;s weak. But typical of the way you ctards lie all the time.  Do they give you an office for this or are you paid to work from home?</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s a demonstrated lie. /conspiratard frequently gets cross posts attacking people in other subs who never once reference /conspiratard in their discussions. It is your people who decide to invade other subs. I counted seven cross posts  today in /conspiratard attacking other subs for their stated opinions, when they did not insult you or even mention you. This disproves your lie and shows how you people have an agenda against free speech.</p>

<p>Really it&#39;s not, we sit in our own forum and laugh at you for the stupid shit you post.

<p>Not true and easily proven not true by a simple review of /conspiratard posts. Plus the Shyamalan twist is that your group simply denies something is evidence and then uses that presumption to attack people. You play a twisted game, &#39;tards.</p>

<p>AND beside that your group invades other subs and brigades them to silence commenters. More distortions from, you, really. Why do you hate others expressing their opinions? Your agenda is to deny people the right of free open speech. You seem to be on a Mission From God to shut up anyone not sharing your views. In your jackboot world, only you have the right to state opinions. It seems you believe it&#39;s your holy right to mock others but not for others to open their mouths. The Germans or the Spanish Inquisition would be proud of you, </p>

<p>An attack on /conspiracy by means of wild claims with a heading of &quot;<a href="/r/worldpolitics">/r/worldpolitics</a> , the sister sub of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where racism is even more acceptable&quot;.  And yet /conspiracy did not reference /conspiratard in their discussions, but your group decided to attack this third party.</p>

<p>Your assertion was a lie, these are links proving your lie, and now, stop lying, hypocrite yourself, It&#39;s clear you people consider other people giving an opinion to be an insult to you if they don&#39;t agree with your opinion, justifying your attack on their right to speak.

<p>Thing is, you say &quot;YOU ATTACK&quot;, I don&#39;t see any attacks there, just people providing the correct information. Funnily enough you conspiratards take that as an attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I guess <em>it is easier</em> to make fun of me for being new around here, but what does that get you? Nothing. The validity of the reply post still stands. The points made in the my reply have yet to receive a rebuttal. Unless you would like to try and refute them. But then again, the would be the opposite of easy. Or instead you can just leave it with your very thoughtful and mature opening: &quot;Hahahahah 27 day old socks account with three comments.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, but we all know why the name was created and for whom... Seeing that we regularly have posts from former conspiratards explaining how far into the world of crazy conspiracy theory they were and what brought them out of it, to sanity.  But whatever floats your boat. I guess, ignorance truly is blissful, though.</p>

<p>I guess you really are failing to see the point here. /Conspiratard is to the Onion, as what /Conspiracy is to Fox News. We are largely a satire subreddit that pokes fun at the &quot;conspiracies&quot; so many of you hold to. I really wish you guys didn&#39;t have to sullen the name of conspiracy theory with your factless and wildly improbable scenarios. When there are actual fact-based conspiracy out there that are getting a bad name because of this sudden Alex Jones idea of everything is false-flag and the government is out to get you b.s., he&#39;s been saying that trash for years and he&#39;ll be saying for years in the future from a mic located within the stable country of United States of America. And he&#39;ll be even richer then because he sells to his followers exactly what he preaches against...FEAR.  </p>

<p>No, /conspiratard goes on bombing runs to other subs and  tries to disrupt them. Vicious mockery of opposing opinion is only a part of what it does. Your defense of it all says enough about you and your level of honesty. Go and paint graffiti, it&#39;s more your moral level.</p>

<p>Yet again, you seem to just be explaining yourself. And I have more important things to do than go on &quot;bombing runs&quot; or whatever that means... </p>

<p>Also, no one thinks they are superior for simple fact of feeling superior. Now if your argument is lacking in the factual evidence department, then yes, I will feel like my point of view is superior than yours because your point of view is not based on fact, and only based on speculation and &quot;how you feel.&quot; </p>

<p>I love conspiracy theories as much as the next guy (who loves conspiracy theories...). I just prefer my conspiracies to be based on some tangible evidence and not pure speculation. The idea that bankers and corporations run our government is a conspiracy I can get behind, because I see tangible evidence that points to a correlation. On the other hand, 9/11 truther business, I just don&#39;t see evidence on an inside job. I see simple physics at work. Now did Bush take advantage of the situation? Most certainly. </p>

<p>I guess overall that&#39;s my issue with the direction this subreddit has taken. When I joined, it was more about factual conspiracies and not all of this false flag or monsanto b.s. </p>

<p>There&#39;s <a href="http://www.nickpope.net/conspiracy-theories-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly.htm">an article</a> you should read by Nick Pope, the former UFO investigator for the UK ministry of defense. It&#39;s called Conspiracy Theories -The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It&#39;s a little more focused on UFOs but I like it because he explains there are good conspiracies and there are bad conspiracies. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t insulted you once (but I probably should, seeing as you keep insisting I&#39;m proving your point, it would work well). I laid out lolcatsbelow&#39;s points for you by quoting him where you insisted there were none.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it gets insulting when some of your lads (granted, not necessarily all of you) feel the need to shove their conspiracies in the faces of victim&#39;s families after every major disaster. I&#39;m fine with silly conspiracy theories flying around and I&#39;m fine with those who look into conspiracy theories simply because they are interested by the theories (however, this seems to be a common cop-out used by avid theory supporters once their conspiracy is debunked). It becomes a whole different matter when conspiracy theorists harass families and disrespect the recently dead of EVERY single major recent tragedy. You call us weak-minded and lazy? That behaviour is at the very least malicious and morally reprehensible. </p>

<p>EDIT: If you have a problem with someone who &quot;harass families&quot; then please take it up with them.  With that said, I have no problem with people discussing alternatives to the &quot;official&quot; narrative of a story.  I respect those who have lost loved ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weak minded and lazy is believing anything you see in a youtube video and proceeding to doubt anything of professional verification. When I was younger, I had a friend who believed every single conspiracy theory he came across. He claimed that he didn&#39;t actually BELIEVE believe them, they only interested him, but one minute in conversation would reveal this to be far from true. I had no real issue with him until he started getting very racist with the theories which he chose to believe, regarding the inferiority of races and the the global Jewish conspiracy. I watched him transform from being a standard conspiracy theorist into a giant conspiratard. For me, this transition is marked by the callous disregard for other humans. Elevating the theory over other human beings. </p>

<p>After he got further and further into the &quot;rabbit hole,&quot; he quit his job and began spending his entire day watching youtube conspiracy videos, preparing for the end of days, and harassing the families of &quot;crisis actors.&quot; My best friend and I were talking about him one day and he said &quot;You could tell that man the sky is real and he would never believe you. Show him a shitty youtube video about the sky really being yellow because the evil aliens use our planet as a sewage system, and he&#39;d be right there with you.&quot;  </p>

<p>I think conspiracies are an ego issue. Theorists have statistically been proven to sign onto a plethora of theories, even if some of them contradict. From my personal, anecdotal experience, conspiracies are a way for some people to ensure that they are more important than the pack. They know more. They&#39;re more valuable. &quot;They&#39;re awake.&quot; Once again, I think that these people have problems, but you&#39;re right, that&#39;s not necessarily a strong reason to call them conspiratards. But once those people truly buy into it and do so in a racially, culturally, or theologically discriminating manner...that becomes conspiratard for me. When the theorists decide that the best way to go about living is to be sticking microphones and cameras in the faces of victims&#39; families and yelling at them to renounce that the horrific events which happened to them truly happened. That&#39;s conspiratard. Everyone has their own definition for what a conspiratard is, and I&#39;m sure that everybody who browses the lands of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> has a different reason; but that is my reason. </p>

<p>You can call it &quot;weakminded&quot; or &quot;lazy,&quot; but take a step back and evaluate how you yourself have been living life. Do you believe an unreasonable amount of these theories? Do you tend to put more faith in a youtube video than a peer-reviewed academic study? Maybe the non-believers aren&#39;t the &quot;sheep,&quot; the peons, the weak-minded. Evaluate yourself. Perhaps you have a driving desire to be different from the pack...and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that at all! That&#39;s a lovely trait, but perhaps conspiracy theories are not the best way to channel this desire, as they can be dangerous and guide you down a slippery, slippery slope. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never once directly insulted you. In fact, I wrote a fairly long reply detailing how exactly I avoided insulting you; a response which you admittedly failed to read. This is a fairly one-sided conversation, as I am providing logic and explanations for my actions while you are constantly replying with the same message by calling me weak-minded and lazy. I&#39;m sorry that you interpreted my words as insulting, but you truly handled this conversation by sticking your fingers into your ears and repeating the words &quot;weak-minded and lazy.&quot; I put you into a &quot;tight little box&quot; because you are unfamiliar with people presenting opinions which sharply contradict your own. You assume that <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is filled exclusively with people who watch conspiracy videos and write LOL RETARDS. I just fail to understand why you are so averse to having a logical discussion about the matter, if you truly do dislike the insulting and trolling nature of conspiratard, then please formulate a reasoned response to my &quot;TL;DR&quot; post. If you fail to do this, then you clearly have no interest in having a logical discussion on the matter, and thus I will proceed to call you &quot;weakminded and lazy&quot; until you do so.</p>
