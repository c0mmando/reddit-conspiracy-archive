       You guys here, are very tame, logical and healthily skeptical when it comes to conspiracies, that's why I remain subscribed.

       I browsed
       <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/">
        http://www.abovetopsecret.com/

       and I can tell you now, the typical user over there is delusional and undereducated.
Too often did I see threads resembling things like "Reptilian stole the wrist watch from my mind" "Vaccinations causing mind control (PROOF VIDEO INSIDE)" and other silly shit.

       So keep up the good work.

       But really, in all seriousness, I'm quite glad to have found this place.  The Boston Bombings rekindled my inner skeptic/conspiracy theorist that had long lain dormant.  It's been an interesting and enlightening ten days since.  Not saying I buy into all the stuff that's posted here, but I'll take it over unquestioning, mindless complacency any day.

       This is all we are really asking for. A "Who-the-hell-do-they-think-they're-fooling".

       Almost all conspiracies boil down to people trying to fuck over people for money and power. It's important to be wary of this in order to steer clear of being on the receiving end of being fucked over as much as possible.

       I think its a good way to get the other side of the story of the things that aren't covered as much. Hell, there's even breaking news here. The plane that crashed on Afghanistan was posted here before I saw it even on the news. Outside of this sub there is plenty of shit thrown at it but mostly its uniformed one liners that people upvote without a second thought to actually come here and spend some time seeing what gets posted.

       I first learned about the Boston bombing here from a redditors post!! Literally minutes after the first explosion had happened!! The community that follows this subreddit are honestly just your average joe who wants to take a different perspective than what the MSM is pumping out. I mean if we are going to be force fed fear, we at least get to choose what horror sequence to follow. But in the end, it's nice knowing that there are plenty of individuals simply seeking truth.

       I'm not much into conspiracy theories and mainly just lurk here to see some opposing ideas to the norm.  Sometimes I get involved if something is clearly someone trying to create something that isn't there.  But I love going to ATS for the entertainment value.  One of my favorites is some guy was theorizing there muse be some inter-dimensional rift, gateway, or some other crazy shit in the Indian Ocean when everyone went there to fight pirates.

       And that's why I don't understand why people come to this sub and call us crazy. Crazy is like what you said they said "meds cause mind control". I recently got into an arguement with this guy who claimed we were idiots for thinking the Boston bombers might be innocent. "The FBI released proof that they did it, and they said they did it, what more do you guys need?!". I told him he's an idiot for assuming the FBI is telling the whole truth after they admitted to lying already (unarmed suspect in boat). Never be afraid to question authority. Its not a crime to do so, and if they have nothing to hide they will answer accordingly.

       That's the problem though isnt it? People are indirectly conditioned to be shills, they are told every which way by the MSM that anyone who questions the official story of anything is a nut. They dont even realise that they are the ones who need help. That they need to realise that while we might be wrong on many aspects, such is the nature of disinformation, that the mere act of questioning it is not in itself a bad thing and will lead to actual justice in real life. For many years Liverpool football club questioned the official story of the Hillsborough disaster in which the police and goverment had colluded to blame the clubs fans on the 96 deaths that occured in a stadium disaster when, in fact, the police didnt do their jobs properly causing the problem and in a lot of cases, altered evidence to cast a poor light on the LFC fans - not helped by a mainstream tabloid newspaper printing yet more lies about how the Liverpool fans were robbing the dead and urinating on their bodies. This has now been discovered to be a massive lie. The clubs fans were not responsible and now a new investigation has been started to work out what happened and who was to blame (Though I think Kenny Dalglish might be all to happy to fill in the blanks for them). This is a small scale cover up in regards to the rest of the world but if you can see it happen, if you can see the proof in front of your very eyes that the authorities are corrupt, the very definition of insanity would be putting complete faith in any other governing or law enforcement bodies not to do the same thing again - i.e. doing the same thing multiple times and expecting a different result (paraphrase from Einstein). In fact, questioning official stories should be celebrated - in the case of hillsborough, the corruption has been exposed and justice will eventually be served. If we question more things, the same will happen. You see millions of memes talking up philsophers, scientists and any of the great thinkers in history yet, as soon as someone else begins to theorise anything other than the bilge spewing out of the media then they are shot down and labelled a moron. I dont care if people think I am a moron for reading extensively on each new story i hear rather than swallowing the "official line" (which in a lot of cases changes during the lifespan of the incident in the news) then that is fine by me. I just dont have the prospect of it all hitting me at once at any point. That shit could drive you to suicide.

       The Sun newspaper, Kelvin Mckenzie and others that covered up Hillsborough are disgusting. I'm a United fan but what was done isn't just confined to LFC. That was a conspiracy that I think went to the top of government with Thatcher and its ongoing.

       Yes mate, I missed many specifics as it was just to point out a high profile case in which government and police authorities covered something up to save face which has, by the ceaseless dedication of everyone afiliated with the Hillsborough Justics Campaign, finally come to light ande (hopefully) justice will now be served. But it begs the question, what else has been covered up? The riots? Did he have a gun that caused the police to shoot him? Or did the police just shoot them? So many other incidents to question too. Yet doing so gets me labelled a conspiracy nut? Fuck that. Also, begrudgingly, congrats on title no.20. We'll be back... next year... hehe YNWA JTF96!

       Cheers. It wasn't exactly an exciting win though this year was it? I know what you mean as well. The case of that guy in London who the police shot wast interesting. It was Mark Dugan who they followed on the intelligence he had a gun. They shot him and said he pulled a gun but it was found stashed away in the car, somehow a police radio got a bullet graze and they removed the car from the scene and brought it back an hour later. Very fishy indeed.

       Not as exciting as watching Jordan Henderson score two goals in a single game. Not season. GAME! hehe. I've never really read into the riots to be honest, I may spend some time on that this week. It all looked horrendously fishy to me. I do remember watching a BBC journalist talking to Darcus Howe (
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzDQCT0AJcw">
        video here
       </a>
       ), a gentleman from the area who, when he said "we dont know what this started off and questions need to be asked, I could sense this coming because of the way the young people are treated etc." was basically asked "are you saying you support the rioters? Is that what you are saying? - also, it says here, you ARE a rioter". Straw-man arguments and outright accusations based on nothing at all. I do not trust the BBC and never will. They also were taken to court recently over the way they treated a well respected scientist in the field of explosives and demolition who, after reviewing the evidence, states that WTC7 was a controlled demolition. Nothing more than that - no major government conspiracy, just the information he gleaned from the evidence at hand. Just that it was a controlled demolition. He had his words twisted and was treated much the same as the guy being interviewed about the riots. Someone went to court over the fact that the BBC was not acting without bias and therefore were aiding terrorists which meant he refused to pay his license fee and the judge couldnt disagree with him. I dont think it was an outright win for the guy but they did agree that something was amiss.
       <a href="http://www.killingauntiefilms.co.uk/">
        Details on that one here
       </a>
       . I struggle to rationalise a lot of what comes out of people's mouths in this sub but I would never attack them for it, but questioning everything should be the first thing you do. And the first question is "who stands to gain from this?". There is always an answer to that, if you dont know it, or have no clues, then you arent questioning hard enough!

       Meh, semantics. It is the influence that they have which is important not what they are called. But yeah, I think that a shill is paid or incentivised and the rest are just the sheeple.

       Its relieving to hear a comment like that. 80% of the posts here are factually/evidence based (pics/videos/link to proof) questions, and its really sad that pointing to legitimate evidence to question the logic of the established belief gets you labled a kook.

       The biggest problem with ATS is the huge amount of religious propaganda mixed into the other discussions. Most people at ATS have their religion first and foremost. How can you be seriously interested in truth, when you take the words of Bronze age goat herders as trumping that of the scientific method?

       Older than that were the goat herders who coined the term atom.  The smallest building block of matter.

       People aren't really any smarter today than they were 5000 years ago, we just have a larger tomb of knowledge to learn from before we start our adult lives. And to be frank, I've met my fair share of atheist who are complete morons as individuals and only repeat the atheistic dogma that they learn from their more intelligent peers.
