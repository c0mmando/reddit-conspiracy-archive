        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A number of Wikipedia editors are conspiring in order to suppress the inclusion of the Psychotronics program, which was recently mentioned by Vladimir Putin as being a large part of their 2011-2020 weapons program. This is a mind control program that dates back to the 60&#39;s, and these editors have it redirecting to a page about a parapsychologist&#39;s psuedoscience rather than the ongoing multi-decade program. They have requested deletion of the historically accurate page, in an attempt to redirect it to obfuscated disinformation.</p>

<p>Please check pages:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotronics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotronics</a>
and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotronic_weapons">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotronic_weapons</a></p>

<p>Check the Talk and History pages also.</p>

<p>Some of these editors individually have been instrumental in suppressing evidence in the Boston bombing page, and the Korea conflict page.  I imagine the new editor walked into a bear trap.  Regardless, the pages, and History show the obviousness of this circle&#39;s censorship goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok but even if we go ahead and assume that Psychotronics is factual, can we at the very least agree that these Wikipedia editors are likely suppressing the article because they are unwilling to objectively research what they see as a fringe idea?  Can we at least agree that it&#39;s probably not because they are paid government agents working as part of a sinister international organization?</p>

<p>Please tell me we can all agree on that likelihood.  </p>

The core group of Wikipedia editors are almost certainly agents of one government or another.  Probably the Israeli government.  And this group likely morphed into the beginnings of the JIDF.</p>

The Internet was a creation of DARPA. It&#39;s foolish to think they would have just relinquished control of it. I feel the same about TOR. It was created by the military, so why do people feel invisible on it? The infrastructure and laws have been established for federal authorities to participate in law enforcement at the local level. They see we&#39;re accepting this, and soon the beast will really show its teeth. </p>

<p>Psychotronics is THE big conspiracy. It&#39;s why the NSA is monitoring &quot;unintentional intelligence bearing signals&quot; (nerve firings in humans), and, as Putin said, like Khrushchev before him- there are weapons far more terrible than the atom bomb. I wouldn&#39;t have believed it either, but the US government is, literally, torturing its citizens with neurological weapons right now.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right.
I suggest others read the links above, as there is obviously something wrong here. 
The entry for &quot;psychotronic weapons&quot; is meticulously sourced, and there are two editors w/names similar to &quot;Louie&quot; insisting it be removed- for no discernible reason at all, aside from their moot, and unproven, contentions about the submitter&#39;s beliefs. 
The essay linked to in &quot;the truth&quot; may support the position that the majority opinion is the truth, but what if the majority opinion is, perhaps counter-intuitively, woefully ignorant? Citations from the Army, NSA, Russian President, New York Times, Washington Post, etc aren&#39;t Wikipedia-worthy? 
If the author is reading this, thank you for your research, and calm irrefutable rebuttals to the &quot;louies.&quot; </p>

<p>This contains many citations on psychotronics, including a link to a report by the European Parliament’s STOA (Science and Technological Options Assessment) panel “Crowd Control Technologies” the originally proposed text of the European Parliament’s resolution is quoted.</p>

<p>There the European Parliament calls “for an international convention and global ban on all research and development , whether civilian or military , which seeks to apply knowledge of the chemical, electrical, sound vibration or other functioning of the human brain to the development of weapons which might enable any form of manipulation of human beings, including a ban on any actual or possible deployment (stressed by the author of the article) of such systems“. (40, pg CII, ref. 369)
Directed energy system is further defined by the STOA document: 
&quot;Directed energy weapon system designed to match radio frequency source to interfere with human brain activity at synapse level“ (at the bottom of the page, first reference, Appendix 6-67)</p>
