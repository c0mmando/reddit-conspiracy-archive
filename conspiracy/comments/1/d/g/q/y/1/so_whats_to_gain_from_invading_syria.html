        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know they have oil but compared to other places, it doesn&#39;t seem much. is it simple for another spot next to Iran. What is the deal with Iran anyway. I mean, when it comes to oil doesn&#39;t Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have more?  besides the nuclear hyperbole and the Iran&#39;s hatred of Israel what makes it so important. what is so geographically great about these places.</p>

<p>EDIT: I just find it interesting that we wouldn&#39;t invade(not that we should) over something <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=H40EsEVU1Wk">like this</a>. Then we say to the <strong>world</strong> we wouldn&#39;t do anything unless they use chemical weapons. then all of a sudden we have reports of chemical weapon attacks. Either the Government is stupid(which i doubt or someone sure as hell wants the US to bring a capitalistic democracy to Syria.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Syria is Iran&#39;s biggest ally in the region. If Iran is attacked before Syria, Israel would be in a very bad situation because its possible Syria would either directly attack Israel in response or it would funnel weapons to Hamas. </p>

<p>This is a post I made the other day explaining that it is again Neo-Cons and Israeli advocates that have been part of a conspiracy against Syria as it was with the Iraq war.</p>

<p>First off, back to 1996 when Richard Perle (US senator) writes a paper for Israel and Benjamin Netanyahu on how to increase Israeli regional security.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clean_Break:_A_New_Strategy_for_Securing_the_Realm">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clean_Break:_A_New_Strategy_for_Securing_the_Realm</a></p>

<p>&quot;A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm (commonly known as the &quot;Clean Break&quot; report) is a policy document that was prepared in 1996 by a study group led by Richard Perle for Benjamin Netanyahu, the then Prime Minister of Israel.[1] The report explained a new approach to solving Israel&#39;s security problems in the Middle East with an emphasis on &quot;Western values&quot;. <strong>It has since been criticized for advocating an aggressive new policy including the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, and the containment of Syria by engaging in proxy warfare and highlighting their possession of &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot;.</strong></p>

<p>One year later in 1997 Richard Perle is a signatory to PNAC, an American think tank that funnily enough has the same ideas for the Middle East that a year before was written to improve Israeli security, specifically about removing Saddam Hussein from power. But that alone is just a think tank document right? Well the same people that were signatories to that document just so happened to make it into the Bush administration in key positions.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century</a></p>

<p>&quot;The Project for the New American Century (PNAC) was an American think tank based in Washington, D.C. established in 1997 as a non-profit educational organization founded by William Kristol and Robert Kagan. The PNAC&#39;s stated goal is &quot;to promote American global leadership.&quot;[1] Fundamental to the PNAC were the view that &quot;American leadership is both good for America and good for the world&quot; and support for &quot;a Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity.&quot;[2] <strong>The PNAC exerted influence on high-level U.S. government officials in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush and affected the Bush Administration&#39;s development of military and foreign policies, especially involving national security and the Iraq War.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>But wait a minute, this was in 1996-1997 right so what&#39;s the deal with Syria apart from it being mentioned in the 1996 document that a proxy war in Syria should be fought and highlighting its ownership of WMD&#39;s?</p>

<p>Well, the same group of people that got into the Bush administration and wrote these tactics have been involved a long with the US government and think tanks in a conspiracy to fund opposition groups in Syria since 2006.</p>

<p>&quot;Though it is not yet stated US government policy to oust Assad by force, these spokespeople are vocal advocates of foreign military intervention in Syria and thus <strong>natural allies of well-known US neoconservatives who supported Bush&#39;s invasion of Iraq and are now pressuring the Obama administration to intervene.</strong> As we will see, several of these spokespeople have found support, and in some cases developed long and lucrative relationships with advocates of military intervention on both sides of the Atlantic.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Henry Jackson Society&#39;s international patrons include: James &quot;ex-CIA boss&quot; Woolsey, Michael &quot;homeland security&quot; Chertoff, <strong>William &quot;PNAC&quot; Kristol,</strong> <strong>Robert &quot;PNAC&quot; Kagan&#39;</strong>, Joshua &quot;Bomb Iran&quot; Muravchick, and <strong>Richard &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; Perle.</strong> The Society is run by Alan Mendoza, chief adviser to the all-party parliamentary group on transatlantic and international security.&quot;</p>

<p>So, the same people that made in into the Bush administration and lobbied for the Iraq war and also were in positions to &#39;advise&#39; that it happened, also wrote that Israel should engage in a proxy war (rebels) and should highlight Assad&#39;s WMD&#39;s have been part of a vast conspiracy spanning several well known think tanks and organisations and recruited people to play those roles where they are vocal about going to war.</p>

<p>&quot;Here is Bassma Kodmani, seen leaving this year&#39;s Bilderberg conference in Chantilly, Virginia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bassma Kodmani is a member of the executive bureau and head of foreign affairs, Syrian National Council. Kodmani is close to the centre of the SNC power structure, and one of the council&#39;s most vocal spokespeople. &quot;No dialogue with the ruling regime is possible. We can only discuss how to move on to a different political system,&quot; she declared this week. And here she is, quoted by the newswire AFP: &quot;The next step needs to be a resolution under Chapter VII, which allows for the use of all legitimate means, coercive means, embargo on arms, as well as the use of force to oblige the regime to comply.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This statement translates into the headline &quot;Syrians call for armed peacekeepers&quot; (Australia&#39;s Herald Sun). When large-scale international military action is being called for, it seems only reasonable to ask: who exactly is calling for it? We can say, simply, &quot;an official SNC spokesperson,&quot; or we can look a little closer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This year was Kodmani&#39;s second Bilderberg. At the 2008 conference, Kodmani was listed as French; by 2012, her Frenchness had fallen away and she was listed simply as &quot;international&quot; – her homeland had become the world of international relations.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Back a few years, in 2005, Kodmani was working for the Ford Foundation in Cairo, where she was director of their governance and international co-operation programme. The Ford Foundation is a vast organisation, headquartered in New York, and Kodmani was already fairly senior. But she was about to jump up a league.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Around this time, in February 2005, US-Syrian relations collapsed, and President Bush recalled his ambassador from Damascus. A lot of opposition projects date from this period. &quot;The US money for Syrian opposition figures began flowing under President George W Bush after he effectively froze political ties with Damascus in 2005,&quot; says the Washington Post.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In September 2005, Kodmani was made the executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative (ARI) – a research programme initiated by the powerful US lobby group, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The CFR is an elite US foreign policy thinktank, and the Arab Reform Initiative is described on its website as a &quot;CFR Project&quot; . More specifically, the ARI was initiated by a group within the CFR called the &quot;US/Middle East Project&quot; – a body of senior diplomats, intelligence officers and financiers, the stated aim of which is to undertake regional &quot;policy analysis&quot; in order &quot;to prevent conflict and promote stability&quot;. The US/Middle East Project pursues these goals under the guidance of an international board chaired by General (Ret.) Brent Scowcroft.&quot;</p>

<p>The questions should be, who exactly has used chemical weapons in Syria and who benefits because the Assad regime certainly doesn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, at work and unable to go for a long post. It&#39;s a well known talking point that Syria is an ally to Iran and taking out Syria would uncomplicate things quite a bit. Do a search on something like the road to Iran is through Syria and you will pull up a lot of info. The history of that area goes way back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>US foreign policy is pretty much dictated by Israel, one way or another. </p>

<p>Syria is Iran&#39;s main ally in the region, and crucial supply route to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has had a problem with all 3 of these players. And getting rid of Syria means weakening <em>both</em> Hezbollah and Iran, not just simply but severely because the two entities – Iran and Lebanon – do not share borders and <em>rely</em> upon Syria.</p>

<p>Israel has been planning to systematically get rid of Saddam and now Syria for a while now. It is essentially Israel&#39;s plan to be the ONLY country in the region that is capable of possessing WMD&#39;s. As such their strong opposition to Iran&#39;s nuclear program, and their under-the-table role in neutralizing Iraq and now Syria for their chemical arsenal.</p>

<p>With regards to Iraq, there were no chemical weapons but they went ahead and bombed them anyways; and they will do the same for Iran, even though all intelligence agencies agree, Iran doesn&#39;t have nukes or even close to it.</p>

<p>——</p>

<p>The plan for all this is outlined in their 1996 policy document– <strong>A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm</strong> — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clean_Break:_A_New_Strategy_for_Securing_the_Realm">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clean_Break:_A_New_Strategy_for_Securing_the_Realm</a></p>

<p>In it, it is planned that Saddam in Iraq shall be toppled, and Syria too will be destabilized and its WMDs shall be highlighted in order to isolate the country in the international arena (sanctions/embargo).</p>

<p>In implementation, things changed a little based upon real life circumstances. And alot of their plans for Syria ended up happening to Iraq, but they managed to topple Saddam and neutralize Iraq as a possible competition/threat to Israel in the end. And now that that&#39;s done, Syria happens to be next in line!</p>

<p>User &quot;HouseofHouse&quot; has also highlighted some of these issues: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dgqy1/so_whats_to_gain_from_invading_syria/c9q9435">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dgqy1/so_whats_to_gain_from_invading_syria/c9q9435</a></p>

<p>——</p>

<p>Lets look at all the people within the US administration who are largely responsible for the Iraq War. Since simply saying &quot;Israel did it, cuz they had an entire blueprint published for it!&quot; isn&#39;t going to convince everybody.</p>

<p>People like to blame Bush/Cheney for the war, and &quot;teh evi1 oil corporations&quot; for being the reason. But as far as I&#39;m concerned, this is entirely a made-up Leftist reason to HIDE the real people behind the plans. </p>

<p>The Liberal Left doesn&#39;t want to blame Israel, because most Jewish-American politicians<sup>who just happen to also be Zionists</sup> are Democrats. While the Radical Left just want to find a way to blame &quot;capitalism&quot; and what better way than to say its cause of the evil oil corporations and their profit-motive! </p>

<p>This entire premise totally disregards the fact that American oil corps didn&#39;t even benefit from the Iraq War. In fact, China is the one who benefited the most (even the first Iraqi oil contract went to china&#39;s CNPC). The US gets almost no oil from Iraq.</p>

<p>– <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/contributed/2013-03-30/was-iraq-war-about-grabbing-oil-%E2%80%A6-or-keeping-it-market">http://www.zerohedge.com/contributed/2013-03-30/...</a></p>

<p>– <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/03/27/187100/">http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/03/27/187100/</a></p>

<p>Now that &quot;teh evi1 oil corps&quot; thing is out the window. Lets go back to who was the real reason for the Iraq invasion, and it is entirely Zionist agents working on behalf of Israel.</p>

<p>The document entitled <em>&quot;A Clean Break&quot;</em> (mentioned above) was <strong>co-authored</strong> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Perle">Richard Perle</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Feith">Douglas Feith</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wurmser">David Wurmser</a>, etc. All of them Zionists, but all of whom were influential within the US gov&#39;t over several administrations.</p>

<p>——</p>

<p><strong>Richard Perle</strong>: He served under the Reagan administration, but later under the Bush administration as <em>Chairman of the &quot;Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee&quot;</em>.</p>

<p><strong>David Wurmser</strong>: Served as the <a href="http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/1392">Middle-East Adviser</a> to Dick Cheney.</p>

<p><strong>Douglas Feith</strong>: He was the <em>&quot;Under Secretary of Defense for Policy&quot;</em> during the Bush administration, and served as the head of the <strong>&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Special_Plans">Office of Special Plans</a>&quot;</strong> alongside <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Wolfowitz">Paul Wolfowitz</a>.</p>

<p>– At this point, people need to take note; Perle, Feith and Wolfowitz, all three of them were originally DEMOCRATS (working for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_M._Jackson">Henry Jackson</a>) and only switched under the Reagan Administration to REPUBLICAN.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Wolfowitz</strong>: He served in several positions under the Reagan administration, during Bush Sr he served as <em>&quot;Under Secretary of Defense for Policy&quot;</em> (the same position that Feith later inherits), and under Bush Jr he served as <em>&quot;Deputy Secretary of Defense&quot;</em> to Donald Rumsfeld. Lateron he went on to become head of the World Bank (which he inherited from another tribe-member James Wolfensohn).</p>

<p>– At this point I must also point out, the &quot;3 Musketeers&quot; – Feith, Wolfowitz and Perle – didn&#39;t just coincidentally work together. They were buddy-buddies. It also explains why we see <em>so many</em> Jewish individuals in top positions in govt/finance/media (despite them being only 2% of US population and 0.2% of World pop&#39;n); because these guys actively engaged in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronyism">cronyism</a>. Just read here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Perle#Neoconservative_Leadership">..&quot;From 1981 to 1982....&quot;</a></p>

<p>——</p>

<p>In summary, nobody talks about the REAL people who were behind the Iraq War effort. The people who served as advisers, deputies and heads of different Defense and Foreign-policy related boards and positions. In fact you will NEVER even hear people mentioning &quot;Office of Special Plans&quot;. Everyone will be busy blaming Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld, who were just puppets; like they do now with Obama.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The person behind the Iraq War was not G.W.Bush, it was the &quot;Office of Special Plans&quot;, run by Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith.</p></li>
<li><p>The person behind Dick Cheney, was David Wurmser his middle-east adviser. </p></li>
<li><p>The person behind Donald Rumsfeld was again Paul Wolfowitz, and Douglas Feith (and later Eric Eldelman; another tribe-member who inherited his position from Feith), who were his Deputy and Under Secretary, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>The person tying them all together was Richard Perle, who headed the &quot;Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>And ALL these individuals link back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clean_Break:_A_New_Strategy_for_Securing_the_Realm">&quot;A CLEAN BREAK: A New Strategy for Securing the Reich&quot;</a>. The Israeli policy-document that said, we need to topple Saddam (Iraq) and destroy Syria.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Saudi Arabia and Venezuela currently play ball with the US (with regards to oil anyway). Iran doesn&#39;t, and is in a very <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/feb/06/iran-oil-exports-destination">strategic position</a> with regards to the transportation of oil, not to mention the oil reserves themselves are substantial.</p>

<p>With regards to Syria, again, it&#39;s yet another strategic position in terms of oil, and is (was) Iran&#39;s biggest ally in the region.</p>

<p>Something you need to bear in mind is that this isn&#39;t necessarily about getting oil &#39;now&#39;, it&#39;s about securing supplies for the future. Peak Oil is something that gets <em>very</em> overlooked around here in my opinion, and is very much the driving force behind most of the West&#39;s, and specifically the United States&#39;, foreign (invasion) policy at the moment; and while SA is being left alone for the moment, it would not surprise me in the slightest if in years to come, the Saudi situation became &#39;unstable&#39;. As for Venezuela, they&#39;ve actively been trying to remove the current leadership for years; it&#39;s surprised me that they&#39;ve lasted this long tbh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Double emphasis on China. The government can&#39;t make any power moves like they used to without China being OK with it now a days. i.e. invading North Korea. And China keeps buying America&#39;s debt in several billions, I&#39;m no expert but in an analogy if you keep posting bail for your friend, he is pretty much in debt to you and at your command. Its like we are slowly being sold to China.how else can you look at it? We can never pay the debt back. Again im no expert but I think by buying our debt we agree to keep having products made over there to keep their economy up which is still on the rise at an alarming rate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, another thing a lot of people overlook. There is no oil in Afghanistan, but in the &#39;90s there were major negotiations going on between the US and the Taliban over a pipeline. The US supported the Taliban takeover for that exact reason - they didn&#39;t want to have to deal with negotiating with multiple tribal areas.</p>

<p>The Afghanistan example is actually a bit more complicated than that, because both sides seemed to be bluffing each other after a certain time, and that then ties into the motive for 9/11, so that&#39;s another conversation lol.</p>

The report explained a new approach to solving Israel&#39;s security problems in the Middle East with an emphasis on &quot;Western values&quot;. It has since been criticized for advocating an aggressive new policy including the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, and the containment of Syria by engaging in proxy warfare and highlighting their possession of &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot;.</p>

<p>Syria and Lebanon are important in terms of who controls the Levantine basin (eastern portion of the mediteranian).  Between the Leviathon oil reserve claimed by Israel and Lebanon and the gas coming out of Egypt, Syria and Lebanon will be host to the pipelines which move the gas up to turkey towards Europe.  Syria is also key in moving gas from the ocean through iran, iraq and pakistan, towards china.  </p>

<p>To sum it up.  Syria has an important port and is a key location for pipelines.  NATO is striving to control or at least control the chaos in this region.</p>
