    <div class="md"><p>Yes I can explain it.. It crashed into it.. Why wouldn&#39;t it. It makes perfect sense, you take over a plane and fly it there..BOOM. The Pentagon does not have fucking surface to air missiles on the root to shoot down airliners. Not to mention you know the whole pieces of plane all over the lawn. You know that &quot;restricted airspace&quot; is not a forcefield right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people who were there that day, and who all saw the plane in the same place on the same  path.......the North of Citgo gas station path proves you&#39;ve been &quot;misinformed&quot;.</p>

<p>The plane was no anywhere near the downed light poles or in line with the damage path through the building.  The people who all show you the REAL flight path all collectively prove that the plane did NOT hit the building.  Hey, its OK to be wrong.  You were not there that day.  These people were.  Did I mention that two of the witnesses to the flight path were 2 Pentagon Police officers?  They would &quot;credible&quot; enough to make you think about this right?  Listen to what they say.</p>

<p>Their testimony puts the plane flight path <a href="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a327/lytetrip/Pentagon/flight%20path/flight-path-composite-full-res.jpg">HERE</a></p>

<p>These people were there and tell a different story that anything the news and media will tell you.  Standard fare.</p>

<p>Here is the evidence. <a href="http://www.citizeninvestigationteam.com/nsa.html">LINK</a></p>

<p>You&#39;ll see that all their testimony all corroborates each other.  They are all the same and therefor cannot be fiction.  They were in different places, some were north of the plane, some were south and one was even right in front of it as it came right at him.  Sean Boger who worked at the helicopter tower, which is now gone.</p>

<p>They all basically triangulate where the plane was and where it flew.  They all were interviewed independently and by the army, they all say the same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ya obviously there pieces of plane scattered around the building it crashed into. The question i am asking is how did it make it to the pentagon without being shot down? There were orders to shoot down any civilian airliner suspected of being hijacked. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDfdOwt2v3Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDfdOwt2v3Y</a>)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but i thought united 93 was shot down...right isn&#39;t that what you conspiracy guys say? so which is it? a plane crashed into a building.. a no fly zone is not the same as forcefields the plane flew through the no fly zone and crashed. fighter jets just can&#39;t teleport to where they need to be fully armed. if you wanna say we needed to change our procedures to increase our reponse time sure say that but don&#39;t say it was a big fucking consiracy because the order didn&#39;t go out until after the pentagon was hit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Pentagon, in common with the nearby White House, is one of the best-protected public buildings in the USA. It is equipped with its own battery of surface-to-air missiles and the airspace above it is the subject of a permanent overfly ban in respect of commercial aircraft. Its security personnel are trained and equipped to respond swiftly to attempted acts of aggression, including attacks by aircraft. Indeed the Pentagon was particularly aware of the dangers posed by an attack of this kind; only a few years earlier a disgruntled citizen ruffled a few feathers by flying his light plane into a Pentagon wall, an incident that led to a thorough review of the building&#39;s emergency procedures. On September 11 however, not a single anti-aircraft missile was fired in the Pentagon&#39;s defense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t advertise it or feel the need to convince you of it. When the plane was approaching the pentagon, the soldier kept asking Cheney if the order still stood (to not shoot it down) What do you think they were going to shoot it down with, NORAD fighters? Those were out to sea and out of town, also by order of Cheney.... who, btw is NOT even in the chain of command for events like this. It was the COG plan that was enacted after the first plane hit that gave him command. Don&#39;t you know anything? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, you&#39;re right. There are no defenses on the most protected building in the world. Think about it...  we have defense scenarios on everything from alien attacks to locusts infestations and you believe the one building in the world where 99% of the county&#39;s military, defense contractors and associated types spend most of their time, along with the largest military and defense spending budget ever does NOT have any money spent on protecting that building. I wish i was that naive. And to think that IF they did have a major defense set-up in place, it would be advertised as common knowledge for anyone to know about and plan a counterattack is simply adorable. But you&#39;re right... it has no defense capabilities at all. Especially nothing as complicated and expensive as surface to air missiles. Go back to sleep,nothing to see here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you need to ask your mom if she can help you. See, what you&#39;ve done is stumbled across one of those internet guys who just doesn&#39;t care to spend any more time feeding your need for attention. Sure, I know this is supposed to be about manly stuff like missile defense but you and I really know what&#39;s going on here, don&#39;t we? You like men. you enjoy talking to them, spending time with them and when all else fails because your daddy didn&#39;t hug you enough, you resort to getting that manly attention from real men on the internet. Nothing to be ashamed about, lots of guys are closet homosexuals. It&#39;s just that I&#39;m not like that, I&#39;m already on to other things now... have already lost interest in proving anything to you. But if I may make a suggestion, have you considered going outside to meet real men in person rather than hounding them to death on the internet, pretending to want them to &quot;SHOW ME ANYTHING&quot; when really it should have been &quot;SHOW ME SOMETHING!&quot;? I have sent those kinds of pics before, trust me, but never to another guy. Sorry, I&#39;m just not interested. I know there are daddy types out there in Real World who are so... maybe, you could ask Mom if you could go to the mall or somewhere you think those guys might hang out. I wish you luck with it. Hey, maybe the nice man you meet at the mall would help you &quot;prove&quot; shit about the pentagon? Wouldn&#39;t that be swell? You could even make a little bet, one of those &quot;If I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;ll blow you&quot; bets. Then when the two of you actually find the information and  you&#39;re proved wrong, you get to blow the guy. Win Win for you and him. Be sue to let me know how it goes. I seriously would like for you to find someone else to shower you with manly attention. Happy sucking to you.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personal attacks? I was trying to help you find the attention you seem to be seeking. And accusing me of personal attacks is understandable, maybe you didn&#39;t appreciate me outing your secret desires. But back to the topic... after 9-11, do you seriously think the Pentagon, already a target twice from &quot;planes&quot; is so stupid that  they would post the &quot;what we have and where we have it&quot; information online where any potential threat could plan another attack? There is no magic website that shows photos and diagrams and and maps explains all the defense capabilities of the pentagon. Whatever sites there may have been are not available for you to peruse now. Sorry. I didn&#39;t take the information down just to piss you off. But use your little noodle... do you think they don&#39;t have anything? What a needy, attention seeking, anal retentive moron someone must be to believe that. </p>

<p>Maybe you should email the Pentagon, specifically request all information they have about their defense systems... I&#39;m sure they would be happy to send you some blueprints and specs. And as a bonus, you&#39;ll get to meet some real men in person too. Win win again.</p>

<p>Stop asking for proof. Not everything defense related can be proved.  </p>

<p>Look out over the great nation.... see any nuclear missile silos? See any missiles standing there? Hidden in silos, right? Use your noodle again... if the Pentagon installed a missile defense systyem, would they bolt it on top of every corner like a giant catapult sitting on a castle corner? Or do you think they would spend the extra $200 million and buy the covers so not just any terrorist in speed-os could see it and plan a counter attack for it. Stealth. Try to remember, they aren&#39;t bragging about this, they&#39;re trying to keep it on the down low.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It did not make it to the building, a plane traveling at that speed cannot fly parallel to the ground without crashing.</p>

<p>It is called &quot;ground effect&quot;.  </p>

<p>Nothing crashed into the building.  The building was just blown up.  They managed a reinforement of that side of the pentagon just a month prior to protect it from bomb blasts (coincidence?) and the plane flew over the building and away.</p>

<p>This is confirmed by Roosevelt Roberts, a Pentagon Police officer who ran out of a loading dock to see a &quot;Commercial jet&quot; flying away from the building.</p>

<p>There was no missile.  That is the distraction, the misinformation, the disinformation......whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p>There was wreckage there but not enough to account for an ENTIRE plane.  No bodies, to wing sections, no luggage.....no nothing.  Just some scraps.</p>

<p>This work has been done for you.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HlUmmPBoLg">HERE</a></p>

<p>This, combined with Cheney ordering an obvious stand down of fighters that day as reported by Norman Mineta is the only and obvious answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand why some people would think it to be crazy for questioning the 9/11 narrative.  But then again, I didn&#39;t either at first, so I can identify with a time in my life when I would have laughed of the idea of it being a conspiracy.   All I&#39;m saying about all this debunking is, in the current state of technology, where&#39;s the video proof?  </p>

<p>I know there to be 3 videos of a &quot;plane&quot; hitting the Pentagon(though I have yet to be able to determine that it is in fact, an airliner).  Fair enough, but when we ask our government to provide video of the jet hitting the Pentagon, they sent out a video that doesn&#39;t clearly show it.  Instead, a video that is more vague than a Bigfoot video(I don&#39;t believe in Bigfoot btw) is released and turns out to produce more questions than answers.  I&#39;ve seen 2 citizen videos that have been released and 1 government video of an alleged plane.  However, in all 3 videos it is unclear as to what hit the Pentagon.  </p>

<p>If the government doesn&#39;t remain transparent in this new digital age, it allows the propagation of conspiracy theories.  </p>

<p>I agree that it is circumstantial that the military should have shot-down the airliner(it is a good point though, a lot of inconsistencies, this being one of them).  There was a lot going on that day, but then again, some people dismiss the information that points to very similar drills were happening on the same day.  That again, is circumstantial.  But at what point do all the questionable &quot;circumstances&quot; add up?  The narrative has holes, and that opens up more room for people to speculate.  </p>
