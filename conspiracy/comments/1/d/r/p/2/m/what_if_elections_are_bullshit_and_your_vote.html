       Democorepublic.  There was a document recently which showed Obama's Cabinet compared to Bush's.  Different parties right?  Well it is ultimately irrelevant do to the fact that 95% of both cabinets are of 2 organizations:  The Council on Foreign Affairs and The League of Nations, I believe.  Thus, who cares who the po t u s is when this is the case.

       And it doesn't even matter if there are other parties because the system of one person one vote mathematically trends toward a two party system.

       edit: Though I will say that Ron Paul was a part of the republican party and definitely did not follow the agenda of the leaders of that party or the other candidates'. Unfortunately the media helped to cancel any possibility of his winning the election (combined with corruption in the party counting internal voting).

       When such work is done to manipulate the voting public's perception of the candidate, that compels me to believe that rigging the votes is not necessarily as straightforward as it might seem. There
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       checks in place, even if they aren't always effective.

       the

       is overly US centric, and most nations which use the voting system all have multi-parties work under

       I can personally hack and manipulate the results of the most used electronic voting machines used in the 2004 election. Lots of IT guys can do this in fact... there was even a documentary I think HBO did about how lax the security is on the voting machines. This is of course not exactly hard evidence, but to any competent IT security guy the electronic voting systems literally seem like they were purposely designed to not be secure.

       Electoral votes and popular votes are two different things. The electorate is SUPPOSED to vote the way their constituents wish. Ultimately, they still vote how they choose. In most cases, this has relatively low effect on the election. But, in the event of a close election it can make a win-lose difference.

       Yup, the electoral college can vote however they want, even if that state voted 100% for a Dem, they could vote for a Republican. It is just very rare that the Electoral College votes against what the popular vote in the state was.

       Depending on who you ask, it's either a sham, or a matter of faith. Just ask yourself where you lie along the spectrum; do you have faith in a lack of accountability or do you distrust a time honored system?

       Hey guys, I can get behind this one!

      <p>
       As a foreigner the electoral college seems ridiculous, but that aside many electronic voting systems in the US are very problematic.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I don't specifically believe election results have been manipulated as a matter of course, the technology makes it very possible and in most cases it's absolutely impossible to definitively verify the accuracy of a vote count.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that some one can claim after the fact to have manipulated votes in a given area and no one can definitively disprove the accusation.

       That's not the problem... the burden of proof would rest on the
       <em>
        accuser
       </em>
       not the accused.  The real issue is that it would be impossible to prove allegations of voter fraud, which is a far more sinister problem...

       No, any system of that nature should be absolutely verifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone comes to allege voter fraud you should be able to either verify or refute the claim with certainty. Being unable to do either makes the whole system unsound.
      </p>
      <p>
       FWIW, in my country all voting is on paper forms. They are optically scanned or hand-counted (depending on the area).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is another situation where the hyper-localisation of the US is confusing and damaging. Rather than having a single system that's deployed nationwide you have every state (and county) making it's own decisions.

       To be fair, some of our states
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       the size of many countries... and we also have a long history of trying to keep our federal government weak with regards to states' sovereignty.  Our founders wanted states to be able to determine for themselves how they should run their affairs.  Your incredulity at our voting system is analogous to demanding that the entire EU be on a single voting system- it's just not something that's part of our cultural tradition.  In fact, when we were a new country, most people didn't identify themselves as "american", but rather as being from the state they were born in.  Each state had their own currency, and it was a landmark supreme court case as to whether the federal government could even regulate trade between the states.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that is ancient history, though... and you're right- we should all be on the same page when voting in national elections.  I just wanted to provide some context so it didn't seem like we were
       <em>
        all

       Also the things like local police departments and elections for Sheriff seem odd to me. I was in LA recently and it's crazy to me that there are a whole
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_Los_Angeles_County">
        bunch of different police departments

       This makes me appreciate my own system. In the past 10-15 years I think we've had tons of re-elections and like combinations of "winning" parties that didn't work out and eventually fell and we would have to do it all over again. It's not the most effective but it's pretty honest.

       But our votes most certainly do count. In most places (I'm sure there are some small offices that get messed with). We have some of the most reliably accurate elections in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       We just vote for the wrong candidate/ideas
      </p>
      <p>
       We could in theory break away from the 2 party system. But the more rational thing to do would be to kill a party and create a new one. Bye bye republicans hello libertarians? Or maybe a socialist party? Either way our 2 parties need more divergence in platform if we are going to get out of this rut
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit - Implying your "votes" don't count is disingenuous at best and there won't be some revolution with small arms fire to fix this country. It will be through the ballot box. Shit like this is why people rip on these kinds of forums

       Back when Obama was still a state senator in Illinois, a friend I mine who has political connections told me that Obama was going to be president in 2008. I thought he was crazy. I had never heard of Obama and Obama's name sounded like a joke. The elite control more than you think.

       On a side note....I am always baffled how people continue to play the game of “voting for lesser of the 2 evils”. Vote for who YOU think is the best leader! I voted for Ron Paul. I wrote his name in. I believed he was the most honest, most trustworthy candidate, with most experience. And he wanted the best for the people. All people. I wrote him in because I wanted him to be in charge. Not one of the “lesser evils”. If you don’t like either, vote for a 3rd one. Vote for yourself. Vote for your neighbor. Show it. Don’t just say it.

       Each 5 years American are tricked into thinking their vote will lead a president to be elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       A further reading reveals that's it's not so:
Even if the
       <em>
        majority
       </em>
       of voters runs for a candidate, the Electoral college can choose another to the head of USA.

       Totally. I understand the context, but it still seems crazy to me :)

       Also the things like local police departments and elections for Sheriff seem odd to me. I was in LA recently and it's crazy to me that there are a whole
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_Los_Angeles_County">
        bunch of different police departments
       </a>
       within the LA metropolitian area. Surely that's hugely inefficient?

       And that same thing seems to follow on in many many areas of US government (local, country, state and federal).
