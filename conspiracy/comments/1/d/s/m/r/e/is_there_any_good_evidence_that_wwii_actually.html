       well with the question that was asked it seems kind of dumb. the question is there any good evidence that World War 2 actually happened at all..  considering we have hundreds of thousands of pictures and lists and lists of people dead at memorials and the fact that Pearl Harbor was really bombed and the fact that we really dropped nuclear bombs in Japan... I mean, can you give me one shred of evidence that truly tells that World War 2 did not happen?

       that is just slack. you have questions and you want answers but you don't want to do any of the work to try and find the answers, that's pretty sad. if anyone is allowed to just come in here with just baseless questions with no related personal inquiry prior to coming here, then I have got some questions of my own.
      </p>
      <p>
       what if the Vietnam War didn't really happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       what if World War 1 didn't happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       what if all the old dynasties in China (Chinasties) never really existed and all those wars that we've been told about China never occurred?
      </p>
      <p>
       what if the US Mexico war never happened and the Alamo is a lie?
      </p>
      <p>
       what if 9/11 is also fake and the war on terror is just bullshit?
      </p>
      <p>
       it's not my job to find out whether or not this is true. it's up to the thousands of dead historians and current historians to do all the work and write books on it so I can read it and have other people post articles about it so I know what really went on because it's not my job to find out it is their job to teach me.

       well instead of using the entirety of World War 2 as your example could you give us an idea of specific pieces or times during world war 2 that you believe is not really true as we have been told. when you come in here blindly without specific questions, you're allowing your head to be filled with random ideas and thoughts from people from across the globe so you are being conditioned with what they are trying to give you within their messages rather than having your own answers that you seek

       No offense, but r/conspiracy's problems come from things like what you've posted. Are you really unconvinced that WWII didn't happen? Or open to arguments that it didn't?

       So are you making an argument by authority or something?
      </p>
      <p>
       So it just happened because you say it happened?  Isn't that how people insist 9/11 worked.  They just declare it, by fiat, and it's just a consensus truth so accept it?

       No. For I am THE authority.

       CanardRipost, it's ME, who you call GOD. You are absolutely correct. There was no WWII, no WWI, none of it. I made it all up. For your entertainment. Because I love you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's always been about you. Everything. Everybody you've ever encountered on line? That's me, just playing roles. All the personal interactions you've had in your life? Me again. All the random "people" that are around you all day? Nothing more than chatter- something to fill the newspapers- apparitions, figments of MY imagination. If you ran across a busy street (full of cars that don't exist either), and tried to grab somebody walking, your hands would go right through them because they are nothing more than thought. MY thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your so called friends and family? Yeah, they don't exist, either. Well, not in the way you believe. I had to make humanoid automatons so that you could have some limited physical contact with others, lest you start to disbelieve the illusion around you, and be less inclined to worship ME.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right about now you're probably wondering why I'm telling you this? Lulz, truth be told, I do this to you all the time, because the shit you think and do after every time is fucking high-larious! It kills me every time I watch holograms of the time you kicked your "dad" in the nuts, what with the way his eyes bugged out of his sweaty moon face, and gave that big old comic book, "OOOF!" It never fails to put a smile on MY face!
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll forget all about this the next time you fall asleep. That's how I have it set up. And I'll fix whatever "problems" you get yourself into.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what are you going to show me today?

       They had cracked codes prior and knew about it. They wanted to get in the war in order to profit even more from it. they were already selling Germany their oil during the war. People made money from both sides of the war and helped prolong it while doing so

       Not sure if this was a serious post or not but whatever I'm slightly bored and have about 5 mins...
      </p>
      <p>
       There is plenty of video evidence. Heck you can buy some 20 DVD WWII packs with footage of actual battles and other things that couldn't really be faked.
      </p>
      <p>
       If WWII didn't actually happen, then there must've been something radically ridiculous happening (i.e mass mind control) which is not very likely. I mean... there's mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy people who experienced WWII first hand. Would hundreds of thousands and even millions of people just straight lie? How and why would that happen? What... maybe all the world leaders were in on it and WWII was a planned thing? World Wide False Flag? Sheeeeeesh.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was certainly a lot of deception, disinformation, coverups etc during WWII, just not in regards to WWII itself happening.

       Not much, though.  I think most of that is just training videos.  You'll notice that the History Channel hardly ever shows anything about world war 2, and if they do, you can tell most of the footage was lifted from the movie The Battle of Britain.
