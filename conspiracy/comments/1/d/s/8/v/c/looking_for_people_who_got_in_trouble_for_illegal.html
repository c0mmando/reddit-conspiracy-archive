    <div class="md"><p>Was martial law actually declared? If it wasn&#39;t then there is no way they can get in trouble, because otherwise these are just warrantless searches. Sure, there may be charges brought up and confiscated items but legally it will get thrown out of court. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plain view doctrine still applies during warrantless searches...which are legal because of exigent circumstance precedent. </p>

<p>Edit: Why am I being downvoted? I didn&#39;t say I agree with it. Exigent circumstance is a lawful manner of warrantless searches. Since it&#39;s a lawful search, plain view doctrine applies. We went over this in other Boston topics. Exigency is determined at the time by law enforcement, <em>you</em> would have to prove poisoned tree in court if they had brought up charges from something they found in plain view. I hate the whole scenario, I hope you&#39;re right that the searches violated rights; I see exigent circumstance being applied in a terrible manner, yet still to its letter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>someone i was talking to IRL said, they were probably making notes of illegal items and addresses and possibly coming back at a later date. but my initial concern was that i &quot;heard&quot; that the SWAT teams were taking people&#39;s weapons. i don&#39;t know if there is any truth to that tho.</p>

<p>on a side note, the people did not really have much rights when this was going down. i mean what are you going to do tell the SWAT team, &quot;no, i do not give you &#39;permission&#39; to come in to my domicile.&quot;? </p>

<p>Does it scare you that if the cops are looking for a &quot;terrorist&quot;, not saying Jahar is/was or isn&#39;t/wasn&#39;t one I am rather undecided on that, that the cops can just come in to your residence as they please with no notice, other than a knock on the door, or a warrant. Don&#39;t get me wrong I know it would be rather ridiculous to get a warrant for EVERY residence in the Watertown area, but where does the line reside? If all they have to say is they are looking for a terrorist, your civil rights mean absolutely nothing. Now all that goes without saying that a vast majority of the public probably opened their doors willingly, but with opening their doors willingly does that leave you open to be prosecuted for whatever they find in your house in the process of the manhunt. I know that there are always two sides of the story and if they did get in trouble they should not have been doing anything illegal in the first place, but still...</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pattern of small concessions, huge assaults, on liberty.</p>

<p>That said I disagree with the criminalization of any drugs. But in this situation it&#39;s a coordinated ploy to divert people from the horrifying situation that is today&#39;s &quot;America.&quot;</p>
