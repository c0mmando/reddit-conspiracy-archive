       I have heard some rumors, none confirmed, that while the SWAT teams and Nat'l Gaurd were searching people's houses that things were being confiscated, i.e. guns, paraphernalia... can anyone confirm this or have an eyewitness account of this happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, did anyone get in trouble where the cops have come back to your house after finding illegal items and charged you with anything.

       Was martial law actually declared? If it wasn't then there is no way they can get in trouble, because otherwise these are just warrantless searches. Sure, there may be charges brought up and confiscated items but legally it will get thrown out of court.

       Plain view doctrine still applies during warrantless searches...which are legal because of exigent circumstance precedent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Why am I being downvoted? I didn't say I agree with it. Exigent circumstance is a lawful manner of warrantless searches. Since it's a lawful search, plain view doctrine applies. We went over this in other Boston topics. Exigency is determined at the time by law enforcement,
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       would have to prove poisoned tree in court if they had brought up charges from something they found in plain view. I hate the whole scenario, I hope you're right that the searches violated rights; I see exigent circumstance being applied in a terrible manner, yet still to its letter.

       You'd have to prove that in a court of law.  I'd argue the searches violated the rights of the residents and were conducted under duress and threat of harm, therefore any evidence would be fruit of poisoned tree, and thus inadmissible.

       how can you say they consented to searches when they didnt have a choice, homes were entered with guns drawn on people and then to make things worse these people were escorted to areas at gunpoint.

       A lot of people were asked if they wanted their home searched, if they would allow a look. Not everyone was cleared from their house with a gun pointed at them. That doesn't mean I give them a pass, but we gotta stop acting like everyone was dragged out with guns in their face like criminals.

       someone i was talking to IRL said, they were probably making notes of illegal items and addresses and possibly coming back at a later date. but my initial concern was that i "heard" that the SWAT teams were taking people's weapons. i don't know if there is any truth to that tho.
      </p>
      <p>
       on a side note, the people did not really have much rights when this was going down. i mean what are you going to do tell the SWAT team, "no, i do not give you 'permission' to come in to my domicile."?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it scare you that if the cops are looking for a "terrorist", not saying Jahar is/was or isn't/wasn't one I am rather undecided on that, that the cops can just come in to your residence as they please with no notice, other than a knock on the door, or a warrant. Don't get me wrong I know it would be rather ridiculous to get a warrant for EVERY residence in the Watertown area, but where does the line reside? If all they have to say is they are looking for a terrorist, your civil rights mean absolutely nothing. Now all that goes without saying that a vast majority of the public probably opened their doors willingly, but with opening their doors willingly does that leave you open to be prosecuted for whatever they find in your house in the process of the manhunt. I know that there are always two sides of the story and if they did get in trouble they should not have been doing anything illegal in the first place, but still...

       Whole reason they are lightly decriminalizing marijuana is so that people can get high instead of doing anything about this growing police state.

       It's a pattern of small concessions, huge assaults, on liberty.

       That said I disagree with the criminalization of any drugs. But in this situation it's a coordinated ploy to divert people from the horrifying situation that is today's "America."

       idk if anyone was found with any hard drugs, but busting someone for pot(in MA) usually just ends up with the cops making you grind it into the ground.
