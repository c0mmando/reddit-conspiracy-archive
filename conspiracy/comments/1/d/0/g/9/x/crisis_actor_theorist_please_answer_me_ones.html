        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok this is to the group that believe that amputee crisis actors were used in the Boston Bombing. Here is my question.</p>

<p>Why go through all the trouble hiring the crisis actors. Having them run the risk of publicly being caught. Think about the coordination that must go through for all of it to be pulled off. The fact that since the bomb was not real, people with camera&#39;s right there would catch things. It would seem the risk of getting caught in the open is pretty huge. Also now with all the actors, and all the support staff you now have a group of what 50-100 people who all have to keep their mouths shut after the fact. There is now a group of crisis actors that either have to go deep undercover working for weeks or longer?</p>

<p>So my question is why go through all that trouble and run all that risk when it would be far simpler to just bomb your own people. If the gov&#39;t was doing things why go through all that work when it would be far easier to dupe someone into carrying a bomb. Now you have a circle of maybe 3-4 people who know what happened. You get the same net effect with less risk of being caught in the open. Am I to believe that they government will take this huge risk of being exposed because they don&#39;t have the balls to bomb a couple of their own citizen? </p>

<p>So please someone explain why they would go through all that trouble and risk with the crisis actor team when it would be 1000 times easier to just have a real bomb that no one knew about and blame it on whomever you already framed.</p>

<p>?</p>

<p>Secrecy? Tell people it&#39;s a drill for national security that relies on their secrecy. tell them they face financial penalty if they violate their contract. </p>

<p>The event seems to have been more about triggering the chase of these pointless mindless criminals and to practice the &quot;LOCKDOWN&quot; event. </p>

<p>The fact that the official story is to blame conspiracy theorist for &quot;radicalizing&quot; him says what the real target was; a pretense to warrantlessly wiretap in the interest of national security.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only do the crisis actors have to keep quiet, so do all of their friends, coworkers etc who would obviously know that something is up (their friend mourning the death of the kid didn&#39;t have kids, the crying teacher isn&#39;t really a teacher etc). We&#39;re talking many hundreds, possibly thousands of normal, middle class people who would have to be in on the plot to enslave mankind with no gain for themselves.</p>

<p>Proving the crisis actor theory would be easy...just get one friend of one supposed actor to admit that the story about their friend isn&#39;t true. For some reason, the crisis actor theorists refuse to actually prove their point, relying instead on just throwing out accusations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>About the only opinion I have at the moment is it seems odd to me, studying all the pictures and video I can find and tracing the order of rescues that he (Jeff B.) was left to writhe in utter agony while several people with seemingly less apparent injuries were tended to, and yet in each picture he is laying there alone in a pool of blood with people that seemed to practically step over him in favor of others.</p>

<p>Then while others are wheeled out on stretchers, he was wheeled out by 1 medic and a civilian on a wheelchair after them, which again strikes me as odd for a man missing his lower extremities. In one particular video the medic stops and either positions cowboys hand onto the vein he is holding or something else. Perhaps he is just trying to hold Jeffs leg together I dont know. In any case, to me it seems like he (Jeff B.) is there a little too long for the severity of his injuries, and cowboy is just a little too out of place based on my observation of the currently publicly available media. </p>

<p>It was a horrific event to be sure.</p>

<p>Cowboy guy is also seen  pushing a fence onto the victims rather than off, which is odd but ok, however it still sticks out as extra strange. (among some of his other pictured and video&#39;d behaviors)</p>

<p>There are a few other anomalies that stick out to me, but again I wasnt there so things can look very different from an armchair hundreds of miles away in stills and video viewed out of context.</p>

<p>To be fair, Jeff B. seemed to have the most footage available so I really can not pretend to guess the actual severity of all of the other individuals injuries and the priority of their medical needs.</p>

<p>My only fact based opinion so far is this was a terrifying and horrific event and I have great empathy for those that were adversely affected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point.  However maybe there just aren&#39;t that many people in the world who are willing to scoop this low or are trusted to do the job.  They look a like, no?  Its worth exploring.  Normally I am not into the actor aspect of it, but this photo had me re-thinking that.  The Achilles heal of these NWO types is arrogance - they think they are invincible. Building 7 is so obvious yet so many intelligent people won&#39;t accept 911 is an inside job.  But one day they&#39;ll mess up so bad, it will help turn things around.  Maybe this is one of those mistakes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so they have these crisis actors. They have 1 job. to play the part during the crisis.</p>

<p>and what you&#39;re telling me is they failed so miserably at that job, that its plain to see they are all faking it.</p>

<p>I mean they had 1 job, the job they are trained for, and they fucked it up.</p>

<p>I would be ripshit if I were in charge of that operation, I&#39;d be at all the acting schools recruiting real actors not the crap the FBI sends.</p>

<p>That sort of brings us back to u/jacquesaustin&#39;s point, why hire crisis actors at all? Just have one or two undercover CIA guys with a backpack bomb, set it off, and sit back while the entire event unfolds organically. </p>

<p>Also now with all the actors, and all the support staff you now have a group of what 50-100 people who all have to keep their mouths shut after the fact. </p>

<p>^ <strong>You</strong> wrote that. But if they use 10-12 actors instead, it&#39;s &quot;foolish?&quot; </p>

<p>Do tell, what &quot;number&quot; is appropriate for infiltrating an event? You seem to know it&#39;s between 12 and 100.</p>

<p>10-12 makes much more sense -- enough to incite the problem, cause crowd panic, etc. Less worry about a leak with 10 people compared to 100+.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks for strengthening this theory.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP wtf is up with you? Every time someone answers your child like incessant questions you just grab on to any incidental factor and then hold on until you are finally driven off on to another tangent. You came here asking why do this? The answers have been provided, some plausible, some unlikely, and some outlandish. Either you are here to drive this dribble as far as possible or you don&#39;t realize that the motives from a gov source could not only be wide and varying, but also for short term, or long term needs. Greed drives people to do some crazy things. Fear helps them accomplish those things. </p>

<p>The point of this subreddit is not to say &quot;ah ha!&quot; we&#39;ve got it solved lets take this to Washington, RIOT! It is to ask questions about what the people have been given by the government and media and help form opinions. If this was all about chasing ghosts it wouldn&#39;t last long because the intelligence would not be there to support it. But there are smart people on here who want to get to the bottom of this for various reasons but for many it will be for peace of mind or to cure that awful feeling of deep distrust. </p>

<p>If the questions are answers people will go away and back to their normal daily lives. They haven&#39;t been answered so we are still here. Yours have been answered to an extent that should suffice for your rationale and level of thinking. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s one for you: Say you have to live with someone whether you like it or not. Maybe your step-dad. He has some power over you, but doesn&#39;t really stop you from doing your thing. One day a tragedy occurs your favorite GI Joe figurine goes missing. You know your step-dad has some debt. You also know his buddy likes Action figures. You also know that he was thinking of doing a garage sale, but too lazy to get it together. You also see a similar woman at your house shortly after the incident with a bag that looks like it has something inside. She was also there wearing the same thing when your sister&#39;s My Little Pony went missing 2 years ago. Your Step-dad tells you he thinks he knows who did it. Your friends came by earlier, he chased them down but now they are too freaked out to even tell you what happened because he threatened them. All of this seems confusing to you. You feel like you won&#39;t get to the bottom of this but you just want to know if your Step-dad is a liar so you can at least know that you should protect your stuff. <strong>Wouldn&#39;t you want to know if you can trust him?</strong> </p>

<p>PS. A week later he tells you that the house isn&#39;t going to be using locks on bedrooms anymore because he might have to come in and save you in an emergency and doesn&#39;t want to get held up. He came to that decision with your mom while you were looking for your friends. She didn&#39;t hear you protest thought it seemed to be sensible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lets be clear, when I asked a question 90% of replies ignored the question and moved on to trying to use visual evidence for clues.</p>

<p>This is a subreddit about asking questions, but the idea that all questions hold equal weight doesn&#39;t hold water, even here, or there would be more talk of aliens and reptilian overlords.</p>

<p>your GI JOE story. while cute, does the same thing to simply obscure but not clarify. You can spend all day poking holes in stories but when you cannot provide clear answers it makes no sense.</p>

<p>So I have every right to ask questions, to not ask for reasons but motivations.</p>

<p>I am not satisfied with the answers given, they all resort to the same retreat into showing my pictures and saying that people are not acting they way they should. Which I am still not clear on what is the appropriate reaction.</p>

<p>Look if someone is saying that the brothers were set up by the FBI to trigger a false flag with real bombs which they thought would be fake. I&#39;d be much more inclined to believe that, there is more evidence to support that claim.</p>

<p>the idea that its now hundreds of actors in some kind of government flash mob just sounds silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all you didn&#39;t answer question. Second, visual evidence is the best kind of evidence, not reports, not eyewitness (those are usually the worst tbh), not talking heads. </p>

<p>You do have the right to ask for motivations, but we don&#39;t know what it inside of every persons head that acted in this or has something to gain from it. Maybe there is blackmail, maybe there is legislation votes needed, maybe there is a tactical war measure, I don&#39;t know what the motivation is and to be frank, even convicted murders on trial rarely disclose motive and sometimes it will be false anyways. I guess what I am trying to say is that you probably won&#39;t be satisfied because your answer does not exist here with the public redditors, and I don&#39;t any shills will be happy to let you know their motivation, but they have one.</p>

<p>My story is not to obscure anything, I did not intend that, it was to show your why people are here in this sub. Because many of your posts seem to ridicule and that isn&#39;t right. </p>

<p>The point was also to show that it doesn&#39;t matter what the answer to this is, people have a right to act on their interests and curiosities and there is a &#39;chilling&#39; effect happing on social media as of late with respect to unusual downvoting/promotion tactics that is preventing this. You come across as someone who only is interested in debunking every theory you can. This thread is about theories, you asked why go to the trouble to do &#39;this&#39;. &#39;This&#39; hasn&#39;t even be determined, so how can we know why &#39;this&#39;?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not seeing people removing prosthetics, I&#39;m not seeing someone throw a cup of blood, i&#39;m not seeing any of that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m seeing what people claim are people not acting how they should, and therefor since they are not acting they way one should in such an event they are actors, and these actors hired by the government are bad actors, because good actors would actually look how they were paid to act and look.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t claim anything about any of the details. I was saying that visual evidence exists around this situation and that is what we have to go on. It seemed like you were saying visual evidence is not enough.</p>

<p>As for the &#39;actors&#39;, an objective reasonable person would say that there IS visual evidence suggesting these people are not acting like a normal person would given the circumstances. But that&#39;s typically a civil law test. Criminal charges require beyond a reasonable doubt to convict. </p>

<p>I see plenty of reasonable doubts to many of the projected mainstream media stories and &#39;authoritative&#39; reports.</p>

<p><strong>President</strong>: Okay guys, here&#39;s what we are gonna do. We are gonna plan a fake bombing at the Boston Marathon. Why? So we can raise taxes on gun powder that&#39;s why. The only problem is, we don&#39;t want to actually hurt any civilians...just get the fear going. Now how can we achieve this without actually hurting anybody?</p>

<p><strong>Vice President</strong>: I have just the idea boss! I saw this website on the internets once called <a href="http://www.crisisactors.com">www.crisisactors.com</a>. Maybe we could email them and hire some amputees to pretend have their legs blown off and what not.</p>

<p><strong>President</strong>: I think you may be onto something here VP, but how would we make it look like they have real legs and then after the bomb have bloody stumps for legs with so many people around?</p>

<p><strong>VP</strong>: We will have the crisisactors.com special effects team on hand. They will be scattered throughout the crowd with backpacks full of fake bloody stumps. Then, we will make sure the bomb emits a lot of smoke and rush in... removing prosthetics, attaching fake stumps and spreading fake blood all over the place.</p>

<p><strong>President</strong>: By golly I think you got something there. Get on the internet VP! Hires us some amputees!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not bought into the crisis actor theory myself; however, there are people who have made good points, and the insults in this thread being thrown at those theorist are why can&#39;t have productive discussions anymore.  </p>

<p>I digress...</p>

<p>To answer your question about &quot;why would the government go through all the trouble of ____________ ? &quot;  I would say the objective is likely to use the bombing in some way to sway public opinion.  <em>Perhaps</em> (I&#39;m am being hypothetical for crying out loud!) they wanted to make sure someone maimed was shown on television.  Adam Kokesh made a good point how you notice the mutilated Americans were shown on television, but mutilated Iraqis and Afghans are NOT shown on television.</p>

<p>Whether he was an actor or not, the end is still the same.  The reaction to the gore is being used to sway public opinion just as the absence of such gore in the wars in the Middle East is also being used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no i get why they would do it to sway public opinion, I just don&#39;t get why they would go through the trouble of doing that VS a REAL BOMB which would MAIM and kill, are you saying we don&#39;t have the technology to create said bomb?</p>

<p>So they want to make sure someone injured is shown on TV, instead of a real bomb that maims and injures (not a difficult task in the least) they create a fake bomb, hire actors, create fake citizens for these actors to play, and they will continue to play them in public events for the end of time?</p>

<p>I get the concept of the government wanting to stage events to sway public opinion. I just don&#39;t get why they would risk being found out by creating hundreds of people in on it. including actors who have to be at the very epicenter of it, who have little incentive other than money, and thinking that somehow it will all stay underwraps vs just setting off a real bomb that really maims americans which they would all appear on the news, and would be saying the same things they are saying today.</p>

<p>I agree that weather he is an actor or not the end result is the same, but the idea of using an actor to get the same result you could get with a bomb, which now you have to have actors keeping an ENOURMOUS state secret, I mean the kind of secret that could bring a government down, and now some random amputee actors are privy to that? Seems like a big hole in security that I wouldn&#39;t allow. I&#39;d just bomb the place and make sure it was in a congested enough area to kill and maim.</p>

<p>This is how FOX used it.</p>

<p><strong>Jump to 02:00. Listen carefully to the two terrible actors who set us up for the next scene.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrNMhQ4Rx08">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrNMhQ4Rx08</a></p>

<p>They are waiting for amputee actor to get in range. They have two cameras ready and switch back and forth once. Once the actor is within range the camera pans backwards to two more actors who begin to talk about the blast scene.
There are windows blown out, about 3 people dead and body parts everywhere. At which point the camera pans back towards the scene and the amputee actor is wheeled into view. Perfectly cued but screamingly obvious.</p>

<p>At such an early stage in the game this official just happened to talk about this in front of a camera that was live. What happened to protocol. Do we just video random talking people who appear to be official.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its funny that you spend so much time trying to convince of the actors, and so little time about the actual question posed.You are becoming a true politician.</p>

<p>So they wanted to create a horrific visual impact? and the best way to do that was to fake it? Since they couldn&#39;t use real explosives they had to fake it because anything short of c4 or tnt wouldn&#39;t hurt enough people?</p>

<p>So they hire actors and fake it because that creates a biggest visual impact than really setting off a dangerous bomb in a crowd of real people?!? I don&#39;t get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is more likely? that they had this entire team read to create this fake situation for the gov&#39;t to spoon feed the masses.</p>

<p>or that the gov&#39;t double crossed the tsarneav bros, told them they were helping catch a terror cell then gave them real bombs and blamed the death on them.</p>

<p>you get to the same point, and now you only have the 2 suspects telling a different story, and maybe 2 or 3 people at the FBI knows of what happened.</p>

<p>Why would they instead just have a thousand person conspiracy that has to go one for years and years? </p>

<p>Ill tell you why, cause the crisis actor idea is sexy and fun and could be from a movie. I saw ads of these people on youtube where they train first responders and military. I saw the movie wag the dog. I want these things to be true.</p>

<p>No if the gov&#39;t is behind it (which i do not believe) they armed the bros with real bombs unknowingly and created the attack, there is no way they created this massive ruse to go around killing 3 people.</p>

<p>our gov&#39;t kills 3 americans in their sleep, so they are not growing a conscious now.</p>

 they don&#39;t want someone they can&#39;t control maybe the family of a victim, </p>

<p>so they create a much larger situation, with far more people that might need to be controlled including actors which are not government officials and therefore are not motivated by power, simply money.</p>

<p>Thanks for setting us straight! We needed someone like you to tell us what to think. </p>

<p>Now let&#39;s talk about what&#39;s <em>real</em>, not what you&#39;re trying to sell us here. Crisis actors have become an important part of false flag events. Controlling the situation, and the <em>message</em>, are the top strategy in modern political manipulations, and crisis actors keep the message on point. They were used extensively in the Sandy Hook false flag to keep the message finely tuned, and we&#39;re seeing them put into play in Boston. It&#39;s not up for debate, it&#39;s fact. It&#39;s been proven time and time again in countless journalistic exposés. The search bar is your friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes you&#39;re right, look at how successful it was in Sandy Hook, what gun laws got passed? oh yeah none.</p>

<p>so the message, so these actors are VERY important to the false flag operation, one would say that they are some of the most important ones.</p>

<p>I guess its not up for debate because you told me its not up for debate. good thing. </p>

<p>Lets look at your postings. oh wait been a redditor for 4 days and only posts here. no credibility.</p>

<p>Crisis actors have been important because its been a sexy story to push but has no basis in reality other than showing pictures of the actors out of character during the event.</p>

<p>so now i&#39;m supposed to believe that not only do they orchestrate the whole thing, but then they hire bad actors to do it, actors which are so bad, that random people like you and me on the internet can clearly point it out, to the point where it is not up for debate as you like to say.</p>

<p>geez, i would think the gov&#39;t could hire better actors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that makes complete sense, why didn&#39;t I look at it that way. </p>

<p>So the government has a heart, and for whatever reason this event was created CISPA? banning gun powder was not deemed important enough to kill for, just important enough to act like you killed for and create fake people to kill, but at the end of the day the agents can sleep well at night because they truly didn&#39;t kill anyone.</p>

<p>Or was the reason to start the military state process? which seems like a big deal, big enough to kill for in my opinion, I mean what 3 people? Didn&#39;t they kill twice as many in Texas? </p>

<p>ALSO, IT SEEMS THERE ARE DIMINISHING RETURNS: for 9/11 they got everything.</p>

<p>Sandy Hook didn&#39;t get gun legislation passed, so why would they be using failing tactics?</p>

<p>oh yeah they have a heart and they won&#39;t kill innocent people to rule the world because they are great people.</p>

<p>So they needed to be sure their legs were blown off, but that they were good looking people for the photo op?</p>

<p>So what you&#39;re saying is they are paying actors, and setting up this massive fake ordeal, because they are not sure if they did it for real, the injuries would be gruesome enough, or maybe they might have blown up an anti war activist who still doesn&#39;t go forward with their plan?</p>

<p>So what is the photo-op they need?  good looking people with white faces and blown off extremities? </p>

<p>What kind of control at the scene? its a bunch of either actors being rushed off the scene or a bunch of blown up people being taken to the hospital, its not like they had a press conference on the spot.</p>

<p>please get me a bigger spoon, i&#39;m still not getting why blowing up real unwitting people doesn&#39;t serve the same purpose, what control at the scene would they lose? maybe a victim would go to the wrong hospital?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha deleting posts....</p>

<p>So the logic comes down to, if you blow up real people you might not get the photo-op you are hoping for, then you waste an explosion.</p>

<p>Also risking using actors, which is a huge risk of someone blabbing, and a huge risk of something in the immediate moment going wrong, I mean someone could trip and fall and the whole thing goes to shit, yet that risk is important because you need &quot;control&quot; at the site. The site where these people are wisked away, no one remained at the site for more than a couple minutes.</p>

<p>So instead of just bombing their own people and having the geinunine human emotions of agony pain right there, instead of having a tiny group of people that knows what really happened instead of a giant group. Because &quot;control&quot;</p>

<p>yup makes sense. what was I thinking, obvious the theory that the brothers we double crossed by the FBI and given real bombs during what they thought was a fake drill is gov&#39;t hogwash, because instead there was a community of actors all playing parts to achieve the exact same thing.</p>

<p>yup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok Ill play just a little.  So there is this HUGE operation to fake this explosion with actors. correct, these are all actors. YET the guy in the hoodie is such a shitty actor, and does such a crappy job, that he just puts on his sunglasses, lays back and reclines, and looks like he is just sitting out on the beach, whoops. Seems like a pretty catastrophic mistake for such a crack team of actors, I can&#39;t believe they would mess up.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying they had this GRAND SCHEME of a fake bomb, with fake first responders, fake actors, all of it at the highest level of government, and this asshole in the sunglasses fucks it all up by just chilling out and having a good time.</p>

<p>I bet he never gets a job as a crisis actor again, they are probably going to tear up his SAG card.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying this was a staged planned event. Meant to strip out last remaining liberties. A planned event at a public location where they know every move will be recorded. </p>

<p>And this event, which was no doubt rehearsed in a private sound stage. Yet the actors were such armatures that they do things like lounge around, put on sunglasses, and mess the while operation up. </p>

<p>I would expect if they had the confidence to pull it off, they would be sure, and if they were not sure, they&#39;d use real bombs, and use the media to filter .</p>

<p>but the crisis actors they used were not that good. (maybe they couldn&#39;t afford the top level crisis actors because of the current furloughs)</p>

<p>so these substandard crisis actors make rookie mistakes, like lounging around in the middle of the most important scene and do stupid things like put on their glasses and get blood in the wrong places.</p>

<p>So these actors hired by the gov&#39;t to fake being victims, almost got away with it, but their subpar acting skills give them away.</p>

<p>the only thing you gave was real blown up people don&#39;t make good pictures, and they need control, what kind of control you are not saying, because its not clear what kind of control actors at the scene which were all rushed off the scene provides that real blown up people would not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, no one contests that crisis actors do not exist. The whole reason this became a thing is because a few years ago people found their sites online and it sounded like an awesome story to say that these people are used in false flag events. </p>

<p>Live drill explains some real injuries and some fake injuries for media purposes and added and ensured gore. We are not talking about 100 actors, we have evidence for maybe a dozen &quot;in on it&quot; players. You don&#39;t think they have the resources to keep these people on the payroll? And enough brainwashing material to convince them that this is for the greater good of security? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who believes the crisis actor thing is either dis info, or just a stretch, I think the <em>only</em> explanation for this would be to confuse &#39;us&#39; (&quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;). There&#39;s so much weird shit with this event that I think it&#39;s not impossible that they did some weird things just to throw us off (assuming it was a false flag). Newtown had a lot of weirdness to it, and some evidence suggests it didn&#39;t even happen. I think Newtown may have been a trial run for the &quot;do a bunch of things that don&#39;t make sense at all&quot;. People <em>are</em> catching on, and the perfect way to keep enough from figuring it out, is to make the theories as jumbled and confusing and un-connected as possible. With ones like 9/11, there is pretty much the established theory, plus or minus, a few kinks and quirks. This seems to have been the case with Aurora as well. Sandy hook started getting weird, and Boston is just all over the place. As someone who has been in the heat of the conversation for these last 3, I can say that it&#39;s not just &quot;we don&#39;t have enough info yet&quot;. The level of conflicting info has increased exponentially with each of these.</p>

<p>So, <em>if</em> there actually was a crisis actor. I think it is to be deliberately confusing/misleading. Potentially to make us look stupider and more alienated from the public, the give less credence to conspiracies. <strong>Or even so that we all try so hard to get to the bottom of it that we ignore the real important things that the story is covering up.</strong> We <em>are</em> spend an abnormal amount of time trying to get to the bottom of the rabbit hole than we are trying to figure out what is getting covered up/take action about it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll just leave this here, concerning the amount of blood. TL;DR? The body redirects blood to vital organs in the case of massive trauma. And as far as i can tell, both his legs are injured below the knee, where there is a <em>much</em> reduced chance of bleeding-out vs a severed artery in the thigh area.</p>

<p>Also, i&#39;m willing to bet you (like myself) have zero experience dealing with these types of situations, so you saying &quot;Impossible feat!!&quot; shouldn&#39;t be taken with much seriousness. </p>

<p>I think that they tried it with the real bombs often enough.  Now they are more savvy.  They know they don&#39;t need to kill people, just give the illusion.  The war is in our minds.   I don&#39;t know why we are the enemy though.  Who are we threatening?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>REALLY? WHY HIRE ACTORS? BECAUSE THEY EXIST TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE?  So because this service exists the gov&#39;t is going to do that because you can find a service online that provides crisis actors?</p>

<p>Risk of getting caught, lets see people like you and others who believe this happened. All it would take is one paserby with a gopro camera to show some guy pulling off a prosthetic and spilling some blood on him.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t get why using crisis actors is more savvy. Its more stupid. It is complete incongruent for a government to care so little about its people yet at the same time go through extraordinary steps to fake their injuries.</p>

<p>This is what I think. People have discovered that different groups use crisis actors to train for situations. military, ems, fire gov&#39;t you name it.  As people found out about these groups, it just became too juicy of a story to not have it into their stories and conspiracies.</p>

<p>If I were involved in the planning of a false flag attack and someone suggested that we set off a smoke bomb, then a team of actors fly into place removing fake limbs and applying fake blood and gore in an instant in public. Then for years have these same actors return on anniversaries, media events. Have them interviewed by the press endlessly. FUCK NO. I&#39;d use a real bomb, hurt real people and have my involvement end there.</p>

<p>No need for years of paid actors, lines, etc. The fact that the only response you gave is because the service exists is the weakest response yet.</p>

<p>Another quote from you, &quot;why kill people when you don&#39;t have to&quot; So our government that kills millions around the world, tortures etc, but doesn&#39;t have the stones to hurt a few more people? Are we to believe that the government that is so callous about taking away our rights, and taking control of everything just can&#39;t bring themselves to kill a few innocent people so instead they go through the huge process of faking it? I&#39;m not buying it.</p>

<p>here is your response.</p>

<p>So they hire actors instead of using real bombs because there are actors available? It still seems ridiculous to go through all that trouble when a real bomb does 100% of the same things with less loose ends. You have not given me 1 real reason on why they would go through a much more complicated process of hiring actors and setting up a live event rather than just set off a real bomb and work from there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>now we get to the nuts and bolts of it.  When you have stopped trying to convince me of the fact but instead explain the why.</p>

<p>So what do we get? MAYBE they got tired of killing citizens? MAYBE they will switch it up next time? </p>

<p>also explain how a bunch of people rolling around on the floor faking major injuries equals control of a situation? What kind of non control were they trying to get which real victims wouldn&#39;t provide? They might say something from their hospital bed that would influence the public? but if they control the media, it would be easier to just not air the story.</p>

<p>So they need control of a situation, the situation being blown up people, because those people might say things which don&#39;t mesh with what the gov&#39;t wants the story to be. And since the gov&#39;t already control the media, they need a second layer of control because they couldn&#39;t simply not air those reports, so they need to control the report and the person reporting it for more control.</p>

<p>AT the end when you try to explain why it all falls to crazy conjecture and wild ideas. Because factually there would be zero reason or benefit to having crisis actors and a fake bombing. Because someone in government grew a conscious after decades of bombings and killings? Although you did just say that the next one might be real bombs. so apparently the conscious can come and go.</p>

<p>The crisis actor story is just so juicy because people have seen that they do exist for legitimate reasons, and the thought of the government doing things like that is so cloak and  dagger that its appealing. It has all the appeals to conspiracy. But in reality no entity would ever go through the trouble to do it. (So I&#39;m supposed to believe these crisis actors will be hired every year to come to the marathon and do all the ceremonial stuff they are supposed to do?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well at the end of all this. I got what I came for.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the scorecard shall we. All you can try to do is hopelessly prove to me through your video freeze frame evidence that these are actors. </p>

<p>Yet the main purpose of the post was not to ascertain if they were actors, but why they government would use actors instead of real bombs.</p>

<p>So from what I understand, and I want to be correct in your theories as to why they would go the route that:</p>

<p>1) involves more conspirators, which means more people to pay off, or to kill off to keep their mouths shut.
2) the plan that involves a team of actors not only going into position as the fake bomb goes off, but as well as clearing that area of any non actors, since if you were standing right on the bomb and were uninjured by the smoke, if say you were just walking through the area right at that time.
3) a plan that not only involves actors that day, but ones that must play victims for weeks in hospitals, and for years as they will be trotted out to anniversary events.
4) as training for first responders, although these first responders would all know its training because they can tell the difference between a gushing real would and someone who has been an amputee for some time, so although it was training for first responders, it really wasn&#39;t because they knew.
5) as control, since setting off a real bomb you could have injured people that might say things you don&#39;t want them to say. So you can control what they and other survivors say on the news for years. Yet you already control the media, so you could have cherry picked what you wanted instead of having actors, but apparently redundancy in control
6) because crisis actors and services exist, and exist in the open, not as some secret service, the government has to use them. </p>

<p>They go through all this in creating the false flag attack because they:</p>

<p>1) have a heart and couldn&#39;t bring themselves to hurt 1 american (although technically they framed the Tsarnaev brothers and one of them is technically a citizen but that&#39;s a technicality, because they choose him for a reason. the others they didn&#39;t choose.</p>

<p>that&#39;s it. The only reason why they would go through all that trouble is because whatever group is in charge of setting attacks against americans has too much of a heart to do the real deed.</p>

<p>&#39;There is no such thing as an independent press in America, unless it is out in the country towns. You are all slaves. You know it, and I know it. There is not one of you who dares to express an honest opinion. If you express it you know beforehand that it will not appear in print. I am paid l50 dol. per week for keeping honest opinions out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for doing similar things. If I should allow honest opinions to be printed in one issue of my paper, like Othello, my occupation would be gone. The business of a leading journalist is to distort the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread, or his salary. You know this, and I know it, and what foolery to be toasting an &quot; independent press.&quot; We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are jumping-jacks. They pull the string and we dance. Our time, our talent, our possibilities are the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think some people do have a heart.  They see that the ends don&#39;t always justify the means.</p>

<p>What if Colon Powell had a heart and refused to lie to the UN?   What if Rummy had a heart and refused to lie about cave complexes in Afghanistan?  They are gone, and maybe, just maybe this administration thought they could achieve the same ends without domestic bloodshed.  These are maybes of course.  I would be more than happy to sit in on their secret committees and report what is actually happening.. somehow I don&#39;t expect it.</p>

<p>Men who&#39;s whole life agenda and goal has been to rule the world and have ordered the deaths of thousands. Yet are afraid of a tiny amount of blood on their hands, so they go through to create the most elaborate real time live action hoax because well they have a conscious now.</p>

<p>what does that mean? so now they faked the incident to evaluate the first responders? who&#39;s response are they evaluating?</p>

<p>You cannot on one side say it was crisis actors used to set up the american people, then say it was all staged to gauge first responders response. Also are you telling me a first responder would not know that these people didn&#39;t have real wounds or are all the first responders also in on it? and if they are in on it, then how could you gauge their response since they already know its a fake drill?</p>

<p>UNLESS it was both. </p>

<p>by reliable source, do you mean the media?  have they indicted themselves lately?  if they have, then they are losing their jobs.  I&#39;m sure there are many books written on the subject in the past 20 years if you want to look.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not seeing people removing prosthetics, I&#39;m not seeing someone throw a cup of blood, i&#39;m not seeing any of that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m seeing what people claim are people not acting how they should, and therefor since they are not acting they way one should in such an event they are actors, and these actors hired by the government are bad actors, because good actors would actually look how they were paid to act and look.</p>
