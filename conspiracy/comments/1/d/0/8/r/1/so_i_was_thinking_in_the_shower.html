       Why do I doubt the government to such a harsh degree?  Why do I thrive on calling these officials out?  Well, it finally hit me and I think I can put it into one concrete phrase.  Before I do, I'd like to say that government is supposed to be transparent.  For example, when you ask a government official or a federal reserve chairman a question, we as a public deserve a prompt, no bullshit, honest answer.  No pedantic statements or beautifully worded anti-terrorism rhetoric, and no having someone hauled off by police for asking a question; just a straight-forward, concrete answer.   Now, with this in mind, ask yourself "How often does that
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       happen?"  Think about the last time our president was able to present concrete evidence or actually answered a question thoroughly.  Also, ask yourself "How often have American politicians (both democrat and republican) been caught in their own lies?"  "How many times have our representatives slipped up on national television?"
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase goes as follows:
       <em>
        I don't doubt the government necessarily because of anything they say. I doubt the government because of what they don't say.
       </em>

       Secret societies, organized crime, and state run law enforcement and intelligence organizations all have their own reasons for not talking about what's going on around them. Secrecy leads to erroneous conclusions based on incomplete, and often wrong, informations. It breeds a spirit of paranoia, fear, uncertainty, and doubt. That is not an healthy atmosphere to live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have to tell the truth so we can talk to each others in the spirit of building a rapport of trust among people. Then, we'll all see that the big scary boogyman really is just a silly little shit cowering in the shadows...

       Start with yourself, my friend. Tell the truth. Speak to people. Your OP is a good start for that.

       Thank you for sharing.  These are encouraging yet disheartening words.  I know when the time comes, "their" ability to carry out their ultimate goal will not surpass the peoples' desire for freedom.  We have seen genocide enough, hopefully we get it right this time by finally outnumbering the enemy 800 to 1.

       I think one of the driving forces (as to why people doubt their government) is because the MSM is so obviously complicit in the cover up.  So often, the obvious questions are never asked, and any guest that attempts bring up something controversial is ridiculed, shouted down, or has words put into their mouths.

       It isn't just politics is it?  It's all pervasive!  How many documentaries have you watched where you actually know a lot about the subject matter?  Every single time you end up spitting your dinner over the TV because the documentary starts out telling the truth, and then it starts slipping in absolute blatant lies.  I work in gvt so I'm used to it, but even local news reporting can't even tell the straight truth about something as simple as a storm, it will either greatly exaggerate an event, or interview people who weren't even involved who come out with the most shocking bullshit.  It's as though the whole media must lie about something, in every story it runs.

       Exactly. I get on here and call for transparency and constitutional rights, never uttered a peep about Newtown, and all I saw for 3 days was "Newtown-tard."

       I only care about transparency and PUBLIC oversight. If we get that, the rest of the problems will sort themselves out. They will eventually, anyway, but people are going to be victimized in the process.

       Mob rule is not the way. Work to be a police agent or government official, and you can have access to the important information. You are just a guy at home demanding access the general public has never had. The agents looking at the videos are public workers working on our behalf, if you want in, get to work.

       What I heard was... some are more equal than others. Transparency isn't important. It's not mob rule because the mob is interested. It's not mob rule until the government goes too far. You have no idea what mob rule is. Mob rule is what's happening on this subreddit.

       When it comes to investigating crimes and dealing with highly sensitive evidence, some are more equal than others. That is, cops and agents are more valued than internet know-nothings. Deal with it. Become a cop if you want to see what they see.

       To a point, yes, but that doesn't mean the police haven't done things that beg for oversight. I care less about the conspiracies and more about the constitutional rights violated, and ineffectively so, given the ultimate goal, and that it took a tip from a resident to lead the dogs to the right hunt. I'm concerned about the sheer number of bullets and police it takes to bring down a single kid, especially after he's holed up in a boat when they find him. Due process. Everyone has a right to that. The 4th amendment. Everyone has a right to that. Innocent until proven guilty. Everyone has a right to that, but the FBI doesn't feel it's necessary to protect any of those rights for the sake of capturing a terrorist who killed less people than were probably killed in violent street crime during the search.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does any terrorist deserve justice? You bet. He also succeeds at his goal through his capture more than his actual crime. More people were terrorized in the manhunt than during the bombing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm getting downvoted by association, so I can't even engage in long-winded discussions outside of one post, because it's ineffective. The trolls have overrun the sub and downvoted everyone, slagged them, and threw context to the wind. Everyone is guilty by association here. I think that's a sign that the terrorists won, because you have a bunch of Americans effectively blocking free speech, with no regard for it's content.

       This is pretty much ramblings, I am sorry, nothing here is even support of what you were originally talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throwing context out of the wind is saying that the cops needed that civilian to catch the kid, when they did 99% of the work.
      </p>

       If you think that leting the cops look around your house is more terrible than living in fear of another bombing, than you do not understand what terror is.

       Hmm perhaps. Makes it even more confusing why he is here to stick up for the government. I guess I could also be wrongfully assuming he is defending the American government. Either way, he has heard the quote now, and I think it applies across the board.

       The point of dafragsta's comment (I think) is to ask why the govt is doing things that they have to hide, and consequently, lie about? Basically it's like they're saying "we do X, Y, Z because fuck you."

       No, because it is dangerous and unnecessary for the public to have all of the information they have. It is insane to imply you should have the same access as police and FBI agents have. It is not their fault you have no faith in others.

       A democratic government has authority to govern only if given consent by the governed. How can a population make educated decisions on who to allow to govern them when so much is kept secret? I am not talking about criminal investigations and evidence, I don't think that is what OP was referring to. When the government won't answer the questions of the people that pay for the government to exist, then they are no longer fulfilling the job of a democratic government, and should therefore be overthrown.

       Can you quote where I said that I was going to overthrow the government? I was basically paraphrasing the Declaration of Independence. "That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government..."

       This is why: because they are trying to make themselves appear in the best light they can. This is normal human behavior, not exclusive to the government. Ask
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       a pointed question about their job, implying that they're not doing their job very well or implying that you don't approve, and they will sound just the same way, defensive and trying to make themselves look good. Have you ever been in a business meeting where an idea is being pitched? You'll see the same kind of behavior. Even just asking someone about themselves, you can see how they're trying to depict themselves in the best light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that mean
       <em>
        everybody
       </em>
       who does not tell the absolute, undressed truth is covering up some huge secret? Of course not. They're just trying to look their best. Politicians don't give straightforward answers? Of course, because they care even more about their image than most others. Is that because they are covering something up? It's probably because they want to get
       <em>
        re-elected
       </em>

       Wonderful reply.  I think a lot of people forget that these people are human beings like the rest of us that usually have families they take care of and love, and they usually just want to do their job the best they can.

       But there is a huge leap needed to go from the line, " I do not believe the official story" and " the story was a complete cover up maintained by groups high in the government to take away your rights"

       plus no offense, but all these false flags have kinda not really worked since 9/11 if they are all true.

       That's an irresponsible claim when governments including the U.S. have a history of coverups and even officially documented plans for carrying out false flags.  When you couple this undeniable history with the lack of transparency on EVERYTHING, a logical-thinking person cannot help but deduce that the government is screwing us at every turn.

       Yes I am familiar with the Rahm quote. But instead of them having come up withe crisis, why can't they just take advantage of every crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the boston bombings, everyone is using it to push their agenda, people for immigration reform say this boston case helps, people against immigration say the boston incident helps their case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure the government has acted shady and continues to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's look at some false flags, Gulf of Tonkin? The US fired first, and in the second encounter before everything was known it was used as an excuse to go to war. What's more plausible that the whole thing was a set up? Or Nervous sailors got into a firefight and the government twisted and used that story as a pretext for war.

       You're going to have to do better than a Rahm Emmanuel quote paraphrasing an old chinese proverb.

       Did 9/11 allow bush to do things and enact legislation that he wouldn't have been able to do before? Damn right, but that in itself is not proof that he caused it, just that he used the aftermath to his advantage. (which i believe all people and governments do. look at this sub taking whatever events and using them to promote their own narative.)

       Is he wrong though?

       I disagree with government tactics. I know they do shady shit. I don't think they planned 9/11 or the Boston bombing. I still realize that government officials are usually not good people, and government is far from transparent. I absolutely loathe politics because it is so obvious that it's a huge act. I have a lot of different views.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I can still realize that without a government, without police, without many of the organizations we have, this country would most likely turn to shit. Don't get me wrong, it could  be A LOT better. But we are better off than a huge majority of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody thanks the government for anything. They just wait around for an opportunity to attack them, and that makes me sad.

       Yes, all the people in public works have plotted to exploit you. Most people involved in water infrastructure, super malicious Illuminati members.

       His shower water came from the government, to try and paint the process as corrupt in order to undermine the obvious fact which I stated....... is an invalid statement, logic wise...

       There's so much more that goes into taking a shower other than having the water. You overlooked almost everything to tailor the situation to support your viewpoint.

       Besides, it is irrelevant to the point I was making.

       Yeah you're right, it's government provided water. However I don't think municipal governments (the ones providing the water most likely) would be the likely culprits to be organizing terrorism and fear mongering, that's the job of the good old federal government. So there is a difference in my mind.
