        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What if these Chechen bastards didn&#39;t do it? This bombshell information was discovered by Kurt Richard Haskell..... WOW here is the REAL Bomber, i&#39;m telling you people this is the real deal you will be surprised who did the bombing, it was a women, all the pictures are below you can see her against the fence holding a tan/brown purse next to the mail box, then she is gone and the brown/tan purse is dropped on the ground at the exact location the bomb went off..... Kurt Richard Haskell discovered something last night that I think may be important. Here are some pics of the second bombing site, these are in time line order. If I was better with computers I would fix these pics to circle what I am talking about and delete the other notations:
(See photo at bottom of note, editied after posting)(Approximately 1 hour before detonation) Note the lady with black hair, sunglasses, white sweater. She is to the right and behind the trash bin. She appears to be alone. Later, instead of moving straight up to the fence, she proceeds around it to the right. This point is nothing major.
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200298369516730&amp;set=a.10200298369436728.1073741832.1078582045&amp;type=3&amp;theater">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200298369516730&amp;set=a.10200298369436728.1073741832.1078582045&amp;type=3&amp;theater</a> 
Ignore the arrow here. Notice that the lady has moved up to very close to where the 2nd bomb detonated. She is holding what appears to be a purse(?) Nothing is on the ground in front of her. Lu Lingzi can be seen over this woman&#39;s left shoulder. Lu Lingzi died at the scene. Lu Lingzi&#39;s friend can be seen to the back and left of Lu Lingzi.
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200298371436778&amp;set=a.10200298369436728.1073741832.1078582045&amp;type=3&amp;theater">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200298371436778&amp;set=a.10200298369436728.1073741832.1078582045&amp;type=3&amp;theater</a> 
Ignore the circles here. Note the plastic bag now in front of the brown bag woman.
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200298375076869&amp;set=a.10200298369436728.1073741832.1078582045&amp;type=3&amp;theater">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200298375076869&amp;set=a.10200298369436728.1073741832.1078582045&amp;type=3&amp;theater</a> 
The pic on the left is the next pic here. Note that the brown bag lady has left, however, her bag can now be seen on top of the white bag. Again, ignore the circles and the pic on the right.
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200298391877289&amp;set=a.10200298369436728.1073741832.1078582045&amp;type=3&amp;theater">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200298391877289&amp;set=a.10200298369436728.1073741832.1078582045&amp;type=3&amp;theater</a> 
The brown bag lady is still gone, but the bags are still there.</p>

<p>See the third picture down. This is the pic the government says shows the Chechneyan dropping a bomb at the site in his backpack. Note the location of the supposed drop, approximately 3 feet behind the fence and next to the tree. Also, in this pic, we see Martin Richard, one of the deceased, circled in blue. To Martin&#39;s right is his mother Denise. To his left, is his sister Jane. To Janes left is brother Henry. Behind Jane, is their father, Bill. Bill and Henry were not hurt in the blast. Denise suffered a brain injury and Jane lost a leg. </p>

<p><a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/16/17776320-adorable-boy-8-mourned-after-boston-marathon-blasts">http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/16/17776320-adorable-boy-8-mourned-after-boston-marathon-blasts</a>? </p>

<p>It was reported that this family just came from getting ice cream when the blast occurred, so this pic is very close to detonation time. Note that four of them are close to the fence and are leaning forward. Bill is backward a bit. The younger two kids are sticking their legs between the fence. Henry is merely leaning on it and likely stood up straight before the blast. The younger kids with their more entrenched positions, would likely have remained in such positions at detonation time. Denise is farthest to the right. Lu Lingzi and her friend are just to the right of this pic and not seen. Note Bill&#39;s close proximity to the tree, where the government says the bomb was located. Due to their positioning in this photo, it is most likely that the shrapnel flew from a right to left direction along the front of the fence line. Note Jane&#39;s protruding leg.
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200298392877314&amp;set=a.10200298369436728.1073741832.1078582045&amp;type=3&amp;theater">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200298392877314&amp;set=a.10200298369436728.1073741832.1078582045&amp;type=3&amp;theater</a> </p>

<p>This is the most important pic. Note that there is no damage to the right of the trash bin. If the bomb was next to the tree, there would be widespread damage to the area to the right of the trash bin (just behind the fence lined up directly with next to the tree) Also, note that it appears there are no injured between the trash bin and the tree although this is difficult to say as it is blurred in that area. It appears that the plastic bag and brown bag are gone. Note that the fence to the left has fallen on some victims. A blast from the right and behind it (tree area) would likely have spun that piece of fence in a clockwise direction or bent it around the sign post. Neither happened. It fell in the opposite direction. The middle piece of fencing is missing and was likely removed when the first responders appeared (Thrown in the street?). Two to three bars of the piece of the fence near the trash bin remain. Note that in the second pic above, the plastic bag sits between bars 2-6 of the fence that sit to the left of the trash bin. The rest of this fence piece obviously took quite a blast. It appears that the tree is not damaged. Note that there are powder burns on the trash bin. These occur only very close to an explosion. At site one, deceased victim Krystle Campbell had such black marks on her low back indicating her proximity to the blast. Note that the powder burns only exist at THE FRONT HALF OF THE LEFT SIDE (Look very closely) of the trash bin. Thus, the blast would have come from very near the trash bin and in front of it to the left. Lu&#39;s fatal wound was to her neck indicating an upward blast. It was of such a sever force that it killed her instantly. Thus, she very likely could have been leaning over the bomb when it detonated. It is likely that when brown bag lady left the scene, Lu and her friend would have moved up into brown bag lady&#39;s previous spot noted in the pictrues above. In the prior pic of Lu and her firend, her friend stood to the back and to the right of Lu. Such a position at detonation time is consistent with the injuries to Lu&#39;s friend, which were only to her left abdomen. Lu&#39;s body would have blocked her friend from the blast if the blast occurred in front of Lu/slightly to her right side.
Draw your own conclusions, but this evidence, to me, indicates that the blast came from the exact location of the plastic bag and the brown bag placed on top of it and NOT from back and by the tree as the government has told us. Thus, this evidence, in my opinion, makes brown bag lady suspect #1 and clears white hat Chechneyan as a suspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but, as far as I know there are no pictures of Tamerlan at bomb site #1. All that we have seen is Dzhokar supposedly dropping his backpack at site #2. Tamerlan was said to have placed his bomb at or near the finish line, which is one of the most photographed spots of the whole race. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say you said it was reported somewhere, I was just asking if you had a source.</p>

<p>But when a conspiracy theorist makes a statement based on their common sense, and then they are asked for a source, they are flamed and ridiculed for not being able to provide it. </p>

<p>Everyone has different levels of knowledge, different backgrounds, different areas of study. Everyone&#39;s &quot;common sense&quot; might be a little different. </p>

<p>While I do agree that common sense dictates each bomber had a specific location, there is nothing that states it as fact. You are using your opinion to argue another persons statement pointing out something, but offer no solid evidence to back it up. </p>

Someone notices a plastic bag in the way and either the owner or (if it was trash) some random citizen decided that it could be out of the way on the other side of the fence. Lady with purse (who is definitely there in all pictures) decides that her purse is getting bothersome to hold and decides to place it within eyesight on top of the plastic bag.

<p>The short survey above (I am male, so don&#39;t ask me) quickly summed up how women do not feel comfortable setting their bag anywhere off their person unless it is between their legs...especially in large crowds. And, if she thinks its a garbage bag--women have more pride in their purses than that O.o but, maybe just coincedence...the mailbox as a landmark makes this pretty hard to chalk off to coincedence, though (IMHO).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is one thing I will not hold with a grain of salt, it&#39;s a survey pertaining to a conspiracy event, listed on a conspiracy subreddit, where everyone is looking for some conspiracy to the point of claiming every gust of wind is something. </p>

<p>No one can claim to know the mindset of how every individual woman is thinking and I do not claim to now (I am also a male, haha). But using logic and simple guess work, it&#39;s pretty easy to pass this off as nothing more than what I stated before. Also, something to look at is the size of the purse and the type of bomb. I am pretty sure there is no pressure cooker in that ladies purse. Also, if we are claiming that SHE has something to do with it, then we are also claiming that the little old lady  is in on it too because she is the one who moved the plastic bag supposedly. </p>

<p>Anyway,The media hasn&#39;t covered anything really about the second blast site. There&#39;s been no mention of evidence (MSM or Net) placing either of the suspects at that site, only at the finish line, where they&#39;re BOTH visible in the same place at the same time. Next, there&#39;s not really any super gory pictures of the site after the blast, there&#39;s a couple floating around way after the fact, there&#39;s a little blood stain, but nothing in the magnitude of legs being blown off. Even at that, the blood is several feet behind where the blast took place, and magically the people standing RIGHT NEXT to the thing didn&#39;t bleed everywhere. These pictures (I wish the last one was still available, I haven&#39;t seen it yet either), are showing the brown bag on a woman&#39;s arm, like big purse. Then they show what appears to be the same brown purse/bag placed on top of a trash bag or something on the runner&#39;s side of the barricade, then the woman leaving. Clearly this is not a dark headed man with a boxer&#39;s build, nor is it a scrawny teen guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to see that footage. Also, I see now that the lady does appear to be there up until pic 5. If you compare the angle of the shadow on the brick wall to the right of the picture, and think of this as a sun dial, you&#39;ll notice that pics 5 and 6 are several several minutes apart. My <em>guess</em> is at least 20 minutes, probably longer. Would that allow enough time for her to leave? I&#39;m pretty sure it would.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve never said ANYTHING to the effect of  &quot;X number of people injured at the finish line, and X more further down the street&quot; They&#39;ve said anything remotely close to &quot; One of the victims of the second blast has this to say...&quot; They&#39;re just ignoring that it happened! The numbers they give are total numbers for both scenes, but they only SHOW the finish line. This is pretty common psychological trickery, the picture they show primes your mind&#39;s focus and then they SAY the larger number at the same time- your mind makes a subconscious connection between those two and left unchecked, Over time people forget there was a second site all together. It&#39;s same thing the media did over 9/11 concerning Building 7. Ask people today about Building 7- A huge  number of people will have no recollection of it, and if they do, they&#39;ll site the reason the towers fell for being what brought down build 7 in it&#39;s own foot print with a kink in the middle.</p>

It was attached to the portion that is bent around the mail box. If you look how it is bent around the green mail box it is bent on an angle upward.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, the fences on the left are clearly blown backwards away from the street, but the fence next to the bag does seemed broken and leaning on the mailbox. Maybe the force broke the fence and it swung forward after the blast? Either way, that type of damage to the metal fence indicates it was right next/very close to the blast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I would have put my bag down just like the woman did if I was tired and it was too heavy. If it was in front of the fence, it would be impossible for someone else in the crowd to swipe. On the other side of the fence, the only people who&#39;d have access to it are the marathon runners, who certainly wouldn&#39;t be concerned about stealing someone&#39;s bag right before they cross the finish line. So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that unusual that she did that. I do the same thing with my bag if I&#39;m in the front row at a concert.</p>

<p>The only way I could see this happening as you propose would be if there were a second, even stronger shockwave on the other side of the fence after the explosion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, the fences on the left are clearly blown backwards away from the street, but the fence next to the bag does seemed broken and leaning on the mailbox. Maybe the force broke the fence and it swung forward after the blast? Either way, that type of damage to the metal fence indicates it was right next/very close to the blast.</p>

<p>Also, where did the trash bag come from? It&#39;s there in some frames and not in others.</p>

<p>Post-blast, the object that could be the trash bag in the blurred photos is actually a person slumped on the sidewalk next to the mailbox. Probably the red-haired woman seen behind the mailbox and in front of the possible bag in 4 and 5.</p>

If the image was altered in photoshop, someone didn&#39;t know how to use the free transform tool very well. ALSO, the dude in the white near the bottom of the image stands out. Too bright? All of the white suits look different. But maybe that&#39;s a separate lighting issue. But since the image was taken from above, I would imagine that the same light source would be even for all of the folks in those white suits. This image reminds me of those bad doctored photos real estate agents use to mock-show prospective homes for sale...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The scariest part is that these lines like: &quot;&quot;You know that bombing at the marathon? Yeah, that was us.&quot;, are exactly the kind of lines that the general public eats up. </p>

<p>Its like there is a science to feeding people the dumbest possible, most fake, and most obviously scripted lines, to appease some kind of anti-critical thinking section of their brain.</p>

<p>Then they regurgitate things like, &quot;Of course they are the bombers, they even admitted it to the guy in the Mercedes.&quot;</p>

<p>I saw an entire thread about the bombers and many of the facts seemed so far-fetched and against logic, but the only thing that the general public could focus on was some circlejerk about how &quot;stupid&quot; the bombers were and that they obviously were &quot;complete idiots&quot;, etc...</p>

<p>And that is enough for them. So if you ask &quot;why would the bombers tell a random guy in a carjacking something like that, and then let him go pretty much immediately afterwards&quot; instead of thinking critically about it, they are fine with the answer &quot;because they are idiots&quot;.</p>

<p>That is fucking scary.</p>

<p>I question the initial shoot out Thursday night.</p>

<p>The weird thing about the shootout is that the mercedes is facing away from the police roadblock. Why does he turn it around and drive toward the police and smash through the road block? I mean, it&#39;s not like they were on a dead end, he could have just driven away in the direction the SUV was already facing.</p>

1) he was trying to kill cops and/or brother (or help his brother get away)
2) he wanted to go the direction where he could get to some main streets and most likely would be able to get away by car.</p>

<p>They were only shooting at cops in one direction. The street is open in the opposite direction. I suppose there could have been construction/road closure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this more accurately explains what happened: Someone moves trash bag in front of the gate and someone added more garbage that was brown. Perhaps a brown paper bag. Reason I think this:</p>

<ul>
<li>People heap garbage on garbage.</li>
<li>Brown is a popular bag color</li>
<li>Someone would notice a purse out there</li>
<li>If it was a brown paper bag, an explosion might not have sent it far.. could this be it? They look like similar objects compare the below images. The directionality of explosion &gt; trash bag &gt; brown object even seems correct.</li>

<p>Is there another photo of the scene just after the blast? Maybe a few seconds later, which would show if someone was moving the fence or if it was already down there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would be hard pressed to damage that thing with anything but a gun or a real strong crow bar after pounding 3 cans of nos--in short, piercing will dent it, but explosions will simply shake it up. Its thick, heavy sheet metal, bolted to the cement. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the railing is thin, maleable hollow pole metal that was most likely fractured in the blast. I think a fractured piece of railing right beside the resilient mailbox speaks enough evidence of how the mailbox stands against a blast. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, the fences on the left are clearly blown backwards away from the street, but the fence next to the bag does seemed broken and leaning on the mailbox. Maybe the force broke the fence and it swung forward after the blast? Either way, that type of damage to the metal fence indicates it was right next/very close to the blast.</p>

<p>Also, look at the fence to the right of the mailbox after the blast. It has the same shape. There&#39;s some sort of bend, it also appears to have been part of some V configuration before the blast. Weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Knowing victims =/= dispelling possibility of conspiracy. The only thing that needs to be faked is the information, not the circumstances. No one is suggesting that the victims or weapons were fake, or that the attackers were not actually extremists (well, perhaps some people have suggested that but, not most)--this sub simply understands that our government does not let a tragedy go to waste, and will actually encourage and abide one if it can be executed with enough people gobbling up the official story and silencing others till it blows over and we hype up yet another official story of another spectacle news story to replace speculation of the last one.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, information and details about the victims can easily be falsified, just like all these &quot;statements&quot; made by Jahar. We are supposed to believe everything the FBI is telling us after they have repeatedly lied about so much up to this point.

<p>So much for agreeing with me?</p>

<p>The truth about items in shrapnel has absolutely nothing to do with the truth of who detonated the bomb carrying the shrapnel. You always have to start to question what is true and falsified, regardless of whether you are pulling something out of your leg. Sry to sound cold. </p>

<p>I notice often that people who attack conspiracy theorists tend to do it while sympathizing with victims and claiming that theorists desrespect the victims by questioning the official story. Its pretty cheap but it works on people who are suggestible and feel guilty for the wrong reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Walkon--if you were part of a &quot;bomb drill&quot; after being recruited by the FBI, and then saw your face on T.V. as the prime suspect and realized you were F&#39;ed in the A...and were witty enough to realize they didn&#39;t want you testifying but preferred you dead and scapegoated, what exactly would you do?
I don&#39;t think they knew what to do either...
Hence, chaos.
[EDIT]: Still wondering how the fuck they got real bombs, though O.o</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could not have been that bag. At all. The fence in the post explosion picture is bent AROUND the post office box from the opposite way you are saying the bomb was placed. It would be the opposite if the bag was where you say it was. Completely wrong. It would take a hell of a lot of force to bend the fence that way. And your theory would have it blown the other direction. Wrong wrong wrong wrong </p>

The thing is bent pretty much at a 90 degree angle. If the blast occurred in the location of the plastic bag the barricade would have been blown backwards and not been bent around the corner of the mailbox.</p>
