I&#39;m tired of seeing you people come on here and completely ignore real, hard evidence that is easilly reasearched and flood this subreddit with derailing insults and stupid bullshit comments to fill up the page and force people away. You get paid for doing this right? Cause idk how the hell you people could make a living with how often you try to run this subreddit into the ground unless someone was paying you to do this...You guys don&#39;t even try to hide it. Its so obvious. When all our rights are taken away and were sitting in camps, I hope you all realize that it was because of your corrupt efforts that our entire race is gonna be completely enslaved. I&#39;m not religious, but if there is any kind of hell out there, i know theres a place in it already reserved for you evil bastards.

You try to call people stupid and silly without even seeing the corruption right in front of you. I cant tell if you people are really this ignorant and blind or if you are bullshit liars. Conspiracies have existed since the dawn of civilization and you think its so insane to believe it can happen still today? Aliens are an out-there idea with no hard evidence, the evil of men has always been. Let me guess, you still believe the official 9/11 report and the official report of the JFK assassination still too? Maybe if you wanna submerse yourself in the lies of this corrupt establishment you should get the hell off this subreddit and get back to your real job. People are already hard enough to help educate about things they don&#39;t want to believe cause it breaks down their sense of security.

Spreading misinformation and downplaying any evidence that surfaces to contradict what the establishment tells us even when the evidence is clearly supplied to you. Controlling the flow of information is much easier than you think when everything is compartmentalized and the people of the world are conditioned to have such a short attention span and are distracted by their every day bullshit and people like YOU telling them how to think. You guys like to say there is no basis for the things we say while blatantly ignoring and covering up all the evidence we present. Where is YOUR basis</p>

<p>Your logical fallacy is: <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/burden-of-proof">Burden of Proof</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The burden of proof lies with someone who is making a claim, and is not upon anyone else to disprove. The inability, or disinclination, to disprove a claim does not render that claim valid, nor give it any credence whatsoever. However it is important to note that we can never be certain of anything, and so we must assign value to any claim based on the available evidence, and to dismiss something on the basis that it hasn&#39;t been proven beyond all doubt is also fallacious reasoning.</p>

How blind are you man? Your counter points are completely irrelevent. Its not people standing on the street, its people who were actually IN the buildings. What better evidence is that? They found THERMITE in the BUILDINGS. The WTC buildings are the ONLY buildings to have collapsed due to damage like that in HISTORY. No plane hit the pentagon either. The dmage on the building simply doesn&#39;t match what a plane would have caused. And no footage of a plane hitting it even 11+ years later? Do you know how many cameras were pointed at the pentagon when that object hit it? Why have they not released that footage? Are you actually retarded? And you say the medias not in on it? They aren&#39;t controlled? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltP2t9nq9fI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltP2t9nq9fI</a>    and just for good measure<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>The airliner hitting it doesn&#39;t make a difference for the LAST TIME. They say the jet fueled is what melted the steel and caused the collapse but the fuel would have burned up instantly and doesn&#39;t burn hot enough to melt that steel. You can see images of cut beams in the wreckage as well as thermite found in it as well. what more do you need dude? Stop ignoring all the evidence im trying to give you...The collapse was a controlled demolition all the way. The actual architects who built it even say it shouldn&#39;t have collapsed due to such minimal damage. There have been fires 50x larger than the ones that engulfed the twin towers and guess what bud, those buildings are STILL standing. YOU are the one who is detached, believing everything the media tells you as truth when they are talking heads on a screen being paid to tell you information other people want you to hear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>agreed. </p>

<p>the blog with the shootout pics is what initially changed my mind, and then i read the fbi papers in full. they wouldn&#39;t claim to have those videos in the formal fbi paperwork if they didn&#39;t have them......just because they haven&#39;t been shown to the public yet doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t exist. he is going to be tried and you can&#39;t reasonably expect every piece, or any of the best pieces for that matter, of evidence to be revealed to the public before they have had a chance to present the case in court.</p>

<p>everyone here just needs to chill out. in time, the evidence which is the basis for the fbi&#39;s case will be released to the public. i truly believe that&#39;s all everyone here wants, evidence. it exists, and we will eventually see it.</p>

<p>personally, i&#39;ve seen enough to make my mind up thru the process of rational thought. but i don&#39;t appreciate being accused of having some sort of motive or gov affiliation simply because i have done so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And now you know how those of us who have evaluated 9/11 conspiracy evidence and found it to not have a rational basis are not sheeple or shills or whatever word you want to use. And while I post this you nuts will go through my 2 years of comment history to find my real identity. If you ruin my life because you are too neurotic to know that real people around you know what you know, and think you are stupid and dangerous, I guess I sacrifice my freedom for your cause.  And then you are no better than this made up group you hate.  </p>

<p>Is there any self reflection here that part of the motivation on the part of these two guys who decided to be violent because they read your conspiracy theories? I doubt it. Honest self reflection in light of new evidence isn&#39;t something this lot is known for. </p>

You really saw NOTHING out of the ordinary? Thermite found in the building, WTC7 falling demolition style after nothing hit it, witnesses in the buildings hearing explosions, military exercises for the same event on the same day, NO video of what hit the pentagon even though there are dozens and dozens of cameras watching it at all times? And that&#39;s just for starters. How can you say there is NO rational basis? You people blow my mind.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be sad if the statement wasn&#39;t so laughable. Yep, nothing hit that building, definately not the two largest buildings on the planet standing next to it. The fact you can say such a thing with a straight face blows my mind. </p>

And the blatantly bullshit official story that architects and engineers the world ever have agreed make no sense somehow IS rational?? watch the video of wtc 7 falling. there is no damage to the thing! even if a chunk of one of the larger buildings hit it, it wouldn&#39;t collapse like THAT if at ALL. If you had any kind of knowledge of physics, architecture and how those buildings should have, or in this case SHOULDN&#39;T HAVE fallen, you would see how much of an idiot you are making yourself out to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Better men than I have already debunked your theory and explained why the building collapsed from the fire and debris that hit it.  You haven&#39;t explained why they needed to destroy a building with a controlled demolition rather than doing literally anything else to move or destroy whatever they needed to move or destroy. </p>

<p>So if I&#39;m the one planning this whole thing, why do I need to make sure WTC 7 falls down?  It doesn&#39;t make the difference in the emotional effect of the attack, I watched it go down on TV but since it was mostly evacuated and was hours after the two other buildings fell down, nobody really cared emotionally about WTC 7.  So you have some theory that there was something they needed to get rid of. Well if they needed to do that, I&#39;m sure movers would have been far less conspicious than planting explosives.  </p>

<p>Why send a missile to the Pentagon when they already had a plane in the air that they needed to get rid of?  Why go through the trouble of finding a secret airstrip to take apart a plane and get rid of the bodies of the passangers when they have a perfectly good pentagon to fly it into?  </p>

<p>In no way does your theory follow occam&#39;s razor. But you get off on your secret knowledge of how the world really works, and the world is a much less scary place if the only bad guys are the ones in black helocopters rather than the guy who lives down the street from you. You have already made up your mind and have a devotion to your beliefs that match that of any theist.  Any evidence that I present that confronts your worldview will trigger the backfire effect and you will resolve the cog dis by further entrenching yourself in your beliefs.  So I&#39;m done here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m half and half on this one.  I do think there is a lot not right about the whole 9/11 affair.  However, I am a rare person in that I read the Official Report, it was dull reading, but it categorically states, several times that they they have nothing concrete as to how the buildings fell, and they list the fact that many computer models were designed and most failed to collapse the buildings.  However, the only feasible model they created, which was based on the days events that did collapse the building has to be the one they go with, but they left it an open verdict on the collapse.  As in, they don&#39;t know!  They never say anywhere that they know for a fact how it collapsed, despite what the MSM says.</p>

<p>The main reason why I agree with the Official story is that any conspiracy of this magnitude would have had to have involved a thousand or more specialists, and not one opened their mouths?  It just doesn&#39;t ring true.  All of this Thermetic material found under the trade centres, anyone who knows how a furnace works can tell you that if you encase a fire with concrete and small air holes it will get much hotter than it should.  Water boils at 100c, and not matter what you do in a lab it will always boil at 100c, until you put it under pressure and then what happens?  It becomes super heated, up to 374c.  Encasing jet fuel in concrete will push the temperature higher than is normally possible, purely because of the pressure build up.  Oh and it&#39;ll carry on burning for weeks.</p>

<p>For every conspiracy around the event, there is a reasonable Official explanation.  Oh, and the Official documents are only &#39;Experts best guesses&#39;.  They even state all over the place that they are theorizing.  MSM would have all the major conspiracy theorists that they are saying &#39;it happened this way, if you disagree you&#39;re a traitor&#39;!  They don&#39;t say anything like that!  Ignore the MSM!  The MSM is completely out of control and actually fuel conspiracies because of bad reporting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very reasonable response. I am not an engineer so I can&#39;t say how the building fell exactly. But considering a huge building fell right next to it seems like a much more likely explanation than any &quot;controlled demolition&quot; nonsense. If you are going to say it was a controlled demolition of building 7, you have to explain why. There is no explanation that is more reasonable than the &quot;official story.&quot;  </p>

<p>People act like the official story isn&#39;t a conspiracy. It was a conspiracy that was successful. These islamists conspired to do it, and were effective. I hate the wars and limitations on our freedoms that people within government have implimented exploiting this tragedy, but you can&#39;t fight those assaults on liberty if you don&#39;t even understand how they came about with false conspiracy theories. Too often we let the tinfoil hat times spread their falsehoods uncontested. Who knows what would have happened if the Boston Bombers weren&#39;t mislead by these false 9/11 trutherisms.  They were conspiracy theoriests who engaged in another conspiracy to murder Americans, which will be used by LEO to further surpress our freedoms, which will cause further violence.  It is a cycle, and false conspiracy theories are a key part of that. Another American Muslim kid could be reading reddit or twitter right now, and think the US government is out to get him, and then decide to take it out on innocent civilians.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly!  The Official report even had experts go through the rubble of all the buildings looking for evidence of bombs inside the buildings.  They thought that maybe a team of Islamists had disguised themselves as workmen and pre-planted explosives weeks before the planes hit.  They found nothing!  There were no unscheduled works.  Or anything else that could have been infiltrated by militant terrorists.  </p>

<p>We must always ignore what the MSM says.  I already posted about the MSM lying constantly and fueling conspiracy theories, because they also own the conspiracy sites.  So, it&#39;s a double pay day for them!  Someone responded saying I must be ultra paranoid, so I went to the New York Times website, and chose the very first story and looked for the lies, it took me about ten seconds to find a provable lie.  Look in my history to see it, it&#39;s quite funny!</p>

<p>The only conspiracies I see are nearly always the result of bad reporting by MSM.  If you bide your time and wait for the official documents to be released, then spend a couple of weeks reading through, you find them to be extremely well researched.  However, the truth is never as much fun as a good conspiracy is it?  All this, Obama wants rid of the guns, they&#39;re gonna take our guns.  Then it get&#39;s to Senate and gets thrown out!  So much for that conspiracy!  But then the conspiracy theorists run around self congratulating themselves because they say it was only because they had exposed their lie!</p>

<p>People hate the fact that the world is in a state of disorganized chaos, and nobody has a clue what anyone else is doing!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreeing with MSM makes you a moron.  Agreeing with an Official story is fair enough.  Go and read the official 9/11 documentation and you see that the MSM misreported this.  The official documentation is actually quite reasonable, they say several times that they don&#39;t know how the towers collapsed.  They are very open about the fact that specialists debated and built several models, and the majority of models failed to collapse the towers, the only plausible one was chosen as the only explanation they could find.  They stress it remains open.  The MSM would have you believe they categorically state the towers collapsed in exactly this pancake fashion, when no official documentation exists that says anything like how the MSM would have people believe.</p>

<p>We are all guilty of what used to be termed &#39;Coffee table book experts&#39;.  As in, we are guilty of taking snippets of misinformation and running off with it.  Then screaming and shouting saying that a respected MSM institution like the New York Times claimed this or that, without stopping to consider that the NYT printed some bullshit and the next day posted a retraction!  You cannot trust anything the MSM present.  Do have a read of official reports, they are full of conjecture and theory and are quite boring, but you will learn more than you will from that than from the best of the MSM.</p>

I&#39;ll never know unless I was there myself to witness the event.  I won&#39;t believe either way because I can be fooled too.  Typically the ones that fool the best have the best resources.

    <div class="md"><p>The lines are also very blurry around here. We are all on a spectrum of our beliefs. You have &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; theorists and every level in between, if you will, and I can&#39;t help but wonder how often we turn on our own. Divide and conquer techniques may be in play but it seems sometimes the &quot;conservatives&quot; shush the &quot;liberals&quot; to maintain an appearance they hold true and vice versa. For example, I had someone argue with me that since within 3 days no evidence of people being outraged at the Boston &quot;home invasions&quot; that it must only be true that they were all ok with it and looking for evidence was confirmation bias. I can see it going both ways. On one hand they could have been trying to keep the crazy down as a true skeptic but on the other hand they could have been a straight up shill. Hard to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The MSM and the Official evidence are two very different things.  Whatever comes out in the &#39;Official Evidence&#39; will be misreported by the MSM, because that&#39;s what MSM does, it misreports every event.  I am waiting for the Official Evidence to come out, and go to only &#39;Official&#39; sources to read what they say.  Because I know if I read the MSM it&#39;ll be a quarter complete lies. </p>

<p>At the moment I do believe it was these two brothers, but I do have a few little nags.  One of my main worries is that within Boston, all that crime was taking place, car chases, bombs being thrown, kids running around with guns and yet not a single Redditor was there to photograph anything and post it to Reddit first!  Reddit is huge now, it&#39;d be the absolute first place I would post a pic (low res), secondly I&#39;d offer it to the MSM for cash and absolute last I&#39;d send it to the FBI.  In fact, if I was a bit tired after negotiating a cash deal for my hires images I&#39;d skip sending it to the FBI.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not alone in this thinking!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s great we have all these people here.  I&#39;ve not been posting for a long time and I do get caught up with some conspiracy theories because they hold water.  We need people to come and say something is BS and give an explanation as to why they think a theory we may hold is wrong.  It is called debate!  I believe quite a few conspiracy theories, but I don&#39;t think this one is a conspiracy, I think the gvt would like people to think they had a hand it in because the gvt think it&#39;s a much better message to send that &#39;they control it all&#39; rather than the truth which is more along the lines of &#39;what a bunch of clueless fucktards the gvt are&#39;.  So they&#39;ll leak info that says &#39;they had him on a database&#39; or &#39;yes we interviewed him, he was flagged by interpol&#39;  anything that makes it look like they were involved, because they are scared shitless of the US public seeing the gvt for the incompitent idiots they really are!  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it before, I have worked in gvt for 20+ years, in every major dept and the gvt has to put a sticker on every photocopier, because nobody really knows who owns them!  They are that stupid!  I have a worthless, shit degree and I work in gvt!  Everyone I know who works in gvt is either a failed businessperson or has a shit degree, or is an under represented ethnicity (who got their jobs through equal opps) or are physically or mentally handicapped.  Please, I beg you, go to your local CIA or FBI office and look at the retarded workers that go limping and shuffing into those places, then ask yourself &#39;Am I afraid of them?&#39;  </p>

<p>Why? Well, because you are; sorry. I seriously, seriously, seriously doubt that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has any bearing on a government, or corporation&#39;s decision making process or intelligence gathering (hindering) efforts. </p>

<p>As far as 99.99999999999% of the world is concerned, this subreddit either doesn&#39;t exist or is just a bunch of tin foil hat assholes. Mostly because of asinine posts like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like the conspiratard crowd feels they&#39;re on a mission from god to outshout anything questioning the government,  Look how many ctard regulars show up here trying to cut off inquiry.  Whether they&#39;re obsessive mentally ill people or agents, either way, they come here to silence discussion. The action is pretty obvious, the true motivation less so.</p>

<p>I just read today that Obama has set up &quot;The Interagency Working Group to Counter Online Radicalization” .</p>

<p>What is the difference between anyone inquiring into government malfeasance, and radicalization requiring countering?  I&#39;m betting the agency will end up making no difference, and setting up politics-driven activity to suppress things like r/conspiracy.</p>
