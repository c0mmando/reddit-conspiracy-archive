    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;m not a fan of Alex Jones but how do you propose running a radio station, a site with a huge amount of traffic, funding employees salaries, flights for in the field reporting, competitions etc? that&#39;s right, advertising. The same way TV stations and channels get their funding. </p>

<p>Its a weak argument to suggest that Jones can&#39;t advertise anything because you don&#39;t think its relevant or important. Without advertising then the whole thing might not be as good. Does he sensationalise, yes, but at the same time he does talk about and has talked about a range of topics that have been more broadly accepted in society which are good talking points.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>AJ&#39;s work is one of the big reasons I started questioning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As someone who believes there is evidence suggesting AJ is a dis info agent (Bill Cooper says he is, he has alleged ties to Stratfor, he is the &quot;face&quot; of conspiracy, he always wants you to buy something, he is an advocate of violent overthrow and freedom through blind rage, fear mongering, he gets on the MSM sometimes, and just his attitude in general); Are you sure that AJ actually <em>made</em> you question, or whether he was just the first one you saw (due to his mainstream attention)? I could be wrong but I think that for AJ&#39;s facts to get through to you, despite his ridiculous behavior, you were open minded anyway, and if AJ didn&#39;t exist, you most likely would have come to the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; side eventually. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If he is controlled opposition then he sucks at it lol. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, I think the opposite. From my experience he actually spread some of the best info around (In which case saying he is a &#39;dis info agent&#39; isn&#39;t necessarily accurate; controlled opposition is a better term). It&#39;s his attitude that get us. from the POV of a &quot;skeptic&quot;,  AJ is one of their primary reasons for why we are all considered crazy. Review any time he has been in the MSM and you will see that he provides little facts, and just makes us all look stupid. His debate with piers Morgan could have been better handled by a 13 year old. </p>

<p>If Jones is controlled opposition he is <em>perfect</em> at it. He spreads good info  getting those of us who can see past his attitude/demeanor to trust him, but alienates us from the public because we are the only ones who even give him a chance and everyone thinks we&#39;re crazy because all they see is him screaming and yelling like a lunatic. One day, he could very well spread dis info, and because he&#39;s never been wrong in the past, many of us trust him without question (the whole problem in the first place; that we &#39;trust&#39; people with power). Then maybe the media exposes that it was all horeshit and we all look stupider. Or maybe we play right into the hands of the &#39;agenda&#39;. Who knows. </p>

<p>All I ask is that, regardless of the evidence, <em>everyone</em> remain skeptical, everyone question everything, and everyone <strong>trust no one</strong>. These people have trillions of dollars in influence and billions of connections; infiltration is not only likely but certain. There are shills and dis info and everything else, and they are doing everything they can to get you to fall for it. And if you don&#39;t question everyone, even people who&#39;ve never steered you wrong in the past, you could very well end up played. </p>

<p>edit: clarified a little</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying AJ doesn&#39;t speak some truth, but truth isn&#39;t what he&#39;s after.  IMO, AJ exists for two reasons : to promote fear (and as a side-effect inaction) and to make conspiracy theorists look insane.  Beck actually exists for the same two reasons.  The difference between the two is that they are targeted to two separate demographics.  Once soccer moms start regularly questioning MSM and visiting r/conspiracy, you can bet your ass that there will be a new face in the conspiracy world targeted at them as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll speak for myself because Glenn Beck is a divisive person. To be honest Glenn Beck led me to question many traditional establishments when he was on Fox News; I conclude without the work he did on Fox News I may not even be on this subreddit. I was a run of the mill neo-con a few years ago but Glenn Beck really did a great job at exposing several things while on Fox News and I watched him every day he was on. With that said Glenn Beck has proven since leaving Fox News however that his legitimacy in truth was lost; he backstabbed Ron Paul supporters during the GOP Presidential nominee process among several other things. </p>

<p>Glenn Beck&#39;s work on Fox News eventually pushed me to Alex Jones. Alex Jones has a possibility of being some agent where he looks crazy to the general public and thus paints everyone who may hold somewhat similar beliefs in the same light. I also used to watch him everyday but I suddenly realized a lot of what he was predicting (economic collapse, etc) wasn&#39;t coming to fruition and he was just saying empty words. At the same time he DOES bring a lot of good reporting/information to the table so I sometimes listen to him; now I just take things that he says with a bit less trust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are both in the entertainment industry, and that&#39;s it. They sell books and DVD&#39;s (if Beck has those, I don&#39;t know) and get listeners/watchers by selling panic, fear, and paranoia to the masses. And the gullible drones who would question you if you told them the sky was blue lap it all up.</p>

Alex Jones is putting on a show for you people. Alex Jones puts on a show with the help of a nice government to give him some real credibility of debunking the mans bullshit.</p>

<p>Glenn Beck does it too.</p>

<p>Mr. Beale does it in Network. </p>
