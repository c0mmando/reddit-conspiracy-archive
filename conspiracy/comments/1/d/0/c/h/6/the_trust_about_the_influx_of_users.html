    <div class="md"><p>Which is your favourite aspect of portrait, the sermon? the discussions with cranly? How is that not then repeated in Scylla and Charybdis. How is Finnegans Wake not the natural progression of the man&#39;s work after Ulysses? Which if any is your favourite chapter of Ulysses? My least favourite chapters are the romance novel one and the very last Penelope chapter. My favourites are pretty much all of the rest, especially Oxen of the Sun. Try RobotWisdom&#39;s site for a little insight into Joyce.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny nobody can see that all these conspiracies actually empower the gvt.  If one bunch of people are sheep and believe the official story, they are easily controlled and probably lead nice, secluded, happy lives.  If you believe conspiracies, you still believe the gvt are in control.  Can&#39;t you see that all you&#39;re doing is presenting no enemy - the gvt are both the light and dark, good and bad, God and the Devil.  This is all a win win for those in power!</p>

<p>What you should do, is realize that the gvt have no power at all.  They don&#39;t know why the twin towers fell, they don&#39;t know why the bombings happened in Boston, they haven&#39;t got a clue about anything at all but are stage managing it to make it appear as though they know everything!  I&#39;ve worked in both state and national Gvt and can categorically state that I have never worked in any Dept that knew it&#39;s ass from it&#39;s elbows.  No two depts speak to each other, there is zero sharing of information.  They don&#39;t even know who they rent the photocopy machines from!  They are clueless and you&#39;re all thinking it&#39;s this big machine (wheels within wheels) and they can organize events like these!  No Gvt dept could successfully run a toffee shop let alone organize an event like 9/11 or these Boston Bombs.  </p>

<p>The truth is this.  If you work for the gvt you are a failure, you got a shit degree (if you even have one), or you are a member of a minority group (equal opps policies got you the job), or are disabled (mentally or physically).  Go and stand outside the CIA offices and just watch the rejects that really work for the gvt!  They aint Hollywood types that&#39;s for sure! </p>

<p>And we have to read:</p>

<p>The man with no legs has real injuries.  There are dead people and they are not actors.   The government officials were not even there.  No drills, no dogs, nothing.   The bombers are guilty based on a photograph of them at the event.  One is executed and the other facing death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with what you say.  All media, including all the so called &#39;trusted sources&#39; are trying to make money.  Go ahead, get one of the thousands of photos off the web of the Boston Marathon and photoshop something suspicious into that picture, it doesn&#39;t matter what, just make it look damned good, then contact both the mainstream and the conspiracy news sources and tell them you have a picture from the Marathon that clearly shows (whatever you want it to show) and tell them that they can have the photo for $1,000.  Or simply email them and tell them that you have a HD close up video of both brothers actually removing a pressure cooker bomb from a backpack and walking with it!  Ask for $10,000 and just see how you are inundated with calls, tell whoever contacts you first that you&#39;ve just had your asking price doubled by (choose your news network) and can they do better, do the same to the next and the next and the next.  Now sit back and watch just how much money you could potentially make, even if the photo/video is completely fake you could net a few million from it.  Everyone is making money from this.  Reddit is building it&#39;s reputation (and worth) with more people discussing this crap, the news media is selling advertising (and news to other agencies).  It&#39;s one giant rake in!</p>
