       Relatively unexposed to the details surrounding Martin Richard, I just know that if this is a whole conspiracy, pretty messed up if it resulted in an 8 year old child dying.

       The boy was real, sadly. His father studied under one of my professors.

      <p>
       EDIT: Regardless of proof, my professor's integrity is rock solid. Sorry for the lackluster response though, I hope it helps some of you in some way or another.

       This is true. Not even a statement from the parents. Sandy Hook parents were all over MSM and what were the injuries of the two girls standing next to him? They are in just as dangerous of a position.

       How about twoi little league coaches.  FWIW the father did make a statement and asked for privacy considering his daughter also lost a leg and his wife has TBI.

       Great question. Realize that there are a lot of shills trying to make this subreddit "more mainstream" by discrediting you in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have wondered this myself. People have accepted such a thing as "witness protection" and "change of identity" for decades before, but that is nonexistent today.

       Calm down man, even if his question may be stupid you shouldn't attack people.  Why would he have a hard time living with himself after asking a question?  Is he unable to still feel empathy for a dead child after asking?  How do you know this person didnt feel more empathy towards that child before asking this question that you did in the first place?  If you dont have something nice to say, dont say anything at all

       Don't throw links at me.  Tell me what you believe in your own words.  I've dealt with the shilliest of shills, on all of these issues, and never lost the argument.  You want a go?
      </p>

       You know why I don't lose?  Because I argue the side of truth, which defends itself.  Only lies are indefensible.  I don't have to use dishonest debate tactics, while you by definition must.   I'm rubbing my hands together already in anticipation of your folly.

      <p>
       I also explained to you in my previous comment exactly what took place. The East support columns were damaged from the WTC collapse, they gave way, which is why the roof sunk in shortly before the rest of the building collapsed.

       What you are doing right now, is changing the subject, avoiding the roofs collapse, and avoiding the diagram showing exactly where the collapse began.

       First mistake.  The NIST report confirms our own measurements.  They themselves acknolwedge in the appendix of the final report on WTC7 that free fall acceleration was measured for 2.5 seconds (about 8 stories)  How can you explain that?  They can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not avoiding anything.  The penthouse collapses first because it is only supported by one column - it is a big empty space.   This column is blown out first.  You can't honestly expect me to make the logical leap that because the penthouse collapsed first that the ensuing total collapse just happened.. .inevitably.  That's fudging.

       *The analyses of the video (both the estimation of the instant the roofline began to descend and the calculated velocity and acceleration of a point on the roofline) revealed three distinct stages characterizing the 5.4 seconds of collapse:
      </p>
      <pre><code>Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).
Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)
Stage 3 (4.0 to 5.4 seconds): decreased acceleration, again less than that of gravity
</code></pre>
      <p>
       This analysis showed that the 40 percent longer descent time—compared to the 3.9 second free fall time—was due primarily to Stage 1, which corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns in the lower stories of the north face. During Stage 2, the north face descended essentially in free fall, indicating negligible support from the structure below. This is consistent with the structural analysis model, which showed the exterior columns buckling and losing their capacity to support the loads from the structure above. In Stage 3, the acceleration decreased as the upper portion of the north face encountered increased resistance from the collapsed structure and the debris pile below.*

       Take a look at this structural analysis model.   They made a video of it.  Try and get the input file if you want to reproduce it yourself.  I'm unable to.
      </p>
      <p>
       This video they made of their analysis does not match the video record of the collapse.  Not even close.  To say it is consistent is a fudge.  Is being 5% consistent with reality enough for you?
      </p>
      <p>
       The model doesn't even proceed to explain through the point of total collapse.  You'll see their video stops at this point.   Likely because the difference from reality is tragically comic.

       How could you prove he exists?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is good reason to believe he never did.   The rest of that family is staying very quiet, as if they didn't exist either.

       Too bad.  Also Jeff Bauman's friends.   Assholes.  Even Dzhokhar the alleged bomber has all his friends rallying online.. but Jeff?  Must have been a loner.

       Calm down man, even if his question may be stupid you shouldn't attack people.  Why would he have a hard time living with himself after asking a question?  Is he unable to still feel empathy for a dead child after asking?  How do you know this person didnt feel more empathy towards that child before asking this question that you did in the first place?  If you dont have something nice to say, dont say anything at all

       First mistake.  The NIST report confirms our own measurements.  They themselves acknolwedge in the appendix of the final report on WTC7 that free fall acceleration was measured for 2.5 seconds (about 8 stories)  How can you explain that?  They can't.

       I'm not avoiding anything.  The penthouse collapses first because it is only supported by one column - it is a big empty space.   This column is blown out first.  You can't honestly expect me to make the logical leap that because the penthouse collapsed first that the ensuing total collapse just happened.. .inevitably.  That's fudging.
