        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Bloomberg  <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-08/congress-hinders-boston-bomb-inquiry-by-blocking-sharing-of-data.html">published this article</a> calling for the chemical &quot;tagging&quot; of all dangerous materials and tracking all potential &quot;threats&quot;.  The article starts out focusing on gunpowder.</p>

<p>The powder used by the Boston bombers is Black Powder, the same stuff invented some time in the 9th century and used by every squirrel hunter in the US up until about 1875.  As you can easily extrapolate, the manufacturing and chemical industries of the 9th century (and of the 17th century squirrel hunter) were limited: a guy in a shack out in the woods ain&#39;t no Monsanto.</p>

<p>Key gunpowder ingredients are charcoal (from wood) and nitrogen (from manure).  We certainly cannot allow the manufacture of the raw ingredients for gunpowder, and pooping in the woods is doing exactly that.  So: will we all soon have to be fitted with surveillance monitors so &quot;they&quot; can track whenever some citizen makes the radical move of pooping in the woods?</p>

<p>The situation is out of control.  Bears all across America are manufacturing the raw materials to fuel the evil terrorists.  What do we do?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s some serious extrapolation there.  Maybe they just want to make it harder for people to get their hands on explosive material?</p>

<p>The processes we use today I&#39;m sure are significatly more advance for creating black powder than they were in the 9th century.  The idea of keeping those materials away from people who could harm others seems like a sensible idea.  It&#39;s the same thing as limiting people from buying tons of sudafed to keep them from making meth.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize that you are solely responsible for what you put in your body.  The thing a lot of people aren&#39;t responsible.  What if you put chemicals into your body that cause you to hurt other people?  That&#39;s exactly what meth can do.  It doesn&#39;t always do it, but it can, and those instances where it does are pretty crazy.  </p>

<p>I can appreciate your viewpoint that humans should be more self regulated instead of big brother regulating us, but having seen a lot of the humans that I have, I think some degree of regulation is necessary.  I&#39;m completely okay with the goverment attempting to decrease people from ingesting certain chemicals.  I believe the end justifies the means in that particular scenario.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is that the &#39;processes we use today&#39; are a mere convenience for owners of black powder firearms.  In fact, some black powder enthusiasts use the same methods that the 17th century squirrel hunter used because that method is more authentic - and just as effective as modern methods.</p>

<p>All that tracking sudafed has accomplished is the creation of a cottage industry for homeless people: the small meth makers just sub out the sudafed procurement to untraceable &#39;contractors&#39;.  The large labs don&#39;t use sudafed at all.  In case you haven&#39;t noticed, meth manufacturing is still thriving. </p>

<p>Anyone who actually believes that those two Boston college students would have been unable to figure out how to make their own black powder is simply not thinking the issue through.</p>

<p>The pursuit of public safety at the insane cost of monitoring everything, done by everyone, all the time, has to be stopped.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have speed limits, but do people always follow that law? No, they don&#39;t.  At the same time, putting a rev limiter on cars to keep them from going above a certain speed I believe would be going too far.  There&#39;s a line to be crossed, and I don&#39;t believe we have crossed it.  The same thing happened after the OJ bombings with fertalizer.  Can people still make bombs, even though it&#39;s harder to get fertalizer to make them with? Yes, but maybe the bombs they make are smaller, or maybe the effort they have to put it is so much more that they&#39;ll be discouraged.</p>

<p>I agree that at some point, the pursuit of public safety at the cost of our freedom is not worth following.  But I don&#39;t believe we have gotten there.  Call me a sheep, but it seems sensible to me for the goverment to track certain materials that could be used in events like the boston bombings.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t looked up the actual process, but yes.  Black powder, the stuff used in all guns for a couple of centuries, is just Potassium nitrate, Charcoal, and Sulfur.   <a href="http://www.skylighter.com/fireworks/how-to-make/Black-Powder-Quick-and-Cheap.asp">Right here</a> is a link to a formula for fireworks type black powder; I left out the dextrin as it&#39;s only needed to make the stuff easy to handle and measure, and for mad bombers that&#39;s likely not important.</p>

<p>Back in the day, the main source of Potassium nitrate was manure.  They mixed manure with ashes, straw and dirt, urinated on it regularly for a year or so, rinsed out the pile with water and let the water evaporate.</p>

<p>Nowadays you just buy fertilizer, which is mostly Potassium nitrate.  Hence the recent fertilizer factory explosion in Texas.</p>
