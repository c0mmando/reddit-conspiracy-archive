I think he is fear mongering and often gives us a bad name (although many of you do that job by yourselves). That being said, I will forever respect him for breaking into bohemian grove (enormous contribution), and transitioning many people from left/right to at least thinking about all of these issues. I&#39;d rather listen to someone who reads infowars than watches MSNBC/FOX. What are your guy&#39;s thoughts as I know he&#39;s a very polarizing figure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are basing you&#39;re entire thesis of Alex Jones around an issue that he REPEATEDLY expresses HIMSELF. </p>

<p>&quot;Second is that he is a figurehead and a movement away from control is not to follow another single figure, he is just another shepherd walking off with all the black sheep portion of the flock.&quot;</p>

<p>If you actually listen to Alex Jones on a regular basis, for YEARS, you would KNOW that he consistently insists that his listeners lead ON THEIR OWN. Alex does not want to be the figurehead of this &quot;movement&quot;, he is the figurehead by default due to his popularity and success.</p>

<p>Alex isn&#39;t dangerous, what&#39;s dangerous is the speculation and the conspiracies surrounding and focusing solely on ALEX. THAT is DIVIDE and CONQUER, THAT is co-intel pro. If you can&#39;t comprehend that, than you simply don&#39;t understand what actual divide and conquer is. If you disagree with Alex, I challenge you to debate him. You won&#39;t get very far before he starts ranting and raving like a lunatic (he&#39;s good at that) and either hangs up on you or makes you look/sound like a fool on HIS radio show. He has every right to do that. </p>

<p>If you want to go out there and fight the good fight on your own, Alex encourages you to do that. Alex encourages you to challenge him as well, and he does this on a regular basis. If you are claiming that he doesn&#39;t do this, you&#39;re simply lying, or you don&#39;t actually LISTEN to his show.</p>

<p>Alex isn&#39;t right all the time, and I defend him a lot.... which I shouldn&#39;t because he has a lot of flaws and imperfections... but the reason WHY I defend Alex is because he is attacked for all the wrong reasons and he is portrayed in a way that is detrimental and even hypocritical to this entire &quot;movement&quot; (and I put that in quotes because it&#39;s not really a movement at all, it&#39;s FUBAR to be honest) because it detracts from the actual issues on hand and focuses solely on the messanger. </p>

<p>What about all of the AMAZING and ENLIGHTENING interviews Alex has done? Most of you seem to focus entirely on Alex&#39;s rants and tirades, quite possibly one of the most negative aspects of the entire &quot;Alex Jones show&quot;. The real gems of his show are the interviews he has with prominent, respected, notable people who spew out tons of amazing and credible information. </p>

<p>Every radio host is imperfect, has spin, manipulates conversations to express their biased point of view... however, all of this hoopla about Alex being part of the grander conspiracy himself... you guys are really missing the bigger picture here. I&#39;ve been listening to Alex since I was 16, I&#39;m 27 now and his show hasn&#39;t affected my life negatively one bit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought you were confused on the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; aspect as well...and now I definitely see you are confused on &quot;attacking&quot; and &quot;allies&quot; also.</p>

<p>Jones is a lot of things...conservative, pro life, Christian, overly animated, and prone to seeing conspiracies in every bush.  That said, he has said many times that he doesnt wish to be the &quot;leader&quot;....that he wants people to look at the information FROM ALL SOURCES for themselves...and he preaches empowerment and being proactive.  He puts out about 3 hours of free audio content a day for well over a decade now and allows for his documentaries to be copied and distributed.</p>

<p>How that becomes &quot;a shepherd who wishes to indoctrinate and profit&quot; I will never understand.   Jones is flawed, but give the man some credit.  His info and his approach are better than the mainstream media and his advertisements are no worse than the Pharma-feuled ads on cable or the millionth Stamps.com ad on your podcast feed.  Strangely, I do think gold and seeds are more worthwhile than Zoloft and Web Hosting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just want to offer my support for this video. I listened to a shortened version of this broadcast a while back and it definitely helped me to evaluate jones and really all conspiracy celebrities more critically.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also this which has been posted on this subreddit before: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_THaKJVen8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_THaKJVen8</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting video, and perhaps warrants a less pathos-filled examination. But it does seem to suggest caution should be exercised.</p>

<p>edit: and my favorite video I&#39;ve come across that relates to this matter is this interview with robert anton wilson: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A8O43tc36k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A8O43tc36k</a></p>

<p>edit2: I&#39;ve found my old links for these videos have a short life before they are taken down. I encourage the use of something like <a href="http://keepvid.com/">http://keepvid.com/</a> to retain these videos for your personal use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he genuinely cares about the info he gives on his show and the direction our country is going. I think he is a genuine person and what you see is really him. He makes mistakes like everyone else and is obviously human. He get&#39;s a little crazy sometimes because he cares. I can&#39;t think of one person that has awoken as many people as he has to all the corruption around the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same way about Jones but I don&#39;t listen to him apart from the times he has a good guest on like Gerald Celente. I think he means well but he uses fear to sell his products. I realise that Jones has a big operation and that the films and merchandise fund that but it is exerted way too much. At the end of the day, if you listen to one source of information and rely on that then the spectrum is too narrow to form an opinion. I think his sensationalism has increased over the past few years and he has become increasingly erratic but somehow I understand that if you have information that you&#39;ve been trying to disseminate to people and they just laugh for years, that&#39;s got to have quite a bad effect on the mind.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like the fact that he is seen as the figure head of the &#39;truth movement&#39; at all. He isn&#39;t all encompassing neither does he represent individual views which are in wide variety. He&#39;s an easy target for attack pieces because of his style of being loud and brash and his sensationalism. He&#39;s also got a huge ego because he&#39;s been given the status of the leader of the truth movement and that only feeds his personality.</p>

<p>Lastly, all the accusations of him being CIA/disinfo etc are unfounded but its not out of the realms of possibility. I just think that there is a chilling effect when people propagate ideas like that and ultimately I think Jones genuinely does believe what he says but at the same time he saw the potential to make a business out of it and worked towards that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d heard of him and seen clips etc, so I thought I&#39;d give his podcast a try. It feels like the sole purpose of the show is to drum you into being paranoid and afraid so you&#39;ll buy some seeds, a water purifier, or canned food. Things that you&#39;ll only need when the world as we know it collapses, which is going to happen any day now, or so he says.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if he believes it, I really don&#39;t think he does, I think he is capitalizing on a market, and living quite nicely as a result. His Piers Morgan stunt was just that, a stunt, and probably gained him listeners and in his highly profitable mildly-paranoid to all-out-crazy demographics.</p>

<p>If you know anything about media production, you know that it&#39;s better to have a small but very targeted demo than a medium-sized broad demographic, because you can charge higher prices because you know who your listeners/readers/viewers are, and what they will buy, and you can ensure that demo stays the same with polarizing content, like, yelling and making wild statements about any conspiracy theory you can think of.</p>

<p>I am sure he makes his advertisers very happy by buttering his audience up with feelings of unrest, unease and general concern. If you enjoy his show, and think it&#39;s helped you, great, but if you ever consider buying from one of his advertisers, maybe you should take a break from his show and see how long you still feel the need for seeds or gold.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Expose him? I replied to a thread about debating him, and gave an opinion.</p>

<p>All you&#39;re doing is making excuses for him advertising, and I am saying, what he says and his general tone would be greatly different were he not trying to sell, sell, sell.</p>

<p>Saying that people shouldn&#39;t evaluate the source of their information and how it affects them, and their buying habits is ludicrous.</p>

<p>I think that he idea that people are attacking him (in general) is within an echosphere; and perhaps is exaggerated by and to the benefit of Jones, to create more fervent and devout followers? There is no greater way to keep people under some kind of influence than to say they and their beliefs are under attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I tried to follow what you were saying, but couldn&#39;t, I can&#39;t tell if you are pro or anti Alex Jones, so I am just left confused. I will try and answer some points I picked up.</p>

<p>Alex Jones == Kindergarten teacher? Seriously? Kindergarten teachers don&#39;t get their kids to sing songs about the One World Government and then tell them who they can buy gold coins from before nap time. No I don&#39;t think educators should work for free, but I also don&#39;t think they should be paid by Fisher Price and Mattel and get bonuses if they convince students from the Hasbro class to move to their class instead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have posited this as opinion without evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is what an opinion is, and I am certainly open minded enough to have that opinion swayed. But from anything I have ever seen or heard about Jones has only validated my feeling.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think he preaches fear and paranoia, for personal gain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So does everyone else</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Most people don&#39;t preach fear or paranoia, for any reason, and if they do, I question their motives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strictly concerning his advertising, it&#39;s definitely not as refined as mainstream.  Alot of it presented in a corny, salesy, fear of loss type way.  But, having gold (pure not numismatic) is a safe bet against any artificial fiat currency.  Especially considering the state of the dollar and euro and their handlers!  Seeds, how can you have any valid argument this is bad?  When buying seeds there are hybrid-GMO&#39;s, irradiated seeds, pesticides, herbicides, etc.  Kudo&#39;s to Alex for addressing this and helping people understand their environment.  His vitamins and mega super pollen burst plus shit is no different than 5 hour energy, vitamin water, green-tea pills and every other snake oil/healing elixir on the market today.  Then he sells his own videos, which I don&#39;t see extreme outrage about dreamworks or universal playing trailers on their own movies (at the theaters).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to have a serious debate on how and what children are taught, that&#39;s a whole different debate.</p>

<p>However if you think we should use as much judgement and scrutiny of Alex Jones, as a bunch of 5 year old children use on their kindergarten teacher, I guess you win?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone else thinks he preaches fear and paranoia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why bring it up? The point is that it&#39;s for personal gain, and not for some greater cause, not for the betterment of society, just the betterment of Mr.Jones. If his listeners or advertisers dried up tomorrow, and someone offered him a big wad of cash to talk about something else, I think he&#39;d do it, I think his principles go as far as his bank account balance. He preaches fear and paranoia, because it&#39;s what gets him paid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paragraphs, use them.</p>

<p>Your argument is like a puffer-fish, all big a shouty but it&#39;s just a bunch of air. Alex Jones seems more like Don Quixote than someone fighting something real.</p>

<p>If he really wants to change the world, he should stop shouting, and start helping people. Stop preparing people for the end times and start helping people live better today; and not by selling them some product.</p>

<p>P.S. trying to attack me is not going to get you anywhere, I am quite happy, satisfied and believe in what I do, kthx.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clyde Lewis&#39; rapport with guests and callers is most refreshing in today&#39;s talk radio landscape.  Clyde is not afraid to let a guest or caller, whose viewpoint he may disagree, make their argument/point without calling them names, talking over them or belittling them; he allows them to make their argument and then responds with either a counter-point, questions to spur further discussion or agreement.  He isn&#39;t afraid to admit if he is incorrect and he allows all viewpoints to be heard.  Programs like Ground Zero are very engaging and challenges the listener to examine topics by presenting all perspectives.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not believe that Alex Jones is a government agent, I don&#39;t believe he is a disinformation agent and I don&#39;t believe he is a shining beacon of truth in a world of smoke &amp; mirrors; Alex Jones has an incredible drive and motivation which is single-focused on: making money. </p>

<p>Let me explain: 
In the 1990s, throughout America, the militia movement arose from the FBI&#39;s 1992 shootout with Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, and the government&#39;s 1993 siege and eventual destruction of David Koresh and the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas. The militia movement followed paramilitary traditions and a conspiratorial, anti-government ideology that was designed to oppose a tyrannical government, a government which was at the core of a globalist campaign to form a New World Order; one world government.  While the movement&#39;s catalysts were Ruby Ridge and Waco, the passage of the Brady Act in 1993 and the Assault Weapons Ban in 1994 aided in growing and strengthening the militia movement.  The Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, the second anniversary of the Waco fire, drew nation-wide attention to the militia movement as Timothy McVeigh was erroneously associated with the Michigan Militia. This increased public scrutiny and law enforcement pressure, and brought in more recruits due to the heightened awareness of the movement.</p>

<p>Enter Texan Alex Jones who in 1996 seized the opportunity to begin his career and make a name for himself by starting a Public Access Television program and soon after a weekly local radio show &quot;The Final Edition&quot; in order to voice the issues of the rapidly growing militia movement.  Jones, even back then, was a master at understanding his target audience and market and how to use the program to capture an audience of those in the militia movement but also how to utilize crossover issues to appeal to an audience of certain Texas conservatives.  Jones became a voice for the voiceless and to further his effort to build the Alex Jones brand in 1998 he, he released his first film, &quot;America Destroyed By Design&quot; and organized a successful effort to build a new Branch Davidian church as a memorial to those who died during the 1993 fire.  </p>

<p>The early 00&#39;s saw Alex Jones&#39; most significant opportunity to both solidify his brand and utilize it to earn more  than he could imagine: With the demise of Bill Cooper and concurrent rise of the September 11th truth movement, Jones saw an opportunity to become the national voice for these groups while utilizing the same message points that proved him successful in the 1990s.  Lucky for Jones as he was working to take his program national, a gold company called Midas Resources was looking to expand their gold business through a creative niche marketing strategy: radio.  Midas joined forces with Jones to form the radio syndicate GCN; it was a win-win relationship because Midas enabled Jones show to be heard across the country and they would use Jones&#39; program to sell their products to his loyal, fast-growing audience in the form of broadcast advetorials.</p>

<p>As his visibility began to rise Jones began to focus on how he could utilize his airtime to present quirky topics to his audience in a manner that he could cause worry about various lifestyle issues (health, energy, food, etc) and shortly thereafter provide a solution to the audience in terms of products he endorsed and often sell in his online store.  The events of the early 2000&#39;s through the present day have greatly aided Jones in convincing his audience to spend their hard earned money with the companies (including his own) that he preaches about on the air.</p>

<p>Essentially, Alex Jones is the PT Barnum of our time and also the best door to door fearmongering salesman who knows how to squeeze as much money as he can from his listeners. I doubt his convictions are genuine; the only thing he has proven is that he knows how to brand himself quite successfully and use his relationship to start a buzz which, in turn, puts a lot of money in his pocket. </p>

<p>Good for him; smart businessman, very successful.</p>
