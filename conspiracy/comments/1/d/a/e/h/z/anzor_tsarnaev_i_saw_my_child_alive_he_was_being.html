       He and other members of the family believe a man shown on television being led naked into a police car the night of the shootout was Tamerlan, and that the blurry footage, still widely available on YouTube, proves Tamerlan was captured alive. Boston police say Tamerlan was killed in a shootout, and the man seen being led into the car was a bystander who was briefly detained.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anzor Tsarnaev said he raised the issue with U.S. officials who visited him earlier in the week in his home in Dagestan.

       "I asked them: 'I saw my child alive, he was being put into a police vehicle alive and healthy. How come media said he was killed?' They were shocked themselves," the father said.

       I would think he would know what his own son looks like, but the way the family members have been acting makes me wonder if they're trying to portray things a certain way, or if they're genuine. I like to believe people personally (call it gullibility or whatever), so I find it disturbing he's saying that :(

       We differ on that point, because I definitely wouldn't want to talk to media, nor give them my name.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure the media would love to have a juicy interview with him. But that requires his consent and cooperation, which obviously he did not give (and I wouldn't have either).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, investigative journalism could produce his name, assuming there were clearer pictures of him and if the media had full access to all of the police's data. But there isn't a reason for journalists to be going after his name since he was cleared by police as an innocent bystander. The only people who want his name are the people who are convinced he's either not innocent or that he was indeed Tamerlan. And Tamerlan is dead, so nobody has any reason to pursue it.

       I sure would do interviews.  It's important to the public to know the truth and that would be my source of dignity.  Who the heck cares these days if they are seen naked anyways?  I really wouldn't. plus naked guy looks good naked so it's not like he was some nasty fat bastard...I might be ashamed if that was the case but this naked guy had it going on.

       I understand what you are saying but you guys have the wrong idea. Getting stripped down of your clothes doesn't make you "lose your dignity," you are over exaggerating the situation way too much. If anything 90% of people would find it somewhat funny if that happened to them. It's not like if he was on the news and everyone found out he was forced to strip down that he would lose his "dignity." You make the situation out to seem like his bare dick was on camera or something.

       Funny, because there are plenty of new accounts on reddit that are quite vociferous in arguing that the naked man was not, in fact Tamerlan, but an "unnamed bystander".
      </p>
      <p>
       His family don't appear to agree, which suggests Tamerlan was murdered whilst in police/FBI custody.

       What? How does his family not agreeing suggest he was murdered in police custody? They're looking at the same grainy video that all of us are looking at.

       He only asked how the parents can confirm it's their son when they're looking at a video with bad quality, nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you're saying that just because he asked that question then he must believe the opposite and that he confirmed the suspects in the other low-quality videos when he never said such in his original statement.

       I saw the live feed that day, that guy did not even have chest chair when he was walking around naked, nor did he look at all like Tamerlan. It would be kind of sloppy of them to broadcast him walking around naked while millions of viewers were watching then say he died in a shootout an hour or so later.

       But who says all levels of media are complicit?  I'm pretty sure the footage of naked man was taken by the local Boston affiliate and not CNN's main network.   It was big news, and shown live,so the main networks couldn't avoid the story.

       People have a tendency to twist their own realities without meaning to, everyone thought it was him, the media was saying it looked like him etc....etc... I am very much not surprised the family was mistaken, everyone expected the police to arrest him and that guy did kind of look like him. CNN failed horribly that night, other stations were already broadcasting the suspects names AND the fact that one was dead well before the press release announced his death. It was mistaken identity, plain and simple.
