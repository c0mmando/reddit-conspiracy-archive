<p>He and other members of the family believe a man shown on television being led naked into a police car the night of the shootout was Tamerlan, and that the blurry footage, still widely available on YouTube, proves Tamerlan was captured alive. Boston police say Tamerlan was killed in a shootout, and the man seen being led into the car was a bystander who was briefly detained.</p>

<p>Anzor Tsarnaev said he raised the issue with U.S. officials who visited him earlier in the week in his home in Dagestan.</p>

<p>&quot;I asked them: &#39;I saw my child alive, he was being put into a police vehicle alive and healthy. How come media said he was killed?&#39; They were shocked themselves,&quot; the father said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We differ on that point, because I definitely wouldn&#39;t want to talk to media, nor give them my name.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the media would love to have a juicy interview with him. But that requires his consent and cooperation, which obviously he did not give (and I wouldn&#39;t have either).</p>

<p>Sure, investigative journalism could produce his name, assuming there were clearer pictures of him and if the media had full access to all of the police&#39;s data. But there isn&#39;t a reason for journalists to be going after his name since he was cleared by police as an innocent bystander. The only people who want his name are the people who are convinced he&#39;s either not innocent or that he was indeed Tamerlan. And Tamerlan is dead, so nobody has any reason to pursue it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have a tendency to twist their own realities without meaning to, everyone thought it was him, the media was saying it looked like him etc....etc... I am very much not surprised the family was mistaken, everyone expected the police to arrest him and that guy did kind of look like him. CNN failed horribly that night, other stations were already broadcasting the suspects names AND the fact that one was dead well before the press release announced his death. It was mistaken identity, plain and simple.</p>
