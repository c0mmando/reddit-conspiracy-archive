    <div class="md"><p>Problem is we don&#39;t even get to the question. Because they were barely religious, so what proves they were radical? what proves they hated America?  </p>

<p>A question based on several undetermined assumptions. Probability of finding a true answer becomes dramatically low.</p>

<p>Not saying they didn&#39;t drop their backpacks, I think they did. But for me that&#39;s the point where the whole book of unknowns open up. </p>

<p>What did they drop? What did they think they dropped? Who told them to drop it? What did they think would happen? Why they didn&#39;t jump on the first flight out of the country?</p>

That&#39;s like the first thing you would want to do if you wanted to survive.  Supposedly the younger brother went back to his college on Monday and worked out at the gym that evening...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was most likely guided by his older brother who thought neither of them would have been found out because of how chaotic things were, not to mention the large crowds during that day where they could just disappear in the &quot;sea&quot; of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The goal of terrorism is to instill fear into a populace. Fear can have a big impact on countries that don&#39;t necessarily correlate to something &quot;big&quot; like financial collapse or destruction of government property. All it takes is a scared populace to incite other 2nd and 3rd order of effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that is a very good answer! thank you! and wow i have to say our drone policy sure did set us up for that, possibly on purpose(speculation). but i never saw a motive presented by the media that said anything like that about there reasons. just that they are &#39;islamic radicals&#39;, so black and white.of course, i have not seen 100% of the media coverage of this, so obviously there is alittle if you know it. thanks again!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly because the international media has been reporting that 98% of the people killed by our drone attacks are civilians. If the bombing was really a reaction to america killing islamic civilians just because, american civilians does make sense</p>

<p>Though I agree there is something wrong with the whole thing, and the whole narrative just doesn&#39;t quite ring true with the FBI involvement</p>

<p>Also googling CIA NGO radicalization front only comes up with one hit and that&#39;s Alex Jones. </p>

<p>You really cannot trust Alex Jones either given the fact that he fear-mongers and says anything he can think of to sensationalize every current topic in order to make profit.</p>

<p>It still does not provide proof that these two weren&#39;t involved but then neither does it prove that they were either, I guess.</p>
