    <div class="card bg-dark mb-3">
     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       So I'm here to offer some truth on what's been going on here since the Boston bombings when more people arrived including dissenting voices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's begin with the obvious, there was a major event in Boston, it involved round the clock news coverage, terrorist, missing suspects and a slew of other details that make it an extremely juicy news story. The kind of the press salivates all over.
      </p>
      <p>
       As people on Reddit often do, people began scouring the subreddits for information. Someone created the /findbostonbombers and this subreddit was the main repository for information, especially extreme up to date information since the broadcast media doesn't work as fast as the net. That subreddit was home to wild speculation and theories on who the bombers were, motives etc. This is where many people also got to the /conspiracy site. (that's how I came here). One great thing about this sub, is members are constantly scanning the media and quickly put up new stories, so this was a logical spot to go about the Bostonbombings, and since at this time no one had been captured, wild speculation was allowed because there were so few reported facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then /findbostonbombers get shut down after the Sunil Tripath mistake, all these people who now feel invested in this case, can't go to /boston or /news because there is no speculation allowed there, just facts, so /conspiracy was the closest place for many of these people to go. That's how I came here, that's my story.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now there is a massive influx of new readers and posters to this sub, all came to this sub for the same reason, more into and conjecture about the Boston Bombings. This new group (present company included) are reading different posts and of course come with less skepticism than others more established on this site and some things just didn't sit right.
      </p>
      <p>
       To explain let me say that its just not realistic to think that all conspiracy theories are equal. If we were to rank all theories and vote on which ones seemed we deemed to be real and actual happened/happening we would find that there are some theories which simply do not hold as much water as others. I'm sure we can all think of some of those such as reptilian overlords, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we've determined that all conspiracies are not created equal, and that a massive influx of new people arrived hungry for Boston bombing information and ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for me, I like a good theory but I hate plot holes. So since all theories are going to involve some element of prose since there will always be things that are unknowable that the community at large has to fill in the details.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at my post history, I don't spend all my time debunking all theories, I think a good one should be difficult to debunk, but also have a modicum of reality. Let me add that I lived in Cambridge until recently, and have been to that marathon sports where the bomb went off multiple times, my brother in law worked there many years ago. (although my personal connection is unimportant).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, as I said all theories are not created equal, and to me the worst one to come from the bombing, the most deplorable one is of the crisis actors, and that no one was injured that it was all a smoke bomb and a flashmob of actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do I find this theory so unacceptable? First its offensive to the victims to claim that they are no in pain, that they are all paid actors. You can tell those who push the actor theory realize this because they focus on adults. There is very little mention of the few injured and one killed child because I feel many understand there is an innate aversion to the suffering of children. (sure many of the most hardcore would say that the perpetrators knew this and thats why they used children) For all the talk of Jeff Bauman and his legs there is little talk of the boy Martin's sister and her loss of limb (or the child amputee actress). The incessant search for a picture of his legs in shorts, I did a search online and I couldn't find any pictures of my legs on the internet (probably didn't help Jeff that he lived in the Boston area where people wear shorts for only about 1 month of the year)
      </p>
      <p>
       The other problem I have with this theory, is the enormous plot holes. As I said before, I hate shitty plot, if you're going to create fiction, it has to be realistic fiction. The premise is this team of trained crisis actors, who have done this before, or at least rehearsed this scenario since its of such importance. So this team which lets be honest is only going to be on camera for maybe 5 minutes tops. I've acted in plays, I've seen plenty of plays or Cirque de Soliel performances, I know about being "on" during your scene. Yet the proof of this theory is that the actors, were so bad at acting, their ability to portray human suffering was so poor, that people on the internet were able to see their performances. This team which again had signals and gestures to each other to plan, yet didn't think that some of these signals, like putting on sunglasses would seem out of place. So there is now the dichotomy of this crack team ready to react, yet they do it so poorly that they are seen right through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now not only that, but let's be honest these injured people will be fixtures at the Boston Marathon for years to come, These actors would have to come back and act out these parts all year, while having facebook accounts and all the other things to make them seem like a real person. Pretty amazingly huge plot hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       So where am I going with this? I know from my point of view this is hogwash and ridiculous so I try to debunk it because it is no more probable than if Aliens set off the bombs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is happening to this sub? Well a slight injection of outside thought has maybe caused the thinkers here to work a little harder and think a little more critically about their ideas and theories. Is this the end for this sub? I'm not sure, I wasn't here before, but if the new people are anything like I believe them to be, they will lose interest, we/they are almost 100% focused on boston and as that moves out of the regular news cycle you will see the this place return back to normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       But be forewarned, if you theory or idea has a major plot hole, I'm going to wreck it ralph.

       I get what you are saying and I appreciate it.  There are two problems that I have seen of late.  Of the over 100k+ users on this not everyone is going to believe every post.  New users seem to believe that a post about lizard people is representative of the sub as a whole.  Like you said, it's a place to discuss and speculate topics, absence of facts.  I don't personally believe that there is an international cabal of multidimensional beings in 3 piece suits, using shows like Honey Boo Boo to dumb down the population to the point of submission, but maybe some do.  Who am I to tell them they are wrong in a sub dedicated to alternative ideas.  I read it, get a chuckle and move on (like many here do). Second it's the massive amount of trolling and circle jerking that has happened lately.  If I see an OP with 100+ comments, I know that 75 of them will be people calling each other retards, shills, trolls, etc...  It's boring at this point.  I came here because of my interest in history (Kennedy, the FED, etc...). I will be happy when this all dies down, right now it's like hanging out in The mall near Hot Topic.

       well I guess its fine when we are talking about honey boo boo etc, its fine to read and chuckle, or think hey they have a point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its gotten to this level because there are people saying that person there sitting in the hospital with their legs blown off is a lie, and it just seems slightly more offensive vs debating something that isn't based on a real person's real suffering.

       I agree completely.  The mistake new people are making is thinking that all 100k+ users of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       believes that.  Which makes it okay to troll the sub to the point where the regulars say "fuck it, I'm out".

       I'm not so much focusing on how or what is deemed fact. What I am saying is places like /boston /news have a system of how that group and those people determine what the facts are and how they are reported and posts that deviate from that system are going to be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am by no means saying what is a fact or what is not fact. I am simply say the items these groups have determined in their own process to be fact, and any new things to be deemed fact must pass through that system/filter.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is by no means condone or condemning it. Just trying to give readers here an explanation as to why a large influx of new people arrived and where they came from.

       what i am saying. is those particular subs, like all subs have a rules to how and what you can post, and those rules are different from the rules here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of those different rules, people ended up coming here to try and find out more information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not passing judgement on other subs, or talking about truth in some universal way.
      </p>
      <p>
       just saying if it was a sub about NFL football and i'm talking about figure skating my comments are going to be moderated.

       the whole point was to explain the influx of new people here and why and where they came from, I'm not trying to create some idea on what truth is and how truth is accepted.

      <p>
       I'm not being deep. I'm saying if it was a subreddit about flowers and i'm talking about baseball, they will not want to hear about baseball.

       for those subreddits "truth" would be flowers and baseball would be a lie.,

       I don't think that was the proof offered, and besides, how do you expect us to collect such proof?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe instead it was seen as impossible for things to occur the way we're told (like Dzhokhar shooting himself in the throat with no gun?)  So whatever remains must be the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we find that it's impossible for the double amputee victim to have been placed in a wheelchair, and highly improbable sequence of events seen following the explosion, the next most likely hypothesis (and one that answers a lot of questions) must be flushed out.   If this offends you then you'll have to abide by it, as we do those that have unyielding faith in the official police narrative (which we are already seeing fall apart)
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory with the biggest plot holes is the one we've been told by our media.  And we know that they are capable of the big lie.  We've seen it again and again.

       I think they were actors.  I think many people have difficulty conceiving this because of what it implies.. it can destroy your whole world view, and that type of cognitive dissonance is not easy to overcome.   Someone can not be forced to believe it, they must be led to a place where they can discover for themselves..
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you, I also knew that the 'facts' didn't add up and wanted a place to discuss it.  Being attacked for your views is fine, but if you're going to be a dick about it, then I'm going to either ignore you, or debate you until you go home.   If you start baiting or brigading me, then I might come up with an entirely different approach.

       And look you're right this is the only place on reddit where this discussion can take place on some level.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree there are huge plot holes in the MSM story, but that does not inexorably lead to paid actors. Let me ask you this. If it is well known that a double amputee should not be put in a wheelchair, that the fact that they would put him in a wheelchair raises major red flags to you and others. Then why would this team of trained professionals, a team that most likely rehearsed this scenario put the double amputee in the wheelchair? Why make such a major error like that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes there are things that don't add up, if you're trying to tell me the government used the brothers as patsy's as straw men to where they were thinking they were helping capture someone else or part of a training mission, then the bombs they were given which they thought were dummies ended up being real, I'd tell you that there are far less plot holes in that story, and its much harder to discredit and makes much more sense, since the government would want to keep a small circle of the number of people who know what was really happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes I agree much of the police narrative is crap, but that doesn't lead perfectly 100% to a flash mob of amputee actors. (please tell me where there children amputees too for when the boy Martin's sister gets her time on the air?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah Dzhokhar shooting himself is most likely BS, i'm sure the cops shot him, but that fact alone, while it does lead one to question more of the story, does not conclusively point to the use of a team of live action amputee actors, makeup artist, set directors, pyrotechnicians, film crews etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       and please please please answer me this one question, why the government would do all of what you are saying they did, instead of just setting off a real bomb and having real injured. Is it because as some have said blown up people don't make the best photo ops? or because the real injured might not have the same soundbites you need? Or because the gov't doesn't want to get its hands dirty with American blood?

       I get your frustration with the paid actor theorists.  I believe the way the theory started was that events were real, but the media would use paid actors to create a better storyline after the fact.  I can actually see that as plausible since most news is just "reality television" now days.  I'm not sure how it morphed into -everyone is a paid actor- but to each his own and what not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also: the theory started popping up after the Batman shooting.  There were some interviews that seemed "off".  Think that is where this all started.

       yeah and the whole "off" thing should be a red flag that they are not infact actors, because trained actors wouldn't do things like give strange interviews. they would stick by a script that everyone could believe.

       I think we are thinking along 2 different lines.  I didn't say I believed the actor thing.  I said I could see a news channel doing something like that.  Not top secret, covert, false flags shit.  More like dishonest reporter douchbaggery.  Like standing in the parking lot of the movie theater after the shooting, picking out good looking people, coaching them a little on what to say, maybe never really caring if they were in the theater to begin with.  Again I was just trying to explain where the rumors started, I wasn't interested in debating with you on their existence.

       Dude, did you read my earlier reply?  I explained how and when the theory started, then grew out from there.  As far as conjecture, how can you say for a fact that they are not using actors.  Don't answer that though, because I don't give a fuck about actors.  I was merely trying to explain where the theory started so that you could have some context in the discussion.  You seemed like you were having a hard time wrapping your head around why people might think it.

       Without being able to interrogate them I can only speculate.   You'll see in the time lapse video that Cowboy hat guy and Amputee victim actually stop for a few frames (several seconds at least) for a photo op, which ends up being an Iconic, trauma inducing photo.   it's essential to the proposed psy-op's effectiveness.  That's what I think.   The shot in a stretcher wouldn't have nearly the same impact.. that's why black women gets a stretcher, and he has to wait a few minutes for his cameo.   The fact they used cowboy hat guy for it, and the almost shmaltzy scene they captured, for me lends more credence to this speculation.

      <p>
       I don't know.. I have several theories, but really I want to see evidence or proof that they did what they are said to.. so far the purported FBI video isn't out, and I don't expect a trial so they'll never have to provide dashcam footage or other 'solid' evidence to the public.

      <p>
       Again, without access to enhanced interrogation of the suspects.. I would speculate money, and a controlled situation.   Look at the expense to the government compensating real victims, lawsuits, inquiries, etc.. it's a big mess.  with actors you can pay off your own production team instead, and have a drill gone real training exercise in a controlled manner.  just more speculation.

       Ok So once again, you are saying that the acting by all was so poor, that they were so cliche using a guy in a cowboy hat, that those are the evidence that they are actors? This team didn't figure our camera guys will get the shots (because they would have had their own people filming some things) instead they have to stop to get the shot and thats the proof?
      </p>
      <p>
       To my theory of the brothers being setup with real bombs? why does that not accomplish the same thing your theory accomplishes but far cheaper? Why would the gov't compensate victims? they didn't do it. And once again lets be honest this was not a 9/11 major thing 3 dead people i mean 50 million dollars covers this. You're saying that because of a few million dollars the powers that be risk getting caught in the open?
      </p>
      <p>
       There will still be some inquiries, and now these actors must play these parts for longer. Plus think about this, the actors how central to the planning and the control of this are they? Are they at the top coming up with the plans and also acting or are they just pawns? Why would your pawns have so much control over you? I mean one of these actors with a well placed camera phone could bring down the whole government, and now these actors have to play these people for years, even if its just a couple of times a year, that is so much less control than having everyone who knew dead or in jail. PLus if there is any element of media control you can simply push the stories of survivors that already mesh with your narrative.

       It seems to me that the proof is the victims are not acting consistent with how someone in a trauma should act. I hope I am not mischaracterizing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are also saying all those people were actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only conclusion I can draw is the actors were not portraying victims of trauma correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
       That leads me to the question of why they were not able to do their jobs better?

       I think they did a decent job actually.   They only had a few seconds to create that scene under the cover of the smoke/noise bomb, and whatever they used to blow out those windows.  There's even a hypothesis that the whole thing was filmed elsewhere on blue screen composite.  Could be?  I wasn't there, and people not injured were quickly herded away from the scene (even though others did remain, and seem to me to be performing roles consistent with the staging)
      </p>
      <p>
       The other side of this coin is that most media is so tightly controlled (even Reddit) by various means that it doesn't matter if they make mistakes.  We saw plenty of mistakes in Sept. 11, and in other such staged terror events.. It doesn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the banks can get away with stealing trillions, holding the entire economy hostage and being too big to jail, then this isn't really much of a stretch for me to believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why didn't they do their jobs better?  They did a good job, good enough to fool most people.   You can't fool all the people all the time, fool me twice, won't get fooled again!

       I don't understand how you believe they did a decent job if you are claiming at the same time so many of them are acting inconsistent with victims, and all the inconsistencies are after all the hard stuff was done. the smoke, prosthetics etc. it would seem to me once you are just lying there, thats the easy part, yet that is where you are able to spot the fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       the comparison to the banks, lets be honest, that's a red herring. The banks did not do a magic trick in plain sight, they didn't trick us. all they did was spend billions over decades lobbying the government, having former CEO's and executives go into government to enact policies that allowed them to legally gamble at far higher levels that were prudent and when the music stopped the economy collapsed. Thats not the same thing as faking a terrorist attack with actors, costumes, sets, fake legs, fake blood, camera men, security to keep non performers away, a smoke bomb, someone to take out the windows etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The banks just rewrite the rules and take advantage of the fact that many banking rules were devised for an individual nation, but as banking has become global, the differences between countries, yet the opennness of the markets have allowed for certain banks to use these gaps to their advantage.

       I feel they did a decent job because almost everyone bought it.  even on Reddit you see the followup stories to cement the 'facts'
      </p>
      <p>
       The only people talking about the fraud are being well marginalized as you've probably noticed.  Still, it's a very compelling hypothesis to those that observe closely, while others will encounter significant cognitive dissonance with their worldview in order to accept that this may be true.

       using gaps to their advantage is a really mild way of putting it.  To me, it's as wrong as describing a rape as merely 'surprise sex.'

       I've worked on wall street and private equity. I can tell you its all about changing the rules or making the game too complicated. PE firms and I-banks would hire all the A students, the SEC get's all the C students. Using gaps to their advantage, so you're saying if i lobby to have a law created, that using that law is illegal? loopholes are all illegal? I'm confused, but lets not get away from the main topic here, the fact that you believe a crew of actors, make up artists, dancers, videographers, doctors, drivers, were used in a 2 second flash mob to fool america, yet you were not fooled because of why are you special?
      </p>
      <p>
       No surprise the bankers create things too complex for the regulators to figure out, so they just have to take the bankers word for it. Its funny that a real life conspiracy, of banks colluding on the LIBOR rate which means the rate all mortgages are set at and yet there are only 2 stories on here about it. Why because as a real scam its just not as sexy as crisis actors, false flags, police state and secret police.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah the banking story is huge, one of the biggest stories ever, and no one talks about it on here save for a couple posts, but we have people making blow by blow blog accounts of how a team of crack actors, make up artists and others came together for a flash mob to fool america.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here is the funniest part. In saying that they did a decent enough job to fool almost everyone but you. Do you see what that does. It makes YOU the hero of the story. Yeah the fooled everyone, but not me. It elevates you, gives you some importance. I'm tired of pussyfooting with you on this aspect of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're clearly saying that the actors in this were good, but not good enough for your experienced eye, and since you are in the minority even in this sub, your eye is better than your other friends here on /conspiracy. You say that the victims are not acting like a normal trauma victim should act, yet you offer no proof. Please there is so much gore on the internet, find me examples of how they should be acting. Why does you not offer examples of how one should act in a trauma?
      </p>

       Please once again address the children. The little girl who lost part of her leg, is she an actress? can you find a child amputee actress that looks like her?

       Maybe people should take from this that speculation is a waste of everyone's time and only facts matter. Or maybe you can continue your nonsense, doesn't matter to me.

       well it mattered enough for you to read and comment, therefor it matters more to you than 90% of the other people who come here since you took the time out of your day to not only read but comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So once we have determined through your actions that it does matter let's look at your statement.

       wrong. What I am saying is that speculation is fine, but some theories and ideas are incorrect, some after a little bit of critical thinking do not hold up on their own and must be constantly modified and changed to hold any plausibility of credibility or reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I came out saying that there was a plot by the combined forces of the KKK and the Black Panther party working together to put the Japanese back into interment camps, people would quickly find facts to debunk it and it would fall away. That is what is happening to the crisis actor idea for Boston.
      </p>
      <p>
       That does not mean all other speculation into the matter is dead, simply the idea that a team of professional actors, gays, hair, makeup, etc came together for a flash mob for freedom.

       Theories should be based on evidence. When you make a theory and then look for evidence, you're doing it wrong.

       And look you're right this is the only place on reddit where this discussion can take place on some level.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree there are huge plot holes in the MSM story, but that does not inexorably lead to paid actors. Let me ask you this. If it is well known that a double amputee should not be put in a wheelchair, that the fact that they would put him in a wheelchair raises major red flags to you and others. Then why would this team of trained professionals, a team that most likely rehearsed this scenario put the double amputee in the wheelchair? Why make such a major error like that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes there are things that don't add up, if you're trying to tell me the government used the brothers as patsy's as straw men to where they were thinking they were helping capture someone else or part of a training mission, then the bombs they were given which they thought were dummies ended up being real, I'd tell you that there are far less plot holes in that story, and its much harder to discredit and makes much more sense, since the government would want to keep a small circle of the number of people who know what was really happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes I agree much of the police narrative is crap, but that doesn't lead perfectly 100% to a flash mob of amputee actors. (please tell me where there children amputees too for when the boy Martin's sister gets her time on the air?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah Dzhokhar shooting himself is most likely BS, i'm sure the cops shot him, but that fact alone, while it does lead one to question more of the story, does not conclusively point to the use of a team of live action amputee actors, makeup artist, set directors, pyrotechnicians, film crews etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       and please please please answer me this one question, why the government would do all of what you are saying they did, instead of just setting off a real bomb and having real injured. Is it because as some have said blown up people don't make the best photo ops? or because the real injured might not have the same soundbites you need? Or because the gov't doesn't want to get its hands dirty with American blood?
