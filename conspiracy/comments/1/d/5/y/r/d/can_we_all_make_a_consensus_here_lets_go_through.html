       In the time since all this went down new information has come to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) we know that the crisis actor theory holds no validity
      </p>
      <p>
       2) there are pictures with the Tsarnaev brothers in a gun fight with police showing they are not innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) the big screen TV thing has been explained and dismissed.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) the naked man is not Tamerlan. Tamerlan is dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if we can all agree on these points it will help filter out about 75% of the nonsense regarding theories on the events. Some other theories (ie: the FBI involvement in radicalism theory still hold some credence at this point) should still be entertained and debated. If we want this sub to clean up everyone that sees one of the 4 posts i referenced should immediately downvote them. That's what the buttons are for. Hopefully by doing this people will get the message that theories already proven by evidence to be false will not be given attention here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I missed anything let me know and I will make edits. Also if what I've laid out here as a game plan is flawed please discuss it with me in the comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Edit 1: up vote for visibility if you support this sentiment. I'm no karma whore. There isn't match karma to farm here anyway. I just really want to see this place clean up a bit so we can stop the civil war in this sub and get back to civil debate.]

       Okay, I read it.  I agree.  It's not enough to capture the bombers, we have to find the source of the corruption and find out the extent of his involvement.  If he is the "mastermind" or is radicalizing these young men to commit acts of terror he and his ilk need to be stopped.  If he's an FBI agent or CIA operative, I want to know about it.  Let's see how far this wormhole goes.

       We don't actually know who is doing what in the gunfight photos. Yea, it appears that maybe Tamerlan has a gun, and maybe Dzhokhar doesn't, but if you're talking about that blogger's photos I don't think we can really say definitively. I think you're probably right, but I also think it can be argued it just isn't clear enough. Just my 2 cents...

       I can understand your sentiment. You can't necessarily see a gun in the photos. But you can see powder marks on the road from an explosive device that was tossed by them. Also I don't see a reason for that blogger to lie about the events he witnessed. He couldn't be a plant. There is no way that someone could have the foreknowledge to place someone in a house that just so happened to be right where the shoot out took place. The bloggers post should be taken with some credibility as he has evidence to back his claims.

       -I don't believe the younger brother ever had a weapon. Besides the explosives no weapon has ever been ties to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       -and I know the official story isn't always to be believed but the explanation for the explosion is that the pressure cooker broke open when they tossed it at police which is why there wasn't so much of an explosion as there was more of a flash fire produced from it. Which would fit with the burn pattern on the ground.

       Very funny.  If you explore my recent comments, you would find that the online conversation actually occurred.   Since you act as if you are interested in seeking the truth, why not chat with one of the witnesses of the shooting incident yourself, instead of acting like a bitchy walking e-meter and dismissing everything as if only you know the truth.

       I know what isn't the truth.. and every day we find out a little more what isn't the truth. Now we hear Dzhokhar wasn't armed, but police shot the fuck out of that boat...what next?

       Good to keep an open mind.  So you had a conversation with someone who says they saw it.  I'll look at your comments sure.   I don't find online chats reliable.   I'm not expecting to talk to any witnesses.  There should be dashcam video of some of these incidents.. so far I wouldn't dismiss an execution based on a 2nd hand account of a supposed online conversation with a supposed witness.

       A dashcam video might clear things up.  Between the other witnesses photos and this guy, it's pretty clear to me that the brother's weren't pacifists in this situation.  If they were setting off explosions here, it's likely they also were doing so at the Boston Marathon.  But given the official's track record of releasing bad information, who is to know for sure.

       yeah, I've seen and heard nothing that convinces me that they were shooting back.. but then I wasn't there.   Of course we know the police story is already changing..so they aren't so reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       All police should be wearing cameras, dashcams mandatory, and ones that they can't turn off or cover up.
      </p>

       the worst part about it all is that their story makes NO sense, and there are too many conflicting facts presented.

       Agreed.  Where is the video of Suspect #2 dropping his backpack at the Boston Marathon.  Where is the guy whose car was hijacked?  Not one friend of Suspect #2 thinks he did it.  The delay of reading the Miranda Rights and withholding information from the public makes me more suspicious of the government than the kid.  There were a thousand security officials at the race and they failed to stop the explosions - not good.  Were 9000 cops really necessary to catch two suspects?  Why arent the officials coming clean about the fuckup at the boat?  His brother sounds like a piece of work, though.

       Perhaps I'm wanting too much here, but these pictures leave a lot to be desired.
* At picture 1 you are already in the heat of the action, so you have no idea how it started.
* The blogger talks about how he goes up to his room with an IPhone5 and instead of taking video (which would show us the gunfire and the explosion) he takes photos.
* He mentions how they used the backpacks and back of the car for supplies, and from what I can tell makes STRONG assumptions on what those supplies are. e.g. "the car where they had additional supplies (assumingly, more ammunition and explosives)."
* He mentions the bomb and the smoke but fails to take VIDEO again, I'm sorry, I just can't understand the no video thing. And also stops taking pictures until the car is taking off...
* Not only does he inexplicably not document the bomb and the eldest brothers mad race towards cops, but he narrates us through it. As in, it wasn't because he was cowering behind a wall like I would at that point, he's watching... and just not documenting.
      </p>
      <p>
       These photos reveal nothing we didn't already know. They cannot truly identify the suspects because you can't see them in any kind of clarity. Since the video wasn't taken you can't see who was shooting, what the boys did to the explosive, whether the eldest brother was surrendering, or fighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I know is that this confirmed the brothers guilt without actually being clear and definitive evidence. And that every time I look through the blog post I'm overwhelmed with frustration that none of it was videotaped.

       What I find most revealing is that after the original photo was uploaded to twitter, new 'clearer' photos appear, and there was a highly energetic campaign to promote them as evidence.   Same with Tamerlan in custody.

       They were just holding up their hands making gun shapes with their hands yelling "pew pew pew".  They were drugged up by the illuminati to pretend to be in the gun fight.  The cops were shooting blanks to convince neighbors that there was a gun fight going on.  There are no 1080p close up videos of the gunfight, so obviously they're hiding something!  I personally think it might not have been the brothers!  Here's what I thought up last night, I think I figured it out.  They were government actors.  The cops were with the FBI wearing police uniforms.  They were all firing blanks trying to convince neighbors it was a real gunfight.  It's so obvious!  I want a picture 2 inches in front of their faces to know it was them!  Wait, that's not enough.  With today's hollywood makeup and special effects, that could be faked too!  I want their DNA!  Wait, even if they found DNA, it could have been planted by their Uncle who works for the government.  Maybe if someone could invent a time machine to let me go back and see it for myself.  Wait! Maybe the FBI would go back in time without me knowing and change the events to trick me into believing their story!  Maybe if they taped a confession?  Wait, that's not enough either!  If he confessed, then that means they are controlling his brain.  That's why they sent him to a military hospital!!!!  Oh man!  I DON'T KNOW!?

       I'm going to disagree with you on #2 in that it draws a legal conclusion.  The photos show the brothers in a gun fight with police.  We don't know why they are fighting or if they are guilty or innocent.  Does it look bad for them?  Sure it does - but I don't want to get into the habit of drawing conclusions based on a few photos)

       What about the statement from the guy they car jacked? In which they confess to carrying out the attacks. Is that to be disregarded? I don't see why this individual would lie.

       I don't think that should be disregarded at all.  His testimony is very powerful, but an admission of something is just an admission.  It indicates guilt, I just don't want to draw conclusions based on one or two pieces of information.  9 or 10 pieces and we can say "Because of A, we have C"
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, my personal belief is that these two are the bombers.  Until I see some pretty substantial evidence that they are not, or that they have been set up, or any other popular conspiracy theories, I'm going to maintain that belief.  That's why I come here - to see what alternative theories are out there and to ascertain their strength.

       A simple explanation of this is the following.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of saying
      </p>
      <p>
       "We are accused of the Boston bombing" one of the brothers panicked and said "We are the Boston bombers".
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the two brothers said while trying to run away from the police in a state of panic, should be treated very carefully. (I would be panicked if an army of officers were after me, and accused me of killing people, even if I didn't do it)
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, panicked people never make good decisions.

       In regards to #2, there are also a half-dozen videos of the shoot-out.  More importantly than the fact that this event was recorded on video by several people, is the fact that there exists

        audio
       </strong>
       of the event from a multitude of angles.

       Post a freakin link if you have clear pictures of that shootout.  Everything I've seen has been blurry as hell if you don't count the "enhanced" version that that guy put in his blog.  The originals on his twitter have certainly been tampered with.

       Did you listen to the guy's interview on several of the news stations?  If not, be sure and read the way he describes it -
       <a href="http://www.getonhand.com/blogs/news/7743337-boston-bombing-suspect-shootout-pictures">
        along with the pictures, which are (by the way) the ones he posted at his blog
       </a>
       .  So yeah, those are the ones I'm "counting", however, my point is there is a lot more than just these pictures.

       My biggest concern so far is that the younger brother was apparently unarmed when he was hiding in the boat, while the police/media narrative for days after included dramatic descriptions of cops exchanging gunfire with the younger brother, shooting from inside the boat.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other stories to be found VIA Google news search, including one by CNN.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This narrative continued long after the police would have known positively that there was no gun in the boat, which means they were lying. Or, if you prefer, omitting key information while actively pushing a compelling narrative probability. This narrative was fed to the mass media which eagerly adopted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Here's the Watertown Police chief spinning it:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFLunTe3aBQ&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=14m38s">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFLunTe3aBQ&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=14m38s
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, after its revealed with a high degree of confidence that this narrative was false, you'd expect to see some focus on this in the media. Catching officials with their pants down is the bread and butter of in-the-trenches journalists all across America (source: I was one for ten years.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, other than some print stories, the CNN and MSNBC cable news machines have steadfastly ignored this (dunno about Fox, as I don't pay much attention to them.) This is information about a key part of the overall story. It's something that would warrant immediate examination and considerable editorial backtracking and clarification. Which, oddly, is not happening. The majors have decided to ignore this in favor of spinning  more compelling narrative probabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which makes them complicit in a lie handed to them by officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which raises serious concerns about the credibility of other information being reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       The logical questions raised by this is obvious: if the cops and the media lied about this... ?

       Exactly. There has been a lot of discussion here about why the subreddit has been overrun with 'shills' recently. Well it's mainly because the stupider the conspiracy the more dissenters there are. That's not real hard to figure out.

       The death photo of Tamerlan matches up with pictures of him. Down to the chest hair and hair line. And the witness testimony from the hijacking puts Tamerlan at the scene where he was shot down and subsequently ran over.
      </p>
      <p>
       We may never know the identity of the naked man. Charges were most likely never filed against him so he was released. Since there were no charges his name doesn't have to be released publicly. I just think its a bad idea to put focus on him because if and when he does step forward to disprove this specific theory it will only give more cannon fodder to attack all conspiracy theories pertaining to the situation.

       The victim of the carjacking's statement indicates that the brothers were both in the same car with him as they were 'joking about girls/iphones/cars/asking for CDs (wtf right?)'. How was the Honda Civic  there (the scene of the shootout) at the same time as the highjacked SUV? Who drove it there?

       I'm not saying it is/isn't him, but with the things people are able to create via makeup, models, etc. in movies, is it not possible that they created a mannequin and/or model of someone who looks identical to Tamerlan?

       The CVT team there is definitely worth noting. However in the video that came out after the bombings you can clearly see the guy with the backpack in question runs past after the first explosion still wearing the backpack.  I do believe that they were hired as security. By who I don't know. And the fact they were there means someone knew of a credible threat. But all of this fits into the theory of FBI radicalization of Tamerlan and his brother.

       The guys in black and khaki aren't Craft International (and ID based on a single baseball cap) - they are members of the National Guard Civil Support Team - apparently they were carrying gear to detect possibly hazardous (including radioactive) material as they do reguarly at high profile public events.

       From what I've read Craft doesn't do security, but does hostage rescue. Not saying they couldn't have been hired for security though. Also perhaps they could have been used as a distraction tactic. If this is a flash flag then perhaps Craft was sent there to keep us following up loose dead ends.

       I guess. If you google craft not many pictures come up showing people wearing that type of uniform, the only thing people went on was the punisher hat. However the same results with searching NGCS. Not many pictures to denote that that is there uniform either, so idk who they are.

       What about the 3rd explosion? Didn't the police say on live TV that they had exploded a third bomb?  Why have we not seen footage of that bomb being planted? Doesn't their admission of a 3rd device throw a wrench into the whole, "two bombers working alone" theory?

       If you are talking about the fire at UMass Boston, it was determined to be unrelated, and a mechanical issue.  In the rush to report, people jumped to the conclusion that everything was a bomb.

       No, I as referring to the reports that there was a third explosion.  When the police gave their first statement on TV (I watched it live) a reporter asked about the third bomb and the police confirmed it was a controlled demolition of a bomb by the bomb squad.

       2.) we can't tell if the younger brother had a gun though. You can definitely tell the older brother was shooting.

       edit: the tv screen was a display screen at the race. It was in photos ont he day or two days before the race, but then was moved to a different area. There was a conspiracy out of that, really I don't understand why. But it was found out that this screen was actually built on a truck so it could be easily moved, and was just in a different location on the day of the race.

       The screen is in photos of the race winners.  So it was there the day of the race.  Apparently moved in the 2 hours between the winners completing the race and the bombing.

         There never was a good theory about the TV that I saw, this is the only mention of it since the one single time I saw it.  Makes sense that it would be taken down in between the 2 hours of the first finishers of the race(the most televised and publicized part of race) and the bombings that occurred 2 hours later.

       Sorry, the only one of those 4 points I can agree with is #3. If pics exist of the gunfight let's see them.  The photos I've seen purporting to be that are so poor quality they could be daffy duck shooting at a clown car just as easily.

       You mean the guy who owns a tech company but didn't have the foresight to snap a single 30 second video with audio? The same guy who waited almost a week to release the photos but them took them down hours later? The guy who thought to post/send them to a blog with less than two pages worth of posts rather than to authorities?

       All I know is that the originals have such a low quality that I can't make any definite decision as to what was going on.

       Having high-quality enhanced pics posted on his blog just a few hours later is really shifty.  Especially when I can't come close to replicating those enhancements.

       Kind of my point.  You can't possibly identify anyone in that picture or even say for certain that it isn't a picture of a few inflatable dolls.  The quality is just unbelievably crappy.  Who the hell even sets their cell phone to be that low?

       After they leave, at 3:10, cowboy and the﻿ wheelchair crew come out of the crowd near the center of the screen, heading to the bottom of the screen. They are not trailing blood. They stop to adjust the fake leg, getting ready for their photo op. This is over three minutes in, at double speed. So, over 6 minutes after the explosion, after the ambulances leave, this guy with his legs supposedly blown off gets rolled out in a wheelchair.

       He looks like he's sitting up and talking. If ur legs are blown off maybe you are in shock but I would imagine you a passing out from that type of blast and the loss of blood. Wild that's gurney rolls right passed him.

       names of victims.. I can also write 53 names down.   Better yet, give me a pentagon budget and I'll invent a self consistent 400 person town.. Not a problem.   Everyone will vouch for everyone else.

       I don't see any inconsistency with the staged scenario hypothesis in this.

       The mother is a librarian at Neighborhood House Charter School. Why don't you drive down there and tell her that she is a fraud? Tell her that she didn't lose her 8 year old child. Tell the teachers and children at the school that they are frauds for having a memorial for a boy they never knew. How about you start by telling off the father to his face?

       I didn't say she wasn't also a librarian at the school.   And maybe she did have a kid that is now dead.   That doesn't mean that he was killed at the marathon.  I can think of a few plausible explanations that I'm sure you will find even more shocking and insulting, so I'll spare you them.

       I'm saying the scene was clearly staged.   What Denise Richard's role was, I cannot say.   Besides the symbolism, what else is wrong with this photo (hint.. look at the tie above and below the string)

       Why would that photo even be photoshopped in the way you're suggesting? What sense does that make - they just happened to have a photo of the kid holding his hands out like that but thought it was a good idea to put in a banner with his name on it?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing wrong with the photo - it is slightly overexposed (a white suit will do that) but the line of the tie continues consistently from the knot, past the string. There is also a shadow near the knot that initially appears to be the edge of the tie, but it's fairly easy to see that it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're proposing that this kid, who went to school and did other kid things, known by dozens or even hundreds of other kids and adults, is dead now, but may not have been as a result of the bomb. So he just happened to die around the same time (so no one noticed he was gone before the bombing) which then conveniently allowed his bereaved family to take part in some gigantic secret plot?
      </p>
      <p>
       That same plot also involved a number of other crisis actors including a double amputee to portray Jeff Bauman who, before the bombings, had two legs but now doesn't? And not only all those anonymous crisis actors but also a prominent and very well known anti-war activist?

       I don't know why the news would go to the funereal? For what purpose, he died and it's sad to say but after that happens the media doesn't really care about you. He wasn't a high profile citizen, just a regular kid and his parents regular people. Why would the press go to the funeral? Or interview them at their house, when they're so busy on the brothers? If you really think he's a live, why don't you try to contact the family, check the local papers for the wake info, etc, etc.

       Also the drills don't seem that out of place to me. The best place to practice a drill of that sort, would be at the marathon. And it is done once a year, so why would you not try to plan it during the time that is going on?

       I don't know that they did.  One possibility mentioned is that parts of it were done with bluescreen composite in a studio.  Bystanders were cleared out of the actual areas REAL fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you about the timing for the drill.  It doesn't preclude a drill gone real-life..  Wouldn't be the first time.

       All the videos?  I've seen two.  I saw some still photos, but if they were from a video, we haven't seen it anywhere.  The FBI says they have a video but not released it.

       Please link what you've seen.  I can only find three videos and they aren't really much good for deciding this issue.

       I agree, more evidence would be nice.  I would like to interrogate the grey hoody guy and ask what he was photographed doing to the double amputee before he put his sunglasses on and reclined like a victim.  Also how he managed to stay so blood free when he's right under a guy who's legs just got supposedly blown off.. .it's very inconsistent and suspicious behavior.  I won't hold my breath.

       Massive bomb?  Are you really qualified to make a statement like that?

       From my experience with explosions, that was a hollywood pyro effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please point out scorch marks or shrapnel damage.  If the explosion was massive enough to blow people's legs off as you claim, then why doesn't it do damage to the sidewalk.

       Jesus, do you understand what I mean when I say I was wrong for saying massive. You keep trying to stick to that even after I have said I didn't mean massive.

       No crisis actor in the history of the, apparently many, staged false flag attacks has ever come forward either to the media or even just on a blog somewhere to say "I was part of this"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not just no crisis actor but none of the involved people. Not one. Not a single cop from Sandy Hook or Aurora, or a single doctor, nurse or orderly from Boston. None. No one has every come forward to say they were on the inside of one of these conspiracies. Right?

       his mother, his sister.. where are they?  not easy to see if they are actors or not.   there's no reason they couldn't be invented identities.
      </p>
      <p>
       the woman in the video on the street.  you assume she lives there?  the photos?  don't show anything, some people hugging and a girl looking sad out front of a house.   what was their address?
      </p>
      <p>
       names of victims.. I can also write 53 names down.   Better yet, give me a pentagon budget and I'll invent a self consistent 400 person town.. Not a problem.   Everyone will vouch for everyone else.
      </p>

       I don't see any inconsistency with the staged scenario hypothesis in this.

       He looks like he's sitting up and talking. If ur legs are blown off maybe you are in shock but I would imagine you a passing out from that type of blast and the loss of blood. Wild that's gurney rolls right passed him.
