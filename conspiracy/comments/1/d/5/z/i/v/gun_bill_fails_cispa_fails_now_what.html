       Okay

       , explain this.  The Sandy Hook shooting is theorized to be a false flag to provide cover for gun control legislation.  The Boston bombing is theorized to be a false flag to cover the passage of CISPA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both bills failed.  How can this possibly be?  The Conspirators can pull off these massive, incredibly complex hoaxes involving hundreds of people, put on a massive show under intense media scrutiny, and get away with it all...but when it comes time to close the deal, they can't do it.  The bills fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone want to admit they were wrong?  Or are those of you who promoted these theories just going to erase history and find new "reasons" why these "false flags" happened?

       What is the agenda exactly?  Polling indicates that Americans are getting fed up with anti-terrorism efforts that don't seem to work, and that people are less willing to surrender freedoms now than they were ten years ago.

       That's a great thing isn't it? No body can prove anything on the false flag theories, but they can prove the directions the media tried to push them in. While I personally believe that most events that have happened weren't controlled to the point that most of the theorists on here do, I am 100% sure that there are plenty of groups who use incidents like these to push and drive their own agendas. If there's plenty of people on the alert noticing how skewed and off the news networks stories are, then it helps to keep the agenda pushing in check.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean let's face it, unless you are involved in something directly, there's no way you're going to know what really happened. Ever, that's just unfortunately how it is. However, it becomes incredibly important for a large majority of people to question things and push out alternatives when something is being pushed out as truth when those pushing the truth don't even know, that includes people pushing theories as fact and the news channels pushing things as fact. All news and relations can be is hearsay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the rise in those disbelieving the mainstream stories is directly correlated to the mental position of the country. There's a lot to learn from these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the point of what I'm trying to say is that there's no need to apologize and that the agendas are simple, just watch the main network news channels and you'll hear them eventually. It's not a secret that there's only five main news networks covering an entire country. Yes there's local news, but they remain local. The ones you hear about daily(CNN, ABC, CW, Fox(arguable I know but people watch it as if it is), and CBS) are the origination of where big news stories that eventually have an effect on public opinion and can sway people into agreeing with certain legislation. Gun control, cyber-security, war on terror, war on drugs(now defeated, yesss), immigration restriction, etc are all talked about to death all day on these channels focusing on events that are tragedies yes, but not truly national tragedies. There are about 314 million people in the US. Does an incident where 28 died sound like a national tragedy numbers wise? Does 3 died sound like a national tragedy? More than that die a day from things that are completely allowed and considered normal. Yet the news pushes and pushes saying this has to be stopped and what can we do about it. The truth is, nothing can be done about it. They know that, we know that. Once something is done, it can't be undone. And pushing legislation to limit the freedom of all to save a theoritical few that may or may not happen again with or without legislation is making decisions on a national level in an emotional state.
      </p>
      <p>
       So on to the point of do the theorist have to admit they were wrong. No they don't. News channels don't make an effort to admit when they were wrong, the government doesn't either(remember a little situation where we didn't find a single WMD after going to war over that fact?), so why should people who were theorizing and not stating things as fact have to apologize? They don't. It would be a nice sentiment, but they're not saying they know the truth. They're simply trying to piece together puzzles. To come on to the sub and ask when they are going to apologize is kind of selfish. They don't owe you an apology, it was a theory.

       I honestly don't think the vast majority of people on this subreddit are trying to figure out a puzzle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this forum exists so that stupid and intellectually lazy people can circle-jerk each other about how much smarter they are than the sheeple by lobotimizing themselves and accepting the most irrational, thoughtless, emotional-driven ridiculous bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like a cult.  Alex Jones tells you morons that the "really smart people' know that the moon is made of green cheese, and that anyone who says the moon isn't green cheese is a dupe, a stooge, a fool, a moron, or even worse, an evil and malignant cancer on society.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since most of you dumb fucks are complete morons, you lap it up.  Being intelligent is hard, so you just cheat and declare anyone who uses reason, evidence and common sense as the basis for their worldview of being a tool, and prove your own intelligence by mindlessly accepting a completely paranoid and irrational worldview.

       Alex Jones isn't the leader of any of this. Do some more lurking before you declare he has some kind of standing here. He exists, yes. He says shit, yes, but that doesn't make him the voice of reason or in anyway the source of information for this subreddit. As for the circle jerk thing, I don't know where you see that, but I haven't seen it that much and have never been involved in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the refuting evidence issue, most of the time there is no actual evidence presented from the main stories. Just being told of evidence. Yes, on the newer cases they hold the evidence until after a trial, but that at the same point means that anyone siding with or against the evidence during the time before its release is all relying on hearsay, no intelligence needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's reddit, so the amount of people that believe whole-heartedly in any theory is unaccounted for as it's impossible to actually count. So we actually don't know who does and doesn't accept anything, but what I see on here is that there are some people who are laying out ideas and some who help look into things to flesh out the whys and hows to make a full theory. Key word being theory. Nothing emotional about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're argument is emotional however. It's fine that you disagree, cool. It's disrespectful to come on here and masturbate your ego. I gave you logical reasoning, you gave me insults. Match set.

       <em>
        because you don't trust the government

       Just as much as it's posted as 'evidence' it's also posted as, what do you think. Not only that. but the photos are the same thing the government supplies as evidence. If photos can be evidence for one side, they can be for the other. No double standards. And photoshopping is so easy these days it's always raised as a possibility and some people do immediately believe that. I don't disagree there, but you're pulling straws if you label the whole community based off that.

       You'd be right if that's what you were doing, but you weren't. You were name-calling. And it's not all irrationality, nor is it actually irrational to believe the government lies, it has a big record of doing just that.

       Well, that's not why people believe there is a 'massive' conspiracy. The massive conspiracies are a different subject because believe it or not, they're not all directly related. Some people may believe they are, but my personal belief is simply that like minded people will find each other and that applies to those with massive amounts of greed, much like the banking systems and fixed rates, LIBOR anybody?
      </p>
      <p>
       I get what you're trying to say though. There is emotional response in there sometimes, especially when things like Boston happen, because that's the latest area of accusation. People are looking into without having been there, meaning, they simply don't know what happened, including reporters not just redditors or channers, or any internet body or cliche group that made accusations besides the victims and the bombers. That kind of thing is going to happen though, especially when there's a massive amount of inconsistencies in the 
story because some people are driven mad by the lack of logic or the lack of information, I feel for them, but it happens. The logical response is to let them run their investigation and present counterpoints and reasoning. Not name-calling and half-wit bullshit arguments. That's childish.
      </p>
      <p>
       And people don't trust the government with a damn good reason. They lie, and they get caught lying all the time. I mean hell, the congress is actively involved in insider trading deals on the market. They make millions off law changes by playing the game that others aren't allowed to play. It's a big money draw game. So how can you blame people for not trusting the government?

       this is such bullshit! there's no finish line that has been crossed. the forces behind gun and internet regulation are not just going to quit and go home now. what kind of pedestrian bullshit is that?

       also, there's absolutely no proof that the two events you mentioned were used to promote regulatory efforts by our fascist state apparatus. you guys find the most ridiculous statements made and promoted by the least able of researchers, and then use that to try to diminish everyone else, or as proof that your own narrative is correct.

       I'll be honest with you, I've been interested in conspiracy theory for many years, and I've been following this sub for about a year...and all my participation in this sub has done to date is make me wonder if the conventional wisdom on conspiracy theorists is correct.

       I think the "conspiracy community" has become hopelessly tainted by merchants of fear like Alex Jones and Glenn Beck, who just peddle paranoid nonsense for $20 a month to suckers and idiots who can't cope with living in a complex world and need everything to be simplified into a black and white theory, regardless of whether it makes sense or not.

       If a False Flag is going to be good, it usually tries to kill many birds with one stone. Not all those birds will be hit, a few birds however were hit(like desensitizing people to martial law, trying to ban gun powder, whatever else future liberties maybe be taken away). Just the fact that CISPA was trying to get passed during the week of the bombings fits a pattern of suspicion and conspiracy. It didn't pass, but there was still obviously an attempt made for it to be passed while there was a huge distraction.

       I would hope that all issues on here have both possibilities considered. That way the one that weighs more heavy will be revealed and we can effectively dub that the truth. Suspicion and Paranoia aren't bad things to feel, they exist in us and they can be useful but they have to be balanced out just like balancing out the possibilities of this being a false flag and not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love for there to be no pattern...but there is clearly a pattern. There are many trends that the attempt of the passing of this bill fits. Things like NAFTA,NDAA and the Mansanto protection act ( I am sure there is more). These either passed when no one was paying attention or in a place that no looked.
This isn't a new strategy its an old trick, like a magic trick. Watch one hand do this, while the other hand does this. Apparently there is going to be more paranoid and suspicious conspiracy theorists around because if you just would look at the the recent pattern/trends on google for the term "False Flag" you would see that more and more people don't buy this shit they are getting fed to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust that CISPA didn't pass now but they will keep trying. I wish there was no trend my friend, but one great trend is the trend of online activism and the people in r/conspiracy who want to push the truth forward. That trend is also on the rise :)

       My good friend that lives in Boston said they were not forcing people to stay in homes. I have also heard other reports that they were not arresting people for leaving homes. I would think you would hear someone being arrested for trying to go outside if martial law was the case.

       You are incorrect, sir.  The "lockdown" (misleading media term!) was 100% voluntary and did not have any force of law behind it.  People were
       <strong>
        advised
       </strong>
       not to leave their home, but like all
       <strong>
        advice
       </strong>
       it was up to the individual citizens to decide whether they left their homes or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost everything I've read and heard indicates that most people stayed home to watch the ongoing media coverage of the manhunt (often gathering in groups in a neighbor's home), or used the "lockdown" as an excuse to stay home from work.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to claim that people were
       <em>
        not allowed
       </em>
       to leave their homes is either a) ignorance or b) a deliberate lie.

       So you think there could be elements in the government powerful enough to maintain secrecy around a manufactured terrorist attack against Americans, but not powerful enough to determine the outcome of a vote?

       My premise is that the only way elements in the government could hope to get away with staging false flag attacks is if the Congress was in on it.  If the Conspiracy doesn't control the legislative agenda, then we're basically talking about a group that is willing to engage in crimes that would get every single participant executed as traitors as some sort of

       You're not addressing the point at all, and are only undermining the credibility of the conspiracy argument.  The conspiracy goes all the way down to the level of the Boston PD, but doesn't involve members of Congress?  So what happens if Congress decides to investigate the bombings?
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, this is huge risk to take for a plan that has no reasonable hope of succeeding unless Congress is in on it.

       Do you realize that this is the second or third time CISPA and similar legislation has been stricken down due to public outcry? Do you think they are just going to stop after this? The people in power trying to push these agendas do not give up and neither should we.

       I think all of this conspiracy bullshit is just pablum sold to suckers by fear pimps like Jones and Beck to scam idiots out of their money.  I don't think CISPA has anything to do with this, and I don't think conspiracy cranks have any influence on society at all.

       Im about 50/50 on whether or not these incidents were false flags. The best explanation I can come up with (other than the fact these incidents were not false flags at all lol) is that the House and Senate have no idea that these incidents were intended to shift attention away from the bills. The 'false flags' were probably instigated by higher-ups to
       <em>
        help
       </em>
       divert attention, but those who were against the bills had no intention of passing them in the first place so the diversion didn't work.

       Those false flags are attempts to sway or rather hot prod sheep into falling for the fear factor. We are much wiser and informed, and several groups  in those camps are hard headed as well. This is a war, and not all battles are won. You were under the misguided notion that theatrics are a prelude to the PASSING of the targeted bills. They'll try again, the nature of power-hungry psychopaths is to seek more power. Take heart.

       Or maybe "they" don't exist, and there is no agenda, and it was entirely a coincidence that CISPA came up in the same week as the bombing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, if people were claiming the cyber-attacks launched by China against the New York times were a false flag operation intended to increase support for CISPA, that would be
       <em>
        plausible
       </em>
       .  There would be an actual connection there.  But the theories being promoted in this subreddit don't even come close to being as plausible as that, and look the world to be nothing but grasping at straws to draw connections.
