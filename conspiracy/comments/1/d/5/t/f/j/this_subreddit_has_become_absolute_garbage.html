       This whole paid shill nonsense was getting out of hand about 2 months ago and I stopped visiting this subreddit as frequently then because any comment I made not joining the circle jerk between OP and other supporters of his claim was replied to by calling me a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought half the point of this subreddit is intelligent discussion of the topics at hand. Apparently not.
      </p>
      <p>
       You people are becoming the epitome of what you hate.  Just like the people that swear by the official story you people swear by any fact that provides evidence against the official story no matter how absurd or ridiculous the claim is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing you are doing is exhibiting characteristics of  something you hate the most he power hungry government and government officials.  Just as they refute and deny claims of anything contrary to official you do the same with anything opposing your viewpoints.  Going as far to suggest banning accounts that are new or relatively new.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so with this being said I am unsubscribing to this subreddit.  The ridiculous claims and paranoia have just gotten out of hand.

       While I agree that the norm of the subscribers here is boisterous at best especially with their one minded gangland thinking that is comparable to the official story and nothing changes. I do find that there is the rare gem in the bunch that you can hold a conversation with. Surprisingly enough out of the few months that i have subscribed to this sub I have only a handful of people whom I would call upon to have an intelligent debate. There are many whom I ignore and tend to sway from. IE the people who constantly berate any or all objective opinions. The subjectiveness of many of the users here is outlandish at times, but the circle jerk you make claims about is unfortunately true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only visit this sub maybe once a week and today has been the first time in a while that I have participated in any discussion because most of it is mundane and ridiculous. I must say I am sad to see you leave even though I never knew or spoke with you before. I feel you may have had some very interesting things to contribute.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the bannings in regards to new users I think that is kind of far fetched and people are just scared of any changes they don't agree with. And they are in fact circle jerking each other because no one wants to upset the applecart as my father use to say. but the cold hard fact is people want to share their opinions and have their voices heard among the 7 billion of us on the planet. and once we start enforcing censorship on ideologies and people we become no better than the people who we are trying to expose.

       I am definitely unsubscribing and definitely not looking for someone to convince me to stay at all .. I just want to point out the things I listed to people in hopes there may be a change so I can return here in the future and these things will be gone.  Or maybe so  I can see how many people there are that have also notices these things that could provide some further insight into what happened here

       I'm so amused at the irony of shill claims I'm not sure I could stop coming even if I wanted to. Shills make personal attacks and deflect conversation, right. I doubt 911 was an inside job. This is what I have been called for saying that: a waste of time, stupid, blind, a moron, and incapable of research. And, of course downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I simply asked for evidence and try to find out why everyone's convinced. I'm met with that, and those are the good guys fighting against government shills? See the amusing irony?

       I'm pretty open to the fact that 75-90% of the claims are absolute bullshit but that doesn't mean we shouldn't scrutinize every claim made by a government that lacks so much transparency it's like a corporation.

       Scrutiny is fine, but only when you don't try to defend a preconceived notion. Much of the conspiracy movement is a good example of this, they make their conclusion (official story
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be wrong, etc) and then look for evidence that supports it. E.g. 9/11 "truthers." Apply actual, unbiased analysis, look at the facts and draw a conclusion, not the other way around.

       Couldn't agree with you more and that's what most of this subreddit does.. Give them some bullshit irrelevant evidence to support possible conspiracy they fucking swear by it like it's the bible.  Give them hard evidence that cannot be refuted they dismiss it as propaganda, photoshopped, or made up.

       Of course I have entertained them. I went from believing the Pentagon was hit by a missile due to negative evidence to believing it was probably a plane. I went from believing it was the CIA to believing it was a joint operation.

       As to building 7, well, billions of tonnes of debris from the collapse of one of the largest buildings on the planet fell onto it, taking out an ENTIRE﻿ CORNER of building 7. Further, tonnes of office supplies, wood, floors, etc, etc burned in the building over a period of EIGHT HOURS, severely weakening the structural steel. The collapse started in one small area of the building on one floor, taking out the floor below it and a chain reaction took out the entire building. Afterwards, the walls fell inwards.

       I dont get why people get so butthurt at shit like this .. I don't care, the way reddit is designed this shit will get downvoted and most people won't see it .. Who cares if the account is 10 years old or 5 hours old just use reddit the way it's designed and this kind of stuff gets limited

       Couldn't agree with you more and that's what most of this subreddit does.. Give them some bullshit irrelevant evidence to support possible conspiracy they fucking swear by it like it's the bible.  Give them hard evidence that cannot be refuted they dismiss it as propaganda, photoshopped, or made up.

       Apply actual unbiased analysis to tower 7? Or do you mean throwing out Occam's Razor wildly and dismissing any legitimate conspiracies.
