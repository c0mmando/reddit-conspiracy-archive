      <p>
       I am a military veteran and served one 4 year enlistment between 1998 and 2002.  During this time, I participated in several military exercises (to train and prepare for wartime scenarios) with one happening nearly every year.  This training included bomb-raid drills, chemical decontamination, security patrols, and even repairing simulated holes in concrete as if we were repairing the runway which had been bombed.
      </p>
      <p>
       While this was fun (in a weird twisted way) it was by no means the only drills the military participates in.  While I was active duty, I was assigned to a team that traveled through 3 different states and participated in local disaster preparedness drills.  During these drills, I, as an actor, would be dressed up in moulage and placed in a scenario for the local police, fire departments, and ambulances to respond to.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Scenario 1
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The first scenario I remember was the simulated carjacking and hostage situation on a greyhound-type bus which was parked in the fairgrounds of the town we were in.  There were at least two actors who were playing the bad guys and were going up and down the isle yelling/cussing at the passengers and pushing them around.  The police responded and eventually the bad guys "gave up".  There were no shots fired, nobody actually injured, or anything.  The paramedics arrived to "treat" the people on the bus.  I remember being loaded onto a stretcher and wheeled into one of the fairground buildings as a "triage" staging location.  After everyone on the bus was removed and "treated" the scenario ended.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Scenario 2
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The stage for the next scenario was some sort of courthouse or city town center building.  All I remember about the building was that it was small, old, and had wooden floors throughout.  There was a staircase (which I was placed in) so it must've had multiple floors.  The stairs were wood too.  Anyhow, the scenario for this emergency preparedness drill was that there was a gunman who had entered this government building and shot up the place.  I was dressed in moulage and was supposed to be dead from a gunshot wound.  Really, they just put some red makeup on my shirt and made a hole in it but they didn't use any fake blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conclusion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The military, local governments, hospitals, etc all participate in drills to test their preparedness should an emergency scenario happen.  It is a good training method for the personnel as they get to learn with a hands-on approach.  Yes, I was an actor and played an injured person.  The people "treating" me had no idea who I was.  There were cameras around and they were filming for other training purposes (perhaps even local news segments).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask me anything! :)
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       A few additional things I thought were important:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        As far as I know, all of the local emergency personnel were aware that they were participating in a drill and that everything is fake.  Obviously it wouldn't work for the hostage-takers if the police actually shot them for waving a fake weapon.
       </li>
       <li>
        None of our people were wearing military uniforms, it was all civilian clothing.
       </li>
       <li>
        I don't remember the town's names but the states were South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana. (We swung back through the corner of North Dakota just to say we had been there too)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       EDIT 2:  Looks like the downvote brigade has arrived 3 hrs in.  Multiple questions &amp; responses have taken a dive.

       The Sandy Hook event was, or was not, possibly an  exercise that went live similar to the 1993 world trade center bombings?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you experienced any situations  similar to the other events that happened concurrently with  similar exercises such as 9/11 ?

       I question everything and consider possibilities other than the official story like many on this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not
       <em>
        experienced
       </em>
       a drill that was turned into the real thing.  Still, they could have easily made any one of these drills that I participated in into the real thing by changing just one or two things...  the only thing they would have to do was give the "hostage takers" actual weapons and have them actually hit the passengers or shoot a couple of them.

       Sorry, I don't have any links to news articles about them nor remember the names of the towns we were in.  A couple of them were larger towns (like ~15,000 ppl) but the one in Montana was very small (&lt;5000 ppl).

       I take it you got paid? So a pay-stubb would be good. Photos from the 'scenes', coz you must have taken some pics while hanging around the set waiting to act. 
I'm sure theres a few more ways too!

        I was employed by the military and was not paid special payments for my participation in these events by the military or the local governments.  There was a little extra TDY pay for being "deployed" away from my home base for a couple days and that was it.

       OP says "I have been a crisis actor for training simulations in which everyone understood it is a simulation."

       Yes, OP might be lying -- for what purpose. I think everyone (non-idiots) understands that crisis training happens. And it uses actors.

       OP didn't say I was a crisis actor in Sandy Hook, ask me anything.

       Good question! Having
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces_oath_of_enlistment">
        sworn an oath to defend the Constitution
       </a>
       (and no longer having to follow orders of my superiors), I'm doing what I can legally to counter those who would destroy the principles this country was founded on.  I can also see how it would be easy to convince any human to do anything by feeding them just the right marketing/brainwashing.  For instance, telling someone they are a secret agent performing a critical mission help the government in its mission against terrorist forces...  that would be an easy one.

       That's a nice sentiment about random people but what happens when it's your government or an agency in a position of authority (FBI or CIA) that is telling you this? Becomes a bit more difficult to reject their sales pitch, doesn't it?

         I've been a member of reddit for many other years but have deleted those older accounts due to personal circumstances.  I have a separate account for my home than I use at work (so I don't have to keep switching what reddits appear on my front-page).

         I've mentioned my participation in these events with my friends IRL but I try not to share much of my personal life online.  I thought this might be relevant to recent events so I thought I'd share my experience.  From my point of view, I was doing nothing wrong by participating in these emergency preparedness exercises and never considered they could easily be turned into the real thing with me being an actual casualty... everything was on the up-and-up.

         Racism exists.  I don't find myself racist (thinking that one race is superior to another) but I also recognize the distinct differences and preferences between each race.  Some are better than other at different things but there's no all-encompassing attribute that makes one race superior than another.

       Why is everybody freaking out about him hiding something?  These types of things go on all of the time to prepare public &amp; private emergency services.  I participated in several back in the early double aughts.  I was actually involved in the special fx &amp; makeup, though.  The first one we did was for a high school to scare the kids around homecoming (don't drink and drive and all of that).  All of the kids who were playing the corpses/victims were rounded up in the gym, we did the makeup on them, and they were all taken out to a mock car crash out in front of the school.  Then ambulances came out and used the jaws of life, pulled the victims out, put them on stretchers, etc. while the whole school watched.  It was good training for the EMT's, police, and firemen, and was also a scared-straight tactic for the school kids.  The only people who didn't know it was happening were the kids who were pulled out of classes.  It was pretty obvious what was going on by the time they got outside, though.  I did one more similar to that at another high school, and then the last one I did was for a big ass coke-plant (the coal by-product, not the tasty beverage).  That one was actually a terrorist attack drill that involved more police and whatnot.  Lots of burn &amp; explosion victims, who were all employees for said coke-plant doubling as actors.  I never was involved in any mock disasters that involved professional actors.  This shit goes on all of the time, especially in small towns who might not regularly encounter this kind of stuff.  It is good training.  Anyway, my point is that a lot of people are exposed to this kind of stuff and probably have never really thought to say much of anything (like myself) because is is a fairly common practice, especially in small towns or areas with a lot of emergency service personnel who need training.  I could see how bigger cities would probably have to cart in professional or paid extras to really pull off bigger disasters so their people could be properly trained.  I don't think there is much of a conspiracy here.  Again, this shit goes on all of the time, all across the country.  I have a friend who actually worked for a contractor who made mock disaster supplies (special fx prosthetics, blood, etc.) for the US Army.  The Army does shit on a much bigger scale, and have a fuck ton more people to train than local community emergency services.  There was good money in making these supplies, and government contracts to be had.  It has been going on for a loooong time.  I actually had a US Army casualty simulation kit from the 80's.  Pretty primitive shit.  Truthfully, most casualty simulation kits haven't progressed much in that time-frame.

       Haha! I remember my school doing that exact "drunk-driving" scenario. They had some beat-up car that they "crashed" into a tree outside the school with a bunch of empty beercans that fell out when they opened the door.  The whole school was escorted outside to watch the police, fire dept, and ambulance show up and perform their duties.

       How much were you paid?  Since you were active duty, where were you stationed?  What made you just NOW want to discuss this?  You say they had the news present for one of the scenarios, do you remember which station, or what the cities were?  Do you have any photos from the drills?  I assume you could show us some sort of military paperwork to confirm you were w/ the military?  Also if these drills were closed to the public, I'd assume they gave you an ID badge for walking around the "set," or did they take them back after the drills were over?

       Youre definitely right about Sandy Hook.  Although it looks shift, all we have to go by are some aerial photos and word of mouth..  Which we all know isn't enough evidence..

       in this thread, he reminded me of a "don't drink and drive" act my school did when I was in the 5th grade.  That was, what, 1989 (24 years ago)?  I'll admit I thought it was real at the time but several years later realized it was all faked.

       How much "acting" did you do?  Was there a lot of yelling "OMHAHGAHD!  MY LEG IS BLOWN OFF!" or did you just sort of lie there until someone came and picked you up?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who was filming?  Did you ever see any of these training videos?  Was there a director and production assistants?

         Level of action: Some people "hammed" it up more than others.  In the first scenario I was pretty hung-over so I'm sure I moaned and groaned quite a bit.  We laughed at the bad guys but they were acting pretty serious.  In the second scenario I was playing dead while they checked my vitals and moved on to the next person.

         The people filming were wearing normal civilian clothing.  The camera was pretty fancy (large) but I don't remember seeing a news van.  Could've been the hospital staff or someone hired to record everything.

         No, I never got to see any of the training videos.  They never told us who was planning anything or how the military became involved in their emergency response drills.  I was just told where to go and what my role was and told to just wait.

       As others have discovered, nothing is truly verifiable.  Images can be manipulated. Video can be faked.  Documents can be forged.  At some point in the very end, you have to take something on faith... even with topics as large as "the earth is round".  You can't say that you've actually verified that the earth is round.  You can't measure it.  You can't see it.  All you have to go on is the video and claims of other people (plus the larger social acceptance/bandwagon effect).

       If I asked you to provide proof of a job you worked on 13 years ago, what would you be able to provide?  Maybe old tax documents that proved you worked for the company?  Do you have any pictures of yourself sitting at the desk (or holding a shovel/spatula)?  Not as easy as it seems, eh?

       Sure I may not have pay stubs, but I can certainly recall

       it was.

       We're just looking for proof of the event. Not that you were there.

       I'm not qualified to speak on the events of the Boston bombing.  Obviously I have seen many of the videos, photos, and media segments but that doesn't mean that I really know what happened any more than you.  It's possible there were actors and it's possible there were not.  It's possible it was staged and it's possible it was not.  It's also possible that the government will sacrifice some of its own people to achieve its objectives which many of us civilians may not know about or agree with...  It could also just be some crazy Chechen brothers who hate America for their freedoms.

       That's a nice sentiment about random people but what happens when it's your government or an agency in a position of authority (FBI or CIA) that is telling you this? Becomes a bit more difficult to reject their sales pitch, doesn't it?
