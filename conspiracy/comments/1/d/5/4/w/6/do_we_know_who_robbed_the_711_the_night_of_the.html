       Oh, my bad. Thanks. Perhaps since 7-11s can be franchised, the installation of cameras is up to the store owner's discretion. Maybe the one in question only has fake cameras used to deter crime.

       On the police scanner, they mentioned it was a "guy wearing a cowboy hat and a long black coat." I remember hearing them also say across the scanner that they had a lead on that suspect and were going to talk to someone in the area with a similar hat. I don't have a source, I just remember listening to it live on the police scanner.

       Exactly!  I was on board with the Official story until all these lies (every single aspect of this story has now come out as being untrue).  I've gone back to the Police radio transcriptions, there's so much that is unanswered and swept under the rug with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still trying to find who were the very last people to be suspected of this crime prior to the FBI rush releasing the photos of these suspects.  Can anyone point me to it.  I'm so tired right now and I can't even find the exact time of the first report of these two suspects to damn well find if anyone else was spotted just prior to the released images.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI said for more than 24 hours that they had a video of the suspects, they already knew who they were (apparently) so were holding onto them, and then suddenly, with no warning whatsoever they released the images of the suspects.  Whoever was put on 4chan or Reddit just prior to this are probably the real culprits.

       the car jacking hostage, said that tamerlan was near him when he tried to escape, saying that tamerlan also tried to grab him and stop him when he fled, but i ask how? if the 7/11 footage clearly shows Tamerlan at the shop entrance window while Dzhokhar is entering the store, how can Tamerlan be at the entrance and also be near the car to attempt to stop the hostage from fleeing? Official accounts say tamerlan came and knocked on the window before Dzhokhar managed to purchase anything and left empty handed, but in this picture

       u can clearly see Tamerlan in the window as Dzhokhar ENTERS the store with redbulls in his hand, so how does the hostage's story match up to this?

       also outside, to the above left of Dzhokhar, you can see the back of a person (black top, white collar), who was he? the alledged robber maybe? (black 120lbs) if not then surely he is also a witness?

       I think it is reasonably safe to presume there was no kidnap victim.  This is fiction.  The FBI have admitted they kept tabs on Tamerlan, so when they released the images they knew exactly who it was - they'd held it all back for more than 24 hours.  There are no real, up-close witnesses to Tamerlan being hit by a car at all, just people who watched from a distance.  Nothing caught on any video even remotely suggests a car screaming down the road and hitting anything!  So this didn't happen either.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all lies.  Let's go back to the start and look again!

       I cannot provide the link at the moment (sorry), but the person who took the well-publicized pictures of the shoot-out (the two brothers perched behind the SUV), has a blog where he gives a description of the shoot out as he observed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       He corroborates the evidence that Dzhokar jumped in the SUV after Tamerlan rushed the cops, and that he ran him over as he crashed through the police blockade. Also, there are pictures of the bloody streak/chalk outline.

       I'd also like to know why it has been concluded by some that he is definitely entering the store. Is it because of the direction he's facing? His hands are full so he's pushing the door open with his back/butt, just as(or after) Tamerlan approaches to tell him they need to leave.

       It could be, Jahar is going back into the store, to say something to the clerk, or maybe he forgot something at the checkout. It is also possible, he is walking backwards, leaving the store, and just exiting the door using his back

       He might not have even seen the news!  He's a student and a weed toker, the news isn't exactly what you watch when you're monged out.  He went to the 7/11 because he'd got the munchies, bought a jumbo pack of Pringles, went home to fap in front of the computer and the very next thing he knows he's rudely awakened and told 'run boy, we're gonna kill you'.  His brother was probably several miles away being told the same, before making at far as outside his house then being hit by a car and shot whilst dead (no blood on the accident photos near the gunshots, shows post mortem shooting - I love CSI).
