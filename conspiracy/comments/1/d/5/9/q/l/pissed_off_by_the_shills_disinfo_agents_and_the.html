For all practical purposes, you&#39;ll never hear from them again, at least until they start using a new name. If enough of us just plain ignore them they&#39;ll be the ones getting angry, not us.

    <div class="md"><p>Or, you know, engage in actual discussion with real arguments. I&#39;ve lost count of the times I&#39;ve made a list of proper arguments against some theory presented here, and gotten <em>only</em> a response like &quot;go away shill&quot; or similar. No rational arguments in reply, no defense, nothing. Any time I disagree with a popular opinion, people instantly call me &quot;shill&quot; and ignore my arguments.</p>

<p>For a subreddit being a &quot;thinking ground&quot;, the way you throw around accusations is utterly devoid of <em>thinking</em>. Not everyone who disagrees is a &quot;shill&quot; or a &quot;troll&quot;, certainly not &quot;disinfo agents&quot;. We just <em>disagree</em> with your conclusions. If your conclusions are right and based on solid information, they should withstand disagreement and critique, should they not? You shouldn&#39;t <em>need</em> to label people &quot;shills&quot; just for not hopping onboard the conspiracy-train immediately.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a 4 year redditor with no history (or interest) in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> until the Boston Bombing put your &quot;theories&quot; right on the front page, and I was called a &quot;shill&quot; by a <em>5 day redditor</em>, who completely ignored every single argument I made against his (heavily downvoted) post.</p>

<p>From what I see, the problem isn&#39;t &quot;shills&quot; or trolls <em>at all</em>, it&#39;s the <em>incredibly</em> narcissistic view people here have of themselves as the <em>only</em> people brave and smart enough to post &quot;the truth&quot;. <em>Anyone</em> who disagrees <em>must</em> be a &quot;paid disinfo agent&quot;, because why else would they disagree? If you&#39;re a regular to this subreddit, surely that means you could never be wrong?</p>

<p>If people question or criticize your theories, <em>defend</em> them. If you can&#39;t, then that&#39;s on <em>you</em>, not anyone else. Don&#39;t respond to properly skeptical replies with personal attacks and absolutely groundless and pitiful accusations of people being &quot;shills&quot; left and right.</p>

<p>A &quot;shill&quot; is not merely someone who questions <em>you</em>. If you want to keep using that word, you better know what the heck it actually means, and provide <em>some</em> evidence to back up your personal attacks with.</p>

<p>People here use &quot;shill&quot; the way the Smurfs use &quot;Smurf&quot;.</p>

<p>This. Although i&#39;m on the other side of the fence, and i&#39;ve been here since i created this account a few months ago, if your theories are worth the paper (pixels?) they&#39;re written on, then you should be able to defend them with sourced and logical information in the face of criticism, childish or not. </p>

<p>If someone dismisses your stuff with no evidence and name calling, call them out on it. It&#39;s very easy to make someone look like an idiot if you&#39;re posting decent information and they&#39;re the ones being purposely ignorant and belligerent. And i <em>hate</em> it when people accuse others of being &quot;shills&quot;. Doesn&#39;t matter if they are, you should be able to stand up to whatever bullshit they throw your way. </p>

<p>Oh, and for people who haven&#39;t been here long, and are just maybe getting into these discussions and trying to figure things out: remember this works both ways. You can&#39;t disprove theories with other, more &#39;acceptable&#39; theories. Take <em>any</em> theories with a pinch of salt (or even less if they&#39;re about crisis actors and reptiles), until you see well sourced and backed-up information from either side.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even actually posting any information, really. All I&#39;m doing is questioning the sources and conclusions posted by others, trying to make people think about what they&#39;re actually saying. That&#39;s enough. Just <em>questioning</em> someone else earns you the title of &quot;shill&quot; in this place.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That goes without saying. However, there&#39;s a trend I&#39;m seeing where &quot;stories&quot;, being literally fiction invented out of thin air, gets upvoted and defended as <em>plausible</em> explanations, whereas the real explanations are being dismissed outright for <em>no other reason</em> than that some newspaper or TV station mentioned it. In other words, pure fiction is perfectly acceptable as long as it originates here, whereas fact-based reporting is dismissed as lies <em>only</em> because it comes from the media.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not healthy reasoning, or good skepticism. That&#39;s fanaticism, plain and simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. That&#39;s why i&#39;m not particularly bothered by these new people. The trolls are a pain, but easily dismissed. But some people around here needed someone to reground them, without a doubt. It&#39;s easy to think you&#39;re right about something when you&#39;re only talking about it with people who agree with you.</p>

<p>And i agree that people throw the word &#39;shill&#39; around way too much... If you want to know how ridiculous it is, look at my comment history, and know that <em>i&#39;ve</em> been called a shill on more than one occasion...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about it this way. Most of the people here welcome criticism and debating theories are fine and dandy, but people that are on the opposing side of the conspiracy get up voted by trolls and the conspiracy theorist gets down voted. This not only makes the theorist look bad but it triggers  the trolls to make a similar post, as the opposing idea, to chop away at a theory with one liners and jokes. Ultimately derailing the post and creating a bandwagon of jokes and puns. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget people come here because they like making this subreddit look bad so they do anything in there power to do so. Such as creating 10 or more alts to down vote conspiracy theorists for no reason and upvote nonsensical posts to make everyone here look like wack jobs. Remember, real trolls have no life and will go the extra mile to make themselves feel better about themselves. I have witnessed in other subreddits where people openly admit to doing things like this to raise their self esteem. </p>

<p>In conclusion, I disagree with you. A simple down vote for disagreeing with people is sufficient enough, unless you have proof beyond a doubt to discredit someone&#39;s evidence. Otherwise you are just unnecessarily feeding the trolls. </p>

<p>In reality, however, it&#39;s rather the opposite. Crack-pot theories are upvoted, serious criticism is downvoted, and the jokes and trolls are hidden at the bottom.</p>

<p>No doubt. I don&#39;t question the existence of trolls in the slightest. I just doubt that this particular subreddit is 90% trolls oppressing the poor 10% minority of truth-seekers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In fact, downvoting for merely disagreeing goes directly against reddiquette, as well as any rules of honest discussion and debate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>unless you have proof beyond a doubt to discredit someone&#39;s evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you don&#39;t need proof beyond a doubt to <em>prove</em> your own theories? Why is that?</p>

<p>from our perspective, if you are that willing to tote the official story without questioning it, you are either a troll or a sheep.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am absolutely questioning it, I&#39;m questioning all of it. I just do it by <em>replacing</em> the official story with a <em>fantastical</em> alternative. I go from &quot;official story&quot; to &quot;no explanation&quot;. That&#39;s the main difference between conspiracy theorists and everybody else, in my opinion. Conspiracy theorists are unable to question anything without first replacing it with a conspiracy.</p>

<p>For example, I&#39;ve changed my mind about the campus police shooting (I thought the brothers did it, now I have no reason to), the robbery (no real opinion on that right now) and of course the arrest of #2 (were there guns? How was he hurt?). But none of that matters, in fact, no one even bothers asking me what I believe, <em>just because</em> I don&#39;t immediately accept any and all conspiracy theory alternatives, I&#39;m labeled a &quot;shill&quot; or &quot;troll&quot; or told to go elsewhere.</p>

<p>I recently questioned a completely made-up story about the FBI setting the brothers up and telling them the bombs were fake, etc etc, a &quot;theory&quot; for which there was <em>absolutely not a single shred of actual, factual evidence</em>. Does that make me a sheep? Does it really? And why berate <em>me</em> for questioning that, and defend people who post things that are as far from &quot;very researched and historically based&quot; as you could possibly get?</p>

<p>TIL that questioning that mainstream (in <em>this</em> subreddit, at least) belief is considered &quot;polluting the comment space&quot;.</p>

<p>Mainstream this and mainstream that. I&#39;m not even really making any claims about anything, I&#39;m mostly questioning the claims made here. Yes, I suppose being skeptical of what some people take for absolute truth is part of my &quot;mainstream mindset&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, at least with me, is that your (or any &#39;skeptic&#39;s) arguments make sense to you, but not to me, because youre missing information, and i dont have 3 hours to go and find every source on what information youre missing, on the off chance that you even were open to the information if its not from a mainstream news source. It takes years of independent research for a lot of the  stuff here to make sense or for assumptions not to seem like &quot;stretches&quot; and if you dont do that it just seems like were crazy. Itd be like me being trying to explain to you string theory when you only understand trigonometry (except you are committed to believing i am wrong). It would honestly take days of writing to even give enough background to refute many of the arguments skeptics make, and thats why most of us just give up. And thats just one skeptic. None of us have the time, let alone are eloquent or educated enough, to lay out every single piece of evidence in perfect logical order as to why your argument is flawed. Theres are hundreds of thousands of books, articles, documentaries, and lectures by people who devotes their life to this, and when we say &quot;do your own research&quot; we are saying to check those out. This stuff isnt easy to understand and if youre committed to mis understanding, and refuse to even be open to it unless someone is going to lay it out for you (which would take at least days of writing, which most skeptics would just say tl;dr) its just not worth the time. </p>

<p>If you actually want to understand why we think what we think, i have hundreds of documentaries, dozens of books, hundreds of articles saved that would get you started, but of course if youre not willing to comb through information and research for yourself, this subreddit or &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; are never going to make sense.  </p>

<p>I agree with you however that people massively over use the term shill, and many may even think it means something it doesnt. </p>

<p>The thing is, <em>neither of us are physicists</em>! That&#39;s the absolute main focal point of my argument. You are not divinely gifted with insights into the occluded in a way I&#39;m not. You reference &quot;years of independent research&quot; as if that actually meant something on its own. You say you can&#39;t be bothered to spend 3 hours gathering sources for your claims, as if 2 minutes wouldn&#39;t be enough to at least get me started. Lastly, you push the entire responsibility back over to me, claiming <em>I&#39;m</em> not open to contrary arguments to begin with.</p>

<p>There is no &quot;years of independent research&quot;, at least not that actually proves the existence of all the various conspiracy theories promoted here. There are <em>thousands of Youtube videos</em> by enthusiasts and hobbyists blowing up &quot;thermite&quot; or collapsing stacks of bricks, but that&#39;s not nearly the same. The <em>actual</em> years of research performed, like the 9/11 commission and various other ventures, would be something you could actually refer to and sound somewhat convincing. But just doing the r/conspiracy dance of claiming you&#39;ve got &quot;sources&quot; and &quot;evidence&quot; I don&#39;t even know about proves squat. Diddly squat.</p>

<p>Websites listing coincidences, numerology or pareidolia do not constitutes &quot;years of independent research&quot;, yet that is 99% of the stuff being posted here. If you have credible, independent sources that are confirmed and corroborated elsewhere, post them. I&#39;ll gladly take a look at them with an open mind.</p>

<p>The problem is that this isn&#39;t true. What you actually mean to say is that if I&#39;m not willing to simply <em>accept</em> what those documentaries, books and articles claim, despite all other &quot;mainstream&quot; research or facts, this subreddit is never going to make sense. Because it doesn&#39;t. Contradictory theories based on equal measures of evidence are presented all the time (global warming is a hoax, yet HAARP can control the weather), and no one thinks twice, but a &quot;mainstream theory that contradicts a conspiracy? Conspiracy all the way, no questions asked, no doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for mostly just proving my point.</p>

<p>Apparently I can only speak here if I already believe what you post arguments for believing. So what&#39;s the point? To be an echo chamber and circle-jerk for conspiracy theorist believers?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, the problem is that you disbelieve something <em>just because</em> it&#39;s written in a textbook. You&#39;re already convinced of the conclusion, and accept only arguments and facts that support them, nothing else. If I don&#39;t believe as you do, my arguments don&#39;t matter and I shouldn&#39;t even be here.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&quot;Respect other views and opinions, keep an open mind.&quot; That&#39;s right in the sidebar. It goes both ways, you know. I respect your views and opinions that everything is a conspiracy, but I choose to question and criticize it to make sure they&#39;re solid. You apparently don&#39;t respect <em>my</em> views and opinions, because they don&#39;t align with your own, and tell me I should go elsewhere.</p>

<p>Who&#39;s actually on the path to honest, fact-based and truthful conclusions? And who just wants to confirm what they already believe?</p>

I&#39;ve gotten carried away in the past and be a little rude to people, but you&#39;re right what needs to be at the forefront is facts and deductive reasoning. As I was reading your posts I feel like maybe the problem you&#39;re facing is you&#39;re not here to be entertained and a lot of people are. I think people that call out the fantasy theories, like crisis actors and reptiles, are just buzzkills for some people that just want to read about conspiracies and not do anything about it. I&#39;ve said this before, it&#39;s a lot easier to look at a picture with text over it or watch a little radio broadcast than read through a dense piece about financial fraud or illegal whatever. It would be nice to see some more activist oriented stuff on here instead of, &quot;EVERYONE ON EARTH IS A CRISIS ACTOR!!!!!111!!&quot; I had to give myself a laugh here ha.

<p>Poorly framed question but yes. You must agree that politics are a real thing, and that you think they are worth discussing. In the same vein here you must admit that conspiracies outside of mainstream acceptance are real, and should be discussed.</p>

<p>Circlejerk implies lack of debate. The reason <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> needs moderation is because shills, JIDF, Hasbara, etc are real things. It&#39;s not some fairy tail, disinfo really happens.</p>

<p>There is no disagreement over whether or not politics itself is real. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> doesn&#39;t argue that it&#39;s real, because there&#39;s no one else to argue that it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>Conspiracies, however, is something people <em>do</em> argue is &quot;real&quot;, whether everyone else believes they&#39;re not. It&#39;s an actual topic of discussion, whether &quot;is politics real&quot; is not.</p>

<p>I disagree.</p>

<p>Yes, and since you&#39;re saying I can&#39;t debate whether conspiracies are real, this is, by definition, a circlejerk.</p>

<p>Whether or not people like &quot;chrunchbars&quot; has no real impact on real life matters. Conspiracies do. It has even permeated the top levels of US politics. I&#39;d say this is a far more serious matter than whether a person likes chocolate or not. The accusation that people seriously hurt in the bombing were actually actors, or that the entire FBI is involved in deliberately ruining people&#39;s live is a far more serious matter. It <em>should</em> be questioned, criticized and debated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but this isn&#39;t a religion or an entirely opinionated subject, it&#39;s a form of challenging authority based on objective facts and logical reasoning. I will tell you you shod debate a nihilist in morality or discuss why oranges are worse than apples, because those are subjective views and there are interesting things to learn about others discussing those things. A conspiracy, however, ought to be a logical chain that propagates an argument. So you should be able to debate the premises of your conspiracy theories and, better yet, know each piece of important information that leads a theory to be likely so you can explain it to people who ask or challenge you. This isn&#39;t a religion and we don&#39;t have to have faith in the JFK assassination being this or that, or that the moon landing was fake, or whatever to discuss what possible conspiracies are taking place in our world. Nobody wants to ruin your fun or anything, but some people want to keep the theories concise and logical so we can stand by them when there is a need to.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not shitting on any <em>user</em>. I respect any member of this community who stands up for what they believe and present a good, honest argument in favor of it.</p>

<p>I <em>question</em> the userbase. If the users can&#39;t handle being <em>questioned</em> on the theories they propose, they&#39;re not theories to begin with. They&#39;re dogma. They&#39;re faith-based beliefs.</p>

<p><em>Theories</em> are for people who know how to make them and defend them. If all you want to do is look for reasons to keep believing what you already believe, <a href="/r/religion">/r/religion</a> is over there...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then why are you here? By your own admission you&#39;re essentially just a troll.</p>

<p>No, a troll is someone who posts things purely to annoy others, usually not even caring what they post. I care very much about what I post, and if having outrageous claims questioned annoys you, then that&#39;s <em>your</em> problem, not mine.</p>

<p>I am not a troll, nor a shill. I am a real person who <em>disagrees</em> with you on the facts, and <em>questions</em> the theories you propose. That&#39;s it. It&#39;s as simple as that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At least we can ALL agree that the world is fucked-up and, as human beings, we have taken a personal interest in finding out the real reasons why. We may not always agree, fellow Redditors, but hopefully y&#39;all (Texan here) just want to make the world a better place for everyone, including the accused AND the victims (in whatever conspiracy you believe in). </p>

<p>I cannot help but feel those who are &quot;in the know&quot; suffer as much from their corruption and knowledge as we do. The systems of the world have been in place for a long time, and people feel trapped on either side of the equation. I&#39;m not crying for the bankers, or the Illuminati, or whatever. I&#39;d just like to point out that, if any of these conspiracies are true, remember that there are &quot;blue-collar&quot; conspirators too, men and women who spend their whole lives toiling in the dark, compromising themselves as human beings, for what amounts to a modest middle-class life or less (I must assume many are rot in foreign prisons for a long time, or meet an early demise). And many times they, too, are programmed (brainwashed, for those who aren&#39;t RA Wilson fans) to believe that, despite it all, they are doing the right thing. I&#39;m thinking Special Forces, many CIA agents, and even more &quot;black&quot; agents (perhaps the Boston bombers?). In truth, I could even garner some sympathy for some of the more obviously deluded power-players in history, like GW Bush. I may not forgive them, but I could never know what they had to deal with and experience in such a high level of power and therefore, ultimately, I cannot judge them with all honesty. </p>

<p>Empathy is the greatest human quality. To me, love is a mixture of many emotions, with empathy foremost. If you joined R/conspiracy in order to prove yourself right on some sort of power trip, or to try to excuse your standing in life by blaming others, or, Science forbid, to exercise your racial paranoia, you have no place here. For the rest of y&#39;all, Happy Hunting ! And may you help bring the world the peace it so very much deserves after so much pain </p>

<p>No, we don&#39;t. Like I said above, <em>disagreement</em> is not the same as being paid to disrupt the common order. If you view <em>disagreement</em> as equivalent to <em>disruption</em>, nothing&#39;s going to save you. This is just a meaningless echo chamber, if the only permissible opinion is the one that agrees with the conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still unclear why so many folks like you spend so much time caring about the stuff this sub talks about.</p>

<p>Maybe we just want to make the world a better place. Maybe we want to test ourselves, see if <em>we</em> can actually defend <em>our</em> beliefs. The reasons are legion. They&#39;re also utterly irrelevant. Either the arguments are sound, or they are not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a conspiracy forum, if you want to debunk, go join a debunker forum and enjoy making fun of people who don&#39;t think as you do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s the point of separating the two? Surely, if you&#39;re a conspiracy theorist, you&#39;d want to know if what you believe is actually true? Right? Or are you saying that people here only believe in conspiracies because it makes them feel good somehow?</p>

<p>People have said to me that what you do here is <em>scientific</em>. Propagating &quot;theories&quot; that only ever support one pre-conceived conclusion and rejecting anyone that questions it is not scientific. In fact, what you do should barely be called <em>theorizing</em> if that&#39;s the case.</p>

<p>The sidebar claims this is a &quot;thinking ground&quot;, that respects <em>everyone&#39;s</em> opinions. It says to &quot;keep an open mind&quot;, and that it works towards a &quot;more transparent world&quot;. How does ignoring and rejecting anyone who doubts or openly questions the pre-conceived conclusions meet those guidelines?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know it&#39;s untrue, what I know is that your theories lack solid evidence. That&#39;s all. I don&#39;t claim to know the truth, and I never have.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That sounds like a very open-minded opinion.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Certainly no more petulant than all the people here who respond to critical questions with personal attacks. If you can&#39;t even defend your theories against common sense and reason, let alone the &quot;mainstream views&quot;, what does that say about you?</p>

<p>If you post a theory, I post a reply with critical questions and holes, and you respond by calling me a &quot;shill&quot; or &quot;sheep&quot; or using the word &quot;mainstream&quot; 15 times in one comment, is it <em>I</em> who has to rethink my position? Or you?</p>
