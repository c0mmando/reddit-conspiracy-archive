       You want to know what is killing r/conspiracy?  The narcissistic users, and some of the ridiculous theories.  Not shills/trolls/disinfo agents or people who want an open discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, so let's start off with one of the theories being tossed around.  Crisis actors at the Boston Bombings.  Do you understand that people died in the Boston Bombings?  Yet some of you want to circulate the idea they were hired actors.  You know, actors that volunteered to die to push some agenda, right?  Can you see how this theory could upset some people(this goes 10x if you were effected by recent events.)?  Especially when nobody provides sources or evidence of this claims.  A training video of the military in fake combat zones w/ actors doesn't prove they used actors either.  When you post shit like that, with total disregard to the lives lost you have to assume people will think differently of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next let's talk about the other thing that is killing this sub..  The narcissistic users.  So, lots of new folks are coming to r/conspiracy because people are finally realizing the msm isn't very reliable.  Many people from Boston came so they could see what WASN'T being reported in the news.  All these people come here to get informed and ask questions.  But they are met with those narcissistic users who are dead set in their ways, and believe what they believe with or without sources.  If their account isn't old enough they're a shill, if they keep asking for sources they're a shill.  You can't win unless you side with their theory..

       I get the impression that many of the theories on here are inspired by a rabid desire to go against the "official story", rather than inspired by facts that contradict it.  I think it was Clinton that said facts should inform your ideology, not the other way around, and when your first reaction to literally anything is, "That's how it was reported, so that cannot be how it actually happened," then you're just as bad as right-wingers, letting your ideology dictate everything.

       If people can't get past their emotions and use their brains they arent ready to be here in the first place anyway. i think the crisis actor thing is misinfo or deliberate disinfo but that is irrelevant; if people are going to get butthurt just because someone proposes an alternative thing  they shouldnt be here. We are talking about our government killing their own people; its already commonly accepted fact that everyone who died in Iraq and everyone who died in Vietnam died for nothing. If people going to flip a shit on some one who simply proposes that this handful of people may or may not have been killed, but couldnt give a shit about the 2 million that were killed as a direct result of our government lying to us, well fuck them.  This is a free thinking ground. We shouldnt have to walk on egg shells all the time. Again, if people can't think for themselves, and determine the facts themselves based on their own research or overcome their emotions to see the facts, its not our job to coddle them into "enlightenment".
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you dont seem to understand what the term
       <em>
        theory
       </em>
       means. Are there "conspiracy theories" that have substantial evidence and she be considered "conspiracy fact", yes, but that doesnt mean there arent some that we are simply
       <em>
        proposing
       </em>
       and do not have substantial evidence for. No one here is saying OMG CRISIS ACTORS IS FACT DONT U GUYS SEE and running around telling everyone. We are, within our community of what is supposed to be free thinkers, simply
       <em>
        proposing the possibility
       </em>
       based on some evidence that may support that. This is the fundamental core of this subreddit, and if you have a problem with it then im sorry but this isnt the place for you.

       In your first sentence I assume you're talking about those who like to make claims and not support said claims.  Would you not be upset if a family member of yours was injured or killed in the bombings?  Wouldn't it add insult to injury if people were going around saying it was a hoax, and wouldn't provide their sources?  I look at these events from all perspectives, not just my own.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only care about those who were hurt/killed in Boston?  That's how I interpreted your comment..  As far as "enlightenment" goes, if you're going to propose a theory like this you better have some pretty compelling evidence to prove it.  So, it is in fact a person's job to present their research if they want their theory to be taken seriously..  Otherwise you're just trying to blow smoke up my ass.

       Theory: a proposed explanation whose status is still conjectural and subject to experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there are plenty of people who believe the crisis actor theory.  I mean it's on the front page of conspiracyx, the guys you are defending.  Fortunately over the last couple weeks there have been enough open minded users to keep these crazy theories from the front page.  Their sourceless theories can't make it to the front page anymore, thus the drama.

       But for the love of god people need to stop saying this. If people were
       <strong>
        trying as hard as possible to comb over every possible detail of what actually occurred that day
       </strong>
       then by god I would be honored by their utmost respect for my beloved lost. I agree that suggesting that there were actors at the scene is offensive, as is any sort of mockery of actual conspiracy investigation. I agree that its possible that ridiculous theories are put out to make theorists look radical, hence masking truly credible info with ridiculous garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, just mask the pursuit of truth as an offensive dishonorable unpatriotic sin, and its all set.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I am more upset about alternative theories that are
       <strong>
        actually possible
       </strong>
       being utterly thrown out and ignored in preference of a spectacular news story produced immediately following a closed off occurrence, and all this parading around with this style as if our country doesn't have a policy of "innocent until proven guilty". Even if every single part of this "official story" adds up, I am not supporting how this was done. We switched to "guilty until proven innocent" for the  convenience of not even fully proving guilt, and throwing out several oddities that happened to be of just as prominent concern as the other 2 suspects until the "case was closed".

       Who is saying that it was a hoax? There
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       some unusual evidence suggesting the possibility that at least one of the bombs didn't actually happen; people are basing the
       <em>
        theory
       </em>
       of the
       <em>
        possibility
       </em>
       based on this information. I haven't seen anyone claim definitively that this bombing was a hoax, and if there are people saying that, they are "doing it wrong". There is in no way enough evidence to support that this bombing didn't happen, however that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate information which seems to suggest the possibility. Maybe you are new to this forum, but we don't up vote things based on factuality, we upvote things based on what is interesting/
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be an answer/to
       <em>
        get
       </em>
       evidence for or against it. This crisis actor thing was a perfect example. It was "hey look at these pictures, and notice these oddities in the picture that suggest that this man may have been amputee" "Could this be the case" "Anyone have evidence for or against this?" That's what we do. We theorize about conspiracy. A lot of times, in fact, most of the time, we get
       <em>
        seriously
       </em>
       significant evidence to support the claims, in which most of us would consider it "conspiracy fact" , other times we get serious evidence to prove claims wrong, other times we don't get much info either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are upset at people who are saying
       <em>
        definitively
       </em>
       this bombing didn't happen, in the face of almost no evidence (and if anything, pretty significant evidence to the contrary), you are rightfully upset, and, if there are people claiming this, I am annoyed as well. But that was of thinking is not reflected by this subreddit as a whole, and it is looked down up by this sub reddit. Anyone who would claim this bombing didn't happen, in the face of this a lack of evidence, honestly isn't a true 'conspiracy theorist' or 'critical thinker' or whatever you would like to call us. Many who are informed about conspiracies got
       <em>
        lucky
       </em>
       in hearing the information, and didn't form their own opinions/conclusions, and thus became as dogmatic with conspiracy as others are with the mainstream. They are not respected. They are not the kind of people we want here. We hope that they will start to question
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       and not just the official story, but no one is perfect.  This a problem, but it is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the rule, and it is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       condoned by those of us who do our absolute best to
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       be open to new evidence for any position.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, that is not to say that just because one questions the official story or
       <em>
        proposes
       </em>
       the
       <em>
        possibility
       </em>
       that the bombing, or any event, didn't happen is in the wrong. I thought you were saying that simply proposing the possibility that the bombing didn't happen was in the wrong (because that
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       all that this community as a whole has embraced), and if you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       believe that, that's what my last comment was in response to. If you are only appalled because you believe people are claiming definitively that it didn't happen, you are incorrect, because if anyone
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       doing that, they are not the majority nor is that thought process respected by those of us who consider ourselves 'free thinkers' or 'critical thinkers'.

       you said it yourself. It's a theory. It's not a fact and no one is saying it is. We simply are interested in finding the information.

       In regards to this specific "theory", of the crisis actors, I believe it is dis info or just a stretch. But we wouldn't know that if it didn't get upvoted to the front page and thoroughly discussed/rebutted/supported/etc.

       edit 2: Just to try and clarify what I was trying to get at in my first response:
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a place for critical thinkers. For people who question
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       and do their own research and don't believe anything even if 99% of the forum believes it (to reiterate, this crisis actor theory is not believed by the majority, but even if it was it is ones duty as a critical thinker to not believe it until they see the evidence for themselves) until they have seen the evidence for themselves and are convinced. Does everyone here fit that criteria? No, of course not. There are a decent number of people who just got lucky and stumbled upon conspiracy theory, but still have that "follow the heard" mentality and will believe something just because it's the top post. There are also people who refuse to accept anything unless a trusted leader or establishment says it's true. Neither of these kinds of people belong here (unless of course they are open to changing those positions).
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to "it is in fact a persons job to present their research if they want their theory to be take seriously", again i cant say enough that i DO NOT believe the crisis actor theory and that i am responding in regards to 'conspiracy theory in general'. First of all, no i have no obligation because i couldnt care less what you believe. Second there are dozens of conspiracies that are well documented and proven over decades, if youre not open to the possibility of conspiracy, no one should be wasting their time trying to prove to you that crisis actors were a thing in boston as means of  convincing you that false flags do happen and that our government is not here to protect us. Even if crisis actors were not used and nothing was faked, there is still a whole mound of evidence for the possibility of boston being a false flag. But even then, it doesnt matter. Whether it was committed or simply being manipulated by the government and media is irrelevant. They ARE manipulating and twisting the information to push a police state and that should be bad enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, if you believe conspiracy  or false flags are impossible check out Water Gate, the Gulf on Tonkin, Operation Northwood, Operation Mocking Bird, CIA Drug Running or any of the number of conspiracies which are accepted by the mainstream. Then check out JFK or 9/11 or The Lusitania or or any of the other things whose only lacking in factuality is that it is not accepted by the mainstream. Or even just spend a few hours a week checking out the info that gets dropped on this sub (assuming it isnt ruined after this who mod/troll scandal thing) and in a few months you may think a little differently.

       Good post, I'm pretty sure you understand my stance on the topic.  That's one of the unfortunate things about this sub, you can't really see where a person is coming from without a thorough discussion like this.  Most people aren't willing to go this far, but we did, and it turns out we see things pretty similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the definition of theory goes..  I'm not sure if I screwed up a sentence or something with an earlier post, but I understand its definition.  Sorry for the confusion.

       The common brain's hardwiring of the phrase "conspiracy theorist" to always be inherently interpreted as less credible and less founded-by-evidence is a massive conspiracy in and of itself. This sort of hardwiring selectively chooses to identify "conspiracy theorists" with ridiculous posts that any worthy theorist would scoff at in a second, and its the production and assumptive support of these radical theories that keeps this hardwiring misnomer alive. When the methods of procuring, recording, and sharing evidence have become absolutely inflated and magnified--it might be worth considering that info on every possible side is misinfo...hence all evidence is possibly incorrect. That is not to say no evidence has worth, but please, for the love of god.

       No, conspiracy theorist does not equal narcissist. A lack of empathy is a sure fire sign of a narcissist. Not everyone is upset because of the conspiracy theories, it's more the lack of empathy people show in their quest to defend an argument. It's ok to debate a tough topic, by all means. It's not ok to show a complete lack of empathy towards those who were greatly affected by the incident.

       Trust me... I have been on subreddits that got filled with persistent trolls. It is not that bad here yet but I am sure it will get there.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it does get there, it won't be just easy as ignoring them. 1)They start downvoting everything in large numbers and upvoting their own, so that the only top comments are theirs. 2)They start making skeptics look like fools all the time. 3)They downvote all articles pertaining to the subreddit so that it gets caught in spam.
      </p>

       So there is a lot of damage these kinds of people can do in the longer time and ignoring just allows that to breed until the only alternative is to move and create a new one that isn't filled with trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seen all this happen... so it is not a good idea to just ignore them.

       so they won't constantly sit there upvoting comments just because they are getting downvoted. On the other hand, trolls will just sit there from morning till night... downvoting everything and I speak from experience of seeing this happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good folks only upvote comments they agree with or for other similar reasons... because that's how reddit is supposed to work. They are not going to engage in some sort of war with trolls with reddit's voting system. It is better in those cases for the moderators to intervene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit's comment system is flawed because it all depends on upvotes/downvotes on show comments that are important, and that's why moderators need to play an active role to make sure it isn't getting abused.

       Truer words... Except not only true for reddits. I've seen it happen enough times. The tipping-point when a community goes down the shitter and you have to ask yourself wether you want to stay and fight for survival. Wether it's worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For Internet communities, the answer is no most often, not worth the time and effort. Move along, join a related community or create a new one. That's all there is to it.

       (Disclaimer: Not part of this sub at all, infrequent reader, first comment here I believe (stumbled in from the frontpage today). But a post like ops, as well as the various comments I read in this thread, all put up the kind of warning flags I learned to recognize. If this is the general mood/ situation right now, leave, and spare yourselves the effort.)

       No, in the comments mostly. You can't even have a discussion anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are still less overall trolls/shills/ignoramus out there to downvote articles, but the pentagon has a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars to create fake social media accounts to swing public opinion:
       <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/07/pentagon-seeks-to-manipulate-social-media-for-propaganda-purposes.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So I have no doubt they are hard at work with their tax payers hundreds of millions creating fake accounts to try and swing public opinion on reddit. I'd imagine after the recent exposure of false flag they upped their efforts in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       otherwise they were mostly at
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       and similar.

       So you understand that they have a very, very long and very, very rich history of staging events and as recent as Fast and Furious shipping thousands of guns into Mexican drug cartels which used those guns in the murder of hundreds of people in Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they've staged operation Gladio, fast and furious which have killed hundreds of people that we know of, they can easily stage the Boston bombing or provocateur it or at the very least allow it to happen. Its not like they don't have a geopolitical agenda to follow through and its called putting up a police state.

       Just because it's a possibility doesn't mean it deserves serious consideration though, especially when there are no facts or evidence to support the claim. To automatically assume that every tragedy is a false flag attack is not skepticism, it's dogmatic.

       You're uninformed. Probably an agent yourself.  No one who has looked into it doesn't believe there were controlled demolitions on 911. You prove yourself ignorant by such a statement.  Crisis actors? Well they exist. I'm not sure yet what they do.

       This exactly. Trolls have ALWAYS been part of an online community. Hell, if you really want to blame someone, blame ﻿the mods for not cleaning up ﻿the forums(its a conspiracy forum, really, anything goes) or just don't visit ﻿the damn thing. Reddits community has really gone down hill lately. No one thinks for themselves anymore. Everyone just grabs ﻿the highest voted ideology and runs with it. Reddit is supposed to be a forum for OPEN INFORMATION and thoughts, or at least used to be. Its recent popularity has really destroyed ﻿the community. Think for yourselves people, gather information and come to your own conclusions.

       I don't really see why silencing people is the right way to go. Perhaps dunbueno went to far in banning ALL the moderators, but I do think their posting restrictions were a bit too heavy handed, and goes against what all skeptics should stand for.

       If people are trolling, just ignore them, IMO.

       i don't feel like 30 days is too heavy handed. you don't need to be able to post to want to learn. i don't come in here b/c i know something you all do not. i come b/c you all are educating me. and imo if the conspiracy is SO important, in 30 days when you can post about it, it will still be relevant.

       I love how this argument is used against anyone who wants less government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me clear this up for you:
When people speak for less government, the also mean the right to privacy, property, and creating their own groups. When someone comes in and infiltrates that group, someone has to put an end to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider a free society with less government control, the troll/free loader would be the one abusing the system. Normally the people rise against the troll and kick him out or kill it. If there is a small government, then the government intervenes to make sure outsiders don't infringe of the rights of those who formed the society. They make sure he doesn't come in again to ruin the society they have created. This is what would normally happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, on reddit... we can't group together and can't just kick trolls out. We leave that power to the mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this is a misunderstanding of what a society with limited government and an inability to understand why reddit is already a restricted platform and how doesn't relate exactly to societies found in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now what we have is trolls messing with the society, people not being able to do anything about it because the users of the subreddit cannot kick out trolls themselves, and the moderators who have the power to do this... isn't doing anything about it.

       Why does godiebiel's comment have 4 upvotes?  Why aren't people asking is he mocking this community or is this just a lame joke?
      </p>
      <p>
       One of my complaints about Reddit in general is a shift in the level of discussion everywhere.  When you go into the comments on a lot of things, the top comments will be lousy jokes or references to some pop culture meme.   And back to the comment in question, I wouldn't encourage it whatever the motivation.

       My opinion on
       <em>

       theories, yes, conspiracy in general is much broader than
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       has been lately. All these voices need a place to speak, and I believe

       should be a place where open minded people respect each others ideas, though in reality, today, it's far from this.

       <em>
        UFO footages
       </em>
       since their only objective is to ridicule this sub, without any insights into the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again if you disagree with me on fringe conspiracies, this is your right, I don't agree with them either to be honest, but as I posted, if the OP really believes in it, then he has the right to post it here, and then maybe we both can enjoy this sub anyway, preferably without all the trolls posting: "Boston Bombing Shill 4Chan Proof", and laughing there asses off at

       Ok, I'm concerned because there's a change throughout Reddit and not just here.  I'm not really big on UFO's but there is a conspiracy forum where I lurk that has people that discuss or post about it.  And it has really good content and intelligent discussion on all the topics.   It seems like there's a campaign to stop discussion on controversial things/events on all of Reddit but it's especially bad here.

       I understand, are you referring to
       <a href="/r/UAP">
        /r/UAP
       </a>
       , that's prob the best sub on UFO related subjects,
       <a href="/r/UFO">
        /r/UFO
       </a>
       is full of
       <em>
        found footage
       </em>
       that's usually for dismissing the whole community while
       <a href="/r/UAP">
        /r/UAP
       </a>
       is a smaller and more focused sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       About the overall change in Reddit, I heard this before specially on
       <a href="/r/theoryofreddit">
        /r/theoryofreddit
       </a>
       , and most agree that it's because of the massive influx of new
       <em>
        redditors
       </em>
       (trolls, 4channers, PR agents, and even shills) occuring ever since AMA and controversial posts became the focus of the media circus.

       No, maybe I wasn't clear.  I don't really have an interest in UFO's although I wouldn't deny their existence.  There's a conspiracy related forum that I read where a lot of people there do talk about ufo topics and the forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       My interest is conspiracy related things is more because of political reasons.  I didn't get interested until 9/11 and started researching that as well as other things.  In general, I think bad things are on the way.
Also, I'm older and I think a lot of the things we're seeing now are because of things the military, FBI and government in general learned during the '60's so they could prevent anything that would prevent them from doing what they want.   Then we had Daniels Ellsburg and now Bradley Manning.   We sort of had a free press back then. 
Also, the FBI's reaction to OWS that was in the news at the beginning of the year and the threats to have their leaders killed shows they will do everything they can to suppress anything that could gain traction with people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think that we're being targeted by the military's persona mgmt guys
and others and also that Reddit has changed.

       It was a dumb rule though, imagine if there was a crises like the Boston bombing and someone who was at the scene and a witness had some damning facts to share but was never a reddit user. They created an account to post the info they had but they were unable to post it on this sub reddit cause of the dumb 30 day rule garbage.

       A 30 day rule is not silencing them. Lots of good forum have that rule to prevent trolling. But keep pretending like your freedom of speech was revoked because your 5 day account couldn't access conspiracy.

       In the wake of something like Boston, how can you not see that this 30 day policy is an attempt to prevent the spread of useful information?  The influx of new accounts is in part trollers and such, yes, but I would have to think the majority are here to find answers.  It makes perfect sense to see new accounts popping up, people are coming here in droves, some to be douches, but most because the public if very concerned about the Boston narrative not making sense and a total lack of evidence implicating the brothers.

       Most people aren't ashamed or care about about their usernames to avoid posting here... mostly trolls are the ones creating it so they can spread misinformation.

       Not saying that you are troll but rather the fact that we don't have any other method of doing this properly and this is the best possible method to avoid trolls. Ignoring them isn't enough.

       the 30 day limit wasn't about silencing certain users it was about stopping troll spam. There is no point in this place if it's overrun by arseholes, why would you want that if there was an option that may have prevented it?

       Of course it would, if someone comes here just to insult people you ban them, previously they could create a new account and do it right again which would make a lot of work for the mods. If they had to wait 30 days it would kill it dead and gradually people would stop being arseholes because it wouldn't be worth it.

       You're not understanding the mentality of the people that would do that in the first. if they're that committed to trolling, they are likely to do it with an account not linked to their personal account. Which means they know they can have multiple accounts. Which means they're more likely to have access to a multitude of accounts. There are programs that allow one to create multiple accounts with ease. All of reddit knows that your account is more legit if it wasn't just created. So a dedicated troll will already have accounts at their beck and call, and may in fact field multiple accounts at once to upvote what they deem worthy and mass downvote opposition.

       Reddit in its entirely is overrun by assholes, they just get downvoted and ignored.  This sub in particular is very time sensitive and having to wait 30 days to ask a pertinent question or make a useful post is completely destructive to the whole purpose of the sub.  This, especially in the wake of something like Boston.  Waiting 30 days is like waiting a lifetime, imagine how the Boston narrative will change in the next 30 days.  If you ask me, the waiting 30 day policy sounds highly suspicious, its exactly the type of rule that would be put in place to try to silence people in hope that they will forget their train of thought in 30 days.

       This is not true. I've been coming to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       for 2 years and only recently have I seen such an increase in the kind of

       </a>
       insulting type comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was clearly a concerted effort from somewhere to disrupt this place because obnoxious condescending comments that would usually be downvoted by the regular users of this sub were near the top on every thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       You talk about something suspicious, well this was suspicious and totally undermined civil open-minded discussion when people were being insulted just because of their theories/opinions.

       What proportion of the valuable posts were coming from people under 30 days compared to the trolls that had accounts for under 30 days? I'd say you'd get a much greater net benefit from limiting the trolls than would be lost from not have very new users comment.

       I see your point, but I stick by mine.  Ignore the fucking trolls!  They will go away eventually.  The good, valuable posts are still being made, so we have to sift through some shit at times, its better than having people silenced.  Time is of the essence, we cannot take away our liberties to prevent trolls, its exactly the kind of policy that I believe this sub is supposed to be fighting against.

       I would normally agree with you but their behaviour especially when their comments were being pushed to the top has a negative impact on everyone on the sub especially new users and is seriously detrimental to the sub. Who wants to put an idea out there if they will simply be ridiculed for it?
      </p>
      <p>
       It creates an insidious form of self-censorship where users won't say certain things for fear of being downvoted/insulted and changes the atmosphere from being open, questioning, and inquiring to hostile and closed.

       After every major event (ie, boston) there is an influx of new posters. Most of them don't agree with most conspiracists. I believe many come here because the idea of victims being paid actors is such an affront to common decency that they just can't believe people actually feel that way.

       This isn't true, there's a massive variety of information and topics with varying degrees of credibility, from the totally out there theories to evidence backed facts. You can't generalise the entire sub.

      <p>
       You green sky analogy isn't fair, the facts on many issues are not as clean cut and unequivocal as the sky being blue. For a lot of issues although many would proclaim to know the "truth" they actually have no clue, that pertains to conspiracy theorists and everyone else.

      <p>
       There is no place where everyone knows the sky is blue. Most of us are getting it wrong most of the time because we don't know all the facts but at least there are some gems of truth amongst the bullshit conspiracy.

       Yet anything that comes from any official source is dismissed without a trial. Not a single person on this sub can admit that they're wrong about anything they believe, even when confronted with evidence, in fact the evidence is never even considered because it doesn't fit their narrative, irony indeed.

       It's like trying to have an argument with a creationist. They start from a foregone conclusion, and only work from the data that supports that conclusion. That is extremely poor skepticism.

       Obviously this is a problem for some people here but I'd say that issue exists on the other side as well. Often those who proclaim themselves skeptics take the official story as fact without any burden of proof then simply attack those who question it. All the burden of proof is on the conspiracy side and their aim is sorely to undermine anything that isn't the official narrative. They aren't skeptical about the official story yet they're skeptical of those who question it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same behaviour exists on all sides because it's human nature to want definitive answers, people don't like to admit they don't know about something and get very emotionally attached to arguments so they'll rigidly stick to them even when they're wrong.

       I think the biggest problem is the overarching umbrella of conspiracy. I'm well aware that conspiracies exist, but I also don't believe in "crisis actors", "chemtrails" and "The Illuminati" and think it's silly and those are the kinds of ideas, along with actively harassing people on other subs that draw people to troll on here, hell, it's what lead me to
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I don't think the simple act of asking a poster to provide evidence for an extraordinary claim should be called "shiiling" or "supporting the narrative" - those are just terms for dismissing an uncomfortable question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I've seen accusations of
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       being "funded" which is just as silly as accusing
       <a href="/r/ShitRedditSays">
        /r/ShitRedditSays
       </a>
       <a href="/r/subredditdrama">

       or
       <a href="/r/circlebraveryjerk">

       Maybe you're right, maybe all the trolls are disgruntled former conspiracy theorists who rightfully had issues with a lot of the behaviour here. I'm sure that's a factor but I have no idea how much.

       My gut feeling is that whoever is funding /rconspiratard has aimed at destroying /conspiracy because, although not all questions here were rational, enough people were coming uncomfortably close to the truth on some things to embarrass powerful people or agencies.

       All the troll comments I've seen typically get downvoted, while those users who post appropriately tend to float to the top of threads.  Also I haven't seen any racist comments...  Maybe they were all downvoted before I could see them..  All one must do is provide a thought out theory with a few sources to back their claim.  What you're likely witnessing is people aren't providing sources, and expect people to believe their theory.  Then when we don't believe we're called a "shill/troll/disinfo agents."  Do you expect users to not reply to such an accusation?  That's one thing happening here..
      </p>
      <p>
       So, to conclude my post.  Those who are actually trolling typically are downvoted on this sub.  If a person makes a thought out post and supplies sufficient sources they are rewarded with upvotes.  I've been frequenting this sub for over a year, and I've never seen a well constructed argument w/ sources get downvoted here.  I think a lot of users are just making this drama because users don't believe your sourceless theories.  :\

       True, but people here are so easily provoked by people who aren't even trying to start anything. All I had  to do is say something factual about science just to inform a person of something interesting (not even trying to prove ANY point) and someone told me to GTFO as if I was saying the OP was wrong etcetc. I was not even remotely hostile or accusatory. Everyone else here has been civil to me, but I've stayed in the bombing threads so I have a feeling I'm amongst the same subset of people for the most part.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be fair, maybe posters are just on heightened alert because of the increase in users and are really defensive. Can't fault people for that, but it does kind of limit anything intelligent when you run into a brick wall in terms of people being willing to throw ideas back and forth.

       I think that is part of the problem. I don't think the people doing that are "legitimate users".
      </p>
      <p>
       Theres 2 ways to look at it. Either it's a user that think he's legitimate but at the moment they pull of the one liner no content shill calling they are just as bad if not worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The otherway to look at it is that some of those shill calling posts are made by people who are trolling or trying to discredit the place, pretending they are what people think is a legitimate user and post all this shill calling bullshit in order to get others riled up against them.

       I think r/conspiracy was doing too good a job, getting too close to the truth, to be allowed to exist. The power players bombarded donbueno with pressuring, and got what they wanted.

       This is all because of the olive garden shit. That troll spree was coordinated and admin supported, and hit every single sub that it was discussed in. Reddit is trying to avoid being digg while still monetizing the site, but I personally don't think it'll work.

       I think having a funeral for r/conspiracy is a bit premature. There has definitely been a big increase in hostile combatants since the Boston bombing which to me is more evidence that it was likely a manipulated event.

       It has been pretty amazing to watch r/conspiracy the last few weeks after Boston. It confirms the theory that shills are actively trying to undermine conversation on these types of sites, even more so after a questionable event like Boston occurs that gets people talking. Don't feed the trolls. Ignore them, they are only trying to distract.

       Quit bitching and bounce already. You can't censor a sub dedicated to freedom. 9000sins made a stupid decision. He went against everything this sub stands for. I applaud donbueno for his actions.

       I think the issue is that not everyone believes in the same stuff. One persons conspiracy is another persons idea of crazy and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another problem is someone might not believe in a conspiracy today, but they might tomorrow, but since they don't believe today the accusers will label them as troll/shills and drive them away and hurt the cause.

       Notice how literally the ONLY comments getting upvoted are trolltastic retorts that support the MSM agenda?

       I don't think it's that bad. Like sure there are far more shills, but think about it, there will always be after a big event like this happens. The reason this sub grew so much so fast is because we had Newton, Sandy Hook, L.A., and now Boston. it does blow my mind though how certain things supporting what we've been saying for years make it to the front page via r/politics, but then when our community says it (or says it years before for that matter), we don't know anything. It's fucked up because the same article would be bashed on r/conspiracy but not on r/politics. These people are fucking retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I say just stay man. For the most part the real people on here recognize eachother. And even new people, we can kinda tell what their motives are after a few comments. However I will support any sub this community makes including this one.

       I've literally been on r/politics for the last few weeks commenting "saw it on r/conspiracy yesterday" and actually getting a few upvotes, people are starting to wake up, The thing I hate about this sub is when you post a question to get a conversation going and then getting down voted to hell, I thought this would be a good place to throw ideas around and see what sticks.

       You're getting downvoted by the very people who are saying r/conspiracy is dead..  They aren't open to discussion, and most of the time won't provide you with a source.  On the other hand they have no problem calling you or me a shill for questioning their theory.

       It's just CSS to hide the downvote arrow. You can't actually disable downvotes. If they did that, you can just go to your settings and disable custom CSS. It also wouldn't apply to mobile users.

       There are ways mods can make their subs not have a downvote option, and only an upvote option. The problem is that it doesn't work on mobile devices, so technically no, there is no way to fully remove downvotes.

       honestly dude, speak your mind and who cares if people think you're a shill. And yes you are right. I notice a lot of people being called shills when they haven't done anything. I think it's because there are those in the conspiracy community with reason, and logic... and then those with paranoia and schizophrenia.

       When you say trolls, do you also include in your definition of troll those who are trolling by posting conspiracy theories they pretend to believe in?

       edit: because I'm sure plenty of people would get a kick out of getting you guys to go along with the theories they make up, along with getting a kick out of annoying/harassing those who try to present rational arguments against their theories.

       One of the biggest problems with the shills/trolls/whatever they're called is they believe each and everyone of us believes in each and every incident is a conspiracy. It doesn't work that, however THEY BELIEVE each and everything TPTB tell them. Who's doing the critical thinking and who's doing NO thinking at all??

       Yup, has become a bunch of really rude jerks on here, I created my own seb a while back you are all welcome to come there (I honestly don't do any modding but, there are like only 30 subscribers, so if a lot of people come I would have to find some decent people to mod):

       As someone who just recently visited the sub, it sure doesn't feel like a "conspiracy theorist" sub... The funny part is, it sort of felt a bit more "at home" just before the Boston events.

       In general, the atmosphere on reddit seems a bit childish and presumptious for me (just asking for downvotes, I know), but I pull some great stuff from it on the other hand.

       And here's the new narrative. The original plan to disturb the sub has been subverted so now it's "let's create another sub!" to go along with all the other private conspiracy subs out there, further fragmenting the conversation. Just like reddit as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Divide and conquer is a old tactic, but an effective one. You want to take your ball and go home? What about standing up for what you believe and making your voice heard? That's what actual conspiracy researchers do.  Last I checked, donbueno wasn't the mod that was willing to arbitrarily change the posting rules of this sub to put a chill on conversation with no discussion whatsoever. But no, now we have a bunch of people talking about how bad donbueno is because he squashed what any first year moron could see was a bad idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Downvote, report, ignore. When those don't work, contact a mod. if you're not in the habit of doing those things, you have no room to talk about how this sub is dead and "We need another one". You've been complicit in it's destruction the whole time, Judas.

       It seems like the moderators were fairly heavy with the ban hammer lately and the 30 day rule might not have worked, but I don't think a subreddit, especially one like r/conspiracy, can work with no moderators. My two cents.

       Thank you for the lead.  And though some people are saying the shills won by fragmenting things, it is also true that if there are more places to discuss what is truth, the more resources the operatives have to expend against inquiry.

       How 'in' to Reddit and the hive mind are you that you choose to eulogize the 'loss' of a sub?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pathetic. Share your point of view and look for the value in some of the other points of view that are shared.

       Come on, man! Don't give up that easy, you have to soldier up and beat this problem with honor and the ideals you value. How else will you see any change in the world if you don't work towards it? I would hate to see people that care about changing the problems with the world fall prey to their own defeatist attitudes.

       We should have it where groups on this sub reddit meet in real life in their different cities and regions where possible and have meetings about the sub reddit.

       No I'm not an agent trying to flush out dissidents. I just think the fact that things are entirely behind computer screens leads to a downturn in the quality of the discourse on here...ie trolls and shills etc and it's easier to build trust face to face.

       I don't think there were any shills... just people who saw an opportunity to troll.  They see a group of people passionate about something, and decided to troll them.  That's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this coup we just had in
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       sure as hell looks suspicious to me.  We've always had trolls, but I don't think 1 mod ever declared martial law here and started going crazy with mod powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks to me like we got the cointel treatment.  Leadership gone, everyone else is infighting with eachother.  I guess when a sub grows as fast as this one did, and covers the topics this one covers, you can't be too surprised that it became a target.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the good thing about reddit is there's nothing stopping a new conspiracy subreddit popping up.  Hell, every couple months someone makes a self post about changing the name of this one anyway.

       If it makes you feel any better I am sure it will die down once people forget/stop caring about the bombers. You guys seriously have NOT seen this before after a major event? I find that hard to believe. I was brought here out of curiosity, I've seen other new members say the same. I've seen other people also say that this does happen periodically when something big happens in the MSM.

       They have the right to free speech but they should not be surprised when people laugh at their nutty and paranoid ideas. They have the right to be crazy and people have the right laugh at them.

       Mocking new ideas and running downvote brigades is against the right to open discussion. it implies you know better than then others and have the right to shut them up. That's kind of totaiitarian. Throughout history some people with new ideas that ended up being right were attacked by those with a vested interest in maintaining the old order.

       Conspiracy, take this confession as a parting gift to you..... direct from the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency (or IS IT?).
      </p>
      <p>
       We take care of the evil in the world, so you can live in paradise. The people in this forum are all good men.... and they know there is evil out there....  they just don't realize that most of what they now enjoy is the result of us being able to eliminate that evil over time.... We are not there to fight you, and you are not here to fight us.  We are in a much greater position to fight the evil in the world than you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are very few evil people on conspiracy boards. You wont see people calling for violence or terrorism.... They are genuine good people, who are confused about what the real evil in this world is. The real evil is in countries where isolation and poor living conditions drive a man to such hunger... that he enters a state of survival... of us vs. them.... of evil.... And granted these conditions are very rare now, with a little encouragement they can easily manifest in reality..... Thats what we are trying to fight....  These conspiracy/hungry people, can after all, be easily fooled by illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Thats what you can fight and actually fucking help us for once.
       </strong>
       Go out and join the peace corps! Join a church mission.
       <strong>
        BELIEVE IN SOMETHING GOOD FOR ONCE!!!
       </strong>
       Or, if you want to fight evil and you want to see how sophisticated it actually is..... Come and join us at the CIA, or the FBI, or the DoD (or one of our many contractors). Or if you really wanna get dirty and fight evil, go join the armed services... become a soldier. All these places are chop full of the smartest people you never knew existed. Trying to do good in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is evil out there... its the evil of hungering. And we're trying ever so slowly to make this world a place that can feed and maintain all of our brothers and sisters. There is nothing but sober, benevolent minds in our ranks.
       <strong>
        Please... get off our ass.

       What i mean is that shills who try and dissuade people, who try to use the tactics mentioned on the right sidebar here in this sub will be banned immediately. Discussions are ALWAYS WELCOME except those that are ON TOPIC and try to go DEEPER to uncover the truth. Pretty much how this sub was back in the old days before the BS and paid shills took over.

       I think that is part of the problem. I don't think the people doing that are "legitimate users".
      </p>
      <p>
       Theres 2 ways to look at it. Either it's a user that think he's legitimate but at the moment they pull of the one liner no content shill calling they are just as bad if not worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The otherway to look at it is that some of those shill calling posts are made by people who are trolling or trying to discredit the place, pretending they are what people think is a legitimate user and post all this shill calling bullshit in order to get others riled up against them.
