        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">317</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-04-26 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Flytape.html">Flytape</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A month or two ago, the mods of this subreddit sent out a call for volunteers to help moderate this subreddit.</p>

<p>I was one of you who answered that call, I had offered my services before but there wasn&#39;t a great enough need so I remained one of you.  This time was different, the need was great, members of this once great forum were being targeted and harassed for nothing more than sharing an idea.</p>

<p>You guys voted for me, you also voted for <a href="/u/englishmunichfan">/u/englishmunichfan</a> and <a href="/u/weedtastic">/u/weedtastic</a>.  The three of us had overwhelming support from this community, that we had earned your trust.  We were one of you and clearly invested in the community and tuned into its needs.</p>

<p>We started to enforce the rules that existed before our election, we all had different styles. Mine was perhaps the loudest, I gave public warnings distinguished in green mod text.  I was loud so that the community could hear me, that I cared and was trying to change to aggressive and oppressive nature of this community.</p>

<p>Many of you messaged me privately, and thanked me for shifting the collective attitude of this subreddit.  A few of you scolded me for warning people about personal attacks.  The net perception was positive.  People started to see a change, the situation was improving.</p>

<p>The trolls responded in kind, they increased their efforts to drown us in hatred and beat us into submission.  You see them here now celebrating their victory.  They began to cross post the worst of our comments to <a href="/r/Boston">/r/Boston</a> to bring in emotionally traumatized people, knowing the clash of ideas would create drama.  Then they linked their drama to <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a> and they knew we would be overwhelmed with random trolls who just wanted a good laugh.</p>

<p>They started a campaign against flytape because I was the loudest.  After a few weeks we had identified and banned many of the worst trolls main accounts and they were forced to make new ones.  They tried to flood us with as many new accounts as they could manage.  Then we hatched our plan to set a 30 day restriction on new accounts, we recruited a coder who was equipped for the task.  </p>

<p>We did all of this to preserve the spirit of this community.</p>

<p>The mod who undid it all hasn&#39;t even been here in a year, hasn&#39;t even been on reddit in 3 months.  He claimed there was no vote, there was a desperate effort by the active mods to find a solution to our new problem.  There was 2 weeks of debate and discussion before we rolled out the 30 day period.  This new mod wasn&#39;t a part of the consensus reached because he wasn&#39;t an active member.</p>

<p>We tried, we were succeeding.  But all of our efforts have now been undone.  The titan mod who has been quiet for a year decided that he knows better than an elected staff of people like you.  These titans happen to be mods on many other large subreddits.  This one only recently became large enough to harvest.</p>

<p>Welcome to the new <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where the trolls are welcome.  You are now free to be publicly marginalized by a jury of your peers (who happen to all be the same person wearing 20 different masks).  You will now help to solidify the MSMs narrative that people who question anything are insane.  That you&#39;re dangerous and months, weeks maybe days away from committing an act of terror.  </p>

<p>I wish you all the best of times.  </p>

<p>I fought for you guys.  I even saw a few trolls change into reasonable people once the rules were enforced.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing you don&#39;t understand is that the reddit admins do not interfere with subreddits.</p>

<p>The only reason why they allow ridiculous, insane racists to post here is because of their free speech policy. This is the same policy that allows Holocaust-denial subreddits like <a href="/r/Holocaust">/r/Holocaust</a> to stay open.</p>

<p>If the admins made you mods and removed the original mods, they would be breaking this rule. So the same reason why reddit did nothing while you refused to get rid of maniacs like <a href="/u/tttt0tttt">/u/tttt0tttt</a> is the same reason why you won&#39;t be a mod here again unless the ones who removed you changed their minds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh; sorry, hmmm... all I know is thus:  if you look at the mod section, there is a heiarchy.  The mods have power over the mods listed below them.  Illuminatedwax has always been at the top since I have been here, so that makes him the most powerful.  The one below him (can&#39;t spell his name) has always been second I think.   So he had the power to remove all mods below him.</p>

<p>R/conspiracy was working to that end...until the great mod cleansing. Those five or so mods would likely disagree with you. </p>

<p>Not to say they didn&#39;t have any issues, just needed time to work out the kinks. It started well with the active participants voting them in. Ended poorly with the unilateral mod cleansing. </p>

<p>&quot;They are free to express whatever they want but they can&#39;t do it at the expense of ours.&quot; - At the expense of yours? Care to elaborate? To me that still sounds like they are free to express whatever/comment on whatever; unless you disagree with what they are saying, and in that case they lose all rights to comment. </p>

<p>Just because what they are saying is stupid, or specifically designed to get a rise out of you, doesn&#39;t make it okay to silence them. </p>

<p>Be the bigger person and ignore them. Pretty simple solution. </p>

<p>Edit: My original comment was mostly to make fun of the people who are taking this so seriously, and now I feel as though I am becoming one of the people who I was trying to make fun of. So I will let you respond and then offer my final rebuttal and then be done with it... So make it good.</p>

How do people maintain their accounts after doxxing, threatening doxxing, abusing their modship and even in one case I know of being a known FBI informant of subs like Anonymous and Occupy Wall St. You and the other mods either recently elected or were longer term did a good job. The discussion was allowed to flow, trolls and troll posts were removed and you contributed in a meaningful way. Yes, there has been trolls here and are still are here that have no intention of debunking or entering into a debate, they only want to cause a great deal of shit for people who come here to share ideas irrespective of who thinks they are crazy or not.</p>

<p>If you had an interest and frequented a sub where you wanted a discussion and suddenly had a large amount of people using ad hominem attacks and weak attempts at undermining the community, what would you do or what would you want done about it? I&#39;m all for views of different kinds but intentional trolling is not a discussion or sharing of ideas.</p>

<p>I understand that trolls have flooded this sub, but the more we argue about it, the more we feed them, the more they x-post these problems to <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">/r/SubredditDrama</a> or <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, and the more they ROFL from their success.

<p>Edit: contents of my message:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There has been <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1d5lzm/conspiracy_rising_how_this_community_elected_new/">a bit of a stir</a> of late regarding certain high-ranking subreddit mods that have no interest in the community interfering in community-elected mod work. I cannot speak for the rest of r/conspiracy, but it does not sit well with me that simply having been someplace for the longest period of time grants any user of any subreddit ultimate dominion over what is said and done there. It is with that thought in mind that I request all of the r/conspiracy mods be removed from their positions, and an election for new mods be held.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists of the world, believers in the hidden hands of the Rothschilds and the Masons and the Illuminati, we skeptics owe you an apology. You were right. The players may be a little different, but your basic premise is correct: The world is a rigged game. We found this out in recent months, when a series of related corruption stories spilled out of the financial sector, suggesting the world&#39;s largest banks may be fixing the prices of, well, just about everything.&#39;</p>

<p>The problem is the noise/truth ratio. </p>

<p>Simply saying &quot;there is some corruption in private sector&quot; doesn&#39;t mean the &#39;crazies&#39; were right. Were the &#39;crazies&#39; talking about Libor before it broke, for example? No, they were talking about &quot;those damn jews&quot; and fucking clouds in the sky.</p>

<p>Shit, can you point to a specific story that was talked about before it broke? I can tell you right now that there is still corruption in politics and the financial sector, that is way too vague to have any use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with donbueno.   trolls and shills will always be here.  </p>

<p>some of us have honed our argument skills on them, iron sharpening iron.  They also bring visibility to the issues they focus on.. for example &#39;crisis actors&#39; is a REAL sensitive topic with them and prone to heavy barrages of downvotes.. so what?  I&#39;m used to ordering comments and submissions by controversial.. that comes with the territory.</p>

<p>without shills and trolls, r/conspiracy would be more of an echo chamber.   so they attack the sub.. all subs eventually get raided.  I&#39;m surprised that the mods would try to fight this with heavy handedness.</p>

<p>The science of evil (Ponerology) suggests an entirely different approach to dealing with this.. mainly to &#39;not feed the trolls&#39; they will get bored not getting the rise they want.   </p>

<p>The 30 day limit actually puts more power in the trolls/shills since they have many alts that are &gt;&gt;30 days old.   Meanwhile the posters that change names often do so for a reason, and will be excluded, mainly by brigade downvoting.  It leaves a game where the aggressives win.</p>

<p>I would have preferred a discussion with the users before coming down with this.  I think the move was poorly thought out, shows weakness, alienates users that change ID&#39;s and generally reacts to these jokers exactly as they crave.   </p>

<p>my $0.02..  </p>

<p>p.s I was banned and had comments deleted in that thread, and I apologize for reacting badly, but really being told explicitly to leave a subreddit if I don&#39;t like it was too much.  I had a 3 day old account, and you can see the kind of discrimination it leads to.   It&#39;s analogous to profiling <em>all</em> muslims as terrorists, when only the majority are.. (j/k)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not at all convinced it was a move to make the sub <em>better</em>. It&#39;s so shortsighted, it&#39;s almost impossible someone with good intentions felt it was a good idea. 3 days? 5 days? 7 days? Okay. I still disagree, but that&#39;s reasonable. </p>

<p>30 days is death for this sub. That&#39;s easy to see if you have any level of regular participation. </p>

To ban it for reasons other than inappropriateness goes up against the concept behind this sub.

<p>Disingenuous. He pointed to evidence that the current mods were deleting and banning based on conflicts with their PERSONAL PREFERENCES and not the sub bylaws. </p>

<p>And in fact, the only attention the mods ever got before this whole kerfluffle was in regards to their constant fuckery and how much it sucked to have them doing that. </p>

<p>Then they get removed and here comes the outpouring of support. Where were you guys when mods like 9000sins were getting maligned on the regular in this sub?</p>

<p>This whole incident has been very enlightening about just how many readers on this sub are suspect. 90% of the usernames I&#39;m seeing are new to me and I&#39;m on here every day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flytape, I would PM this to you but I think transparency is important. Honestly as a mod I found you a bit heavy handed. All the warnings about personal attacks, I understand why but at the same time in this type of community moderation should kinda be at a minimum. That said, you were passionate and that only comes from a place of caring. I know this stuff matters to you and I respect that. You honestly do care and it shows. Thanks for the work you did even when I didn&#39;t agree with all of it.</p>

<p>I read this sub constantly, always refreshing the new to see whats current. I&#39;m fascinated by this kind of stuff have been since I was a boy. I&#39;ve never found a conspiracy community anywhere online as lively as this one and now it seems we&#39;re flooded with trolls and shills and forum sliders. Now moderation abuse it seems. Well what can we do. A new private sub? Limits on when people can post?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a solution except the one I use in daily life. Accept the reality that everything is fucked and solider on. It&#39;s only when these ideas start to get traction that they meet resistance. If there is opposition its only because the ideas presented here have merit. This community is 100,000 strong. If a new sub need to be created to get the kind of moderation this sub deserves rest assured that you&#39;ll have me subscribing to that sub and I don&#39;t imagine I&#39;ll be the only one.</p>

<p>I come here for information and ideas I can get nowhere else. I come here to discuss with the like minded these concepts. I should hope that whatever the outcome of the recent events here that this community will continue with the same passion and hunger for the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why this is ridiculous is because you set this precedent where you ban people for racism. But you allow people who say &quot;all Ashkenazi are psychopaths&quot; to post here. Therefore you selectively enforce this rule.

    <div class="md"><p>I have no problem with Flytape, in fact he/she has been one of the best mods but I don&#39;t want it to be in one persons hands. Rather than the possibility of one person having all the power, the idea of shared power can mitigate any underhanded tactics to gain control and turn it into a free for all. Its happened in many other subs. Some of the SRS mods have gained control of other subs and dish out personal attacks and bans at anyone that brings a view they don&#39;t personally align with. Flytape for that very reason will understand why one mod (including the one now) is not a good idea not only for this sub but for any sub.</p>

I sincerely hope you regain modship along with the other mods that have done a good job so far.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for explaining that.  I&#39;ve never had a problem with the mods...on the contrary, I would message them and point out the obvious trolls.  I was watching as trolls would get banned, they would show up again with a different mask.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t like the idea of preventing comments for a month for new users.  I thought it would punish legitimate newbies who just wanted to be a part of the conversation, or might have some good material they wanted to bring to life.  With that said, I never believed it would lead to this.  </p>

<p>Now the trolls are dancing in the streets, free to destroy any form of honest and open debate.  Was there no middle ground that the supermod could come to with the mods? </p>
