       Ok. Theorists know without question the Vatican is a tax haven for the world elite and has had their hands in funding plenty of regimes that Jesus would have...plagued or miracled or
       <em>
        cynical Christianity joke
       </em>
       . Now my question, is what the hell does it mean that the new Pope is...well...kind of incredibly awesome, as far as anyone can seem to account? I don't believe it was a slip and the elite simply let a good'un sneak in unnoticed. There's gotta be something else behind this, the Vatican is too valuable as a propaganda and financial tool for the elite to give up because the Pope found God, as it were. It's still one of only 3 cities that share it's separation from the country it resides in, the others being D.C. and London. WHAT IS THEIR PLAY?

       Your question is exactly mine and I can't wrap my head around it for some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think right now it's a matter of trying to be Good Guy Church Image and nothing else. Right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later on, once TPTB have decided they have calmed the waters around their tax-pit enough, the Jesuit enforcer is going to be revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my honest opinion, the man is an actor, like Obama, like so many global 'leaders' nowadays. Selected, not elected, because they will play the game dictated to them and say the right things about the right topics at the right times.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, I don't -- and no rational person should-- suddenly believe that the church is now all of sudden about helping the poor and homeless and persecuted.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is and always will be about what everything else is, all the time in every paradigm-- money and power and money and power.

       Of course. But the question is where the gain is in this. The more that man speaks the more damage he does their cause. He has attacked some of the same points of modern Catholicism that we love here on r/Conspiracy, particularly the illogical correlation between Christians and economic conservatives, and the fact that the Vatican is a golden monument of excess, leading a church started by a homeless hippy jew. The guy is attacking some points that the elite have spent billions of dollars and years of work creating and maintaining. It's super sketchy to me man.

       The Catholic Church is in some way the only global "grass roots" organization that can act as a clearing house of aid, goods, services and money. You put the Vatican in the same place as the WorldBank and SWIFT, well, I suspect they are of a different wood.

       Also,
       <em>

       they indeed are all conspiring together, then it would be handy to have a backup system that does not rely on money, as everything else does.

       The idea of damaging your own cause to establish credibility, and then using that credibility to manipulate later on (often in the opposite direction) is a tried and true propaganda technique.

       There are very clearly factions in the world.  I think we can all agree that the Jesuits exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who are the powerful Jesuits in the US?  Maybe seeing who has had control over the white house for about 20 of the last 50 years will point you in the right direction.

       Yup, this new pope is just another agent in a long line of luciferian deceptions. They won't have to force the NWO on most people because agents like this will have people lapping it up.

       I'm very, very leery of this pope.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm Christian, not Catholic (just differentiating, not trying to start an argument) but I try to keep my eyes open on all fronts.
      </p>
      <p>
       As time moves on, religion keeps getting pushed away and more and more it's vilified.  But all of the sudden, here comes a pope that people (even atheists) are saying is really cool!  WHAT?!
      </p>
      <p>
       I find him to be saying what the masses want to hear, to give himself credibility later on should he take a different direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like it.  I've never liked the idea of one human being more important in God's eyes than the rest.  He is just a man.

       I'm not accusing the Pope of having any agenda. I like him, as of now. I'm accusing the global elite who actually have their hands more directly in the Vatican's money than the Pope, of having ulterior motives to allowing such a seemingly good candidate to take the position, because it interferes with
       <em>
        their
       </em>

       Well if they want a new world order they would need a world religion. If this guy is really being used, he is not interfering with their plan.
 Fade the boundaries between existing religions now so you can easily implement a new religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       A new religion, probably stating we had it all wrong. Perhaps they will use extraterrestrials. Check out project blue beam

       i can't figure it out either...just to float an idea (that's what reddit's about right?), any chance they put a genuinely good guy in the position in order to win over the skeptics, only to have him assassinated later to further a cause?  The amount of sentiment it would create would be incredible (conversely the backlash against the accused perpetrators would be just as strong)...just a thought.

       I already touched on that in the OP. My question was about the new Pope being socially responsible IN SPITE of everything we know about the Vatican's financial role in the world, and what it means.

       IMHO, the new pope is the new Chief Information Officer at the Bank of Vatican.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's all like "this shit has to be more covert. We're not going down with those bastards when the SHTF so we need contingency and less opulence (which equates to obviousness)."
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, he's doing better than last popes in curbing the excessiveness of the church. But the Vatican is and will always be a BANK. We know now that banking runs the whole show. That would make the Vatican one of the oldest "banking" institutions in the world. Think of what they have in those vaults of theirs!

       This pope is opening up the books of the Vatican bank!  What the hell are you people talking about?  There are two key factions at play here- the super elites (reptilians, illuminati, Rothschilds, freemasons, etc) who are basically the old moneyed interests of Rome and old Europe; and then there are the Jesuits, who were basically founded to fight those interests inside the church.  Now Benedict may not have been the best guy, and he was a wee bit of a Nazi, but one thing we can rely on the Nazis for is their hatred of central banks.  So he does the unthinkable, relinquishing his seat and pushing for the Jesuit bulldog to get it. There's a reason that the church never had a Jesuit pope before- they were  never this desperate.  The Vatican is a clubhouse, and there's a different faction in charge now.  With the superelites turning against the church, finally it might actually perform a useful checking function for society.

       You know...There are people in the world who actually want to help. I haven't believed in the church since catholic school. But this pope is different. He practices what he preaches. And that is a concept I believe in wholeheartedly. I find it nice that this pope has actually read the bible and appears to follow Jesus's teachings. If there were a conspiracy, it lies with his predecessor pope emperor palpatine.

       Just as satan is a deceiver, so is this pope. 
He is not following Jesus' footsteps in any way. He is twisting scripture and injecting his own teachings in its place. 
The devil doesn't come looking like a pointy eared and forked tailed red devil, he's an angel of light (deceiver).

       Well if they want a new world order they would need a world religion. If this guy is really being used, he is not interfering with their plan.
 Fade the boundaries between existing religions now so you can easily implement a new religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       A new religion, probably stating we had it all wrong. Perhaps they will use extraterrestrials. Check out project blue beam
