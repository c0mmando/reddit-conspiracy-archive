Theorists know without question the Vatican is a tax haven for the world elite and has had their hands in funding plenty of regimes that Jesus would have...plagued or miracled or <em>cynical Christianity joke</em>. Now my question, is what the hell does it mean that the new Pope is...well...kind of incredibly awesome, as far as anyone can seem to account? I don&#39;t believe it was a slip and the elite simply let a good&#39;un sneak in unnoticed. There&#39;s gotta be something else behind this, the Vatican is too valuable as a propaganda and financial tool for the elite to give up because the Pope found God, as it were. It&#39;s still one of only 3 cities that share it&#39;s separation from the country it resides in, the others being D.C. and London. WHAT IS THEIR PLAY?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your question is exactly mine and I can&#39;t wrap my head around it for some time. </p>

<p>I think right now it&#39;s a matter of trying to be Good Guy Church Image and nothing else. Right now. </p>

<p>Later on, once TPTB have decided they have calmed the waters around their tax-pit enough, the Jesuit enforcer is going to be revealed. </p>

<p>In my honest opinion, the man is an actor, like Obama, like so many global &#39;leaders&#39; nowadays. Selected, not elected, because they will play the game dictated to them and say the right things about the right topics at the right times.</p>

<p>In the end, I don&#39;t -- and no rational person should-- suddenly believe that the church is now all of sudden about helping the poor and homeless and persecuted. </p>

<p>It is and always will be about what everything else is, all the time in every paradigm-- money and power and money and power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course. But the question is where the gain is in this. The more that man speaks the more damage he does their cause. He has attacked some of the same points of modern Catholicism that we love here on r/Conspiracy, particularly the illogical correlation between Christians and economic conservatives, and the fact that the Vatican is a golden monument of excess, leading a church started by a homeless hippy jew. The guy is attacking some points that the elite have spent billions of dollars and years of work creating and maintaining. It&#39;s super sketchy to me man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. </p>

<p>The Catholic Church is in some way the only global &quot;grass roots&quot; organization that can act as a clearing house of aid, goods, services and money. You put the Vatican in the same place as the WorldBank and SWIFT, well, I suspect they are of a different wood.<br/>
Also, <em>if</em> they indeed are all conspiring together, then it would be handy to have a backup system that does not rely on money, as everything else does.</p>

<p>I&#39;m Christian, not Catholic (just differentiating, not trying to start an argument) but I try to keep my eyes open on all fronts.</p>

<p>As time moves on, religion keeps getting pushed away and more and more it&#39;s vilified.  But all of the sudden, here comes a pope that people (even atheists) are saying is really cool!  WHAT?!</p>

<p>I find him to be saying what the masses want to hear, to give himself credibility later on should he take a different direction.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like it.  I&#39;ve never liked the idea of one human being more important in God&#39;s eyes than the rest.  He is just a man.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMHO, the new pope is the new Chief Information Officer at the Bank of Vatican.</p>

<p>He&#39;s all like &quot;this shit has to be more covert. We&#39;re not going down with those bastards when the SHTF so we need contingency and less opulence (which equates to obviousness).&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, he&#39;s doing better than last popes in curbing the excessiveness of the church. But the Vatican is and will always be a BANK. We know now that banking runs the whole show. That would make the Vatican one of the oldest &quot;banking&quot; institutions in the world. Think of what they have in those vaults of theirs!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This pope is opening up the books of the Vatican bank!  What the hell are you people talking about?  There are two key factions at play here- the super elites (reptilians, illuminati, Rothschilds, freemasons, etc) who are basically the old moneyed interests of Rome and old Europe; and then there are the Jesuits, who were basically founded to fight those interests inside the church.  Now Benedict may not have been the best guy, and he was a wee bit of a Nazi, but one thing we can rely on the Nazis for is their hatred of central banks.  So he does the unthinkable, relinquishing his seat and pushing for the Jesuit bulldog to get it. There&#39;s a reason that the church never had a Jesuit pope before- they were  never this desperate.  The Vatican is a clubhouse, and there&#39;s a different faction in charge now.  With the superelites turning against the church, finally it might actually perform a useful checking function for society.</p>
