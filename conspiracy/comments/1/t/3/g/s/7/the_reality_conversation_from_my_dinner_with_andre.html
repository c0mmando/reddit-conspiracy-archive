Do you know a lot of New Yorkers who keep talking about the fact that they want to leave but never do?&quot;.. and I said &quot;oh yes&quot; and he said &quot;why do you think they don&#39;t leave?&quot;.</p>

<p>I gave him different banal theories, he said &quot;oh I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that way at all.&quot;.</p>

<p>He said &quot;I think that New York is the new model for the new concetration camp, where the camp has been built by the inmates themselves. And the inmates are the guards and they have this pride and this thing they built, they built their own prison. And so they exist in a state of Schizophrenia where they are both guards and prisoners and as a result they no longer have, having been lobotomized, the capacity to leave the prison they&#39;ve made, or to even see it as a prison.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point. In the US and EU and the former communist countries being recruited into the EU, the people are lured to big cities by the promise of jobs, leaving the country deserted. Most people are more and more concentrated in ugly urban areas. </p>

<p>This reminds me of how the communists did it differently. In fact one of the ten points of the communist manifesto was: Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country. </p>

<p>So they meant to spread industry throughout the country instead of concentrating it in a few cities. Now that communism is over, these smaller cities throughout the former Soviet Union are being emptied. Just as in the US small towns have been emptied across the country. </p>

<p>I think I prefer the commie way. More utopian but they implemented it. It wasn&#39;t just a dream.</p>
