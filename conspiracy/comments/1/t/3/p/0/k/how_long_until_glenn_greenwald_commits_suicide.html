<blockquote>
<p>Peter Goelz, the former managing director of the NTSB, the federal agency that investigates air crashes, is also named along with Monte Belger as a Vice President, Corporate Strategy, in U.S. Aviation Technology. </p>

<p>Goelz, at the NTSB from 1995 until 1999, personally supervised the investigations of TWA Flight 800, Egypt Air 990, the ValuJet crash in Miami, and the mysterious crash of the young John F. Kennedy&#39;s plane off the coast of Cape Cod.  There are many outstanding questions about what really happened to the aircraft involved in several of the high-profile cases that Goelz was involved in.</p>

<p>Peter Goelz, former managing director of NTSB, also oversaw the seriously flawed TWA 800 and Egypt Air 990 investigations.  The New York-born Goelz was a lobbyist for gambling interests in Kansas City prior to coming to the NTSB.  A political advisor and lobbyist, Goelz lacks any real expertise in accident investigation.  Prior to being appointed to the NTSB during the Clinton administration, Goelz was a political advisor in New Hampshire and a lobbyist for gambling interests in Kansas City.  I have not found anything in his resume that would make him a suitable candidate to oversee aviation accident investigations. </p>

<p>Some have questioned Edward Snowden&#39;s #2 spot on the Time list (just behind the winner Pope Francis). They say that nothing has actually changed. I say the very fact that we now know about these programs is a change whether they continue the programs or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greenwald is not to be trusted, he&#39;s definitely an asset.  Anyone who thinks otherwise should find out who invests in him and his cronies.  This whole Snowden situation is a way to bring in international control over the US.  Greenwald works with Soros funded groups, Laura Poitras is Soros funded and they both work with Human Rights Watch which pushes the UN&#39;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Article 29 section 3 of the UNDHR states that if you don&#39;t agree with the UN you have no rights.  Let that sink in slowly....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely wrong.  Snowden revealed nothing new that everyone didn&#39;t already know.  It was inconsequential information that had been leaked many times before.  Snowden was a way for the media to <em>announce publicly</em> what was going down so that other countries could go to the UN and say &quot;hey the US is spying on us we need international law and regulation(therefore government) to curb their spying&quot;, which happened.  Greenwald and Poitras work closely with the UN and several UN related NGOs not to mention billionaire George Soros.  The NSA <em>wanted</em> that information out.  Its kind of a way to tell everyone hey we&#39;re watching you.  Remember, the corporate media wouldn&#39;t be HANDING US INFORMATION if it was actually a threat to the establishment.  The media talked about Snowden and debated his actions constantly and continue to, which means there has been &quot;official&quot; approval.  Notice how the &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; have been talking about the NSA for a long time because a lot of whistleblowers have come out in the past and said everything that Snowden &quot;leaked&quot;.  Its all BS dude.  Its a media/establishment stunt to bring about big changes worldwide.  To make the US the boogieman so that the UN can be legitimized even more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re assumption is that the US wants to look good.  The end goal of all of this is world government.  The people in the US government are/have been complicit the entire time with the global government scheme.  Ever heard GHWB&#39;s &quot;New World Order&quot; speech?  They have to knock the US off of its high horse, bring in the UN &quot;laws&quot; and end national sovereignty.  You must not even be on &quot;level 1&quot; yet.

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh, you ARE slow aren&#39;t you?  You&#39;ve never SEEN THE BUSH VIDEO?  LOOK IT UP, youtube has 1000000 versions of the same video.  The elites who run the government want to bring down the Constitution and bring in their own Declaration of Human Rights, which I have stated before.  The goal is global government.  You have either not been paying attention or are a complete newb to the ideas presented in this sub, you also could be a 14 year old who has a very limited view of how the new world order is going to work.  China and India have been chosen as the new superpowers, NAFTA and all of the other &quot;free trade&quot; agreements made sure of that.  Those were state sponsored bills that sent industry scrambling for the exits.  Its no accident that the GDP and the wealth of the average US citizen has dropped.  If you knew anything about Agenda 21 you would know they are attempting to &quot;equalize&quot; the planet, by using money from &quot;wealthy&quot; countries to &quot;develop&quot; poor countries so that heavy industry can move in there and drive down wages even more while usurping the indigenous cultures in order to crate a global monoculture.  For fucks sake, the idiots who say &quot;source?&quot; all of the time are just lazy assholes who don&#39;t want to put in the leg work.  I&#39;ve been studying this shit for years and have a lot of clout on this sub because of that.  Anything that is on mainstream television is put there for a reason, they don&#39;t tell you news they tell you what they want you to know.  Snowden/Greenwald, those guys are working in conjunction with the elites to create friction on the world stage in order to bring in the UN regulations and global government, I cannot stress this enough.  Go do your own research if you don&#39;t believe me.  The shit is happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do truly sound like a tin foil hat wearer. When I ask for sources it&#39;s because I&#39;m interested in your reasoning. Your reasoning and sources are, of course, very necessary to back up the flow of accusations.</p>

<p>While some things are very obvious (like free trade agreements harming affluent countries while temporarily boosting third world countries), others are far less easy to accept like the two parties all being a part of this.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;ve taken the concept of the wealthy pulling the strings (which is very true) and expanded it beyond the realm of reality where everyone in government is complicit in this. The causes of many in government don&#39;t support this nor do many laws passed.</p>

<p>Like I said, I think you&#39;ve got a lot of answers and if you could only suspend your ego for a second to explain things rationally you could probably convince a lot of people. However, foaming at the mouth as you do isn&#39;t helping anybody.

<p>It doesn&#39;t take much research to find this information.  I&#39;m not going to do your legwork for you.  I also never said <em>everyone</em> in government is doing this.  I am pointing at the corporate media, the prominent politicians(the ones who appear ON the media who somehow get a platform over the hundreds of other politicians).  The two parties differ only slightly from each other, I know its hard to see through the rhetoric and the soap opera the media portrays but even as Ron Paul pointed out, they all agree on the fundamentals.  The large, multinational corporations who have their hands in every aspect of society are the funding source, they have no &quot;home country&quot; therefore have no national alliance.  They fund UN initiatives along with the big &quot;charitable&quot; foundations who have, since the early 1900s, been funding subversive education, media and fake &quot;grassroots&quot; movements to bring about the drastic changes in society we have seen since WW1.  I can&#39;t point to one source and it would take all night for me to line up links for you because there are so many.  Let me give you a good place to start.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a text excerpt from GHWB&#39;s New World Order Speech given on 9/11/90:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...A new partnership of nations has begun.</p>

<p>We stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. <strong>Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective -- a new world order -- can emerge: a new era -- freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace.</strong> An era in which <strong>the nations of the world, East and West, North and South, can prosper and live in harmony.</strong> A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace, while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor. Today that new world is struggling to be born, a world quite different from the one we&#39;ve known. A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak. <strong>This is the vision that I shared with President Gorbachev</strong> in Helsinki. He and other leaders from Europe, the Gulf, and around the world understand that how we manage this crisis today could shape the future for generations to come....</p>

<p>....<strong>We&#39;re now in sight of a United Nations that performs as envisioned by its founders</strong>.....</p>

<p>On 6 June 1992, six months after leaving office, <strong>the Rio Earth Summit civil society delegates appealed to Mikhail Gorbachev to create and launch Green Cross International.</strong> At the same time, Swiss National Council parliamentarian Roland Wiederkehr, founded a “World Green Cross” with the same objective. The organizations merged in 1993 to form Green Cross International.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Rio Earth Summit is where the Agenda 21 document was codified and signed by almost every nation on earth to form a global government from the bottom up.  I am the moderator over at <a href="/r/UNAgenda21">/r/UNAgenda21</a>  we document this shit happening DAILY.....</p>

<p>It would be nice to know what info he pulled from MIT servers... Just a supposition, but perhaps there was a lot of tech info on those servers thats mostly unknown to the masses? Maybe thats what he was trying to get out? </p>

<p>Just my opinion, </p>
