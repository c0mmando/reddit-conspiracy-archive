<p>It&#39;s not about you. It&#39;s really not. And BTW, are you threatening him with a ban? I don&#39;t think mods should abuse their powers like they&#39;re some kind of drug that feels good.</p>

<p>When a mod bans a user and the community wants that user back instead of the mod, something is not right. Then you are acually NOT contributing to the community. I suggest you rethink who you&#39;re banning, and what&#39;s best for the community, not what&#39;s best for the rules.</p>

<p>Now you are just incarcerating minorities because they had some pot on them.</p>

<p>But banning him is conducive to rational discussion??? If anything this whole debate about you and this ordeal is distracting and NOT conducive to rational discussion. In fact, more harm then good was done. /r/ conspiracy has a mob-mentallity when acting in a group, just as any other group. It will act with almost uncontrollable reactions, and individual members of this group can do nothing to stop it(alone). </p>

<p>If we boil down the situation to one guy who could have prevented it, it would be you. As an individual, do I have to blame r/conspiracy as the root to this specific incident? </p>

<p>Let me try to phrase it differently. If one guy could do anything about this whole deal, that would be you, right? Sorry for the unfitting rant, but this all seems upside-down to me.</p>
