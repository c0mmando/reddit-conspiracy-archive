        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When I was a kid, I believed that all humans were normal like me. I thought we were all alike, living on this planet, enjoying life, caring about our families and friends, and having fun in chosing what we want to do with our lives in constructive ways.</p>

<p>After I become aware that things on our planet were radically different, that humans are aliens to each other, because of religions mainly, or other cultural differences, and that some humans are capable of harming or killing other humans just for personal gain, or simply because their sick enjoyement.</p>

<p>Now, everytime I read about any exposed conspiracy I feel really depressed, every information i gather shows that our planet is a very dangerous place, not only people are capable to do horrible things to other people, but also parents are capable able to hurt, or kill their own children. I often wonder how much in danger me and my friends were by simply fooling aorund outside our houses as kids.</p>

<p>Sometimes I see people who think it is fun to talk about conspiracies, I don&#39;t know why, but this kind of people don&#39;t understand that we are all constantly in danger, they think it is fun because nothing still happened to them personally yet, I think this is stupid.</p>

<p>This is why sometimes I enjoy thinking about aliens. I have no clue if they exist, but thinking about an alien invasion, or aliens conspiring on our planet is somehow better than thinking that you can die because of other humans who are crazy.</p>

<p>If aliens were to fight us , it would be at least something you can think about easy, I have no problems being killed by aliens, because at least they are aliens, it would be something obvious and at least somehow rational. I believe aliens would win, because humans are mainly dumb and crazy.</p>

<p>Even if I have no clue about the existence of aliens, I still can think how they might be, based on facts that I have from basic knowledge about how life is on our planet. We are the most evoluted beings here, our brains are the most intelligent, and our bodies are rational.</p>

<p>This makes me think that if aliens exist, they must be somehow like us, if they have the intellectuial capacity to travel trough space, their minds are obviously evoluted, which means that their bodies must be rational as ours are. Which always makes me feeling good, because it makes possible that aliens are already living among us.</p>

<p>At least it makes me forget for a while that people are killing people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, good link. I have never heard about this guy before. He looks like someone who is genuinely willing to help others by sharing informations. Unfortunately I have become too much paranoid, so I don&#39;t trust nobody, not even him.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh you haven&#39;t heard of Corbett? He&#39;s a great guy, if you see more of his video&#39;s you&#39;ll notice he gives some great advice. </p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t agree with his politics, but if your looking for a semi-credible source of information it&#39;s good. Admittedly, it&#39;s always worth evaluating sources on your own merit. </p>

<p>If your trying to keep optimistic about the future I would suggest you keep three things in mind. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Success is worth striving for:</strong> You can&#39;t wait for a Shit Hits The Fan scenario to live an awesome life. Start living it today, work to be the person you want to be.</li>
<li><strong>Be social:</strong> I&#39;m not saying go become charlie sheen, but withdrawing from friends will only cripple your support network. Don&#39;t focus on &quot;informing them&quot;, they will ask. Be the friend you would want for yourself. </li>
<li><strong>Have a plan:</strong> You don&#39;t need a great plan. However a workable path forward will give you lots more motivation than someone waiting for times to get better. </li>
</ul>

<p>These aren&#39;t assumptions about you, just things I&#39;ve learned the not-so-fun-way. </p>

<p>Keep fighting the good fight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve exchanged a comment with you here and there. I find you to present yourself as a reasonable, curious, skeptical and courteous person. I want to help you with your depression. </p>

<p>Researching conspiracy theories or as I call it &#39;paying attention&#39; can be intellectually and emotionally exhausting. The Earth can appear to be a very fucked up place.</p>

<p>I beg you remember the subjective nature of morality. People kill people, dogs kill dogs, plants kill plants, and ants kill ants; life is a circle; everything is simultaneously shit from one thing and food for another. </p>

<p>Might I suggest reading some more light-hearted conspiracy theorists such as My Beloved Robert Anton Wilson, The Great George Carlin, or Buddy Boy Joe Rogan? (crack myself up.. &quot;buddy boy joe rogan...&quot;)</p>

<p>Rupert Sheldrake, Ram Dass, Graham Hancock, Terrence Mckenna, Timothy Leary... some more great authors to look into....</p>

<p>Oh sure you can&#39;t trust anyone, especially yourself. My Beloved R.A.W. can tell you a thing or two about the incompletedness of Belief Systems (B.S.)</p>

<p>Sorry this is so fragmented, I&#39;m about to doze off...</p>

<p>Aliens are transdimensional dude. Ingest some exogenous DMT and say &quot;hi&quot; to them for me. </p>

<p>Traveling through space in metal machines is wholly stupid in it&#39;s inefficiency. You can travel anywhere instantaneously if you leave behind the trappings of the body.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be afraid to get into New Age shit, just look out for panhandlers, and con artists.</p>

<p>I see that the meaning in life is in living. So live. We experience pain and pleasure because we can. So why not enjoy it? Or despair, whatever suits your concepts of fulfillment. You aren&#39;t happy? Change your concepts, or change your living.</p>

<p>The world is irrational. I choose to embrace it. 5 apples bets you didn&#39;t know you were a Pope of Discordia. (another R.A.W. reference)</p>

<p>Get illuminated. Join the Illuminatti. It&#39;s as easy as yoga. Hah, &quot;easy!&quot; seriously consider psychedelic shortcuts. </p>

<p>Shrooms were here first. 5&#39; tall fungi.</p>

<p>Just remember to kick back and have fun. Find your passion(s). Mine are lawlessness, mountain forest gardening, fucking with gender norms, children, and analingus. (&quot;analingus&quot; means &quot;talking out the ass&quot;, right?)</p>

<p>I am an alien. Again, everything is subjective. Reality is a verb. Change is the only constant. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t fear death. It&#39;s actually really cool. Not so cool that I&#39;d fuck over all my idiot friends and relatives to mourn me by an heroing. They&#39;re not really idiots, just idiotic for still being brainwashed to think that death is a sad thing.</p>

<p>My will is going ot have a clause about partying. Let the mead flow!!!</p>

<p>Mk. I probably read crazy right now. I hope it was intertaining. </p>

<p>P.S. Alex Jones is afraid to take psychedelics. That should tell you how open-minded and trusting he is. He&#39;s an unreliable source of information. Be an optimist and remain sleptical (honest slip of the fingers). Example: chemtrails. Yes I belive in them. But I deny their nefarious nature. Contrails most likely have chemicals in them and most certainly are fucking with the weather b/c they&#39;re mostly water and water is a leading greenhouse gas.</p>

<p>Besides. If we all die, we all get released from the prison planet that is Earth. Unless Matrix Trilogy.</p>

<p>Well its arguable that the truth is somewhere in the middle. Psychedelics are increasingly proven to be helpful for certain illnesses and conditions. So, to say there is absolutely zero healing capabilities would be a bit one sided.</p>

<p>i can agree with you on certain drugs, as in methamphetamine or crack cocaine for examples, but i guess where we differ is what we consider hard drugs versus what we consider soft drugs.</p>

<p>and as much as i agree with the healing capabikities of cannabis, it could also be detrimental to your health as well. There is a certain duality when it comes to drugs, and anything in life really. As i said, moderation is key. </p>

<p>There are good arguments for both sides. Cocaine for instance works very well as a topical anesthetic. But when in freebase form becomes something very addictive. Moderation and application make for good medicine. Abuse makes for terrible health consequences.</p>

<p>Whites need to understand that other races want to annihilate us. The only thing that holds them back is our superior war-making ability. They know we would wipe them out if they tried. But as soon as they sense that we are weak enough, they will move to erase us from the face of the Earth.</p>

<p>The Muslims, the Asians, the Negroes, the Jews -- they all want us dead. Unless you&#39;ve realized that, you are not in the real world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are saying bullshit. What you are trying to say is that every other race is against the white people. This is bullshit. Just cool down a little bit, and understand that we are all being imprisoned by the ruling elites in our own countries, who are willing to make us fight each other for no rational purposes. It is called divide and conquer, and it was invented in ancient times by evil people, who are still ruling our planet, because the majority of humans are all ignorant sheeple.</p>

<p>I believe bureacracy, i.e., institutionalization, is everything that is wrong with religion (and everything) today.</p>
