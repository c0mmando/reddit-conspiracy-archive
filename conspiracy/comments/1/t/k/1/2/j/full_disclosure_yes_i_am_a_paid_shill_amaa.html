<p>Redemption, of course, is possible to everyone regardless of their deeds.  However, the law of karma (the real one - not the Reddit kind) never, ever goes unpaid.  All this is to say that your soul will indeed most certainly get &quot;bought back&quot;, but it may not be in this life...and it may not be without a <em>lot</em> more effort and toil than you might have otherwise bargained for or anticipated.</p>

<p>These last few weeks I have created an account whose sole purpose was to amass the highest quantity of downvotes (my goal was -1000, this is why I antagonized <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>[11] , <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">/r/SubredditDrama</a>[12] and GMO subs) while speaking the absolute truth about everything I know, and having some laughs in the process. Since a lot of people give more importance to karma than the truth, this would be a good way to keep a low profile, not calling too much attention to myself from my colleagues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that was the case why did you lose arguments so badly and have several meltdowns where you spammed threads to sub-reddits and sent people abusive PMs? here&#39;s an example of you starting and then losing an argument - <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1t9gz6/active_thermitic_material_claimed_in_ground_zero/ce6plxs">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1t9gz6/active_thermitic_material_claimed_in_ground_zero/ce6plxs</a></p>

<p>Here is you having a meltdown and screaming at people who think GMOs aren&#39;t evil - <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/GMOMyths/comments/1tht27/everyday_reflection_for_progmo_militants/">http://www.reddit.com/r/GMOMyths/comments/1tht27/everyday_reflection_for_progmo_militants/</a></p>

<p>And you&#39;re going to claim this was part of some master plan? Did you boss say &quot;hey go lose arguments on purpose, then move the goal posts and don&#39;t even research what you&#39;re talking about. And after a day or two just give them a one sentence admission that you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about. You&#39;re really earning your pay check this week!&quot;</p>

<p>Was it part of the company procedure to tell me to go eat poison ?</p>

<p>This is an incredibly desperate and obvious lie. You started out as a good troll and now look at this, it&#39;s just sad.</p>

<p>You&#39;re really going to pretend you get paid to do this? I mean I knew today would be the day you made a new account but I had no idea you were going to throw in such lies about it. And you&#39;d think if you were being paid to argue it you&#39;d</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See what I mean? no counter argument like you&#39;d have if you were in fact a paid shill. Just a reference to an earlier insult in a conversation that is useless to anyone else reading.</p>

<p>And if you were a shill are you saying that all conspiracy theories are government ploys and that believing blindly in them like you have shown to is actually playing right into their hands? Because why would you come here to shill by talking about the boston bombings and 9/11 and just saying all the normal conspiracy theorist stuff?</p>

<p>I mean somebody paid you 500 bucks a day to just post a bit on conspiracy saying things conspiracy wants to hear? And you expect us to believe that with no motive, with no explanation of the goal of the company or how it makes money or helps the government by going and circlejerking and accusing people of being shills in a sub-redit full of crazies on the internet?</p>

<p>In all honesty there is a 94% chance you are just a teen with way too much free time this summer. Go spend it with your family fer christ sakes, it&#39;s christmas eve already! (well here at least)</p>

<p>But feel free to provide proof that you work for said company and said company performs said actions. Pictures of some guy in different places with his face blacked out, and a picture of a reddit address in some random software, is not proof.</p>

<p>If you were really a shill it would be pretty easy to get proof. GO find the user guide for the software you use. Grab paper from your orientation day where they explained the goals of the job. Take a screenshot of a company email that incriminates them somehow where it is clearly not photoshopped.</p>

<p>These are the things you would do if you were not lying about all this. </p>

<p>Yes, they knew he was &quot;expiring&quot;. The Denver Airport mural[1]   is a tribute of sorts.</p>

<p>The whole Mandela thing was unique. Usually things serve as distractions for other things. This time there was no distraction, just misdirection. They said they were there for his funeral when in reality more shady goings-on of the occult nature were happening. It was part of my job to discredit the shady part and focus on the funeral part. That&#39;s what peaked my interest. And like I said, connect the dots. He was supposed to die so they could meet. They say the military is about 10 years ahead of us, politics is about 5. And yes, we only get briefed on a need to know basis. Occult is a personal interest so I did some research myself based on the fact they wanted us to focus on just the funeral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn! I can try from memory.</p>

<p>First reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many people do you work with, and how many people in total across related agencies do you think are paid to do what you&#39;re doing? You&#39;re telling us to organize - in your opinion, what would be an effective way of organizing against this? Since you &#39;are the enemy&#39; so to speak, perhaps you would also know your greatest weakness</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He said in his building there are 8 floors, and each floor has about 100 people.  There&#39;s an entire army of paid shills in different countries as well.  I don&#39;t think he directly answered the &#39;greatest weakness&#39; part of the question.</p>

<p>Second reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once you &#39;get out&#39; do you think you&#39;ll be spared any of the prophesized doom and gloom we&#39;re all to face? Do you have any plans to work for the good of humanity once you leave? Or do you just want to slip away quietly with money in the bank?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He said that money talks and he makes about 20k a month.  No one is really willing to give that up.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, what are some of your sources of information? Any particular websites that seem to be more closely aligned with what you think is the truth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for sources of information, he said the important ones are the ones they are paid to target, so Reddit, ATS, Godlike Productions.</p>

<p>Third reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During your employment, which event or story was considered the most important to obfuscate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He said 9/11 without a doubt - he put it as &#39;beating a dead horse for 11 years that still won&#39;t die.&#39;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did your employment contract allude to any consequences you may incur by revealing information or even quitting the job?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He said anyone is free to leave or quit at any time...can&#39;t quite remember what he said about revealing information..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you feel like a burnable asset that could pose a threat to TBTP?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He said no, not at all, he and his colleagues don&#39;t really pose a threat to anyone</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever had direct contact with or orders from any agents of the US Government</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He said no, he takes direction from his own people down in SA, but he has seen highly decorated military folk around his building on occasion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where do you suppose the next major false flag will occur? Going off this, since you get information before it&#39;s reported, anything you can divulge right now that we might see in the media later, as a form of proof of your claims?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He said he has no idea where the next false flag will be.  For the second part of the question, he said in the first quarter of 2014 the dollar will take a huge hit.  However the media won&#39;t report on it until it&#39;s already too late to do anything about it. Bitcoin is just a distraction</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who or what has the most to lose by your claims?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He said &#39;no one.&#39;</p>

<p>Fourth reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once you &#39;get out&#39; do you think you&#39;ll be spared any of the prophesized doom and gloom we&#39;re all to face? Do you have any plans to work for the good of humanity once you leave? Or do you just want to slip away quietly with money in the bank?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is only going to safeguard his friends and family, and plan on doing that pretty soon</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for the dollar taking a big hit - is there any exact catalyst or reason why? And you say Bitcoin is a distraction - do you think this is a government invention, and if so, what is it distracting us from?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He said that&#39;s all the time he has questions for, and to keep an eye on the little sources and leaks. MSM lies, government lies, everyone lies - the little guys are where the real information comes from.</p>

<p>You simpleton. Do you really think you can fight us? Your fellow redditors are downvoting you like crazy simply for telling the truth. The only thing your little attempt at calling us out has accomplished is you being marginalized by your peers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are my words. I stand by them. From the comments in this thread, it is obvious that my words were not idle threats; every letter has been vindicated as OP&#39;s credibility is zero in the eyes of his cohorts. I am honestly glad that you have chosen to deactivate your account - This will spare us the displeasure of having to target your loved ones. We are not evil. That is to say, we do not actively desire or find pleasure in ruining people like we did &quot;IgnoreTheShills&quot;, but our Brave New World is too important to mankind and those who oppose it must be silenced.</p>

<p>I honestly wish you well, IgnoreTheShills - It was a brave, but foolhardy attempt. You got in way over your head when you started trying to call us out. You did not come close enough for us to have to play hardball by taking away things you love and/or your life, so I urge you to go back to these things; cherish the life you have, your family, your friends, whatever you value. Forget about this; forget about us and our doings. It will be better for you.</p>
