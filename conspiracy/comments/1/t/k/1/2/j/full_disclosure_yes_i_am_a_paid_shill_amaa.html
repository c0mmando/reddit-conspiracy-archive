       So the best way to keep somebody unimportant is to ignore them.  I made the mistake of responding to this guy for a couple of days.  This is probably his 50th account so banning him won't even matter cause he'll just create another one.

       I get your point but then he'll just be a shitposter with a different account name.  At least we can all identify and ignore him so long as he is "IgnoreTheShill."

       So, you have mentioned unification and vigilance as keys to understanding and in battling their plans for a total Orwellian police state.
      </p>
      <p>
       My last question. Is there anything else that you can tell us - other than what you have already mentioned, anything else we should be aware of that could help people, if all of what you say is to come to pass starting in 2014?

       Do you know anyone that worked that are and would they be doing what you're doing (disseminating the status quo) or would they be doing something differently? It would seem your two areas would get a lot of overlap with topics like 9/11 and mid-east interventions.

       Redemption, of course, is possible to everyone regardless of their deeds.  However, the law of karma (the real one - not the Reddit kind) never, ever goes unpaid.  All this is to say that your soul will indeed most certainly get "bought back", but it may not be in this life...and it may not be without a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       more effort and toil than you might have otherwise bargained for or anticipated.

       If that was the case why did you lose arguments so badly and have several meltdowns where you spammed threads to sub-reddits and sent people abusive PMs? here's an example of you starting and then losing an argument -

       Here is you having a meltdown and screaming at people who think GMOs aren't evil -

       And you're going to claim this was part of some master plan? Did you boss say "hey go lose arguments on purpose, then move the goal posts and don't even research what you're talking about. And after a day or two just give them a one sentence admission that you have no idea what you're talking about. You're really earning your pay check this week!"

       You're really going to pretend you get paid to do this? I mean I knew today would be the day you made a new account but I had no idea you were going to throw in such lies about it. And you'd think if you were being paid to argue it you'd

       See what I mean? no counter argument like you'd have if you were in fact a paid shill. Just a reference to an earlier insult in a conversation that is useless to anyone else reading.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you were a shill are you saying that all conspiracy theories are government ploys and that believing blindly in them like you have shown to is actually playing right into their hands? Because why would you come here to shill by talking about the boston bombings and 9/11 and just saying all the normal conspiracy theorist stuff?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean somebody paid you 500 bucks a day to just post a bit on conspiracy saying things conspiracy wants to hear? And you expect us to believe that with no motive, with no explanation of the goal of the company or how it makes money or helps the government by going and circlejerking and accusing people of being shills in a sub-redit full of crazies on the internet?
      </p>
      <p>
       In all honesty there is a 94% chance you are just a teen with way too much free time this summer. Go spend it with your family fer christ sakes, it's christmas eve already! (well here at least)
      </p>
      <p>
       But feel free to provide proof that you work for said company and said company performs said actions. Pictures of some guy in different places with his face blacked out, and a picture of a reddit address in some random software, is not proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were really a shill it would be pretty easy to get proof. GO find the user guide for the software you use. Grab paper from your orientation day where they explained the goals of the job. Take a screenshot of a company email that incriminates them somehow where it is clearly not photoshopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the things you would do if you were not lying about all this.

       What I can't figure out, is if people are upvoting you here beause they actually have fallen for this awful story full of bad photoshops and zero evidence. Or if it's just because they think it's fuckin hilarious how awful this attempt to troll has become.

       Quick  and to the point... My faith is Islam,  I'm a Muslim, one of the ones the msm tries oh so hard to demonize these days.

       When he first came out i thought wak job.  Even posted a "burn". the ... post in my history that i edited.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then i did go back and checked his top post, links, other things he has said, some of it matches up with my own beliefs,
      </p>
      <p>
       So stop demanding documentation.  Not all of us need it. I would like to hear what he has to say.

       If hes lying or not, whats it matter?  Some of us just don't care.  Lying?  fine then give the rope so he hangs himself.

       What are any red flags you can warn us of to be aware when something is coming? When you said the next false flag will be "huge" does that mean nuclear? What region of the country do you anticipate is the "hottest" or most likely to be a target? What are the hottest topics they had you pining against?

       If they had the meeting set since the beginning of the year, then that would imply that they knew he would be expiring around now.  Is that correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a general question about how much you've been told.  Assuming you're the real deal, I'd imagine that the most effective way to conduct this business would be to keep things on a need-to-know basis.  Take the meeting being pre-planned for example.  Was this required for you to do your job?  If so, how?  If not, why would they include that?

       This may sound ludicrous but when you believe you don't need proof. Proof is impossible to come by when you know that it's being kept secret. Personally, i have been constructing a view/perspective of the world that explains many unknowns, his answers are corroborating my assumptions to a T.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like he's been saying, you have to do your own research. Be your own bullshit detector. When you know information is being manipulated is there any 'proof'.

       Anyone who thinks other wise is kidding themself. For most of human existence we have had zero answers for life's greenhouse riddles. And suddenly in three generations we have them all?

       Hey, I just wanted to apologise. I was being a bit of an ass last night and wanted to say I was sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I did want to ask you why you believe me to be a
       <em>
        paid

       shill. Isn't that a little arrogant to believe that some company out there cares enough about some random internet commenter to spend money to troll them? Isn't it more likely that people who don't think very much of you are just being dicks on the internet?

        The whole Mandela thing was unique. Usually things serve as distractions for other things. This time there was no distraction, just misdirection. They said they were there for his funeral when in reality more shady goings-on of the occult nature were happening. It was part of my job to discredit the shady part and focus on the funeral part. That's what peaked my interest. And like I said, connect the dots. He was supposed to die so they could meet. They say the military is about 10 years ahead of us, politics is about 5. And yes, we only get briefed on a need to know basis. Occult is a personal interest so I did some research myself based on the fact they wanted us to focus on just the funeral.

       You've been pretty active on this sub lately, mostly calling out people you deem shills. Is it to be assumed that you haven't been "working" during this time? Secondary question: assuming reddit is as censored as some of us think it is, why would you be allowed to post any of this here? How would the NSA or other similar government agencies not have figured out they have a "rat" so to speak?

       Hmm.. I'm intrigued enough to at least entertain the idea that you're legit, despite my skepticism.

       So, in my opinion, it takes a pretty morally bankrupt person to knowingly mislead people from the truth for money (no offense, honestly). So why now? What changed that made you suddenly find a thread of humanity? I don't mean to word these questions so harshly I just don't know how else to phrase them - I hope you understand.

       Did others feel the same or were you the minority who felt pangs of guilt? Did you all have a good laugh at ours and others' expense after a particularly good trolling/circle jerk? Did you work together with others knowing full well that they also were shills? Did you use multiple accounts in the same thread to "agree with yourself" and make it look like it was multiple people?

       If you're changing jobs and getting out of the business and all this, can you post some documentation. Do you have any memos that prove what you're saying? Do you have any memos that describe the false flags, chemtrails, anything that you've claimed?

       Did someone verbally telling you that 1st quarter is when "winter" will come or is that your own estimate?
      </p>
      <p>
       In one of your linked you confirmed that Sandy Hook, boston bombing etc are all false flags. Was that info confirmed to you verbally by people in your company?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the objective of your job? Is it to just discredit all theses conspiracies? Is it to cast doubt? Do you ever report specific users to your higher ups or log them in any way?

       It's a website called Above Top Secret that used to (or still does?  I dont' know) have a bunch of info relating to conspiracy-oriented material.  For the most part, the place is absolutely
       <em>
        crawling
       </em>
       and infested to the core with naysayers and shills.  It's a wonder how anyone ever talked about real info there.

       Are you posting all of this from work?  If not, how did you get the screenshot of your Reddit account management program out?  If they are that careful, I'd imagine the would monitor that kind of thing being uploaded since it isn't via SSL.

       How many people do you work with, and how many people in total across related agencies do you think are paid to do what you're doing?

      <p>
       You're telling us to organize - in your opinion, what would be an effective way of organizing against this?  Since you 'are the enemy' so to speak, perhaps you would also know your greatest weakness

       Wow, that's pretty crazy.  Does your employer generally not care about how many loose ends (in terms of people who are 'in the know') there might be in this sort of operation?
      </p>

       Thanks for the replies. Here's a bigger list of questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         During your employment, which event or story was considered the most important to obfuscate?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Did your employment contract allude to any consequences you may incur by revealing information or even quitting the job?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you feel like a burnable asset that could pose a threat to TBTP?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Have you ever had direct contact with or orders from any agents of the US Government
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Where do you suppose the next major false flag will occur?  Going off this, since you get information before it's reported, anything you can divulge right now that we might see in the media later, as a form of proof of your claims?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Who or what has the most to lose by your claims?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>

       Once you 'get out' do you think you'll be spared any of the prophesized doom and gloom we're all to face?  Do you have any plans to work for the good of humanity once you leave? Or do you just want to slip away quietly with money in the bank?

       As for the dollar taking a big hit - is there any exact catalyst or reason why? And you say Bitcoin is a distraction - do you think this is a government invention, and if so, what is it distracting us from?

      <p>
       He said in his building there are 8 floors, and each floor has about 100 people.  There's an entire army of paid shills in different countries as well.  I don't think he directly answered the 'greatest weakness' part of the question.

       He said that money talks and he makes about 20k a month.  No one is really willing to give that up.

       As for sources of information, he said the important ones are the ones they are paid to target, so Reddit, ATS, Godlike Productions.

       He said 9/11 without a doubt - he put it as 'beating a dead horse for 11 years that still won't die.'

       He said no, he takes direction from his own people down in SA, but he has seen highly decorated military folk around his building on occasion.

        Where do you suppose the next major false flag will occur? Going off this, since you get information before it's reported, anything you can divulge right now that we might see in the media later, as a form of proof of your claims?

       He said he has no idea where the next false flag will be.  For the second part of the question, he said in the first quarter of 2014 the dollar will take a huge hit.  However the media won't report on it until it's already too late to do anything about it. Bitcoin is just a distraction

       He is only going to safeguard his friends and family, and plan on doing that pretty soon

       <p>
        As for the dollar taking a big hit - is there any exact catalyst or reason why? And you say Bitcoin is a distraction - do you think this is a government invention, and if so, what is it distracting us from?

       He said that's all the time he has questions for, and to keep an eye on the little sources and leaks. MSM lies, government lies, everyone lies - the little guys are where the real information comes from.

       These are my words. I stand by them. From the comments in this thread, it is obvious that my words were not idle threats; every letter has been vindicated as OP's credibility is zero in the eyes of his cohorts. I am honestly glad that you have chosen to deactivate your account - This will spare us the displeasure of having to target your loved ones. We are not evil. That is to say, we do not actively desire or find pleasure in ruining people like we did "IgnoreTheShills", but our Brave New World is too important to mankind and those who oppose it must be silenced.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly wish you well, IgnoreTheShills - It was a brave, but foolhardy attempt. You got in way over your head when you started trying to call us out. You did not come close enough for us to have to play hardball by taking away things you love and/or your life, so I urge you to go back to these things; cherish the life you have, your family, your friends, whatever you value. Forget about this; forget about us and our doings. It will be better for you.
