<p><strong>Edit:</strong> For people who are asking, <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1tibtv/discussion_what_could_be_done_to_make_rconspiracy/ce8d68x">this</a> is the main reason why people want <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a>  to leave. He is soliciting advice from someone who has had a history of manipulation in this sub, as documented by <a href="/u/TheGhostOfDusty">/u/TheGhostOfDusty</a> in <a href="/r/NolibsWatch">/r/NolibsWatch</a>, and more specifically in <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tk4nq/in_which_ubipolarbear0_summons_his_voting_brigade/">this thread</a> . The person, <a href="/u/Bipolarbear0">/u/Bipolarbear0</a>, said this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These [analytic data regarding people from racist subreddits who also sub to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>] speak wonders, but the true story can only be ascertained by spending a few hours digging into the sub. <strong>The racism pervades deep and corrupts the subreddit to its core</strong>, undermining the forum and its long gone potential as a place for enlightening discussion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...was <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9Iz12h2.png">caught redhanded</a> using an alt account and making &quot;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1gm8lf/has_anyone_ever_noticed_that_jew_boys_have_their/">blatantly anti-semitic posts</a> in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> [to see] how many upvotes they could get&quot; then goes on to complain that &quot;of all the mainstream subreddits, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is certainly one of the most racist&quot;.  Note that the top post in that submission says &quot;Why are all of your submissions about Jews?&quot;  Given this information, you may now be able to understand why some people in here would be irate that one of the biggest provokers and trolls this sub has ever seen is giving a mod advice on how to run it.  </p>

<p>I am not advocating <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a>  being banned from this sub for &#39;fraternizing with the enemy&#39;, I am not ever for restricting someone else&#39;s right to free speech. My concern is that this person has the power to restrict mine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just that. Simply <em>disagreeing</em> or presenting an alternate theory is being met with being called a shill, whether or not one also subscribes to r/conspiritard. If someone makes a post you don&#39;t like, downvote it. If they break enough forum rules, ban them. But don&#39;t ban them for posts you don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>As an analogy, I&#39;m in an outfit in Planetside 2 called the 4aces. They frown deeply on their members having alternate characters in different factions in another outfit on the same server for a good reason, because you dedicated your character to the Aces and it&#39;s a community of players, and swapping allegiance to another faction&#39;s outfit at the drop of a hat isn&#39;t taken well. But even they won&#39;t outright kick or ban you from the outfit.</p>

<p>Even if you wanted to &quot;improve the rampant racism&quot; (lolol), I dont think that is the place to go for discussion</p>

<p>also, arent you forgetting that he posted a bunch of anti jew stuff himself, because....why exactly?</p>

<p>There is no rampant racism here, and I challenge you to point out the &quot;myriad of other problems&quot;</p>

Everyone here is their own person, with their own thoughts, beliefs, politics and background.

I will upvote to promote discussion (not to confirm absolute belief, which is where <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> gets confused a lot).  But I don&#39;t downvote.  If people want to discuss, Bigfoot, aliens, bankers or Israel, good for them.  It&#39;s there business.  If the topic were to  turn to drunken Irishmen and I began to feel uncomfortable, I would stop participating.  Put on some big boy pants and understand that the world doesn&#39;t owe you shit.

<p>My oldest account is 8 years old, and I love the reversals that reddit keeps pulling politically. The entire reddit community is a pretty big laugh to me, except when it strays into <strong>real</strong> racism and sexism. I won&#39;t stand for that, nor should anyone else.</p>

<p>Edit: Since I have two people PMing me about how &quot;you are a newbie shut up you faggot&#39; and a similar messsage, I&#39;m happy to verify my oldest account age to the first person who has an account &gt;1 year old who is willing to preserve me confidentiality.</p>

<p>And your second paragraph is really stupid. If your sub has 250 currently online users, they can easily overwhelm the 500 currently online users here if they link directly to a post. The 500 here are scattered throughout 50 threads. Not to mention the fact that many people here are members of r/conspiratard. For being a member of a community that prides itself on being so much more intelligent and reasonable than this community, that was pretty ridiculous. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1e9hqf/telling_the_facts_are_considered_antisemetic_and/c9y2p87?context=3">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1e9hqf/telling_the_facts_are_considered_antisemetic_and/c9y2p87?context=3</a> - The <a href="/r/WhiteRights">/r/WhiteRights</a> guy applauding the label of anti-semitic, +21</p>

<p>If the community disagreed with racism as much as it claimed to, my linked posts would already be removed and the users banned. Complicity is pretty shitty. The report button exists for a reason. </p>

<p>Edit: Also, why edit your post? Here&#39;s where he accused me of being a troll, because having an opinion and citing sources is troll behavior now.</p>

<pre><code>    Please, tell me what I am.

The anwer would be &quot;troll&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>These posts have nothing in common with the overtly racist ones you posted previously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Good ol&#39; holocaust denial at +10</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this person could be the biggest bigot, comment is not evidence of this.  In fact, I&#39;m sure a large segment of those who don&#39;t believe the holocaust didn&#39;t happen are bigots.  However, you can<strong>not</strong> infer that simply questioning this implies hatred of all people in a certain group.  And to say so is simply intellectually lazy.  He presented a collection of factoids he believes to be true.  I&#39;d begin by disproving those points.  And it is through that discourse that you&#39;d be able to find out if he is in fact a bigot or simply misguided.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="/r/WhiteRights">/r/WhiteRights</a> guy applauding the label of anti-semitic, +21</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet another grey comment from the same dude.  Did you even watch the video he was commenting on for context?  If not, then it seems he is raising the valid point that &quot;anti-semite&quot; is often thrown around when one starts to talk about Palestine as if being against neo-apartheid means you have to hate all Jewish people.  By that definition, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/04/israeli-support-palestinian-state_n_2408079.html">43% of Israelis must be antisemetic since they want a freeze on the the expansion of the West Bank as well</a>.</p>

<p>So in summary, you found unpopular posts that were overtly hateful and other posts that <em>could</em> be from a hateful person, yet contain no actual hateful content.</p>

<p>In other words, the rampant racism claim against the community remains unfounded.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, why edit your post? Here&#39;s where he accused me of being a troll...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is correct.  That was an error on my part since I conflated your post with other posts while formulating my comment.  It couldn&#39;t have been up for more than a minute or so before I realized that this did not apply to you since you had been genuine in your posts (even if I strongly disagree with the conclusion you draw about this sub).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been in this sub awhile, I feel comfortable saying that I have never seen someone saying nigger that wasn&#39;t a troll.  At least half of the time that  &quot;Jew&quot; is used, it&#39;s a troll as in &quot;the Jews did 9/11&quot;. Of  the remaining, I see people being corrected often about the importance of distinguishing Israel from Jews everywhere.   As for the rest, I chalk it up to ignorant assholes and those are everywhere.  I think most of the complaints about <a href="/r/con">/r/con</a> being antisemitic is because we criticize Israel.  I don&#39;t see anything wrong with criticizing or disliking Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean absolutely no offense, but you haven&#39;t been viewing every thread if you haven&#39;t seen &#39;nigger&#39;. It&#39;s not particularly common, but it&#39;s certainly not uncommon.</p>

<p>I know none of you guys know this, but I think Israel is shit. They&#39;ve held a nuclear program for decades in direct opposition to law, and the US refuses to uphold our laws regarding that. I think the US should absolutely enforce our laws, and we don&#39;t.</p>

<p>None of this is anti-semitic, and none of this is wrong. This isn&#39;t what I&#39;m complaining about. I&#39;m complaining about the <em>actual</em> anti-semitism, not antizionism. Antizioism is (loosely, because it absolutely isn&#39;t <em>actually</em> antizionistic*, closer to just straight politcal opinions) </p>

<p>&quot;Israel sucks because these 12 Hamas guys were killed today from a rocket attack.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice I didn&#39;t emphasize it, because it didn&#39;t need emphasis. If the &#39;jews&#39; are doing the bad you suppose they (not &#39;you&#39; they, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> &#39;they&#39;) are, no exaggeration is needed.</p>

<p>No.  Shills do that to hide their deeds.  That&#39;s what comes to mind first.  I guess you should just go ahead and delete all your comments then.  It&#39;s very brave of you.  Clearly you believe that going around this sub the other day, and calling random people a shill, so many times that at least three people called you on it, was a noble endeavor...yet now your &quot;possible&quot; reasoning for deleting your comments is so people stop trying to dox you.....or something something my opinions?  Dude, I think you should just go ahead and delete this commment as well.</p>

<p>Did you ever consider this line of questioning is more obvious then you going around the sub the other day and calling everyone a shill?  Now that you admit the whole maybe maybe dox me thing had nothing to do with it, I am left with the notion that you are simply here to troll.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/nolibswatch">/r/nolibswatch</a> is a great example of how conspiracy theory itself has turned into a partisan political game. Our govt. can radicalize stupid conspiracy theorists on the right wing, claiming that everything is a &quot;Liberal Conspiracy&quot; and then effectively makes the conspiracy culture split down the middle and argue with each other and get nowhere. Just like they did with politics. Make them fight each other over stupid shit while the NWO gets away with whatever it wants.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s most likely true of all other subreddits too, not just <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. That&#39;s the only logical result of naming your sub &quot;conspiratard&quot;.

This submission received hundreds of upvotes and many supportive comments. His Stormfront buddy r00t shows up to lend support and claim that &quot;American Jews are mostly cowards.&quot;</p>

<p>In the same thread, idonotcollectstamps basically accuses all Jews of being un-American based on his statistically explainable anecdotal experience. He was a regular here until his account went quiet, and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/xhkmq/friendlysoviet_and_mindbleach_discuss_the_best/c5mgbh9">he&#39;d jump at any opportunity to accuse the &quot;jew boys&quot; in the JIDF &quot;ZOG machine&quot; of trying to take over the internet.</a></p>

<p>Dieselphiend is there, too. Along with claiming <a href="/r/Conspiratard">/r/Conspiratard</a> of being 100% &quot;paid shills,&quot; he loved the usual &quot;Jews aren&#39;t a race&quot; <em>argumentum ad Webster,</em> and outright said that millions of anti-semites must have a good reason.</p>

<p>Bumblingmumbling also shows up, and do I even have to explain what an asshole he is? This is the guy who said WWII was a Jewish plot to stop Hitler&#39;s monetary plans. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0A9Pr.png">9000sins wrote of him: &quot;The man may indeed be a hardcore racist, but that does not make his points invalid. Every point he makes is backed up by evidence.&quot;</a> The mods here banned people just for arguing with his overt and ridiculous racism masquerading as politics. He used to be in every goddamn <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> thread and he&#39;s still active in <a href="/r/WhiteRights">/r/WhiteRights</a>.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s billsang1 <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/yo33b/9000sins_is_calling_it_quits_as_a_mod/c5xc6wu">claiming there&#39;s no such thing as the Jewish race</a>, even though the word means both the religion and the several ethnicities closely associated with that religion.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s been any shift to actually bother enforcing Rule #1, but even if the mods now care enough to keep the racism quiet, you guys had and presumably still have a <em>shit-ton</em> of racists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say the best petition would be the one you just started. If enough people want it it will make it to the front page. Everyone who upvotes also leave a comment stating whether he stays or goes, that way vote manipulation can only do so much. If as many people want him gone as I suspect then this should make it to the top of the front page. He&#39;ll see it, hopefully along with the other mods. And he&#39;ll have to comment on it, he&#39;ll either do as everyone asks or he will refuse and he&#39;ll keep his post. If he does that then I would think that it&#39;s time for everyone to move on to a different sub. </p>

<p>It seems that you&#39;re a bit guilty of this when you generalize about the people here along with their method of rhetoric without any &quot;facts&quot; yourself. 
Look at most of the posts on this sub, they are are all referencing articles filled with facts. However , I do agree many of posts here come from untrustworthy sources. Still, you can&#39;t claim it&#39;s not about facts anymore. 
Moreover, I feel like this &quot;truth movement&quot; you reference is most harmed when people are categorized into &quot;the right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; and you have predetermined one is correct and the other has &quot;fundamentally flawed reasoning&quot;.  The best way to discover truth is to avoid the  Ad Hominum fallacy and focus on facts and arguments. </p>

<p>E. G. 
I could have started this post attempting to refute you based on your position as a moderator on <a href="/r/socialism">/r/socialism</a>. But I stayed focused on your reasoning instead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He went to a subreddit which is obviously critical of conspiracy theories and so is full of people critical of conspiracy theories to ask how a subreddit on conspiracy theories could be improved, in a polite and completely open way and people want him to be removed?</p>

<p>He clearly didn&#39;t go to <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> to ask advice specifically from someone who had &quot;a history of manipulation in this sub&quot;. He went because he knew that people would be more likely to give much better answers on how to improve <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> than the people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, because the subscribers of this subreddit are more likely to think that this subreddit is alright how it is.</p>

<p>Just look at the replies to his post in <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a>. They&#39;re mostly genuine answers. I can see why a subreddit like <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> exists when people from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> think a mod is &quot;conspiring with the enemy&quot; (-<a href="/u/SovereignMan">/u/SovereignMan</a>). It&#39;s fucking Reddit. He&#39;s not trying to infiltrate and destroy the subreddit. The people who think that really are just paranoid maniacs.</p>

<p>As far as your mainstream argument goes I&#39;m not sure I agree completely. A lot of us remember things like echelon, and it wasn&#39;t the fact that the NSA is spying that was surprising. It was their reach. I mean, they had a small team work in a backdoor into Skype without the majority of the Skype development team ever finding out.</p>

<p>Some folks have a difficult time comprehending things outside their comfort zone/world view and react to conflicting information by calling people names in order to silence them.... r/conspiritard  reminds me a bit of a truck full of rednecks hootin&#39; and hollerin&#39; and blasting off shotguns looking for some poor guy wearing a pink shirt so they can beat him for being a homosexual. Because that&#39;s a really good way to reassure yourself and your peers just how straight, or in this case, how mentally stable you are. </p>

<p>The term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is a useful tool to silence debate by those who would rather not face information that makes them uncomfortable. If you would rather keep your head in the sand that&#39;s fine, but ridiculing people with different opinions and beliefs might be an indication of your own mental deficiency. You certainly don&#39;t demonstrate a higher cognitive function over those who dig to uncover the truth about the world they live in by doing that. Please resist the urge to say I believe in lizard people because I want to know more about what the NSA is up to. If it wasn&#39;t for the mainstream media coverage of Edward Snowden&#39;s revalations, I suspect you would call him a nut job who also believes the moon is made of cheese. </p>

<p>I wish I could answer that with a list of policy changes made since the Snowden revelations started, but I can&#39;t yet. But I find it hard to believe that by the time the last of the documents has been released, that it will have had no impact on the extent of government spying. Shining a light on corruption surely has a long-standing tradition of affecting change, and the lies and cover ups that follow each new report serve to multiply the outrage of the people, and puts faces and names to the crimes. I had never heard of Clapper till he lied to Congress. At least now when you try and warn someone about privacy they can&#39;t treat you like an idiot, nut job. It&#39;s they who deny a problem exists who look stupid now. There&#39;s change a-comin, and it&#39;s hard to imagine it not coming, once a critical mass of like minds have had enough of the crap.
As for the new Pope. I smell a pure PR decision in bringing this one in. It worked so well with Obama! And the media surrounding him, reinforcing his rebel, Christ-like character should be a clear tell. Maybe this pope is like everything they say... But he is just the figure head of a corrupt institution which will not dance in step with this &quot;pied piper&quot; in terms of any real change to the Catholic faith. It sure takes the heat off them right now. Brilliant marketing move IMO.</p>

<p>However, this is a fallacious argument of the worst kind. In elections, it&#39;s always a minority that actually goes out and votes, and those votes speak for everyone who doesn&#39;t bother. The same goes here. When it comes to petitions/vote tallied threads on reddit, ONLY the actual votes count. You can&#39;t just invoke the supposed opinion of the silent minority, because they are silent on the issue.</p>

<p>To complain that your &quot;freedom of speech&quot; is somehow being impinged is ridiculous. You should already know that the whole concept of freedom of speech is only to protect individuals from the government, not some guy on reddit who disagrees with you. He could track and blast your opinions in every post you make and it wouldn&#39;t be a freedom of speech issue. Hell, the mods could ban you or the admins could shadow ban you and it still wouldn&#39;t be a freedom of speech issue - reddit is not the government, it&#39;s a private site. Freedom of speech isn&#39;t about feels. It&#39;s something far too important and rare these days to trivialize like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>200k - 90% = 20k. </p>

<p>Think i alluded to 100k being real accounts?</p>

<p>But really, lets pretend we have 100k Active, Different people here</p>

<p>Have you Ever seen 1k user on at once?</p>

<p>Have you ever seen <strong>1% of this sub&#39;s user</strong>&#39;s on at once? </p>

<p>I think 940ish was most on that i ever saw for reference.  </p>

<p>Proofs in the pudding doubleraptor</p>

<p>Edit, btw, 1% of 100k is 1k.... sub actually has 204k, so have you ever seen more then .4%  (point four percent) on at once?</p>

He will always wonder why people don&#39;t appreciate his &#39;help&#39;, help they never asked for and don&#39;t want. It really is a sad story...</p>

<p>P.S.  There will never be any compromise to be had with the real bigots in that hate group. To think what you did was wise or even acceptable shows unbelievable lack of judgement. How else can I say respectfully that I no longer respect your authority... Please resign.</p>

<p>&quot;Doublespeak is language that deliberately disguises, distorts, or reverses the meaning of words. Doublespeak may take the form of euphemisms (e.g., &quot;downsizing&quot; for layoffs, &quot;servicing the target&quot; for bombing[1]), in which case it is primarily meant to make the truth sound more palatable. It may also refer to intentional ambiguity in language or to actual inversions of meaning (for example, naming a state of war &quot;peace&quot;). In such cases, doublespeak disguises the nature of the truth. Doublespeak is most closely associated with political language&quot;   </p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people, in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an incorrect or deviant decision-making outcome. Group members try to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation of alternative ideas or viewpoints, and by isolating themselves from outside influences.</p>

<p>Loyalty to the group requires individuals to avoid raising controversial issues or alternative solutions, and there is loss of individual creativity, uniqueness and independent thinking. The dysfunctional group dynamics of the &quot;ingroup&quot; produces an &quot;illusion of invulnerability&quot; (an inflated certainty that the right decision has been made). Thus the &quot;ingroup&quot; significantly overrates their own abilities in decision-making, and significantly underrates the abilities of their opponents (the &quot;outgroup&quot;).&quot;</p>

<p>We do not want you destroyed.  We want to be friends.  We want <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to be a place to rationally discuss actual conspiracies: not random libertarian shit that is not even close to an actual conspiracy, Jews or lizard overlords.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to agree with this statement. Any time you try to propose people be of common sense and mellow out and post sources or anything you get called a fool or a sheep just because you don&#39;t believe in every damn conspiracy. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> does cater to people who have already made up their minds and argue from an egotistical perspective.

They&#39;ve been around in government since government existed. I&#39;m also not naive enough to say that arbitrary variables make up a valid conspiracy, which I see a lot of on here. As for the big pharmacy thing, there has been evidence of massive conspiracies, the first one coming to mind being the Bayer/HIV OF THE 1980&#39;s and on. That&#39;s one that has real tangible evidence. I don&#39;t believe all pharmaceutical companies are evil because that would be a generalization without sufficient evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any and all is a bold statement. Jeering and debunking isn&#39;t the same as trolling. People can get way ahead of themselves here and get offended that anybody criticizes them. <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> isn&#39;t undermining you, its just a joke at your expense, and you&#39;re offended. I get it, it sucks to feel stupid, be proved wrong or told to be reasonable. The reason <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> was founded is because of the silly butthurt. You don&#39;t see and <a href="/r/historytard">/r/historytard</a> do you? Because in <a href="/r/history">/r/history</a> everything has to be verified and the threads are moderated so you don&#39;t get stupid shit clogging up a thread that is supposed to be informative. </p>

I think you are selling a lot of the people over there short by thinking of them as &quot;mortal enemies&quot; The guy simply tried to open an honest dialog. There are plenty of people over at <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, myself included,  that understand conspiracies can and do happen. There are also people over there, myself included, that understand they are not everywhere and at all times. I&#39;d bet there are a lot more moderate minded people than you are giving credit for. The notion that the Mod committed some mortal sin for simply talking to the other side is just ridiculous. Open a serious dialog. Maybe we will all come away more intelligent.</p>

<p>There is no &quot;dialogue&quot; that is going to happen with trolls.  They don&#39;t care about this sub!  Why would they offer constructive criticism?</p>

<p>And it&#39;s laughable to argue that they understand conspiracies happen and are open to exploring them.  They are extremely hostile to exploring conspiracies and comments like &quot;I just go to <a href="/r/conpspiracy">/r/conpspiracy</a> to eat popcorn and watch retards look retarded&quot; is very common.

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit.  This place is for exploring conspiracies.  If a theory is unlikely then that&#39;s fine if people want to argue it&#39;s unlikely or question the evidence.  Saying theories are off limits is bullshit.  Sandy Hook theories are legitimate theories and if you want to <em>mock</em> a theory rather than discuss it then take your juvenile antics back to conspiratard.</p>

<p>But we don&#39;t need advice from trolls who only mock this place.  This is classic concern trolling.  Why take advise from juvenile trolls?</p>

<p>Making hoax theories off limits is a terrible idea. </p>

<p>Some theories are unlikely or make extraordinary claims or rely on inference.  That&#39;s fine if you want to argue that.  </p>

<p>But as this is a place to explore theories they all deserve basic respect and should be allowed to be aired.  Basic respect means not calling a person &quot;retarded&quot; or mocking them for presenting the theory and not judging the entire sub for it (&quot;this post just proves you&#39;re all retarded here&quot;).</p>

They are a minority subsect of modern Judaism and would be like calling all mainstream Mormons members of the child raping polygamist cult that is the FLDS church.  Basically I think the mod staff should be critical of any post that blames all of the worlds problems on Jews (or any group for that matter), if they are backed up by evidence then leave them, if they are accusations with blogs and youtube videos as citations then remove them as unsubstantiated.

I come here and read about them then I scroll down to the bottom and find a perfectly worded comment with -36 points that is cited with evidence. Not seeing the light is a big problem. But do you guys bother with reading anything? NOPE you just downvote them and call them corporate shills. That mod was trying to get constructive criticism and instead of listening to the criticism you guys FREAK THE FUCK OUT and demand the mod step down.. asking for things like that is what a good mod SHOULD do</p>

<p>No, I disagree. Maybe you desire something from that subreddit that the majority do not? I think you may as well go into <a href="/r/awww/">/r/awww/</a> and give carefully worded theses on why one animal is cuter than another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happens all over, man. They implemented the &quot;dont show vote totals&quot; thing to combat circlejerking. So whats the next step? Are you saying you want all such comments removed or auto-downvoted, or comments with links auto-upvoted? I fail to see how more rules are going to have any effect on this, nor do I find it to be such a big deal that it needs to be fought off. We are still talking about insufficient rules here, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blah blah blah, same old story from you. All this boils down to is that someone called you a shill and you don&#39;t like it. And no, &quot;the mods&quot; never asked anyone, it was one mod asking a subreddit whose very existence is predicated on mockery. I personally don&#39;t find that a problem, but I&#39;m not one to go around creating problems out of thin air.</p>

<p>You started off saying the rules were insufficient because the users don&#39;t follow the rules. When I pointed out how illogical it was to implement more rules because of that, you started talking about being called a shill and how the users were being made fun of and how that is some great problem that needs some solution, apparently to be solved by rules, but you can&#39;t seem to offer anything concrete there.</p>

<p>My position remains the same. The rules <a href="/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy/</a> has right now are sufficient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because calling someone a shill adds nothing to the conversatio. Its just used when people prove you wrong and it makes you mad. People come to this board and post FACTS. For example I remember a thread about climate change. I asked for any peer reviewed sources that says climate change is not happening. The response I got was &quot;you show me any peer reviewed studies that show that it is happening&quot;. So I did, I cited about 5 sources. The response was &quot;yeah nice cites&quot;. I said &quot;Yale university is not reputable?&quot; Then I got called a shill and the whole comment chain was down voted. Thats the problem. People on this board do not care about ANYTHING but hearing themselves talk they believe every conspiracy even if it contradicts the others they believe in. Did a missile hit the pentagon? wait no it was a remote controlled plane! This shit isn&#39;t even consistent</p>

It isn&#39;t about pointing and laughing at the dumb shit people buy into, oh no, it&#39;s part of a super secret plan to make r/conspiracy look like nuts because all of conspiratard know &quot;the truth&quot; about the NWO but work hard to suppress the message to the &quot;sheep&quot;.</p>

<p>If the admins cared about people &quot;airing Reddit&#39;s dirty laundry&quot; SRS would have been banned ages ago. Also I&#39;m fairly sure Reddit isn&#39;t actually profitable as a business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something that we are going to have to live with is the inability to discern another&#39;s intentions behind the firewall. The person commenting might really believe what he or she is saying, or they might be working for the government, or they might be working for a reputation repair firm, or they might just be misguided. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s weird that the mod went to that asshole den to ask for guidance on a sub when he could have posted here or asked another mod. This tells me these mods are elected for strange reasons. If the mod in question is, as he said, not that big of a conspiracy theorist, then why moderate this community? I can see that you care if you are asking for help in the first place to improve this community, but why? And what&#39;s wrong with it in the first place? I think it&#39;s just fine. </p>

<p>These kinds of posts will become more and more frequent as the authenticity of other users&#39; commentary becomes more and more questionable. Trolling and deceiving is now profitable and is a desired skill, so arguing over whether or not to trust another anonymous user on the net is moot. Instead, focus on what we do know to be true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of those subs where you read the comments at your peril - but good lord, if you are an fan of conspiracy or interested in how various conspiracies and movements have played out over the last few hundred years, removing conspiracies alleged to be directed at Jews or motivated by Jews would leave... well, not a whole lot. </p>

<p>I&#39;m personally quite intolerant of bigotry and cultural supremacy movements, I don&#39;t think anything that leads to purges and pogroms is a good thing - for reasons that I should not have to explain. </p>

<p>But at the same time, if you are going to have this sub at all, antisemites and Zionists will form part of it&#39;s frothy brew. At best, you can get the better sorts of those to police the worst sorts. Indeed, you can expect them to conspire to do that in order to paint their own views in a better light and the other sorts as being clumsy, bigoted trogs.</p>

<p>Me, I am a fan of the history of such things but perhaps I&#39;m too jaded to take such things seriously, but really, how could anyone expect anything else?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even sure which way to argue: given that I believe your allegations about <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a> , does that show him to be unqualified to mod this sub, or does it demonstrate him to be more than usually qualified, with but the one slip in his trade-craft? Mods moderate. That means that they do indeed &quot;manipulate the direction of the sub and the discussion.&quot; </p>

<p>I think I&#39;ll just go back to my popcorn. :}</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there is some <a href="http://forward.com/articles/155742/jews-are-a-race-genes-reveal/?p=all">evidence</a> that disagrees with you.</p>

<p>Race isn&#39;t a biological construct; it is a social and cultural construct linked to some biological realities. You can not argue that a race doesn&#39;t exist because they are mixed. Most people consider jews a race, and they are certainly treated as such. As race is cultural, there is no reasonable way to conclude that they aren&#39;t a race.</p>

<p>The fact that they are mixed with other races - &#39;Heinz 57&#39;? Doesn&#39;t mean that they aren&#39;t a race any more than Barack Obama proves that blacks aren&#39;t a race. Consider that a black/white 50/50 in USA is generally considered black but a black/white 50/50 mix in latin America would be considered white. It isn&#39;t biological, it is driven by culture. </p>

<p>Lastly, I agree that the Jewish religion is separate from the Jewish race. </p>

<p>But bigotry shouldn&#39;t be any more acceptable than racism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to subscribe to the old school of thought regarding race. It&#39;s the only train of thought that makes any sense to me. Remember? Hispanic, African, Caucasian, Asian, etc, etc...</p>

<p>Now, tell me, what &quot;race&quot; are Jews? What makes them so fucking special as to get their very own race? If race is cultural, why aren&#39;t Christians considered a race? How about hippies? Shouldn&#39;t they be a race as well? What about punk rockers? Hmm? The cold hard fact is I, or anybody else can become a Jew. <strong>It is nothing more than a religion, and it does not deserve racial protection</strong>.</p>

<p>Who are the real Jews anyhow? Perhaps they are the <strong>black</strong> Ethiopians?</p>

<p>Perhaps the Palestinians have more <em>true</em> Jewish blood?</p>

<p>If a race didn&#39;t exist five thousand years ago, it doesn&#39;t exist today!</p>

<p>The racism is so thick.</p>

<p>So thick. </p>

<p>So, if they aren&#39;t a race, then why were they wholesale slaughtered based on their bloodlines? Why are they treated like a unique group based on their relationships?</p>

<p>You should really take a moment and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_classification">read a little</a>) about what race is. It&#39;s not just your &quot;old school&quot; of thought. </p>

<p>In the end it doesn&#39;t even really matter; let&#39;s just abort the entire concept of race. Let&#39;s instead classify it as unfair bigotry against a group. </p>

<p>Whenever you see people referring to anti-jewish racism, just mentally replace it with &quot;unfair prejudice and bigotry against the jewish people&quot;. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t think there is unfair prejudice and bigotry against them - and I feel you have displayed plenty here - then I don&#39;t want to talk to you any more. </p>

<p>So, this is what determines race? Any idea how many groups that would apply to?</p>

<p>I guess that makes skateboarders and hippies a race as well? Or, do we have to have a skateboarder holocaust, first?</p>

<p>&quot;If you don&#39;t think there is unfair prejudice and bigotry against them&quot;</p>

<p>Unfair? Perhaps to some, but as a whole, no. They&#39;ve been kicked out of over 200 countries in two thousand years. I&#39;m so fucking sick of the Jew apologists, fumbling over themselves to stick up for something they know nothing about because it&#39;s been ingrained in their tiny little minds by Hollywood and the media since birth. Life is fucking hard, every cultural group of people in the world has faced persecution. Tens of millions of Christians were killed by the Jewish Bolsheviks starting nearly one hundred years ago, and they killed at least ten fold more Christians than every Jew who died in Germany. If there was a Holocaust in the past one hundred years, it was committed against Christians by the Jews...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how the sarcastic comments (or any comments useless to the discussion) are being downvoted ferociously. Most from conspiracy who visited conspiratard recently for the first time and glanced at their posts have left feeling a little more stupid and frustrated, so you can&#39;t blame us for being a little angry. Seriously, the first few links may have made me chuckle, but their adamant uploading, adding to reddit&#39;s garbage heap of the most useless posts on this site is something to fear, particularly because they&#39;re attacking something that is at least potentially serious... </p>

<p>On the point of racism in this sub, I&#39;m pretty new here but the majority of new posts are usually interesting ones, or ones asking for discussion (I know, we can thank the mods for that). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they are based on different technologies for the encryption algorithms.</p>

<p>See:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin: <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_hashing_algorithm">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_hashing_algorithm</a></li>
<li>Litecoin: <a href="https://litecoin.info/Block_hashing_algorithm">https://litecoin.info/Block_hashing_algorithm</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Many crypto currencies (there are a lot besides Bitcoin) are overinflated and in a bubble. Buying or selling them involves some amount of speculation. </p>

<p>However, this &quot;Dogecoin&quot; thing was created as a joke to make fun of all the other crypto currencies out there. It was funny and it made a point about the silly nature of all these new <em>me too</em> currencies being created. </p>

<p>Some people turned the joke into a real-life Ponzi scheme. They buy a bunch, and then go around the Internet spamming to pump the value of Dogecoin. They convince suckers to buy in and raise the value. Then, when the value is at it&#39;s peak, they sell and cash out --dumping-- leave everyone else holding the bag. It&#39;s unethical. It&#39;s slimy. It shouldn&#39;t be legal.</p>

<p>This guy could easily abuse his position as moderator to push his scam on unsuspecting noobs. Who would stop him?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose the issue is that everyone has a different view on racism.  While saying that Jewish people are behind certain actions is not racist (as long as you have verifiable, factual evidence to support your claim), blaming an entire group of people for every event that occurs could be seen as racist.</p>

<p>And no, I&#39;m not saying that you or anyone else does that.  It&#39;s just a thought.</p>

<p>Well, yes, it is. It&#39;s like saying the blacks are barbaric thugs; generalizing to a whole race because of evidence that some limited number of them have trait X is very much racist. </p>

<p>Someone makes a generalization about a group based on some perceived traits of that group, and applies it to the whole group regardless of who the individuals are or what they did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference in pointing out key individuals in power as Jewish and on the other hand saying that an entire race is savage. I don&#39;t believe all Jews are power hungry but enough of them are to the point where they were expelled from around the world.</p>

<p>Even though Jews constituted 2% of the population in Germany they controlled most of the theater industry, most of the financial institutions and they were heavy in politics as well as they are today in America and used to be in Russia (the oligarchs). It&#39;s not racist for pointing that out. It&#39;s the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay.</p>

<p>Where did they say that key individuals in power are Jewish? That wasn&#39;t the statement made, the statement made was not about any individuals.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you see what is happening? That you are conflating a few individuals with power with an entire group of people - and that same bigotry was used in Germany to orchestrate the mass extermination of that entire class of people, not just the ones that were actually in power? Don&#39;t you think it is wrong that you are making vague insinuations about the Jews having power? So what if one ethnic group is concentrated in industries? Why bring it up?</p>

<p>The reason you are bringing it up is that those concentrations are used as excuses for persecution. It&#39;s not wrong to blame the Jews if they are secretly wielding power against the rest of the population, right?</p>

<p>Racist version: It&#39;s the jews</p>

<p>Non-racist version: Some people have power in the theater, banking, and political world and are abusing that power</p>

<p>It was never the bulk of Jews that controlled those industries, any more than most Christians in American control theater, banking, and politics - the simple fact of the matter is that most people have very little power. </p>

<p>This is textbook racism. Right here folks, right here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except it is important to call out the fact that they are Jews in the same way it is important to call out the fact that suicide bombs going off were the product of Muslims. If you negate the person&#39;s religious background which in both cases has an incredible influence on the person&#39;s development then you end up with things happening that have no real context.</p>

<p>If for example you would negate the fact that a Muslim was indeed the person doing the bombing then you wouldn&#39;t understand why he did what he did. In the same way Jews whether you like it or not have a doctrine which is very foreign to us westerners, the degree of extremism is dependent on the individual but it is important to understand that it exists. Jews see themselves as a people very different from the rest of the world, their books talk about their exceptionalism and how they were made to rule over the rest. Jews who are fairly moderate will have moderate stances toward this, but there is a huge base of Jews who literally see the world in this manner, it&#39;s because of their religious notions that they can do what they are doing in Palestine.</p>

<p>From this world view follow their actions, and their actions today as in the past in this world are inline with what their books are saying. So it is impossible to disconnect the Jewish identity from world politics. They hold the most power of any group in the world and thus have the most influence. The entirety of American politics is very strange, it&#39;s as if the American government does not work for it&#39;s people. Now ask yourself why this is? It&#39;s the same reason why the USSR wasn&#39;t working for it&#39;s people, because the group who has the power to create change and prosperity is choosing not to do so. It is a powerful group of people who doesn&#39;t care about the interests of the inhabitants of the country they control. They merely use the inhabitants of that country to push forward an agenda. </p>

<p>America is fighting the Jewish war in the middle east, to the public a different narrative is laid out, however people have started questioning these wars and questioning the events that have put everything into motion (9/11). People are starting to doubt whether they are actually fighting for terrorism and not for something else. Some have said that oil is a motivating factor, or perhaps power, gold or the poppy fields, people have investigated all this stuff at length simply to find an answer to why America fights the wars it&#39;s fighting. They will never find the real answer however, because the real answer lies in a place that they have been taught never to look at, and that&#39;s the Jewish question.</p>

<p>America wants to bomb Iran, the goyim are told it&#39;s because of an alleged nuclear weapons program (evidence for this does not exist). The real reason is because of Iran&#39;s stance toward Israel and Zionism. The middle eastern wars have been planned before 9/11 Wesley Clark talks about this and there can already be seen a lot of propaganda directed towards Iran before that period. 9/11 was the event that started it all, and this crucial event is shrouded in mystery, it is the event that has brought forth mass skepticism and an awakening from the American populace, and rightfully so. But whenever the Jewish question is touched upon we are as a collective taken aback by our conditioning, a conditioning which is so pervasive that even when clear evidence presents itself we choose not to see the reality of the situation. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying all Jews are bad, I think many Jews are regular people who live their lives entangled in all of this mess without their knowing, Israeli&#39;s are very indoctrinated people, their view of the Palestinians for example is completely skewed. Palestinians are a suppressed people and they will attack in anger at times, usually with very amateurish weapons, such as home made rockets. These attacks of the Palestinians are inflated by the Israeli government, the Israeli government depicts this conflict as though it was fighting a large terrorist force. This stance is incredibly useful to get the population to follow along with your extermination plans, but in reality they are not a terrorist force at all. They are merely people struggling to survive, and with their displacements from their home, the deaths of their loved ones comes a great deal of anger, especially in the hearts of proud Muslims. Arabs are an honorable people who will fight to the death for their land. </p>

<p>Imagine the Americas at the time of Columbus, the Israeli situation is very similar. Now imagine that the colonialists had some way of propaganda, and depicting the Indians not as a people protecting their land and family but simply a bunch of rowdy extremist individuals who want death to the colonialists. This is Israel today, and the Jews their are heavily indoctrinated. I&#39;m not even sure whether the true elite even care about the Jewish population. </p>

<p>And while you are blaming me for pointing at the Jewish elite, the western propaganda machine is going on an all out war against the Muslims. I believe there will be a great war among the west and Islam. The two greatest enemies of established Jewry exterminating themselves, all caused by Jewish manipulation of the masses. One  of the perks of controlling the media is the control of an entire population. I posted a documentary about the oligarchs in Russia, this exact process was happening there until Putin intervened and drove them away. But before Putin did what he did they were taking up all the banks, all the resources and the media, they were the ones who made the politicians, you couldn&#39;t get your foot in a governmental building without having been approved by these oligarchs. The only reason Putin got on the inside was because he gained the trust of these people, and once he was firmly established he started the process of elimination. </p>

<p>This process never happened in America, and to this day it is ruled by people with power (money). And while the mainstream masses are talking about left and right, blue and red (which they are waking up to) there are a group of people laughing their asses off. America will be used for as long as possible and they will never leave America lone until it&#39;s completely destroyed and used up.</p>

<p>The people will never understand the real issues, their houses will be foreclosed on, their relatives will die in wars in the middle east, the major players of their economy will move to different parts of the world, they will be left completely ideologically divided. Not just ideologically but on every issue imaginable. Black/white, gay/straight, pro-healthcare/anti-healthcare, pro-gun/anti-gun, christian/atheist, pro-choice/pro-life and the list goes on and on. When they leave America alone, there will be no America anymore.</p>

<p>This is how I see things from all the information that I am exposed to. Whether my conclusion is suited to you or not is not my problem, I have no control over the conclusions  my mind makes. Information is gathered and that information must assimilate into the mind to then form a coherent picture of the world. Quality information is hard to come by nowadays, we are being deceived at every turn and so our abilities of discernment is all we have.</p>

<p>Good luck on your search, I will never censor you for your truth, so let&#39;s not censor me for mine. </p>

<p>What matters is that they were willing to kill someone else.</p>

There&#39;s nothing to say about a history of racial discrimination and racial violence against blacks?

The fact that Daley I was an active participant in race riots in his youth and then continued almost overtly racist policies and covertly racist hiring and contracting policies throughout his terms?

<p>Why is this of interest? Because they returned to lesser jobs or no jobs compared to their white counterparts? Of course they would be denied loans, it was only good business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference is that I don&#39;t dispute asians do better on IQ tests than whites. The difference isn&#39;t as large as that between blacks and other races, but it&#39;s there.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with it at all.</p>

<p>You however, would shout &#39;racism&#39;, right? You&#39;re so typically predictable. </p>

<p><em>I noted asians scoring better than whites on a post a week or whatever ago. You can check my post history for it.</em></p>

<p>Owned, bitch.</p>

<p>edit: No, it was just 2 days ago, although I&#39;ve probably noted it before:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DarlingtonDude 1 point 2 days ago
Yes, clearly you wouldn&#39;t want to &#39;waste time&#39; trying to fight what 60 or 70 years of IQ testing has clearly shown in schools, the military, and corporations.
Asians score a bit higher than whites, which you would probably agree with. Amazing how facts really fuck you liberal idiots in the ass in any real argument, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some more &#39;fun with black people&#39; while we&#39;re on it:</p>

<p>Murders with guns are the No. 1 cause of death for African-American men between the ages of 15 and 34. But talking about race in the context of guns would also mean taking on a subject that can&#39;t be addressed by passing a law: the family-breakdown issues that lead too many minority children to find social status and power in guns.
The statistics are staggering. In 2009, for example, the Centers for Disease Control reported that 54% of all murders committed, overwhelmingly with guns, are murders of black people. Black people are about 13% of the population.
The Justice Department reports that between 1980 and 2008, &quot;blacks were six times more likely than whites to be homicide victims and seven times more likely than whites to commit homicide.&quot;

<p><em>You&#39;ll notice no other race reflects these kinds of numbers.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Though I never heard of the human pancake before I&#39;m shocked that anyone is angry at the Israel. They have been making every attempt at peace and getting shit on at every turn. Sometimes they have to push back and people shouldn&#39;t intentionally put themselves in harms way. I wasn&#39;t even alive when these fights started but I&#39;m old enough to know that it&#39;s utter bullshit.</p>

<p>Shit&#39;s about as dumb as those anti-nuke protesters laying on the tracks. It&#39;s not as bad as idiots getting on a bus and blowing themselves up with a bomb or constantly launching rockets into civilian population... </p>

They&#39;ve been around in government since government existed. I&#39;m also not naive enough to say that arbitrary variables make up a valid conspiracy, which I see a lot of on here. As for the big pharmacy thing, there has been evidence of massive conspiracies, the first one coming to mind being the Bayer/HIV OF THE 1980&#39;s and on. That&#39;s one that has real tangible evidence. I don&#39;t believe all pharmaceutical companies are evil because that would be a generalization without sufficient evidence.</p>

<p>I enjoy fresh content to make fun of</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rules:</p>

<p>10.Any posts that <strong>attack the sub</strong>, users or the mods will be removed. Breaking this rule more than once can earn a ban.</p>

<p>So you admit your here to add nothing of value, only to troll.</p>

<p>Its really sad tbh, but if your personal life is so slow to come make fun of crazy ol me..</p>

<p>then troll on troll, troll on</p>

<p>Maybe one day a mod might actually give a sht and ban ppl like you.</p>

<p>I know none of you guys know this, but I think Israel is shit. They&#39;ve held a nuclear program for decades in direct opposition to law, and the US refuses to uphold our laws regarding that. I think the US should absolutely enforce our laws, and we don&#39;t.</p>

<p>None of this is anti-semitic, and none of this is wrong. This isn&#39;t what I&#39;m complaining about. I&#39;m complaining about the <em>actual</em> anti-semitism, not antizionism. Antizioism is (loosely, because it absolutely isn&#39;t <em>actually</em> antizionistic*, closer to just straight politcal opinions) </p>

<p>&quot;Israel sucks because these 12 Hamas guys were killed today from a rocket attack.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice I didn&#39;t emphasize it, because it didn&#39;t need emphasis. If the &#39;jews&#39; are doing the bad you suppose they (not &#39;you&#39; they, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> &#39;they&#39;) are, no exaggeration is needed.</p>
