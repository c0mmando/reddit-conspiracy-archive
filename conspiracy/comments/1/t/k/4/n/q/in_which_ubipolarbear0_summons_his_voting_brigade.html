<p>For extra hypocrisy he goes on to offer a list of <strong><em>slurs</em></strong> to auto-censor, <strong><em>in a subreddit with a bigoted slur in the name</em></strong>. </p>

<p>These guys are <em>obsessively</em> dedicated to stigmatizing and disrupting this subreddit. It&#39;s incredible really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I look fine. I just know that the img you&#39;re using and claiming is evidence Bear is summoning a vote brigade / posting anti-semitic things, when you yourself know that this is taken from before he posted the thread on conspiratard admitting his trolling.</p>

<p>You actually honestly think all of the holocaust deniers in this sub are bipolarbear? what about grandest_inquisitor, who thinks only 300,000 jews were killed in camps in WWII? Or amos quito who spends all his time rambling about israel and how they get too much compassion for the holocaust and how they&#39;re actually super racist themselves so it&#39;s not that bad. Or 4to2 who is an actual white supremacist.</p>

<p>All of these people are bipolarbear? </p>

<p>The fact is bipolarbear doesn&#39;t post &quot;black propaganda&quot; here and hasn&#39;t since he made that thread and it didn&#39;t really go that well. </p>

<p>All NLW seem to do is organise a witch hunt/brigade against Bear using the same information every few months. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not damning at all, it&#39;s old information that you&#39;ve already seen. He leaked it himself. It reveals that he is purely trolling and trying to gauge a reaction (which wouldn&#39;t be possible without anti semites upvoting him). </p>

<p>And you don&#39;t really care about Rachel Corrie, you&#39;re the one who brings her up every 5 seconds to use her as a prop. Some members of the mod team have made off-colour jokes about 1 dead person. An old mod here, <a href="/u/tttottt">/u/tttottt</a> was a blatant white supremacist neo nazi. I guess you must support those beliefs seeing as you regularly defend <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?</p>

<p>And again, this is old and irrelevant information. Recently there was a post in conspiratard where a comment about the fact that Corries death was shady and a tragedy was highly upvoted.</p>

<p>Why are you constantly attempting to start a witch hunt against Bear? I dunno what he did to you, but a 6 month old troll and some jokes made by the conspiratard mod team (I ctrl f&#39;d his name through the list of posts and couldn&#39;t find anything by bear himself) don&#39;t really change that you are using 2 old pieces of information you have used month in and month out to continue this bizarre attack on another user. I just don&#39;t get why though, is it because he&#39;s pro-Israel?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whjat question? Of course I don&#39;t support people mocking peoples deaths. What a ridiculous assumption to make just beacuse I&#39;m calling you out for creating witch hunts every month. You literally caws-paw for and defend people from white-rights, if we&#39;re going by your definition of &quot;caws paw&quot;. So might not want to make such huge assumptions. I don&#39;t even know or speak to jcm whats his face or the ghostofwhatever, and I did not mention them. Try to stick to the actual subject of the thread you poosted.</p>

<p>I noticed you didn&#39;t respond to literally any of my points or the accusation that you re-use this information and wait for Bear&#39;s name to come up in conspiracy before posting this exact thread. Telling.</p>

<p>Then if anyone argues with you, you bring up something completely unrelated like the Rachel Corrie thing, which has nothing to do with bear or his trolling or myself. Or some random thread from EPS? What has that got to do with bipolarbear, who is actually one of the few libertarians that browses conspiratard? I don&#39;t think he really browses EPS/ELS much, he must be a glutton for punishment if he does.  </p>
