       A few well choreographed actors either running away or else injured at the area where the 'bomb' went off provides a photo opp for a photographer. Everything else they can probably get from people leaving the area.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'bomb' was never going to be powerful enough to actually injury anyone near the explosion - without crisis actors the whole thing would've been even more of a joke. They were necessary to give the appearance that the blast was more destructive than it actually was.

       Because they needed to sell the gore and fear.  TPTB couldn't just leave that up to chance and "hope" that there would be blood and limbs flailing about.  They had to

       that the MSM and the cameras caught people dismembered with painted blood on them, etc.

       To me, I believe having actors in the first place leaves room for conspiracy theories. If you don't want the American public to learn that this is fake why put them there? Because if there are actors, there's a trail that the bombing COULD have been faked. It's hard for me to find the words to explain what I'm trying to say haha

       Oh most definitely.  You actually can't have actors in an event like this WITHOUT it actually being a something which was staged - which ties very much in with it being a conspiracy theory.

       No one is saying he didn't.  That's besides the point.  The question isn't whether he lost his legs or not.  The question is
       <em>
        when
       </em>
       exactly did it happen?  There seems to be quite a bit of evidence indicating that it wasn't during the Boston bombings.

       That said, it would seem that you might be a new user to this sub then, as there was quite a bit of info that came out here during the time of the Boston bombings showing how the photos and footage of Bauman during the attack were in no way whatsoever consistent with what ACTUALLY happens to an individual who actually suffers those kinds of injuries IN THAT MOMENT.  There was a really long post - that one might even be able to find on Google - where some medical doctor/practitioner type says they've been an ER type and have seen injuries like this before and analyzes specifically how the body reacts to femur and tibia injuries and details how those injuries look, what happens, how patients react, etc, etc...and he/she mentioned that ZERO of that was consistent with how Bauman acted or how his injuries looked
       <em>
        independent of his reaction
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There were actually a few posts like that - on Reddit and on the internet in general.  Reading through a few of them, it seemed to cast quite a bit of significant doubt that Bauman received his injuries as a result of the Boston bombing itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe there is any question whatsoever that Bauman's legs are no more from the knee area down.  I think no one questions that.  It's not about that, however.  It's about HOW it happened and WHEN it happened.  A lot of people feel his injuries - legitimate as they certainly seem to be - had nothing whatsoever to do with the Boston bombing.

       I have seen many of those posts as I was addicted to this sub during the boston bombing. As I do not quite believe the official story. However , none of this so called evidence is anything convincing to me, people opinions is all they are these are not considered evidence none of it would be anything admissible in a court appearance as it is literally all heresay and circumstantial. A smoking gun so to speak has to be a 100%sure thing, exposing a flaw or truth or lack therof.

       Some of it is common sense - not just "people's opinions".  Blood DOES gush out uncontrollably if your femoral artery is severed.  People DON'T tend to live for very long if they have that kind of injury.  These are facts.  Bones DON'T tend to have
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       white showing if they have that type of injury (and I recall seeing a bit of white bone in some of the Bauman pics).
      </p>
      <p>
       One doesn't really need to be an "expert" to know these things, and one shouldn't really need an "expert" to state these things before one understands the validity of the statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, for whatever it's worth, it technically IS actually evidence, and it IS actually admissible in court if the "opinion" is that of an actual expert.  Additionally, it's actually not hearsay and circumstantial, as it's based on visual, photographic evidence.  Nothing hearsay about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, going back and forth on this issue is neither here nor there and doesn't really matter to me one way or the other - i.e. I have
       <em>
        no
       </em>

      <p>
       Not saying you're one who denies that.  I don't know one way or the other.  Just saying that whether Boston was a FF attack or not (which I think it was) is actually an entirely moot point, as even if it wasn't, there have been SOOO many
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       , factual, verifiable FF attacks staged by TPTB on the 99% that no one in their right mind can rightfully say that this planet isn't generally run by very,
       <em>

       I have seen almost all of these and many are indeed convincing  but that still isn't enough for me. Now I am however convinced this whole things is not as it is reported and such. I love all of the unanswered questions about this but I am defiantly less convinced than with the sandy hook conspiracy. That one holds more unanswered questions than I can count on my hands.

      <p>
       One possible agenda - though likely not the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       one - can involve a simply overtaking of the population slowly but surely by TPTB.  The Boston bombings resulted in an immediate temporary police lock down of the entire surrounding area where people were effectively under the type of police state that TPTB could possibly be working on enacting on a far greater, national scale.  Boston could have just been a dress rehearsal for the real thing nationally-speaking and TPTB could have just been using it as a basic "dry run" before they go "fully operational" on a much larger scale.  TPTB were also testing out public reaction to that type of city-wide lock down so as to be able to assess things better for larger operations in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one theory anyway.

       I'm not aware of any "Russian connection".  As far as the older brother being/going "crazy", that should be taken with a very soluble grain of salt, as what the MSM says
       <em>
        cannot

       by any means be trusted.  Maybe he became crazy after some police torture or some other PTB manipulation.  Who knows?

       There were posts mentioning how there is no way this specific type of injury could have been that clean.  It was mentioned that blood would have been gushing uncontrollably everywhere - very different than what was shown in the pictures.  The massive blood flow that would have resulted wouldn't have been able to be easily and casually pinched off by the cowboy hat-wearing "bystander" who was shown in the pictures (and whose identity was revealed to be someone other than who he and the MSM reported him to be), and Bauman himself would have been unconscious from the constant loss of blood in but a few moments if this had really happened - to say nothing about the likelihood of his unconsciousness coming simply from the sheer shock of the injury itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all valid things that were cited.  I'm not saying Bauman was definitely and without a doubt a crisis actor plant by TPTB as they staged their latest FF attack on the public, but - again - there seems to be quite a bit of evidence that really does call into question the legitimacy of what the MSM reported as having happened on that day.

       Jeff bauman at exact location. Now don't get me wrong this whole situation stinks and the lack of evidence against the brothers is astounding, but I find it appalling that people say these things about a man who has been through so much. It makes me wonder of he is even aware people think he is an actor.

       "RealiZe that whatever he went through might not have happened" to this my point is that everyone on here is seeing some inconsistencies and possible problems with the story and instead of doubting that this really happened to Jeff they go straight past that and right to he is an actor and faked this. People don't refer to him as victim or possible victim or even piccolo actor, but these titles are "tragedy actor Jeff bauman yards yards yada" we all speak with devotion to what we believe like we are experts, I myself am guilty as I 100% believe what happened to bauman happened. The rest of that day I am not sold on, I believe he may be a casualty of a conspiracy but certainly not an actor. See there I go using that word without its meaning. Not one of should be certain.

       The fact of the matter is that if the Bauman was a plant, then that
       <em>
        necessarily
       </em>
       means he was a paid actor though.  You have to realize that if what he went through
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       happen during the Boston bombings, then that NECESSARILY means that he was put their as a paid plant.  His being an actor is actually a direct consequence if he did indeed receive his injuries BEFORE the Boston bombings.

      <p>
       And that is because even though it IS indeed a sad thing that he FOR WHATEVER REASON got in the type of accident that left him without his legs, to
       <em>
        use
       </em>
       that injury to be a co-conspirator in an act as absolutely heinous as the Boston bombings false flag is a despicable, deplorable thing, and simply being "a poor amputee" is no excuse for involving yourself in.  If Boston WAS a false flag attack, and if Bauman WAS indeed a crisis actor, then that is a 100% horrible, horrible act that he committed - amputee or not - because he is being directly responsible for driving this nation further into the ground of despotism.  You don't see that?

      <p>
       If there's a murderer walking down the street wanting to kill your kid and I KNEW that, and while walking down the street he approaches me and asks me where you live and I actually point out your house to him and he goes in there and kills your kid, then even though it wasn't I who killed your kid, I am 100% liable for the crime he committed because I was a party to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That might not be THE best, cleanest example, but the point here is that if Boston WAS indeed a false flag - and it seems like it was a FF - and Bauman DID indeed receive his injuries

       the incident - which it does indeed seem like he might have - then that means he's agreeing to take part in an act AGAINST the American people.  That is a heinous action and DOES deserve to be prosecuted.

       Well, I certainly leave room for the possibility that I could be wrong in anything I say.  That's part of the reason I kept saying "IF he did such and such, etc, etc" above.  You have to realize that we live in a country that is, again, overrun by evil, nefarious forces, and given that 911 is a 100% false flag, and that false flag resulted in the murder of over 3,000 innocent victims just like you and me, you can't blame anyone for assuming that incidents like what happened in Boston weren't a false flag operation also.

       A decent portion of the American public has been starting to wake up to the fact that we are under attack...by our OWN COUNTRY to a large extent.  It is not unreasonable at this point to have many individuals questioning whether what happened in Boston was a FF attack or not.

       I'm nowhere near as convinced.

       No one is saying he didn't.  That's besides the point.  The question isn't whether he lost his legs or not.  The question is
       <em>
        when
       </em>
       exactly did it happen?  There seems to be quite a bit of evidence indicating that it wasn't during the Boston bombings.

       tl;dr:  Whoosh.
