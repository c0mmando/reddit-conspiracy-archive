You vehemently deny anyone with conventional explanations for your conspiracy theories, and then someone chimes in, saying, &quot;Being a [such-and-such] for <em>n</em> years, this explanation isn&#39;t the case.&quot; And you don&#39;t question their credentials at all, you just upvote them to the top because their words allow your conspiracy theory to continue as always. I thought you guys were skeptics? How is it that you can doubt things that are told to you by supposedly trustworthy people in places of power, yet you trust, without a second thought, the words of a random and unkown person on an internet forum that you&#39;ve never met in your life, and for all you know, could be disseminating misinformation? I don&#39;t understand you, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and I honestly cannot take you seriously, with all the double standards, selective hearing, and sensationalized posts.</p>

<p>I can understand this.  A good number of us in this sub primarily use the new tab to try to view this sub with out the score clouding our judgment of it.  And these posts (as your finding out) get downvoted quickly.  I&#39;d recommend using the new tab not only here, but also on any other sub that may have some political content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen the whole &quot;prove who you say you are&quot; thing crop up a lot lately (although admittedly I haven&#39;t been a redditor or subscribed to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for all that long).  I&#39;ve asked the question multiple times, just what exactly constitutes &quot;proof,&quot; and I&#39;ve never gotten a satisfactory response.</p>

<p>For example, i&#39;m a Submarine Warfare Officer in the Navy.  I can guarantee that a submarine didn&#39;t shoot down TWA Flight 800 like I&#39;ve heard some people suggest.  I&#39;m certified as a Nuclear Engineer Officer by the Naval Reactors, so I know that while Fukushima is a problem, it&#39;s not killing us all as I type this like some would lead you to believe.  I know someone who lost a foot at the Boston bombing, so I&#39;m <em>pretty</em> sure that wasn&#39;t fake.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m pretty sure that whatever proof is requested that I&#39;m (1) who I say I am and (2) not a shill is not going to intersect with my comfort level for privacy.  Maybe it would, maybe it wouldn&#39;t.  But I&#39;ve never gotten a straight answer.</p>

<p>The name calling and accusations on both sides of the aisle need to stop for there to be any meaningful discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, groupthink just kinda happens. It&#39;s hard to fight human nature. But I&#39;ve noticed the situation as well. You could try a different sub, preferably smaller, and see if you like that more. Other than that you could try using RES to label users varying degrees of critical thinking or whatever and just avoid the threads that have too many with a low critical thinking &quot;score&quot;.</p>

<p>Of course, then comes the problem of &quot;even a broken clock is right twice a day&quot;</p>
