       The Manchurian Candidate (1962) is basically the best movie about Conspiracy I have ever seen. They managed to show how people are being hypnotized, how the western government was connected to the eastern governments, and what kind of presidents we have in our countries. If you know a better movie, that is capable of explainnig how things are, feel free to post it here.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't understand, is why they tried to make such a silly remake. They called it still The Manchurian Candidate (2004), but it is nothing like the original, it is missing vital information, and they changed the most interesting and true part about hypnosys with some silly micro chip implanted in the brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the difference between two movies shows how things have changed in Hollywood. Before it was possible to think about serious movies that would try to explain something to the viewer, now it seems that they are only capable to make complete bullshit that is making no sense at all.

       I haven't seen the original movie, but the remake actually really affected me. If you understand how systematic trauma and PTSD-level experiences can be used to induce memory dissociation and personality fragmentation/compartmentalization, then allow the deep insertion of trance suggestion and setup for the use of 'trigger' events to induce or recall alter-states...well, the goosebumps should come up. It stunned me, concerning how well it's medically understood and how it can ultimately be used for military purposes. I'll have to watch the original!

       The problem is that they omitted many facts form the original, and made it become too abstract, not based on scientifical evidences. There was really no reason to keep the original title.

       While I haven't seen the original movie, you should definitely check out the movie They Live. It's a movie about the average person being taken advantage of and being unable to see the world as it truly is.

       Thank for the effort dude, but you are talking about sci-fi. This movie it is not sci-fi, it is about real life facts that people were unaware of.

       This is accurate regarding the evolution of mind control techniques and technologies, albeit microchips are now obsolete. In the Sinatra version, hypnotic trance and trigger words were the gold standard for mind control. Dr. Jose Delgado of Yale was then able to exert an incredible amount of control using stimoceivers (implants), but he, eventually, said that he could get the same results using only shaped electromagnetic fields- making implants obsolete.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also now have proof that the microwave auditory effect has been weaponized- allowing for silent hypnosis without the victim even being aware such a technology is being deployed. This could also be achieved with directed ultrasonic sound or EEG Cloning through S-Quad (Silent Sound Spread Spectrum). Mind control experiments no longer need to be done on POWs, or even on people aware they're being experimented on.

       Personally I am only aware about the low frequency sound gun, that induces dementia and crazyness in victim's minds. I laways consider michrochips implants to be abstract bullshit, like the stories about lizards.

       It is all very strange, there is an old video on YouTube, where JFK is syaing literally that there is a huge conspiracy, that no one would believe, unless there are serious proofs avaiable. Because the conspiracy itself is so crazy. Unfortunately I don't remeber the link, but you might try to type "Kennedy speech about conspiracy".

       You've said it well. The Frank Sinatra version was a great movie. The remake would better never have been made at all. Film makers have been dumbed down (look at such idiots as Spike Lee and Quinten Tarantino), and audiences have been dumbed down, so that even if there were great film makers still around to make great movies, it is unlikely that modern audiences would have the attention span to watch them.

       I don't quite understand what Spike Lee and Quentin Tarantino have to do with conspiracy movies. But you are right, the majority of what Hollywood has made after the year 2000 is obviously dumbed down from the previous standards. And the new generation of moviegoers are being given mainly stupid movies in order to quit thinking or knowing.

       Spike Lee and Quinton Tarantino are just two examples of directors who aren't very bright, and who make simplistic violent movies with no higher message.

       Tarantino is an idiot. What are the messages in his movies? Hate whitey? Punch people in the face? Nazis are bad? Steal money? He makes vapid action movies with no message or higher intention. He's just pushing the violence porn buttons of the zombies.

       You're entitled to your own opinion so to each their own. But there are dozens of other more popular directors that are doing damage to societies ideals and values. Tarantino makes entertaining movies and has fun doing it, his movies are pretty widely accepted by a lot of different people as great, not just the 'zombies'. Though I see what you mean.

       If you read what the OP had to say, you will discover that we are talking about how Hollywood these days seems incapable of making movies that have any real value, such as the original
       <em>
        Manchurian Candidate
       </em>
       , which dealt with political corruption, mind control, loyalty, Communist subversion, and other very important themes. Tarantino is a very good example of what Hollywood celebrates today -- mindless violent trash, with no higher message or greater value to society.

       I guess. But you can apply that to any film if you generalize it like that. My point is that Tarantino makes a different kind of film that is of his own unique style.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can say he uses pointless violence and all that but why does every movie necessitate a deeper meaning to it? He has him on style of goofy over the top violent movies. People who appreciate films enjoy his movies because on the surface they can be enjoyed by most but have very deep dialogue and he puts a tremendous amount of research and development into his character and movies. The violence in all his movies is zany and over the top on purpose, that's the point. And the dialogue in his movies like Inglourious Bastards and Reservoir Dogs are not just to fill in time between action scenes, they are much more intelligent than the average movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely agree that Hollywood is shit and only produces movies that either dumb you down or are some form of propaganda. But my point is that Tarantino doesn't attempt to be like that, he makes his own movies that a large amount of people enjoy because they are genuinely good films. When I think shit Hollywood movies like you are speaking of I think of White House Down, Zero Dark Thirty, Argo, and others of the such.

       Tarantino is one of the popular guys, but his movies are still trash, which is why he's a good example of how far Hollywood has fallen in its ideals. Decades ago, directors at least tried to present thoughtful films about important social issues. When has Tarantino ever done this? When has he even tried to deal with an important social or philosophical question? Never, that's when. He grinds out his slick violence, and takes his money to the bank. It's sad that he is defended. It shows how far we've fallen as a society.

       It is always the same trick called Divide and Conquer. They were doing it since the beginning. First politics and religions, politics was very easy, they started with left vs right, then Christianity vs Judaism vs Islamism, plus Christianism vs Satanism, then they proceeded with social systems, like Capitalism vs Socialism, or Communism vs Fascism. Or biological divisions based on ethnicity or races. Or social divisions based on rich and poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no really thesis or antithesis. It always depends from what side you are able to analyse the situation. The best way is always to stay neutral and keep comprehending that it is just all bullshit in order to make unaware, indoctrinated people fight each other to no end, in order to exterminate each other. They are still continuing to find new ways to divide people even now.
