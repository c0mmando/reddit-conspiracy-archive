       Why hasn't he released information on a larger scale? Why doing it little by little? I mean, think about how last year we still got angry because Facebook didn't erase all our information upon deleting the profile, and how gradually we've come not to be specially angry, but very much used to the idea that the NSA is basically spying on the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is Snowden's actual agenda in easing us into this state of affairs?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd really like to know your opinion on the subject, and on Snowden in general.

       The guy still works for the NSA. This is the government's greatest operational experiment. Let's see how the world reacts when we tell them that they're all being spied on. You have to see this from "their" perspective. What's reality and what's an illusion. How does a person act when they believe to be spied on? Do they resume most criminal behavior, or do they act more conservatively because they may have greater chance of being caught? We live in the mother-fucking Matrix.

       He could just be an actor for all I know.  I do know we are going through a period called "externalization of hierarchy", which in essence means the true structure of the world is being revealed so we may reject it in favor of a world government.

       I think he's a triple agent as well.  He'd be dead if they wanted him too.   His planes would have went down in the beginning if he was major trouble.  Hes controlled opposition controlling the informational flow regarding the expanse of our police state/world.   If Russia and the US arent just foes just show, he is giving them misinformation.

       I like that the OP is questioning things, but only snowden &amp; his partners would know the answers to most of these, but here is my opinion.

        Why hasn't he released information on a larger scale?

       As I comprehend it his partner greenwald is setting up a tower of ego cashing in on greed while building a way to slowly seed the masses to grow people to become acclimatized to the snoopers.

       To milk all they can while slowly only exposing gentle handling of the publics private teats. If the NSA had some real press dudes drop hard bombs quick, then shit would hit the fan hard &amp; be like Watergate in response. IMO snowden is likely a snowjob to provide a controlled release on the govs terms to dull perception by slowly acclimatizing the herd their cold ill milk machine hands on their private teats.
      </p>
      <p>
       The eN-S-A has IMO been violating the constitution for a long long time &amp; they fear a big leak that could come in these information highway times. This whole spectacle on the worlds puppet stage is IMO a controlled drama like most major things are.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NFL owns both leagues &amp; cares not who wins, they are the house like a casino. skull &amp; bones own left/kerry &amp; right/bush politics come after college clubs. All seen on the large stage is set up &amp; guided to happen, often without all participants being fully in the know. Courses can be plotted before hand &amp; the house always wins in the end. A wise grifter or sham man can work people to like a Haitian vodou dude does a zombie or a hypnotist works many susceptible minds found in in all crowds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think snowden is likely still active &amp; in the know. Not sure about greenwald, but IMO both would have been neutralized long ago, if such a source of unknown revelation threatened the eN-S-A. Head honchos could have their ponchos removed exposing their bare asses &amp; to sweat a mob boss with that kind of power most often leads to silencing the weaker &amp;/or smaller party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden has no college degree &amp; held jobs &amp; security clearances a GED does not [IMO rarely if ever] earn. IMO his real record includes psyops in the military &amp; a degree loaded with police state oriented classes &amp; is not ever going to be known without the ill machine dying.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What is Snowden's actual agenda in easing us into this state of affairs?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       IMO to use fear like today on Xmass to build tolerance to removals of freedoms ignoring constitutional laws by acclimatizing the public to the fact they are already messed with.

The military drones little kids &amp; few blink &amp; nothing major to see so far, just some tiny snapshots of them taking little sips of moonshine casting sparse light here &amp; there slowly trick'ling. They then lie claiming snooping a few tiny sips of rotgut is mostly harmless like cannabis which is very needed for some medical conditions. They claim the

       I find it hard to believe that the very same machine he describes as being enormously sophisticated and overwhelmingly entrenched somehow managed to fall asleep long enough for one young individual to steal all it's most critical secrets in an act of super hacking, and was conveniently centralized/non-compartmentalized for him to download. It sounds like a crap video game, or movie storyline. He's an announcer, saying just enough to get our attention...for whatever comes next I suspect.

       I have always thought of snowden to be a plant in order to spur this and get more money to bolster security against future 'snowdens' and enact a tighter security protocol internally and with contracting companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       From here on if someone actually wants to 'pull a snowden' the security measures and background checks will require more than one person to authenticate to get said data meaning the 'enemy' would need TWO on the 'inside' wanting to obtain data of which they would use to turncoat.

       That wouldn't make any sense. If you are spying on someone, why would you want them to know about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless of course they aren't spying on us at all, and they just wanted to create the illusion of a panopticon. However, that wouldn't make much sense either because criminals would stop using electronic communication.

       I don't buy it. I think Snowden is genuine.

       Facebook used to be quite powerful for organizing things like the occupy movement and flash mobs.  It was really the poor mans tool of mass broadcast that hitherto only the powers that be had.  As individuals started exploiting it, the NSA came into the room and FB crawled into bed with them.  FB then started changing its code, limiting the amount of people one could communicate with and the ability to do such.  Then the whole NSA thing came out and people started closing down their FB accounts in droves...  I think that statement you made about creating the illusion of a panopticon, although I'm sure there is one, is simultaneously being used quite successfully.  ...case in point, TPTB didn't like the poor man having access to such a powerful tool, it was a threat to them.  So, they put fear into everyone that everything is being watched, especially FB with its backdoors and such, and people voluntarily let go of a tool that was more powerful than anything they've ever had before in its ability to organize and coordinate mass amounts of people.

       If he was legit the news organizations wouldn't have aired it, its that simple.  You've not studied the situation enough.  The Guardian asked the NSA prior to releasing any information if there was a security risk, they said no.  Meaning they were okay with it being released meaning its a charade.

       I don't think this is the case. I could be wrong though, do you have a source?
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming you're correct and Snowden is just a shill, what was the purpose? How does this help the NSA? It seems to me the story has changed public opinion on government surveillance, which should lead to lower budgets and less power.

       There is a video of the guardian editor that ran the article talking about how she contacted the NSA to see if it was okay if they ran the story, I don't have the source it's been posted to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       many times.  You'd have to figure out her name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden is more than likely a shill because he is serving several purposes for the NWO.  First he is creating a chilling effect.  Just like in
       <em>
        1984
       </em>
       , everyone KNEW they were under surveillance so they acted accordingly. Secondly, the information he "leaked" is turning countries and their citizens even more against the US and they are now turning to the UNelected, UNdemocratic, UNaccountable United Nations, which legitimizes world governance even more to these third world and other western countries' peoples.  Its making the US seem even more like the big bad guy.  WW3 is getting set up, in order to bring about world government they need to have a large conflict or at least the threat of one so that people DEMAND a global government.  Snowden is just there to drive a wedge further between in order to create conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, here's the catch, he is more than likely NOT working for the US govt.  The people surrounding him are agents of George Soros.  Greenwald, Poitras, etc they all work for several Soros funded NGOs like Human Rights Watch(Which are UN shills), and the Open Society Institute among others.
      </p>
      <p>
       They claim his US passport is "revoked" as well, which means nothing unless you are traveling to the US.
