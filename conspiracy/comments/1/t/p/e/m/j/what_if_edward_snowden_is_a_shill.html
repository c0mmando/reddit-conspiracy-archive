    <div class="md"><p>The more info I analyze the more I <a href="http://i.imgur.com/O43yeeH.png">lose hope</a> in agent dope.</p>

<p>I like that the OP is questioning things, but only snowden &amp; his partners would know the answers to most of these, but here is my opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why hasn&#39;t he released information on a larger scale?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I comprehend it his partner greenwald is setting up a tower of ego cashing in on greed while building a way to slowly seed the masses to grow people to become acclimatized to the snoopers. </p>

<p>Big money is rolling in yet no heads are rolling. Seems like a scheme to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why doing it little by little? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To milk all they can while slowly only exposing gentle handling of the publics private teats. If the NSA had some real press dudes drop hard bombs quick, then shit would hit the fan hard &amp; be like Watergate in response. IMO snowden is likely a snowjob to provide a controlled release on the govs terms to dull perception by slowly acclimatizing the herd their cold ill milk machine hands on their private teats. </p>

<p>The eN-S-A has IMO been violating the constitution for a long long time &amp; they fear a big leak that could come in these information highway times. This whole spectacle on the worlds puppet stage is IMO a controlled drama like most major things are. </p>

<p>The NFL owns both leagues &amp; cares not who wins, they are the house like a casino. skull &amp; bones own left/kerry &amp; right/bush politics come after college clubs. All seen on the large stage is set up &amp; guided to happen, often without all participants being fully in the know. Courses can be plotted before hand &amp; the house always wins in the end. A wise grifter or sham man can work people to like a Haitian vodou dude does a zombie or a hypnotist works many susceptible minds found in in all crowds.</p>

<p>I personally think snowden is likely still active &amp; in the know. Not sure about greenwald, but IMO both would have been neutralized long ago, if such a source of unknown revelation threatened the eN-S-A. Head honchos could have their ponchos removed exposing their bare asses &amp; to sweat a mob boss with that kind of power most often leads to silencing the weaker &amp;/or smaller party. </p>

<p>Snowden has no college degree &amp; held jobs &amp; security clearances a GED does not [IMO rarely if ever] earn. IMO his real record includes psyops in the military &amp; a degree loaded with police state oriented classes &amp; is not ever going to be known without the ill machine dying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is Snowden&#39;s actual agenda in easing us into this state of affairs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IMO to use fear like today on Xmass to build tolerance to removals of freedoms ignoring constitutional laws by acclimatizing the public to the fact they are already messed with. </p>

<p>He is yelling &quot;big brother is on drugs!!!&quot; with no crack pipe nor needle in their arm. The military drones little kids &amp; few blink &amp; nothing major to see so far, just some tiny snapshots of them taking little sips of moonshine casting sparse light here &amp; there slowly trick&#39;ling. They then lie claiming snooping a few tiny sips of rotgut is mostly harmless like cannabis which is very needed for some medical conditions. They claim the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_of_the_dog">&quot;hair of the dog&quot;</a> cures a hangover &amp; it does, but the rotgut causes the hangover. people often create their own enemies <sup>&amp;</sup> <sup>cunning</sup> <sup>people</sup> <sup>set</sup> <sup>up</sup> <sup>falls</sup> <sup>&amp;</sup> <sup>scenarios</sup> <sup>beforehand.</sup> The reply so far is lackluster with no police action as they claim they are using soft safe drugs that are <strong>federally illegal, but not illegal in the surveillance state</strong>. The public freaks out less &amp; less as the feds make their &quot;hidden &amp; to not ever be seen in a non controlled manner&quot; ill ways seem like their seen tiny weak leaked ill ways are harmless like weed. Soon most of the masses are likely to accept &amp; tolerate snooping, as the keepers claim most are rarely snooped on as tolerance of snooping on others grows into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...">&quot;they came for&quot;</a>...</p>

<p>From here on if someone actually wants to &#39;pull a snowden&#39; the security measures and background checks will require more than one person to authenticate to get said data meaning the &#39;enemy&#39; would need TWO on the &#39;inside&#39; wanting to obtain data of which they would use to turncoat.</p>

<p>Unless of course they aren&#39;t spying on us at all, and they just wanted to create the illusion of a panopticon. However, that wouldn&#39;t make much sense either because criminals would stop using electronic communication. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facebook used to be quite powerful for organizing things like the occupy movement and flash mobs.  It was really the poor mans tool of mass broadcast that hitherto only the powers that be had.  As individuals started exploiting it, the NSA came into the room and FB crawled into bed with them.  FB then started changing its code, limiting the amount of people one could communicate with and the ability to do such.  Then the whole NSA thing came out and people started closing down their FB accounts in droves...  I think that statement you made about creating the illusion of a panopticon, although I&#39;m sure there is one, is simultaneously being used quite successfully.  ...case in point, TPTB didn&#39;t like the poor man having access to such a powerful tool, it was a threat to them.  So, they put fear into everyone that everything is being watched, especially FB with its backdoors and such, and people voluntarily let go of a tool that was more powerful than anything they&#39;ve ever had before in its ability to organize and coordinate mass amounts of people.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is the case. I could be wrong though, do you have a source?</p>

<p>Assuming you&#39;re correct and Snowden is just a shill, what was the purpose? How does this help the NSA? It seems to me the story has changed public opinion on government surveillance, which should lead to lower budgets and less power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a video of the guardian editor that ran the article talking about how she contacted the NSA to see if it was okay if they ran the story, I don&#39;t have the source it&#39;s been posted to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> many times.  You&#39;d have to figure out her name.</p>

<p>Snowden is more than likely a shill because he is serving several purposes for the NWO.  First he is creating a chilling effect.  Just like in <em>1984</em>, everyone KNEW they were under surveillance so they acted accordingly. Secondly, the information he &quot;leaked&quot; is turning countries and their citizens even more against the US and they are now turning to the UNelected, UNdemocratic, UNaccountable United Nations, which legitimizes world governance even more to these third world and other western countries&#39; peoples.  Its making the US seem even more like the big bad guy.  WW3 is getting set up, in order to bring about world government they need to have a large conflict or at least the threat of one so that people DEMAND a global government.  Snowden is just there to drive a wedge further between in order to create conflict.  </p>

<p>Now, here&#39;s the catch, he is more than likely NOT working for the US govt.  The people surrounding him are agents of George Soros.  Greenwald, Poitras, etc they all work for several Soros funded NGOs like Human Rights Watch(Which are UN shills), and the Open Society Institute among others.   </p>

<p>They claim his US passport is &quot;revoked&quot; as well, which means nothing unless you are traveling to the US. </p>
