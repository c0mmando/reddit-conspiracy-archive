    <div class="md"><p>I have been here quite a while and have never been banned. Even arguing on here while drunk occasionally. </p>

<p>I remember the last wave when confidence in r/conspiracy was getting bad. Wow you talk about a conspiracy. Everyone got pissed and started making new subreddits and unsubscribing. I even made a fuck you I&#39;m out post (and didn&#39;t get banned). I think the mods were being blamed for too many shills after the shootings. The r/conspiratard anti-semitic  conspiracy got brought up. A couple people were really leading the charge...</p>

<p>I sure do feel deja vu. Makes you wonder if they are choreographed incidences to create division in the truth seeking community. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that our collective force is what keeps r/conspiracy free from the thought police. </p>

<p>With division they will acquire a foothold. If disinfo doesn&#39;t get debunked and the thought police aren&#39;t outnumbered and quelled, then they will slowly gain control of the group think of r/conspiracy and turn it into crap.</p>

<p>With that being said, I barely know about this new situation and don&#39;t really care.  </p>

<p>look at my history</p>

<p>some negative points from this</p>

<p>PROPAGANDA ON REDDIT
CENSORSHIP ON REDDIT
DO YOU BELIEVE THE &quot;OFFICIAL STORY&quot; ON 9/11?
DO YOU BELIEVE THE &quot;OFFICIAL STORY&quot; ON JFK?
QUESTION EVERYTHING
CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL RATING IS BELOW 10%
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR AMERICANS TO GET MAD?
Looking at the state of (post-9/11) America today — the perpetual War on Terror, empire building in the name of “humanitarian regime change” of democratically elected leaders in foreign countries, the Department of Homeland Security and its Transportation Security Administration goon squad, the National Defense Authorization Act and its ability to disappear American citizens suspected of terrorism without due process of law, the National Security Administration’s big brother SURVEILLANCE STATE, the militarization of our police in an ever-expanding police state, the common core, the Federal Reserve’s runaway monopoly money printer and a nation hanging on the verge of economic collapse, the crackdown on food freedom. And when revolutionaries like MICHAEL HASTINGS are assassinated like MALCOM X, MLK JR, JFK, RFK, AND TUPAC, it only strengthens the flame yearning for resistance and justice.
A former insider at the World Bank, ex-Senior Counsel Karen Hudes, says the global financial system is dominated by a small group of corrupt, power-hungry figures centered around the privately owned U.S. Federal Reserve. The network has seized control of the** media** to cover up its crimes, too, she explained. In an interview with The New American, Hudes said that when she tried to blow the whistle on multiple problems at the World Bank, she was fired for her efforts. Now, along with a network of fellow whistleblowers, Hudes is determined to expose and end the corruption. And she is confident of success. Citing an explosive 2011 Swiss study published in the PLOS ONE journal on the “network of global corporate control,” Hudes pointed out that a small group of entities — mostly financial institutions and especially central banks — exert a massive amount of influence over the international economy from behind the scenes. “What is really going on is that the world’s resources are being dominated by this group,” she explained, adding that the “corrupt power grabbers” have managed to dominate the media as well.“They’re being allowed to do it. - See more at: <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/world-bank-whistleblower-reveals-how-the-global-elite-rule-the-world/5353130#sthash.hDfvgpY4.dpuf">http://www.globalresearch.ca/world-bank-whistleblower-reveals-how-the-global-elite-rule-the-world/5353130#sthash.hDfvgpY4.dpuf</a>
