       I've been a redditor since the summer and I just want you all to know that this community is important since it enforces what a majority of us know to be true. That our government, our economy, and media are a trigemony. A hegemony is where the government and the ideology (church) have the same agenda and operate together, which is illegal. What we have going on is much worse. They are all in cahoots, all corrupt. The current state of America is hypocritical to the ideals it was founded upon and is fascist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to let you all know that I've discussed many of the subjects on here with my professor and fellow students in my media, state and society class. We spoke a lot of Snowden, the NSA/CIA/DEA, the Constitution, the War on Terror but even went further into issues not discussed in the mainstream media such as depleted uranium and chem-trails. These are all true issues that we certainly do face. So stay Brave in this New World. Our media may be straight propaganda, but there are many educated Americans who have their glasses on.

       I'd like to point out that they didn't mention the thousands of engineers and architects "striving to find the truth" because the truth has already been discovered. As it turns out, buildings collapse when you fly a fucking plane into them.

       Plane? No. Debris from the other buildings collapsing? Yes. That, plus a ragingly hot office fire meant that the building just collapsed on itself.

       A 50-story building, with critical load-bearing girders having been heated by a massive fire over several hours? That would be enough to be bring the building down on its own. After having been hit by tons of WTC debris, it's collapse was a sure thing. Also, your rousing cry for eugenics against the mentally handicapped was a nice touch.

       Again, a building that has had its structure heated to a point where the girder's integrity is compromised can collapse very rapidly. Besides, in the absence of any other theories, I fail to see why doubt should be cast here.

       Hey, when the Jewish illuminati lizard people take over, we'll see who's laughing then. In all seriousness, if you look at my account history, you'll see that, if I'm a shill, then I'm a very active one who legitimately thinks that you 'tards are full of shit.

       Fireproofing was designed to keep it from collapsing long enough for people to get out, not to keep it standing after a several hour long, uncontrolled fire. That, plus the massive fucking in the side of the building made it collapse, not a controlled demolition by lizard people.

       Hardy har har.  Lizard people.  Your juvenile humor is soooo funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're just talking out of your ass.  You're some ill-informed conspiratard troll that couldn't care less about facts and the truth so you're just leaving your turd droppings here so we all have to step around them and waste our time with your poorly formed 'thoughts.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Show me how fireproofing only works for a few hours.  If a fully fireproofed beam is subjected to 1200 degree fire are you telling me it will only work for about 8 hours then fail?  How does the fireproofing fail from a "normal" office fire?
      </p>
      <p>
       The official story on the towers is that the fireproofing was ripped off but that's ridiculous as well because only small portions would be ripped off and the steel will still be mostly protected (not to mention it's idiotic to think mostly aluminum planes are going to sever steel beams, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fireproofing is designed to consistently withstand certain temperatures, dipshit.

       There is no precedent for that happening anywhere, ever. Steel framed buildings have survived fires which burned out every single floor, yet they survived. So saying "that would be enough to bring the building down" is just speculation on your part, seeing as it has never happened before.

       Speculation yes. However, it is educated and based on ideas corroborated by the witnesses present. This is as opposed to whatever you guys believe, whether it be the CIA or thermite or a controlled nuclear explosion or really whatever ridiculous bullshit strikes your fancy.

       So you admit that you are spouting bullshit, and you try to divert attention from that by mounting a strawman on "whatever bullshit strikes my fancy". I didn't offer an explanation for how WTC7 came down, so how can I be bullshitting? You are the one making the extraordinary claim - that a 47=floor steel frame building came down in its own footprint after suffering a fire. Prove it or STFU. (Go on, use the NIST report, I double dare you)

       "The fourth branch of the government AKA the media
Seems to now have a retirement plan for ex-military officials.
As if their opinion was at all unbiased.
A machine shouldn't speak for men,
So shut the fuck up you mindless drone!
And you know it's serious
When these same media outfits are spending millions of dollars on a PR campaign
To try to convince you they're fair and balanced
When they're some of the most ignorant, and racist people
Giving that type of mentality a safe haven.
We act like we share in the spoils of war that they do.
We die in wars, we don't get the contracts to make money off 'em afterwards!
We don't get weapons contracts, nigga!
We don't get cheap labor for our companies, nigga!
We are cheap labor, nigga!
Turn off the news and read, nigga!

       Would be better to ban these trolls to try to defend the integrity of this sub.  Why let admitted trolls disrupt a sub like this?
      </p>
      <p>
       You have guys coming over here and saying he's just here to make fun or you "tards," like Kinkodoyle does above, and he gets to vote and participate here yet other legitimate conspiracy users are banned for made up instances of anti semitism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, they play fake victim and act like they are banned for "dissenting" when I can find very few instances of them actually being banned.  Case in point is troll Kinkodoyle above being able to spew his garbage here and over there.

       This is not the definition of a hegemony. A hegemony is, as Oxford Dictionary puts it, "leadership or dominance, especially by one country or social group over others:
