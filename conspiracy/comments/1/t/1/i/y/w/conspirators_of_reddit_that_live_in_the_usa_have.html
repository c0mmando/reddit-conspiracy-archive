    <div class="md"><p>As I recall, the original FEMA camp plan Rex-84 from the 80s was designed by Bush Sr, Oliver North, and the former chief of CA&#39;s state police. He was a perfect candidate for developing a system through which protesting Americans could be locked up in camps in case the military-industrial complex decided to go to war somewhere in Latin America because throughout the 60s and 70s he was well known for locking up and detaining tens of thousands of blacks on arbitrary, unconstitutional bases due to the political instability of those times. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if the East Bay is considered by the PTP to be one of the most likely places to revolt against their rule; it&#39;s full of minorities, poor people, they&#39;re relatively politically aware and urbane. I assume that&#39;s why they built camps out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am active duty USAF and occasionally work as a drop zone controller(mostly during manning-issues, such as the government shutdown and sequester).  Supposedly, there is a FEMA camp in Ft. Polk, AR(there is a dropzone we occasionally operate there) and I know several ATC and Combat Controllers who are very critical of the government and are like-minded thinkers.  I have yet to make the trip to Fort Polk but I am told it is largely abandoned, though there are storage facilities there with numerous buildings and lots, full of military trucks.  Although this may seem suspicious, there are quite a few off-site storage areas around the country that house bulk amounts of vehicles and equipment for disaster relief(I have yet to see combat-related vehicles), most of which are out dated.  Most of the vehicles are HUMVEES, tankers, and supply transport vehicles.</p>

<p>Having asked the guys I know that frequent the area, they have only noted large amounts of old barracks and other facilities, not active structures or guard towers; much less, the personnel needed to man such.  That is not to say they cannot be converted and quickly re-manned.</p>

<p>I have yet to see one face to face or know someone who has, nor has the USAF talked about such encampments(we typically play a supportive roll and are likely seen as too-pussy to handle such operations) but then again, I am not in a &quot;need-to-know&quot; roll/position to openly know this information.</p>

<p>On a side note, just wanted to let you guys know that nearly all of the military members I know are nervous about the future and are extremely critical of what is going on.  I can&#39;t speak for every military member but from what I have heard and what I continue to learn, the military is more than just generally pissed off and the administration knows it.  I just learned today that the USAF will be cutting 25,000 active duty by this time next year.  Force shaping...</p>

All the extra vehicles are National Guard vehicles, Army Reserve vehicles. All the extra storage buildings are for visiting troops that train for JRTC.  The railroads in the surrounding towns (Leesville, Deridder) are always full of HUMVEES and MRAPS.  The base has expanded and contracted every 10 or so years since WWII, which is why there is so much extra space and &quot;abandoned&quot; buildings.</p>

Short of a &#39;looking-glass&#39; device or perhaps an above-top-secret clearance with in-the-know privileges (and thus waivers, contracts, oaths that bind one to an absolute silence presumably), how is anyone to really know? The future is so full of corners and susceptible to so many variables (of forces unknown or unforeseen, events majure or Machiavellian, etc), that it can be speculated about based on present circumstances and extrapolations, but no one scenario has predominance..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As beautiful as that was written, all you said was: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;but you wouldn&#39;t know until it was already happening&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The internet has become the next superweapon- please pay close attention to this next sentence:</p>

<p><em>How easy would it be to disarm an entire country door to door, and city by city - if there were no communication in or out of an area?</em> Better still... what if you only let junk stories on conspiracy forums get out- instantly marginalizing rumors that escape and neutralizing the messengers. (because you can find them in moments.)</p>

<p>Our Military has been training to disarm countries using this exact tactic in two wars over a decade my friend-and most importantly you are nowhere near as battle ready as the people they&#39;ve been fighting. </p>

<p>There would be minimal casualties, and they would&#39;ve been resisting arrest anyway... right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fema camps exist as &quot;emergency disaster relocation&quot; centers, problem is they have a dual-purpose. Can easily be used as detention (concentration) camps. Now, that can be said about any prison or jail too. But FEMA for whatever fucking reason falls under the &#39;Dept of Homeland Security&#39;, not the &#39;Dept of Environment&#39; or whatever. Meaning, if the DHS ever were rounding up &quot;domestic dissenters&quot;, it would be at FEMA camps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the research I have done on them, they do not exist as &quot;FEMA Camps&quot; but are rather existing federal institutes. I have not researched them all, but tried to find real &quot;Fema Camps&quot; in MN and had no luck. Just regular old prisons.  I think the scare with FEMA camps really started after Katrina when it was proposed that we needed these camps around the country to house mass amounts of people in case of an emergency. This was done because the Superdome was a shit storm during Katrina. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the technology that exists today there is no need to create hundreds of FEMA camps. The truth, I believe, is that every suburb and populated area can be converted into a FEMA camp by installing razor wire around certain key areas and creating road blocks. They can probably do this in less than an hour or two and if done in the middle of the night that neighborhood would wake up and be surrounded. With door to door searches and an unarmed and/or passive population the imprisonment would be complete. I believe in the FEMA camp idea but not necessarily in the creation of a huge amount of camps...I do think there are some places that have been prepped for this with inward facing barb wire and the ability to bring in supplies and people on trains or buses but if TPTB decided to round people up they wouldn&#39;t NEED camps...they simply need to state that so and so city or area is now &quot;contaminated&quot; or &quot;infected&quot; or they declare an &quot;outbreak&quot; in it and it is &quot;cordoned off for your safety.&quot; As for eugenics, completely unnecessary to do it in camps, in fact 100% better to do outside camps...if you want an example of what I mean go down to Walgreens and get a flu shot or even better...witness it first hand...go to an old folks home during flu shot season, hang around for a week and watch the bodies roll out! With the unprecedented amount of people getting &quot;shots&quot; without even reading the inserts, how hard would it be to infect a population with something deadly and then start declaring outbreaks and start rounding up the sick or the healthy or the un-vaccinated?...All of it done &quot;for your safety!&quot;</p>
