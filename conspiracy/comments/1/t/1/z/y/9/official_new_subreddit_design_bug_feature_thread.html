As with any new design- it&#39;s work in progress, so please let me know if you find glitches. Screenshots are the most helpful. This design is based off of a new basic reddit design I&#39;m working on called <a href="/r/cleanreddit">/r/cleanreddit</a>. I hope it makes your browsing of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> more enjoyable!</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for being so passionate about these changes everyone. It shows how much you care about the community here. We&#39;ve heard your feedback about the symbology and will be making adjustments to it over the coming days.</p>

<p>Look at the new background. This sub looks like a fucking Masonic lodge sub now. 
I think the mods keep forgetting this is supposed to be an anti-NWO sub, not <em>pro</em>. There is nothing in this design that could be interpreted that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so clearly everyone is against the NWO-wannabe/secret society/skull and bones look, can we come up with a theme that would work?</p>

<p>Brainstorming: </p>

<p>You could go for the redacted document, CLASSIFIED, kind of look, but again, then we&#39;re mimicking the ones we are trying to stand up against.</p>

<p>You could go for a hacker matrix-y type look, but I think that would just be annoying as fuck to read. </p>

<p>I like the work he did on the &quot;clean reddit&quot; subreddit design, the top bar and margins/padding with the divider and space comes off really clean.</p>

<p><strong>Maybe we just need to come up with a &quot;BANKSY political commentary type look&quot;. I&#39;ve seen some great artwork come through this sub -- We need more of a counter-culture feel I think.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hijacking:  Disagree.  The new design is dope.  People are always going to hate shit for the sake of hating it without offering anything better.  Thanks for putting the time in, and as a professional designer I appreciate some of the finer points of what you&#39;ve done.  When I saw it I instantly liked it better than before.  It&#39;s cool.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>on a design point of view it&#39;s better, obviously. But.. on a ideological point of view, and that is what this sub is all about : belief, ideals, discussion, etc. And hidden masonic or whatever ocult simbology is not what we support.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes because looking at his design is going to turn you into a lizard person.  Be careful.  </p>

<p>Watch: This design will stay, and then in a year they&#39;ll change it again, and all the idiots will be back complaining saying &quot;Go back to the old one.&quot;  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why anyone cares, but honestly if you give enough of a shit to comment, the first words you say ought to be &quot;<em>Thanks <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a> for taking time out of your life to work on a forum I use without expecting anything in return and also for putting up with needless abuse from idiots who can&#39;t do a better job and yet will try to argue that you are brainwashing people with the design, and who will express this in a barely literate and paranoid fashion.</em>&quot;  </p>

<p>The design doesn&#39;t make the sub look stupid.  The <em>reaction</em> to the design makes you look stupid though.  It&#39;s an aesthetic that&#39;s relevant, and it looks cool.  The interface is cleaner and there&#39;s thought behind the design.  If your mind is so weak that the subliminal implications of seeing an eyeball actually effect you, again, you&#39;re the one that makes the sub look stupid.  Commenting shaking in your boots about that is embarrassing.  Seriously.</p>

<p>Saying &quot;I fucking hate this shit&quot; like the idiot above me, again, is what makes us look stupid.  </p>

<p>The ONLY relevant criticism I read is that a cleaner aesthetic might help make new users think that the sub is more inviting, which, whatever, that might be relevant.  At least it&#39;s constructive feedback.  But if you feel that way: Get. off. your. ass. and. do. it.   If you&#39;re just going to sit and say &quot;Shit sucks,&quot; you&#39;re being useless.</p>

<p>To the rest of you: Fucking relax. Thank the guy that did FREE work for you, stop being a bunch of jackasses, and go back to fighting lizard people.  There are bigger fucking problems in the world than this design, and if you want to speak and be understood, learn to spell &quot;occult symbology.&quot; Jesus titty fucking Christ.  I love this place but you guys are tiresome as hell sometimes.</p>

<p>He did some awesome free work for all of us, and I guarantee 90% of designers tasked with designing a conspiracy style sub-reddit would go for the mason/secret society look/theme. And while I think it looks cool (damn that masonic eye background thing he had at first was pimp!) you have to get where everyone is coming from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What propaganda techniques have you been taught?</p>

<p>Do you always go with the illogical bridge of conclusion wherein action A leads to result Z for no logical reason?</p>

<p>Equation: Looking at design (action A) = Become Space Lizard ( result Z )</p>

<p>First off, Masons do NOT equal Space Lizards.</p>

<p>Space Lizards are an entire theory on their own, and if you don&#39;t believe in them then it&#39;s not even a part of anything.</p>

<p>The Illuminati Masons are just that, Freemasons who are a part of a secret cabal that controls the world through finance and war and slavery.</p>

<p>People aren&#39;t ragging on the design here, they&#39;re ragging on the logos at the bottom which appear as an homage to the Illuminati.</p>

<p>Damn, you sure do like kissing <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a> on the butt cheeks.</p>

<p>Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with showing appreciation for peoples work, but like seriously are you his personal body guard..........and by body guard I meant alt account. </p>

<p>In this instance, though I appreciate your skill as a graphic designer, YOU ARE the mod who is making our subreddit worse by giving it a seemingly pro-illuminati background.</p>

<p>Like seriously, an all seeing eye in a pyramid with mason shit and hanging feathers like a pagan dream catcher?</p>

<p>What the fuck?</p>

<p>The thing I like about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is that it tries to expose the truth, and the truth has revealed that the Masons are very much not good when you look into who they are, where they&#39;re at, and how they function.</p>

I just appreciate that you took the time to make something to improve a forum I frequent, and that you used your skills and time in a way that benefits me, even though I don&#39;t know you and you owe me nothing.  Cheers for that.  Seriously I do design for a living, I understand what goes into doing something like this, that it takes thought and effort, and it&#39;s also clear that you know what you&#39;re doing and could have spent your time doing any one of an infinite number of other tasks.  So for spending your time on US, as opposed to anything else, on behalf of those who are not feeling so charitable today, I thank you.  </p>

<p>Everyone else: Check yourselves.  You want a better world where people are creative and loving and use their skills for the right reasons instead of chasing profit and selfish gains, and yet when someone does just that, you berate him?  For no good reason?  Cursing and sputtering over CSS? Wtf?  Bunch of hypocrites for the moment ITT, for the moment.  Disappointing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey there, 
thank you for listening about the eyes in the self post. I&#39;m glad it went back to They Live. I think I speak for most when we say we appreciate the time and effort. But as you can guess, we are a sensitive type and are getting cabin fever and you happened to waltz right into the crosshairs.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t hate you. We don&#39;t even know you. But we are glad you listened to at least the eyes in the self posts. they were creepy and I hope after some time you agreed.</p>

<p>Now, lets talk about the background with all that symbolism and how bout the color. I think <a href="/r/cleanreddit">/r/cleanreddit</a> looks pretty with the colors it has. Why not try something along the lines like that sub? I feel many of us would appreciate a less grim looking sub. Based on first reactions, I think people would be skeptical at a sub if it were to be dark and hopeless feeling. </p>

<p>anyway, thank you for what you do.</p>

<p>Not true, i never gave my approval of this design.</p>

<p>I was working on a new CSS for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> a long time with features like userlflair, linkflair and other things.</p>

<p>You can see my CSS at <a href="/r/conspiracycss">/r/conspiracycss</a>.</p>

<p>This CSS is unfinished and the community doesen&#39;t like it, we should rollback to the old CSS and work on a decent CSS not something you have thrown together in 5 minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The boxes that are present in this design as well as some other subreddits that are adopting it does LOOK more professional.   It has nice boxes around all of the items, and it appears more artistic.</p>

<p>However, I don&#39;t think it is as friendly to the eyes for quick scanning and reading as the original design.   The original design doesn&#39;t look as slick, but I think in terms of eyes and presentation of information it is actually easier to read, and scan quickly.</p>

<p>I read r/science quite a bit, but they went to a similar boxy reddit appearance and I stopped reading them as often.   I usually am multi-tasking when I am on reddit.   I am looking and scanning through topics quickly for things that I believe may be of interest while I am either at work, and/or doing some other activity.</p>

<p>I have found first with r/science that this boxy approach is not as conducive to quick scanning.   Furthermore, to make room for the new art it actually allows less topics per screen than the previous version.</p>

<p>I find it more of an eye strain.   This is a personal opinion and I may be totally out of my mind(probably am).   I&#39;ll continue to read here with this or any other scheme you guys decide to use.   I&#39;m one of those IF IT AIN&#39;T BROKE DON&#39;T FIX IT type of guys.   I don&#39;t see this fixing anything that was broke, if it does fix something let me know and maybe I&#39;ll understand why here and r/science did it and shut up. ;)</p>

<p>EDIT: Also thanks for asking for clarification.   If you need me to go into more detail let me know about what, and I&#39;ll dig into it and give you my 2 cents.  I&#39;ll use whatever you decide to use even if it is extremely poor color mixtures. :)</p>

<p>EDIT 2: I did some counts.  r/technology which uses the old look currently fits 15 easily readable topics on my screen.   r/science which uses a scheme similar to the direction you are heading fits 8 topics.   In addition, r/science varies the color of topics which is not that smart.   Sure it looks pretty, but we train our mind to use color as part of our speed sorting and identification process.  When you start making it any ol&#39; color it throws this identification ability out the door.</p>
