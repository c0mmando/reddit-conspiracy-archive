We have had a lot of interest and some good suggestions for additional help and choices have been made accordingly.

<p><a href="/u/SovereignMan">/u/SovereignMan</a> </p>

<p><a href="/u/go1dfish">/u/go1dfish</a></p>

<p>Have all been chosen because of their clean post history and your  recommendations. We hope they can offer us some much needed help with content, comments and technical options. Good luck to them and welcome to the team. </p>

<p>A fourth user is to be given a wild-card trial period. Specifically to &#39;troll hunt&#39; and help us remove unhelpful and abusive content. </p>

<p><a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> will work with the new moderators and hopefully help us with users who come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to derail, slide and abuse our users and posts. This will be a trail period and we will see how we go. <strong>All new mods are expected to contribute and make time for duties</strong></p>

<p>A number of you are still worthy moderators. Keep your interest here, things change quickly and we are still a growing sub. Shouts out to -</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congrats.</p>

<p>Do you think it would be possible to start a sticky thread where we can discuss changes we would like to see in conspiracy for the new year.</p>

<p>I think this whole <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a> fiasco has shown that there is a lot of discontent amongst the users, so it would be good to bring any grievances we still have to bear.</p>

<p>Also the fact that <a href="/r/conspiratard/">/r/conspiratard/</a> is engaged in a heavy circlejerk right now about how the quality of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is only going to go down since <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a> is gone is quite irksome, I&#39;d like to show them otherwise and I think a community effort would be the best way to do that.</p>

<p>As for <a href="/u/letsownthenwo">/u/letsownthenwo</a>, what can <em>you</em> tell me? What have you heard?</p>

<p>Was he shadowbanned? Did he delete his account? How long has it been?</p>

<p>I noticed it when he stopped posting, and I&#39;ve even seen a few people here and there ask what happened to him, but I never <em>seriously</em> thought about it until this moment, and you&#39;re not the only person to ask that question ITT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a sticky thread.  Why not discuss it here :)</p>

<p>I want to clean up the sidebar a bit to make a few things more prominent.</p>

<p>For example; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s clear enough what <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a> is and that it is operating on this sub.</p>

<p>We should link directly to a search for the sub:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorship/search?q=conspiracy&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on">http://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorship/search?q=conspiracy&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on</a></p>

<p>Probably in big bold text directly under the rules; something like <strong><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorship/search?q=conspiracy&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on">All post removals documented at /r/uncensorship</a></strong></p>

<p>I think instead of a &quot;Moderator Transparency&quot; category that it would be better to have some sort of &quot;Meta/Reddit&quot; category for things like uncensorship, undelete, ModerationLog PoliticalModeration etc..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try to spread word of it whenever I can.  The biggest sub-reedit to date to adopt it is <a href="/r/TrueReddit">/r/TrueReddit</a></p>

<p>I think the best way to get people interested in it is to lead by example.</p>

<p>But people have to know what it is and that it exists; which is why I suggest making it a bit more prominent in the sidebar nearer the Rules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just thinking, about the moderator transparency topic. Im not familiar with the protocol mods follow when banning a user, and if i am iterating what the actual protocol is, i apologize. </p>

<p>But i was thinking maybe having a way to announce publicly to the community when one is banned. Of course, this would be following PMs directed at the soon-to-be banned, but i think public warnings would help with transparency issues some may have, and would offer the mods a means to explain to the community exactly why a certain user was banned. Possibly, it could allow a soon-to-be-banned user a chance to redeem themselves.   </p>

<p>It was just a thought..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would certainly be possible to publicly report on bans; and I don&#39;t really see a downside to it given that the user is already notified of such bans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand, since 2011 this is how it goes down.</p>

<p>Reddit inc has a board. It has three members. Some President of Codne Naste (I think their original stake was 11 million at the time of the split), the CEO of reddit inc Yishan, and Alexis one of (along with Spez and (a bit later) Aaron) the original founders of this platform.</p>

<p>There are some angel investors. Jedberg is one of them. They made a blog post where they detailed all the angel investors. Although that blog post was inflammatory and full of PR nonsense so I won&#39;t link it.</p>

<p>Reddit inc staff also own shares in the company as well.</p>

<p>The last valuation of reddit I saw was 230,000,000. Probably a bit higher now. Reddit inc herself may not be profitable. But someone&#39;s making money ;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congrats, all!  I&#39;m really glad to see a slate of people with a good posting history.  <a href="/u/go1dfish">/u/go1dfish</a>, you&#39;ve been doing a lot of great stuff for years with your other subs.</p>

<p>I wonder if anyone is interested in expanding <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with a little bit of organization?  A few things I&#39;ve been wondering about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;Corruption-proofing&quot; the discussion.  Most importantly, creating alternative sites to fall back on if an admin or a mod goes censor-happy again.</p></li>
<li><p>Archiving information so that it doesn&#39;t get lost if somebody (admin or mod) gets overzealous with deletions.  It&#39;s two years to the next big USA elections, and shills crave a memory hole.</p></li>
<li><p>Reaching out to a few trusted internet / alternative journalists to share information and strategies</p></li>
<li><p>Cooperation with coders / designers (such as <a href="/r/darknetplan">/r/darknetplan</a> just to name one) investigating alternative methods of distributing information in case somebody decides that they own the intertubes and want it back</p></li>
<li><p>Indexing the net.  Not the whole net, but retaining copies of information that get deleted, modified, or removed by government / corporate request over time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And so forth.</p>

<p>Imagine spawning off a few subcommittees and reporting back regularly.</p>

<p>TL;DR:  We will ALWAYS be infested with shills, spammers, and scammers.  Here&#39;s a great opportunity to learn new ways to make progress even while they are making noise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that <a href="/u/GrippinThaGrain">/u/GrippinThaGrain</a> would be excellent for the future, and I have faith in <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a>.</p>

<p>However I&#39;m glad to see that the blogger mod did not make the cut, and he will <strong>never</strong> make the cut if I can help it.  <a href="/u/Orangutan">/u/Orangutan</a> has been a mod for years at 911blogger, which was exposed in the <a href="http://rockcreekfreepress.com/CreekV4No11-Web.pdf">November 2010 issue of the Rock Creek Free Press as a disinfo site.  The link goes to a PDF of the hard copy of the paper; the article titled &quot;Is Leading 9/11 Truth Site Working for the Other Side?&quot; is on the front page, below the fold, in the middle</a>.</p>

<h2>Below is an excerpt from that article:</h2>

<p>A little more than a month after Zwicker’s endorsement of CIT was rejected, the situation repeated itself, when retired NASA aeronautical engineer Dwain Deets recorded a video endorsement of CIT on August 30, 2010 and submitted it to 911blogger. Once again, 911blogger refused, without explanation, to post the endorsement of a highly qualified professional.</p>

<p>Prior to 911blogger rejecting these video endorsements from Zwicker and Deets, nearly all users at 911blogger who were vocal in their support of CIT had been banned. An informal poll easily came up with 25 former users of 911blogger who had been banned without explanation—about half of whom are CIT supporters.</p>

<p>Three of the most well-informed, articulate and prolific CIT supporters were banned simultaneously on May 24, 2010, while in the midst of a heated online debate with 911blogger moderator Erik Larson (aka Loose Nuke). Truth activist Stefan S. of London, England explains it:</p>

<p>“The exact moment that Adam Syed, Adam Ruff and I were banned, we were in mid-debate with Erik Larson. Nothing remotely offensive or rule breaking was being said by any one of us, let alone all three of us at the exact same time.</p>

<p>“What was happening was that Larson had been backed into a corner over a blog entry of his, which was a listing of what he claimed were witnesses to the plane flying south of the Citgo station prior to it striking the Pentagon.</p>

<p>“Not a single one of those witnesses even mentioned Citgo, it was just a collection of laughably tenuous arguments for why ambiguous witness statements must be supportive of the official story. The list was submitted to an intensive analysis and it was shown conclusively that none of the witnesses supported the official flight path, that the list included several witnesses who stated that the plane flew to the north of Citgo, and most strikingly, several who explicitly stated that they were not even in the vicinity at the time of the attack.</p>

<p>“The discussion was drifting into increasingly embarrassing territory for Larson when — presto — all three of us were banned and Larson, in a completely childish fashion, proceeded to have the “last word” in full knowledge that he had just stopped the people he was addressing from being able to respond.</p>

<p>“Larson’s articles are disinformation; the information he puts out there is deliberately false with a motive to undermine genuine research. 911blogger is no longer a 9/11 truth site, that much is clear.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Response:</p>

<p>&quot;This article is a response to “Is Leading 9/11 Truth Site Working For The Other Side?”, credited to “staff writers” at the Rock Creek Free Press, November 2010 edition, available at:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rockcreekfreepress.com/CreekV4No11-Web.pdf">http://www.rockcreekfreepress.com/CreekV4No11-Web.pdf</a></p>

<p>The “leading 9/11 Truth site” being referred to is 911Blogger.com. The authors of the article critiqued here chose to remain anonymous, and the article’s title doesn’t lend itself to an easily pronounceable acronym. Therefore I will refer to the article’s authors, along with their vocal message board sympathizers and Barrie Zwicker, as The Complainers. We will abbreviate Citizen Investigation Team as “CIT” and their video National Security Alert as “NSA” (noting the irony).</p>

<p>I normally prefer the high ground when it comes to accusations regarding intentions. However, since the Complainers routinely impute sinister motives to their critics, the reader must consider whether that behavior is more consistent with an intention to support or subvert the overall agenda of the 9/11 Truth Movement.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the chapstick gets on your lips and it lowers slightly the statistical likelihood of you getting lip cancer from the sun, but it&#39;s gotta be the SPF variety. Since the dosage is so low in the water, scientists have decided it&#39;s ok to just add to the public drinking water. </p>

<p>I also advocate sunscreen water. If you shower in sunscreen water, the sunscreen gets on your skin and lowers slightly the statistical likelihood of skin cancer from the sun&#39;s rays. Again, scientists have said it&#39;s ok in low doses. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same with fluoride. </p>

<p>The reason it&#39;s still added to water is because we know that some of that water touches the teeth when you drink it. </p>

<p>All that needs to be done here is removing spam and checking to make sure that the natural exchange of debate and discussion is running smoothly.</p>

<p>What we really need is a statement of ethics. What do the mods even stand for when they have power over deleting content? Guess it doesn&#39;t matter?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rule number 6 is shit. It&#39;s actually just simply an incorrect statement. Any mod can ban somebody. The unban is done by mod consensus, not the ban. So if you want someone banned, just ban and then don&#39;t consent to an unban. Not that hard to figure out. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that&#39;s true. However, I&#39;ll make an effort make sure that bans are agreed upon by at least by a majority of mods available at the time. It&#39;s important that the mods follow the rules too.</p>
