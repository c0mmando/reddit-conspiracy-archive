       That's what my guess would be..
      </p>
      <p>
       I went through all of the pictures and videos of the entire scene, the home, everything. The only interesting thing is still how many cars got hit with bullet's. More than 4 cars were hit with bullets.. I thought only one car had a bullet hole.

       The clothing worn by lanza looks ridiculous too.. looks like something a painter would wear minus the gloves.

       The whole report is a joke.

       Maybe to reiterate how small and harmless he appeared? It would add substance to the idea that "anyone can snap, so guns are the problem..." I don't know though, that might be reaching.

       So I had a family member who is resistant to following conspiracy tell me about this info release. What disturbed me was that it completely disproved to her that there were hidden facts and evidence. Not because she looked at the information, she said what I imagine most will say, that it's too hard to look back at a time of such tragedy, but the simple release of information meant transparency to her. For me, at least, that tells me that it was successful. Only people committed to unearthing the real facts of that day will remain dissuaded, but the thousands of people on the fence will dwindle and diminish.

       That's a great point.. and it's unfortunate that just enough is all we need, where justice is about beyond a reasonable doubt.

       There are so many people with reasonable doubts though, it's crazy.

       I guess Sofia Smallstorm was right. No Christmas decorations anywhere! Not even inside, in between blue screens(!). Did you ever see a school with no Christmas decorations inside? The "content redacted" is a bluff.

       you have to remember SHES was a special place, 480 students according to the police report (not 600 as the MSM reported), 80 plus staff members according to police report, more than twice the amount per capita a normal school would have working there. and most likely only two grades left there in 2012 if the previous drill photographs of the kids in the firehouse parking lot are anything to go by, and also the two years grades reported for SHES for 10/11/12 and the sudden drop in academic score percentage in 2010 compared to previous years.
      </p>
      <p>
       not forgetting the
       <strong>
        one
       </strong>
       adult sized baseball pitch for the 480, six to ten year olds to play on.
      </p>
      <p>
       they put the security camera up on the wall outside the main door
       <strong>
        after
       </strong>
       the shooting took place.
      </p>
      <p>
       it was not there in photographs of the day, its there in photographs taken weeks later.

       a lot of those interior photographs are photoshopped, open them up in a graphics program and zoom in on the posters and decorations, the edges are blurred as from copy pasting and blending, and also the PNG quality is degraded down to the lowest level possible to cover up the manipulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       try doing inverted colour transformations and ELA on the pictures, the palette mismatching from the copy/pasting shows up as blocky rectangles around suspect objects.

       a cheap walmart camera would take a better picture than whatever the 'pro' used to take these interior photos.

       No one HAS to view the police report. In fact ill bet many won't. But the fact of the matter is this material shouldn't be classified or redacted. Especially after a year. Especially when it was something that spurred changes in law and order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply put when it comes to the police report, there is not enough evidence yet to even state clearly that a shooting actually happened.

       I really am curious what additional piece(s) of evidence would sway you.  I grew up in Newtown, attended Sandy Hook (kindergarten through 5th grade), still have many friends who live in Newtown, and personally know someone whose daughter was killed at Sandy Hook, so the idea that there isn't enough evidence to clearly show that a shooting happened is, you might guess, not one that I agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've followed, to varying degrees, some of the conspiracy theories about the shootings over the last year, mainly because for the first time in my life I find myself in the unusual position where I have personal, firsthand knowledge that a conspiracy theory is wrong.  Except for some minor details, I don't agree with any of the SH theories that I've read about, or with conspiracy theories in general, but I really would like to know what evidence would convince you.  FWIW, I promise to keep things civil.

       The conspiracy isn't really saying "there was no shooting". The general opinion seems to be that there was indeed a shooting, but it wasn't a crazy lone gunman kid who'd planned and orchestrated it by himself.

       You know someone who's daughter was killed..  so you are 100% sure of how it happened.   Right.    Anyone can post anything.   Even if you were telling the truth - did your friend get to see their kids body and verify the circumstances of the killing?   Is she suing the state, or just collecting money now?

       I can be certain because of my acquaintance with one of the people who was directly affected, and much closer acquaintance with many other people who know this person better than I do.  I know that won't sway you (and I wouldn't necessarily expect it to.  I'm just some guy on the internet).  It's not certainty based on faith.  It's certainty based on personal experience.  I mean, there's always the chance, however miniscule, that I'm wrong, so let's call it 99.9999999% certain instead of 100%

       Still you can't possibly have any direct knowledge of what happened in that building.  Nobody has seen it.   You can only tell what

       happen by what is missing.   It's fucked up, but that's what you have to do when people hide and redact important and readily available evidence.

       No, I don't have direct knowledge of the details of the shooting, and I'll never say that I'm 100% certain of them (to put a number on it, let's say I'm 90% sure of at least the basic progression of events that day).  I am, though, 99.999...% sure that the shooting happened, so close in fact that it's pretty accurate to say I'm 100% sure.

       ok, we got you down to 90%..  what do you think about the fact that none of the pictures or video from that day shows holiday decorations?   you must remember being in elementary school near holidays.   paper snowlfakes on all the windows and walls. .. think how much impact a photo  blood splattered snowflake might have - it could have been pulitzer material.

       No, you didn't get me down to 90%.  I started there, and without something VERY compelling I'm not likely to go below that.  And that 90% is just because there are lots of details that we can't ever know, so no one will ever know his exact route through the school, exactly where he pointed his gun, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't seen many pictures from inside the school.  I may download and watch some of the videos from the report this weekend.  I would say, though, that the lack of holiday decorations in the halls wouldn't mean too much.  Lack of such decorations in the classrooms would be a little unexpected, but still very, very far from convincing evidence that things didn't basically happen as described in the official reports.

       Just one question,  I mean we all saw it on TV, we all saw Obama talking about the horrible loss of life, and how we should support efforts to stop any possibility of Assad using chemical weapons on his own people again.. but it was a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       People were so sure they were supporting missile strikes..   You can see why events as extraordinary as this are very important to see ALL available evidence.    We are lied to so often by criminals in power you can understand the skepticism.

       Details?  These are crucial available evidences that can not be shown.  That speaks volumes.

       Let me ask you the same question I asked the OP: What evidence would convince you that this basically happened as described in today's report?  I agree with you completely that details are crucial, but since there are a LOT of details on this shooting that are well supported by evidence, I'm curious which additional details would sway you.  Unredacted videos?  A picture of Adam Lanza holding a gun in the school?  Pictures of the classrooms before the bodies were removed?  I'm not trying to be petty or snarky, and I hope I'm not coming across that way.  But the evidence is overwhelming, unless you choose to wholesale dismiss the police reports, witness testimony, 911 calls, etc.  So I'm curious what level of certainty you would require to, say, agree with me.

       My skepticism was borne from the unbelievable accounts and performances of people involved, and officilals' and media's treatment of the events.
      </p>
      <p>
       These evidences convinced me that there was a need for a higher standard..  Think, if A. Lanza (if he even existed) had survived the alleged event - what evidence would have to be provided to convict him in court?

      <p>
       The police reports?  They are incomplete and redacted?? after a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The witness testimony?   Why are they all so not credible?  They don't display credible emotion.  The TV news interviewed little kids right outside on the same day, and the media overwhelmingly joined in the exploitation of the alleged victims.    Disgusting.. yet I am a monster if I want to see some little evidence of a massacre.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a big boy, I can handle it.   If I can see the Abu Ghraib torture pictures. but only congress can see the videos.. well that's not great either but at least I saw the pictures, and was described what was in the video (it was credible)
      </p>
      <p>
       The 911 calls were not-credible, and also withheld, only released after legal challenge, and even then not the crucial ones.  Withheld and redacted.

      <p>
       The whole situation stinks.  I'm surprised at you.

       At some point you have to believe someone.  I choose to believe the people I've known (and trusted) for basically my whole life, who have no reason to lie, and who would have to be spectacularly good liars to pull off a lie like this.  Not just one person.  Quite a few would have to be lying about the existence of a person that, I assure you, was 6 years old on 12/14/12 and hasn't sung in any superbowl halftime shows.

       Nope, you are wrong. Do you know how I know? Because it would be impossible to get the dozen or so funeral homes to all plan organize and run fake funerals. You can deny everyone else's personal truth all you want, but tell me how they get funeral homes all over the western part of the state to hold mock services.

       My opinion can sway depending on the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me ask you first off...How many people can keep a +75% hit accuracy while actually killing people? Because I can't even keep a +75% hit accuracy in battlefield. Your telling me this kid carried all this ammo and all this weaponry and still managed a +75% hit accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The above fact alone is what makes me think he was a patsy of some kind or a made up name for the press and people. Which would lead to me to believe one of two intelligence agencies probably had a "hit squad" of some sort visit the school that day and a lot of it is being covered up. Which is why the content redacted along with everything else that has happened screams cover up which in turn screams "hit squad".
      </p>
      <p>
       Again this is all based off of a kid having never been in a combat situation wearing about an extra 25-50 pounds of gear and weaponry and still maintaing a proper firing rate and accuracy of +75%.

       If you were playing the videogame 'Battlefield' or were a member of the USMC, you may never reach that kind of accuracy in a real life situation with an AR-15.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adam played the videogame 'Call of Duty' and some other dancing videogame to attain that type of accuracy and to keep that ice flowing through his veins despite all the bulky equipment, screaming, people running, shots echoing, smoke, and chaos.

       I disagree that using accuracy from a video game is a good indicator towards how accurate someone will be in real life. I have pretty shit accuracy in battlefield, but could hit ten out of ten shots in real life with a rifle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we know he was far away from these people when he shot them, it would be pretty easy to walk up and shoot these people point blank while they hide in a corner.

       Extremely often actually. I love hunting as well. I happen to be lucky enough to live in a pro gun state. Glock 9mm and .45 1911 will always forever protect me :)
      </p>
      <p>
       While I have been hunting, I have never been in a combat situation. I couldn't imagine one kid doing this much damage or having that good of accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The distance from shot to hit is definitely in question right now which is why redacted information doesn't help public opinions. If we could see the information and pictures we would be able to say..ok they were 2 feet a part and only 5 feet away..he would have to be blind to miss...or they were running in every direction down every hall and he would have to be a god damn navy seal to hit anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: if you shoot guns you know how hard it is to hit a moving target..no matter how good you are.

       I wouldn't call it a combat situation though. No one was trying to shoot him, or take him down during all of this. As another person pointed out, they were in classrooms so he could not have been too far from the victims, but that is still in question. I agree a moving target is very different from a stationary one, but I still don't see how you compare video game accuracy to real life if you shoot regularly. Sorry for formatting btw, on mobile.

       I was comparing video games and real life because I don't have a 75% hit accuracy in a video game, that's how ridiculous it is.. I also don't know many service men with a 75% accuracy rating..
      </p>

       From the shorter report that was released last month, I believe most of the children were shot in their classrooms, which are pretty small.  Unless he was on the complete opposite side of the room, I would guess that the distance wouldn't have been more than a few meters.

       You also have to realize at this point his adrenaline had to be through the roof as well.. He had already supposedly killed his mother before ever going to the school. That's why I am upset at the information being redacted and why I am more leaning towards cover up.

       Sure, he was probably pretty high on adrenaline, though I'm no expert on these things.  It's possible that by this point he was pretty calm, or at least very focused.  That's just speculation on my part, though, and also partially irrelevant.  I've fired a pistol at a target 3 meters away while very nervous (concealed carry test, while still very inexperienced with shooting), and I missed the target maybe once, if that, with the large majority falling well within the target area.  I'm sure the experience of shooting at a range at a stationary target is much different from the situation that Adam Lanza was in, but when you're close enough it's hard to miss.

       And just for the sake of completeness, where did you get the 75% number from?

       You have to remember he wasn't firing a pistol.. He was firing a bushmaster ar-15 which is a very different gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every kid was hit with 3-7 bullets from an ar-15 .223(from carver during the press conference). Witness's also said they heard rapid fire shooting(I remember hearing this on the news at the time). It took 11 minutes for the whole event to transpire. I am trying to find the accuracy report link.

       This has always bothered me!  The number of people actually killed in massacres is ALWAYS like..4 killed..30 injured.  Even when kids are involved. 
How perfect to "kill" 20 kids! TWENTY!  A "whole class" basically.  Yet, Columbine happened..with two perpetrators with more evidence to support planning, and previous use of weaponry...magic how Adam bought this stuff, what, weeks leading up to it and yet became proficient enough to successfully kill (KILL NOT INJURE) twenty kids?! 
Fuck that. 
Also, no.. Christmas isn't "just a 4 letter word" especially in Connecticut. How many non-Caucasian people have you seen associated with this?  A small town, full of white people...in the US... I'm sure any other school would have walls of decorations. 
Look at how much they push "angels" and those types of images into our heads associated with this fucking joke.

      <p>
       As Rummy once said, the problem is there are too many known unknowns to this equation, and that will always lead to more conspiratorial views. Especially in a group forum where people adamantly distrust the status quo and official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do find it odd that people heard sputters of automatic gunfire. That coupled with the facts of kids getting hit with at least 3 bullets would lead me to believe the shooter was shooting an automatic rifle and not a semi-auto rifle. This reminds me of the Anders Breveik shooting..

       I can't tell if you're serious. Did you listen to the news on this when it happened live? The kids were all killed execution style. He had them all trapped in a classroom and shot them one at a time except for a few shots he fired randomly to scare people. That's the only reason it's not 100%

       You lose..I clicked on the very first huffington post article and there is nothing of execution style killing..
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what execution style killing is right? it's the same thing happening in syria with people lined up on their knees taking one to the head..That's not what happened at Sandy Hook.. Each child took at least 3 .223 caliber bullets. Even in your huffpo article it doesn't say that. Not a credible source link at all..
      </p>
      <p>
       straight from your huffpo article:
"Authorities gave no details on exactly how the attack unfolded, but police radio traffic indicated the shooting lasted only a few minutes. State police Lt. Paul Vance said officers arrived instantaneously, immediately entered the school, searched it completely and found Lanza dead."
      </p>
      <p>
       Your second article doesn't say anything about executions style either. Just that the teacher was protecting the kids from the remains they found.
“She took her kids, put them in the closet and by doing so she lost her life protecting those little ones,” her cousin Jim Wiltsie told ABC. “She was found huddled over her children, her students, doing instinctively what she knew was the right thing. I’m just proud that Vicki had the instincts to protect her kids from harm. It brings peace to know that Vicki was doing what she loved, protecting the children and in our eyes she’s a hero.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I see no proof of execution style killings at all..

       Just in case your Google doesn't work. I took a screenshot of the top results.

       I am quoting the articles you gave me.. It's not execution style.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again execution style is where you are on your knees and someone puts a gun to the back or front of your head..That's not what happened.. each kid took 3-7 bullets. That is being mowed down. I also listened to the live scanner that day and there was never any mention of execution style. Again I am happy that you can type into google but that doesn't provide evidence that it actually was an execution style killing..
      </p>
      <p>
       There were even reports that kids were trying to pile into a bathroom and couldn't fit and that caused the killer to be able to line a lot of them up. Again there were no execution style killings..
      </p>
      <p>
       Just go back through your articles..the fact that you even linked the first two is ridiculous since they prove that there was no execution style killings..
"Authorities gave no details on exactly how the attack unfolded, but police radio traffic indicated the shooting lasted only a few minutes. State police Lt. Paul Vance said officers arrived instantaneously, immediately entered the school, searched it completely and found Lanza dead." - article 1

       “She took her kids, put them in the closet and by doing so she lost her life protecting those little ones,” her cousin Jim Wiltsie told ABC. “She was found huddled over her children, her students, doing instinctively what she knew was the right thing. I’m just proud that Vicki had the instincts to protect her kids from harm. It brings peace to know that Vicki was doing what she loved, protecting the children and in our eyes she’s a hero.” - Article 2
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I see no proof of execution style killings..Just because you can type into google: sandy hook execution style killings doesn't mean that's what actually happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me ask a stupid question....if all the killings were execution style...how did bullet holes end up in the cars parked outside?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I will say that there is no evidence that the killings were done execution style.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Call me silly but at least I can read..
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: according to evidence the only person to have been killed "Execution style" was head of School Dawn Hochsprung...and that was from confronting the shooter. None of the children were killed "Execution style"

       Yes, you fail, move along. I'm not going to get into an argument with a child over things like other children being murdered. You can go argue with someone else, I've already proven my point and you just evade it and spout non-sense. You're a fool, always will be a fool. I'll let you be a fool by yourself.

       Adam Peter Lanza killed 26 and injured 2 in Newtown Ct
      </p>
      <p>
       One of these things is not like the others, one of these things looks like it was done by a trained and conditioned killer. Especially considering that the 2 wounded, one was hit by a ricochet and the other is unidentified as is the nature of their injuries. The SH shooter knew what the fuck he was doing based on the numbers.

       How come it's no big deal then to see dead Iraqi kids or victims of our drone strikes.  How come dead Vietnamese kids are published in countless books.  Are they just animals?  It's reality.  Wake up.  Apparently you've never been to liveleak.  It has nothing to do with life or death or honor or respect.  Dead is dead.  Where is the evidence of the dead?

       not real kids, just four year old photographs of still living kids, they even borrowed one photo from a girl in the UK to the upset of her mother. that would likely be the daily mails connection to US intel, the DM always seems to the be primary conduit for release of news stories to back up US news.

       Lol.  Wtf does "moral standards" have to do with death.  There are a lot of us in professions that deal with dead people every day: doctors, nurses, emts, paramedics, funeral personnel, current and ex-military as well.  If a person is too weak-kneed to handle it, they shouldn't look.  It's not like people would be required to click on it before they logged into Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to believe all those obvious lies from Gene Rosen, Wayne Carver, Robbie Parker and others, you're free to do so.  If you need no proof, cool.  There are many of us that are not so naive.

       Let me ask you the same question I asked the OP: What evidence would convince you that this basically happened as described in today's report?  I agree with you completely that details are crucial, but since there are a LOT of details on this shooting that are well supported by evidence, I'm curious which additional details would sway you.  Unredacted videos?  A picture of Adam Lanza holding a gun in the school?  Pictures of the classrooms before the bodies were removed?  I'm not trying to be petty or snarky, and I hope I'm not coming across that way.  But the evidence is overwhelming, unless you choose to wholesale dismiss the police reports, witness testimony, 911 calls, etc.  So I'm curious what level of certainty you would require to, say, agree with me.
