    <div class="md"><p>Because the tards are angry that our little community got a small victory. We finally had something really miniscule go our way for once and they are furious. They didn&#39;t get to sabotage our sub with their conspiratard infiltrator/apologist. </p>

<p>Wanna know what else they are doing right now? Getting caught vote brigading. Someone in r/conspiratard linked a thread, basically asking for help on a post with a wink wink nudge nudge, so they brigaded it. I caught them because it&#39;s obvious (There just so happened to be a bunch of r/conspiratard members who magically showed up to the thread right after the link) and they also used the opportunity to call this sub racist, specifically the r/Israel mod Yserbius in that thread. Just look at his stupid post. They do this all the time, just going around spouting off the same stupid lies and misleading claims to get all of Reddit to hate us. </p>

That hardly seems like a &quot;brigade&quot;.  It really seems like a small fraction of a fraction of users disagree with you, and are downvoting.

<p>Users can come here, however, and post racist comments, which I have always seen being met with hostility as educated people realize racism is the stupidest garbage on the planet, we&#39;re all human beings and we all deserve the same love and respect as one another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Valid point.  It does seem like there is an appeal process that is done by moderator consensus so the rule should make that clear because lots of people probably get banned by one renegade mod then go away.  I recall solidwhetstone blaming a user he evidently banned for going away and not appealing . . . as if the user should have been aware of this unstated rule.</p>

No, probably not specifically.  America probably just happens to be more interesting/relevant</p>

<p>Similarly, users like Bipolarbear0 and friends most likely just have an interest in pointing out flaws in conspiracy theories.  They aren&#39;t obligated to turn their attention to all of Reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know man. I&#39;m seeing your posts about the mod mail and forcing the mods to submit everything. I guess that sounds like a good idea and everything, but what if you saw a bunch of personal shit? Just right off the top of my head I can name like 100 things that I could potentially read that would make me feel weird. Could be anything. Mods consoling eachother over a death or miscarriage, etc. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure they never planned on submitting everything, so they must have felt comfortable talking about anything through mod mail as their own little corner of the internet, like a private subreddit. I guess if there was some way to magic marker out a couple spots that they don&#39;t want submitted to the internet in general it would be cool. I don&#39;t know. But then you have to think of all the people who might be their enemies using that cache as a goldmine of material or take out of context and spam everywhere to damage their reputation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>War is fought on many fronts. With the Internet information and propaganda has become the front line. Since MSM is completely controlled by TPTB then the Internet has become the battleground for the minds who are still engaged and thinking. Look at it like a mark of prominence.</p>

<p>Take on the mentality of warfare. Read The Art of War by Sun Tzu, The Prince by Machiavelli, Propaganda by Edward Bernays. Deception, misdirection, and misinformation are the tools of war. Make no mistake that those who rule us are well versed in the texts I mentioned above.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been at war with the TPTB for millennium. I can personally attest that Reddit was a major factor in my awakening. With the Snowden/NSA deluge this subreddit naturally has become a target. I do believe an awakening is occurring. In part because as the narrative and reality move farther apart more and more people see the deception for what it is and are looking for answers.</p>

<p>We are at war, act accordingly. And I say that to you as well as to myself!</p>

<p>I sure tried to. I believe those that are here not because they enjoy conspiracy, but because they like to tear down (see the sandcastle metaphor) are engaging in schadenfreude, at best, and, &quot;hating&quot; on others. </p>

<p>You&#39;re putting words in my mouth and telling me what my point is, and after I walked you through the sandcastle metaphor. Tsk-tsk. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right though, &quot;Your defence when you say that criticism is wrong pretty bad though.&quot; </p>

<p>You&#39;re proving yourself not very bright repeatedly. Wow. You shouldn&#39;t be telling anyone to work on anything when you string words together like that. I, literally, can&#39;t even discern what you mean by that. I would have no reason to defend saying criticism is wrong, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re getting at, because I never said criticism is wrong. </p>

<p>EDIT- Criticism can be good. Hopefully, here, it will prompt you to learn to use grammar correctly and formulate sentences in English that convey ideas. </p>

<p>Mean criticisms do not equal any and all criticisms, work on making sense, not putting words in people&#39;s mouths.</p>

<p>I would say find this quote of mine that you are falsely attributing to me, but, really, you&#39;ve got a lot of work to do with basic language skills before even engaging in any type of debate with a literate adult. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I for one, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware, would like to see stronger action taken against people who only come here to mock conspiracies and cross post in conspiratard.  It doesn&#39;t look the all the mods agree so hopefully the future policies will be fleshed out in the open.  </p>

<p>You visit this sub often and you don&#39;t see conspiratards trolling?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. We have more <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> trolls trolling in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> than reverse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s another reason for me to question your intellect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...What?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you expound on conspiratard and what it believes in, who comprises it, what you do and don&#39;t mock</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not being proud, that is saying the truth, and correcting you on what you think it is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>these are the actions of someone with a sense of pride in conspiratard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that is correcting you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conspiratard is a group that exists solely to mock- which, as I said, is nothing to be proud of. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And nowhere did I claim to be proud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I find myself having to really spell things out here for you that I feel you should be able to pick up on without explanation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arrogance, the worst kind of intellectual problems people like you have. It even seems like you are proud of that!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seemed to me that your dialogue about &quot;criticizing nonsense&quot; was trying to justify the existence of a group which exists, solely, to mock another group. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because that is what <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is? Criticizing and mocking? Did you expect something more or something?</p>
