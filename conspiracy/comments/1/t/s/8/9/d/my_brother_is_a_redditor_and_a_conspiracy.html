       this sub was cooler two years ago, where it was a mix of historical conspiracies and
       <a href="/r/psychonaut">
        /r/psychonaut
       </a>
       . Now its so diluted people always discuss politics, back then we already knew politics of past and present was a joke and never brought it up.

       That's only because users know that the other subreddits (like politics) are heavily scrutinized by people with interests. There was a surge of complaints about censorship around a year ago, which prompted an exodus to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what the remedy is for that to be honest. To me, it's not that damaging, but I can understand if some people find this place to be too "doom-and-gloomy".

       The remedy is simply submitting that type of content and encouraging that type of discussion by presenting an argument that captures ones attention and imagination. As a subscriber to both subs, I would gladly participate in those types of discussions. Don't think that just because it isn't the norm here at the moment doesn't mean it cant evolve there, and even if there's only like 5-10 posters that are interested you can always just try and have a great discussion in those threads and hope casual readers catch on. You yourself have the power to evolve the discourse of the content and discussion here, you can only hope to be convincing enough to ensure it catches on and spreads. I'd say give it a shot because even though discussing political corruption is the current trend, it's impossible not to be intereseted in the concept of how certain events are interpreted and analyzed by the subconscious mind. What's the phrase again? Small minds discuss events and great minds discuss ideas? Let's bring that concept back to this sub, I've been itching for it.

       I like your suggestion a lot. It also means that we need to have zero tolerance for those who ridicule or demean in other ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Civil discourse has to be cultivated more here, it's why I suggested that this subreddit should introduce guidelines besides the rules. Also to remove the symbolism which I find limits this subreddit. Open-mindedness and complete void of bias needs to be the focal points IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe have certain themes some days with stickied posts? I don't know, that might sound a bit too kindergarten-ish though.

       I completely agree. The only thing is zero tolerance seems to be somewhat authoritarian by nature. This whole fiasco came about because of the community, what we need to encourage is unbiased open minded discussion but at the same time, as you said, cultivate civil discourse in a manner that encourages intellectual discussion. Of course, that's not going to happen overnight as a community, but as I said we can just be the change we wish to see in the world, and hope it catches on because truth resonates with people. It's hard to have zero tolerance and at the same time be 100% opened minded because sometimes you need your antithesis to either forge your synthesis or reaffirm your thesis. The big question is obviously where do we draw the line. When people say we are silencing the opposition by banning conpiratard posters, we need to look to the subs opinion as a whole in order to determine whether they're here just to disagree (so long as they provide a reason why backed with evidence) or they are just downright trolling and brigading the community. I think with time, we will get a better understanding. In either case, I'm glad this sub took a stand and got results, regardless of what type of person
       <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">
        /u/solidwhetstone
       </a>
       is in real life. It was clear he didn't understand this subreddit and what it represents
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: i think the stickied thread idea is great, but I'd like to see it be centered on self posts because those types of posts typically bring out the actual theorist in people. It's easy to sticky a news article and go ape shit on it, but I think the whole psychonaut conspiracy crossover will come from getting people to understand who we are, not just what our opinions about politics are.

       These last couple of years have felt very gloomy though, but that's more to do with how politics is conducted rather than
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       sharing it.

       The term 'conspiracy theory' has been so ridiculed over time that almost everyone I engage in discussion with now genuinely thinks the word 'conspiracy' refers to something a "conspiracy theorist' believes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was talking with my father the other day (who worked for over 30 years as an administrator in the public education system). We were briefly discussing 9/11 and I pointed out to him that no matter which stance you took; let's say you believe the official story  or you believe something else happened, you are a 'conspiracy theorist' as the 19 hijackers part of the story has never been proven, only alleged. It's still a  conspiracy theory that they were involved. He stopped me and kind of off-handedly said, "well, not a 'conspiracy' because that's what the government said happened." Inferring that if you believe the government's version of events it can't be a conspiracy because conspiracies aren't real.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was surprised hearing that from him so I curiously asked him what the definition of 'conspiracy' meant to him. He didn't answer right away and I could see the gears turning in his head. When I gave him the proper definition he had a slightly embarrassed 'duh' look on his face and I think he understood the point I was trying make, but the most interesting thing to me was how even a person like him had been influenced by the way the word has been used and twisted over the years.

       Because current "conspiracies" are way more important and affect all our lives, compared to conspiracies that happened 50 or 70 or 100 or 200 years ago.

      <p>
       So in a way, its become better, because we are on the tails on the elites, rather than 50, 100 years trailing.

       For me I found the opposite, it was only when I saw the bigger picture that I was able to fully grasp the intentions.  These people move at a snails pace - they don't care if it takes a lifetime to accomplish a simple goal.  The daily distractions provide a layer of protection in their onion of structure.

       solution: submit more of the type of articles you want to see and do not be lazy with that downvote button, it makes a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, think before you upvote: "is this
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       material?", by upvoting you are approving of that type of submission and encouraging more of it...

       these days is a conspiracy and has some sinister meaning behind it.  Coincidence and common sense no longer exist.

       People don't fully understand what "conspiracy" really means, and its meaning is diluted.

       No, we simply think that all zionist behavior is disgusting.  We can clearly see their racist and sickening actions towards others.  They claim such a horrid history yet do it themselves.

       This mod is absolute fraud gold.  His "employers" saw how bad he fucked up.  This wasn't a personal realization.  They will assuredly try again, though with someone more intelligent and able to slowly subvert the community.  A lot like Obama did with America.

       A stunt by
       <a href="/u/donbueno">
        /u/donbueno
       </a>
       (ex-mod) where he removed all mods under him (leaving only himself and illuminatedwax) caused some turbulence for half a day. He lost it when 9000sins suggested and began to implement the (IMO sensible) rule that accounts under 1 month in age (typically ban circumventers from the 'tard club) would be disallowed from commenting and posting in here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently OP had to telephone his AFK friend illuminatedwax to get donbueno removed and things back to normal, because top mod here doesn't really use reddit anymore. OP was modded during this and stayed around for whatever reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Top mod here scooped up tons of subreddits on day one. They probably aren't a "conspiracy theorist" either.

       That's about the size of it. However- I am a filthy peasant casual conspiracy theorist. I do have an axe to grind with the NSA (I've protested them twice this year), and have spent my fair share of time researching 9/11. I don't get involved in the larger world of all of the various conspiracies though (ufo's, illuminati, etc.) It's interesting to read about, but I don't invest a lot of emotional capital in it.

       Not true. I share his views, as do others. This whole spectacle was ridiculous, and not because someone "colluded with the enemy". It was ridiculous because a group of people who claim to abhor censorship in any form shouted from the rooftops that censorship is exactly what they want for this forum. As long as it is against those who disagree. The human aspect of the things this sub stands against- injustices and crimes against humanity, political tyranny, elitist organizations, and so on- all of this was undermined by the way a few members acted and reacted the last few days. You guys lost a lot of your credibility on your own by not practicing what you preach. I love this sub, but I am disappointed.

       Who is asking for or seeking censorship, in any form here?  With all I've seen it is quite the contrary.  Many small voices have stood in up in unison to clarify questionable rules and policies.  All voices are welcome here.  While not perfect, and with the voting being heavily rigged and certain groups who prefer to censor rather than openly debate, all in all, she is as beautiful as you make it.

       I like the way you put that. I was referencing the onslaught of "ban this group and this person" mantra that was so prevalent during all the drama. My point was simply that silencing your opponent does not mean your opponent has vanished, and further, that selective oppression is one of the first steps taken on the road to tyranny.

       You clearly did not read his original post  to conspiratard or the comments that were made; most (not all) surprised me by being measured and considered.  Doesn't mean we listen to a word they say but we should have seen it as a strength that one of our mods reached out to our major critics.

        /r/conspiratard

       is some kind of rabid hate group against this sub. In reality we're not! In fact, many of us are active posters in both!

       Seriously, why do you think asking for evidence is trolling? If I told you hippos could fly or the Amanabi people of Guatemala had built working radios in the 300s, you'd want proof, right?

       if you're asking for evidence, you don't know, you haven't done the work. if you don't know and haven't done the work, you don't belong here. we get a lot of people like you here and we don't have time to educate them all, it is quicker and easier to flip you off. i have been researching these topics for nearly 10years. if i told you all i knew you wouldn't believe me.

       That's hella presumptuous. I spent a decade immersing myself in UFOlogy, conspiracy theories, a cryptozoology before I decided that if none of these were getting confirmed, maybe I was wrong.

       ufos are bullshit with zero evidence to back them up, you wasted 10years on that shit? the nwo is in black&amp;white, i can prove everything i believe, to someone who has the time, interest and intelligence to read, watch and listen to everything i point them to.

       I think why so many people think you're not "one of us" because you've repeatedly said you don't like what governments are doing to citizens. If you hang here long enough, you stop referring to the facade of democracy and look at the bigger players.

       You would think with the millions spent on persona management software, they would gave used a more intelligent and skilled agent to subvert this community.  Perhaps with the next attempt they will.  Keep your eyes open, and call these agents out when they have been identified.

       Just a bunch of puppet accounts.  What an incredible stroke of luck that the exact same number of upvotes for people who post responses supporting him as to the the comments he makes.  Do they really believe they are fooling anyone with this?  It blows up in their face, they try to hide it, and then release the shills and fake accounts to upvote themselves and downvote anyone who questions.

       I enjoy reading this sub Reddit for insight into different subjects, and i never post on here, but damn, this was like being back in high school. Some people really need to get out of their house more and away from the keyboard. if this "issue" was the worst thing you have to deal with your life is going pretty ok. Am i the only one who reads this site that thinks it should be more about the issues and not whether or not someone is in a group making posts to a "rival" sub?

       Hey man. Just give up on trying to change these people. It won't do any good.
      </p>
      <p>
       The horrible misconceptions and blatant racism, bigotry, and ignorance in people cannot be amended by a mod in an Internet forum. It won't turn the tides or change people's faith; and let's face it, the conspiracy-theorist's beliefs are held together with faith. Same as the religious faith only it is faith in whatever their particular brand of theory they believe. The people's faith cannot be broken easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then there are the people that make money off of conspiracy theories. They take advantage of these different faiths or mentalities. Look at all the websites, authors, and groups. They are money making enterprises, committed to perpetuating the illusion these authors have created for themselves. Look at all the people that believe this nonsense, that is a big market. Many millions of dollars are there for the taking if you can bend the truth in such a way to create a credible story. It's naive to think otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       CT's are really the perfect market: they are glutinous consumers, they are loyal to their brand, they are unwavering in their dedication to consume the product, they become addicted rather fast, quitting is extremely tough and they brainwash themselves (no need for 
marketing)
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a commercial and cultural system that cannot be 'fixed' because it is already the way it is supposed to be. Move on or try and profit.

       The sidebar has a list of mods. It is literally less work to find the answer to the question on your own than it took to write either comment. It's even less work than having to google it. Just fucking look, christ.

       It's always been against the rules but a lot of us have been called far worse and nothing has happened.

       If the ban hammer is to be used it should be used fairly, not just because a mod is butthurt about being called a name on the internet.

       That's great, but a mod can't read every single post, especially a single mod. But when an insult is directed straight at them, a warning is given, and then the insults are continued, it's extremely hard to ignore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police don't catch every criminal, but if someone attacks them personally, they have a MUCH higher risk of being arrested. It's very simple.

       Cmon you know that wasn't true. You reported a number of users that the mods dealt with. But that one list you gave us yesterday was LONG. It's a volunteer job and sometimes the mods don't have time to get to every post.

       I started to look at the list- I think maybe banned one of them and then had to return to replying to all the other posts and comments I had. It's been a busy week my friend. If you have tried to mod a subreddit with nearly a quarter of a million people in it- you would understand how time consuming and difficult it is to keep up with every single thing that's going on.

       There are no warring clans.  Just paid disinfo agents with a goal of subverting open though and discussion.  Their existence is proof that out discussions are harmful to certain parties.  They have spent millions upon millions on efforts such as this.  GLP is  a prime example of this.  So much so that the disinfo agents own and control the site.  1984 lays out the plot to a T.

       No doubt the tards downvoted the shit out of the many sensible comments below. I think they are angry because they thought they had an inside guy they could manipulate. The suggestions they offered were a dead giveaway of the ultimate intentions of their sub. For me it was an eye opener.

       Indeed it was, not 100% what I meant by it, I think I meant apparently the majority got together to have solid removed so now that that "problem" has been dealt with what will we "fix" now?

       You did the right thing, regardless of who you are as a person it was obvious that being a mod here was not in the best interest of anyone. You show a lot of character stepping down in order to help the sub refocus on more important issues. Thanks

       that sounds like a such a crappy excuse but everyone is accepting it because it's what they all wanted. Im picking no sides in this fight but yeah I have a feeling maybe he might get modded under that sockpuppet account of one of the conspiratards.

       No one is accepting it.  Fake accounts and mass downvotes are clearly being used.  This has about as much reality as the shit you see on TV.  Do not believe the lies.

       Liberalism is brain rot that's being programmed into society by the ultra elite as a method of control. It's there to make you so fucking pitiful that you won't fight for yourself in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those of you espousing the ideas of liberalism, all this love in bullshit and 'everyone is the same' and other crap are nothing but tools of the Illuminati and deserve to be executed in the streets for  your betrayal of free thought and speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       You, solidwhetstone, are one of these people. You are nothing but a puppet for your masters who have told you that you need to fight for people they have deemed 'underclass' and 'victims' and completely ignore their wrongdoings and the detriment to society they cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll find liberalism as a tool of the ultra elite dating back many decades in discussions of conspiracy theories. How this has suddenly fallen away from the mainstream conspiracy theory believers is both interesting and frightening.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moment you start telling other people what they can't believe, and what they can't say, you are one of THEM, not one of US.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have every right to disagree, but don't ever try to force your disagreement on everyone else as the standard by which we should all live. You don't have that right.

       You're Canadian so  you don't get it yet, but you will eventually. The blacks you've let into Canada have already started their shootings and ghettos. 13% of the population in the US (blacks) are responsible for 50% of the murder. Their crime rate is massively disproportionate to their percentage of population across the board. Sure, other races have criminals, but not anywhere close to the rate at which blacks offend.

        As noted above, scholars acknowledge that some racial and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the United States. The data from 2008 reveals that Black Americans are over-represented in terms of arrests made in virtually all types of crime, with the exceptions of "Driving under the influence" and "Liquor laws". Overall, Black Americans are arrested at 2.6 times the per-capita rate of all other Americans, and this ratio is even higher for murder (6.3 times) and robbery (8.1 times)

       The other half is EVERY OTHER RACE COMBINED. Think about it a fucking moment. 13% of the population (blacks) is committing 50% of the murder. The other 87% of the population (everyone else combined) is committing half the murder.

       The endless excuse.

They tear down every civilization they are a part of. You've been programmed into simply excusing them, your entire generation is a bunch of losers spoonfed with excuses for blacks.

       Yes, Gandhi slept with many underage girls.  He admitted it in his autobiography and somehow rationalized it (a spiritual exercise yah know /s).  Thanks for mentioning it.

       My understanding has always been that yes, he slept with underage girls, naked at times, but never touched them or himself.  This helped him harness raw sexual energy, transmitting it into willpower to help pursue other goals.  I think I read bout this in a Napolean Hill book.

       Well when my own brother said he saw my name pop up in his reddit feed and he read every single thing about me gave me the advice to step down- I was willing to really consider it. One thing about him is he knows me really well. And he said some people were saying things about me that he knew to be true- from actually growing up with me. And it made me think about whether I am truly a fish out of water and just don't realize it. He and I have been through the shit together, so I took his advice since he may be seeing some angles I'm not.

       Erm. They're making a great point, actually. Those post often get upvoted through the roof
       <em>
        by this community.

       There aren't enough of them to push something to the front page. It's people here that encourage this nonsense; they're just trying to prove how racist this place can be.

       My point i that it takes more than just the very few in
       <a href="/r/conspiritard">
        /r/conspiritard

       to push a racist post to the top here. It takes the support of

       Like most liberals you're too fucking stupid to get it.

       This comment proves you just don't understand:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        &amp; 50%? that's half, whose the other half?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The other half is EVERY OTHER RACE COMBINED. Think about it a fucking moment. 13% of the population (blacks) is committing 50% of the murder. The other 87% of the population (everyone else combined) is committing half the murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this REALLY too hard for you to grasp?
      </p>
      <p>
       Blacks commit murder far and above their population percentage. NO OTHER RACE does this .
      </p>
      <p>
       My source are FBI yearly crime breakdown by race. It's the same every fucking year. Blacks are complete trash.

      <blockquote>

        pretty sure poverty is what your mistaking it with by those "stats"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The endless excuse. Everywhere on the planet blacks are the same, and idiots like yourself will always think it's because they are somehow discriminated against, but they live in poverty because they don't ever TRY to get ahead. They tear down every civilization they are a part of. You've been programmed into simply excusing them, your entire generation is a bunch of losers spoonfed with excuses for blacks.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Overall, Black Americans are arrested at 2.6 times the per-capita rate of all other Americans, and this ratio is even higher for murder (6.3 times) and robbery (8.1 times)
       </p>

       You don't even realize THIS SUPPORTS WHAT I'M TELLING YOU.

       ufos are bullshit with zero evidence to back them up, you wasted 10years on that shit? the nwo is in black&amp;white, i can prove everything i believe, to someone who has the time, interest and intelligence to read, watch and listen to everything i point them to.
      </p>
      <p>
       persuade yourself. if you don't have the intellect, or interest, or time, you won't, that's your problem not mine.
