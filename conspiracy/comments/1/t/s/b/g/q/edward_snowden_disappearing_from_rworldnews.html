       I frequently browse r/worldnews and it has become apparent over the last few days that all the Snowden posts are, well, disapearing. I first noticed yesterday that links to his christmas message were getting to the front page of r/worldnews then promptly disappearing, not on the first, second, third, even fourth page. It could be due to their rule that there is no US internal/US politics news. But to me these posts are concerning the security and privacy of the internet, which is a concern for all countries. Not only that, but regarding global spying on other countries, and the countries that are looking after Snowden. To me this is world news and if its being voted to the front it should stay there. This news needs to get to the people, as it addresses the enormous and continually growing concern of technological privacy. The first two I saw on the front page I only upvoted, but put no comment, so I have no way of linking them. But the same thing happened to two more Snowden posts I left a little note on so I could find them again.

       This has sufficient votes to be on at least the first two pages but it appears no where.

       </a>
       This link has significantly less votes but the same article was posted with around 1220 upvotes and has disapeared from the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anyone else noticed this? I am concerned that there is vital information that we are not receiving when it comes to Snowden's case.

       It's obvious whose responsible. Edward Snowden himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspected from the beginning that he's an NSA agent. If they didn't want him to leak that material, he'd already be dead. The truth of the matter is that the NSA is just the government's way of laundering money to continue MKUltra-- the program to create a method of mind control. When I and some other conspiracy theorists began to put that puzzle together, they had Agent Snowden release the information. They knew that the average conspiracy theorist always falls for embarrassing government "leaks". They don't really care that you think they're tapping phones. That's nothing. There's been no revolution, no interruption of commerce, no mass awakening. It's all a smoke screen to hide the mind control program.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's having those posts "deleted" to make conspiracy theorists think they're on the right trail, but I saw right through their web of lies.

       Do you really think the vast and sinister forces that even now collude to repress mankind would really be so obvious?

      <p>
       America's been at war with Israel for decades now. The Coalition of the Willing-- America, Iraq, Afghanistan, North Korea, Russia, China and France-- have been launching attacks on the Israeli population from the West Bank this entire time, yet the media continues to lie and blame the Palestinians.
      </p>
      <p>
       If America really did support Israel they'd hide it far better. Everything they tell you is a lie.

       We clearly can't agree. You believe that America's at war with who they say. You believe that America's telling the truth when they pretend to have pro-Israeli policies. You believe that Edward Snowden is a real whistleblower. All of this is lies force-fed down our throats by the US government.
