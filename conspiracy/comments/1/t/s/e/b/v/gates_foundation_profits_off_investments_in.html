       The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation says on its website that it “works to help all people lead healthy, productive lives.”
      </p>
      <p>
       While the Gates Foundation has invested in many worthy projects to help people worldwide, some of the Gates Foundation Trust investments seem to contradict its admirable goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother Jones recently analyzed the Gates Foundation’s 2012 tax return to see where it was investing its money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably the most surprising investment was $2.2 million into a private prison company, The GEO Group, which have accused of numerous human rights abuses and violations.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the Palm Beach Post, The GEO Group has a laundry list of incidents in its private prisons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The State of Texas even canceled an $8 million contract with The GEO Group because of a juvenile jail where officials found feces on walls and floors, locked emergency exits and excessive use of pepper spray on minors.
      </p>
      <p>
       “[The GEO Group] knowingly put workers at risk of injury or death by failing to implement well recognized measures that would protect employees from physical assaults by inmates,” stated Clyde Payne, OSHA’s director in Jackson, Miss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother Jones also found that the Gates Foundation invested...

       Like war...the world prison system is a racket make the rich richer all under non profits, offshore accounts, and owning many who make key decisions on behalf of the people. It is time for citizens to see whose actions and words really make a difference for the communities they live in, or has it all been lies for a vote for a seat of bigger power?
      </p>
      <p>
       Taxpayers pay more for a prisoner than they do a student. Message from the government seems to be saying that we won't take care of them when they are young, but will spend billions on them when they get older.

       I will agree this is worrying, however $2.2 million pales in comparison to the ~$3.2 BILLION (grants figure) that the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation gave out in grants in 2012. That's less than 0.07%.

       What's wrong with progressing to a cashless society? In Sweden they are moving that way and things like bank robberies just do not occur anymore. Also...eugenics? I don't think you know what eugenics means...

       Cash can't be electronically tracked, controlled, manipulated, stolen with a computer. Why do you want everything you've ever purchased stored in a database somewhere? Buying too much beer or fatty foods at the grocery store? Oops, looks like your health insurance rates just went up. Good thing you abandoned the anonymous purchasing system that was around long before bitcoin. Cold, hard, cash.

       Right. But stealing cash is easier than electronically stealing from a bank.

       Cashless society leads to an end to untrackable transactions which will make the technocratic goal of a global consumption tax 100x easier to implement.  Eugenics, yes, an end to "undesirable" life.  Keeping the poor from natural reproduction is eugenics, telling them its a "good idea" to not have kids, etc.  You must have bought into a lot of the well orchestrated propaganda campaigns over the last 10 years.
