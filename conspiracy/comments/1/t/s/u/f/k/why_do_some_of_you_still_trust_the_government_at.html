<p>Government, by definition, is force. Anyone who tries to appeal to government to fix a problem is, in reality, is asking for other people with guns to force other people to do what you tell them to. </p>

<p>The government can never do anything that is moral or benevolent because to provide anything to anyone else, they must steal from others. </p>

When I first started to realize, it was surprising enough to find that I had been lied to for ~20 years.  I honestly can&#39;t imagine the realization of 40+ years of deception coming crashing down.  I have immense respect for older generations that admit to the reality of what&#39;s going on because I realize it can only be more difficult for them than it was for myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently realized that everything, literally everything of any importance, that we&#39;ve been told by the government is a lie. Nothing can be trusted. I knew there was corruption, but it&#39;s to the point where people die and disappear if they are involved with anything that the government doesn&#39;t want getting out. This is what gives me such cause for concern.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have a government, it is not of the people, by the people, for the people. It&#39;s intention is not the peoples safety and well being.</p>

<p>It is a power hungry machine, a mafia, a hit squad, they collect &quot;protection&quot; money from the average worker, let their buddies slide, and get away with breaking their own rules. Then when they do things under the veil of &quot;protecting the public&quot; what we now know is just really protecting itself.</p>

<p>When I came to that ultimate conclusion, my stomach turned, and it felt like I had a rock in there.</p>

<p>We have some very dark, very bloody, very bad days ahead of us, and there is literally nothing we can do. From the media, to the poles, the corporations, the politicians, everything is rigged.</p>

<p>Edit: Because someone was a dick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While government is force, I cannot agree that everything about government is bad. Where are you from btw? While things could be better were I am from (Sweden, living in Norway) it isn&#39;t THAT bad. Then again, I haven&#39;t been in that much need of the government directly. I got social security for a couple of months, because I couldn&#39;t find a job. Haven&#39;t been at the hospital that much, but I&#39;d have to say that a lot of things should change in our school system. I wouldn&#39;t want us to go from lots of government to no government over night. It would only result in total chaos, but we should make a plan to make government less significant over time, now it&#39;s the opposite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. The state is force and coercion. A voluntary society would be the only moral society. Generations of us have grown up only knowing that the state <strong>has</strong> to be there for certain things to exist (roads, water, fire protection, etc.)</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s compulsory school that indoctrinated us as children, moral relativism, and a failure of imagination that allows people to cling to statist beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people aren&#39;t going to get this without explanation. It comes off as nonsense.</p>

<p>*Govern- control
*Mente- From Latin mente, ablative singular of mēns (“mind”).
*Government- control the mind/ mindcontrol. </p>

<p>It makes sense. You control 99 percent of a population using techniques that manipulate their minds. Most people just want to do whatever they want, like build a house in the woods, fish/hunt, fuck eachother etc. The way you get them to fall in line and send you half their paycheck is make a bunch of stuff that is &quot;official.&quot; Laws (just words on paper), cool looking buildings, people in costumes like judges and cops, etc. Everything is &quot;official,&quot; but really that&#39;s mind control. None of that shit is any different from people writing shit on paper and getting dressed up in weird suits. <a href="http://steeshes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/ron-swanson-i-can-do-what-i-want.png">Here is Ron Swanson&#39;s take on the issue</a>. He just wrote some shit on paper and handed it off as if it was &quot;official.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Government by definition, is mind control. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Middle English governement, from Old French governement (French gouvernement), from Latin gubernatio (“management, government”), from Ancient Greek κυβερνισμός (kubernismos), κυβέρνησις (kubernēsis, “steering, pilotage, guiding”), from κυβερνάω (kubernaō, “I steer, drive, guide, pilot”) + -ment.</p>

<p>Also, note that all of the other words ending in -ment <em>don&#39;t</em> refer to the mind. I&#39;d say this is a highly inaccurate translation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;trust&quot;. Do you imagine that there are people who believe every single word that is said by any government employee? If such people exist they are probably few in number. Should I automatically disagree with every single thing that any government employee says? In that case wouldn&#39;t I be just as foolish as those that blindly trust government, just in the opposite direction? </p>

<p>I judge each government action or statement as it comes along, I don&#39;t &quot;trust government&quot; or &quot;distrust government&quot;, I don&#39;t think the question even makes a whole lot of sense when you look at it.</p>

<p>I have noticed that at times when I have pointed out factual errors in posts that alleged to revel a hidden truth I have received replies along the lines of &quot;well sure just go ahead and trust the government then&quot;. So I think there is at least some subset of &quot;truth seekers&quot; who imagine masses of people blindly believing every word or action of every government official. </p>

<p>But can&#39;t think of anyone I have met like that IRL, I think you are looking for straw man to joust with.</p>

<p>I also trust that there are lots of people dealing with the mechanics of life in a modern civilization, like keeping up the roads, keeping the water and sewage and trash moving, etc.</p>

<p>I also trust that anyone involved in regulating the flow of huge capitalist affairs is being constantly tempted by very large bribes from said huge capitalists. I trust those capitalists to be rapacious shits who will do anything for a buck.</p>

<p>I trust that every single cog in the vast machine of society is a fallible human, probably underpaid, and corruptible to various degrees. I trust that they have loyalties to whatever they consider to be &quot;their&quot; tribe, and will try to make life better for those people now and then. I trust that these myriad conflicting secret dealings and occasional revelations of such will average out to a kind of dull roar of &quot;nothing ever quite works right&quot;.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Even if you&#39;re thinking on a small and primitive level, it makes sense for survival and quality of life. I&#39;m sure at some point, some primitive man figured it would be better to put all of the wood in one big pile and build one fire for the whole group instead of everybody keeping their own wood and their own fire. That&#39;s a group effort, and that&#39;s government.</p>

<p>Even animals have government. A pack of dogs can work better in a group than they can individually, and the toughest and best of them will decide where the pack goes and what they do.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not so simple in actual practice though, not even in those simplified examples. Nothing works exactly as it&#39;s expected or supposed to be from the original concept.</p>

<p>A primitive man might fight over who gets to decide how the wood is used, how much they burn in the fire. They might steal it, hide it, misuse it. Even primitive people would disagree with each other.</p>

<p>A pack of dogs fight over who should be their leader, that fighting might not be good for the pack; and a leader might be tough enough to keep being the leader, even though he&#39;s still less effective at hunting and traveling.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I trust the government, but this premise is objectively wrong.  Most of our taxes go to social programs and safety nets.  Only about 20% goes to war and &quot;homeland security.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re off the mark. Taxation isn&#39;t the problem - without taxes your government is powerless, and without government you&#39;ll just end up paying even more (through arbitrary gateway tolls, &quot;protection money&quot;, etc) to whatever gang or corporation gains regional control over your area. The problem is transparency, when something &quot;for the people&quot; is no longer as such and begins to hide its activities from those people. Government is actually the solution to what you perceive to be the problems of taxation and representation, and the problem with that solution is that this government has been compromised for decades.</p>

Basically what you are saying is that a government can take nearly half of the money I make with the threat of jail or punishment, but in a libertarian world where people voluntarily support corporations it would be worse off? In a free market economy that isn&#39;t corrupted with corporate welfare and subsidies, an abusive corporation would never be able to conquer a society like a government can....... simply because they don&#39;t tell you to buy your products at gunpoint.....and if they did, this hypothetical libertarian society probably wouldn&#39;t have any gun control so good luck to those corporations. you&#39;re just too scared to take big brother&#39;s dick out of your ass because you don&#39;t know how to live without it shoved up there.

    <div class="md"><p>Well first off, free markets get corrupted by government interference. Nothing lasts forever, but it can for a long time- having a defeatist attitude won&#39;t help anything. People corrupting the government are rich ceo&#39;s and bankers who became rich in the first place by teaming up with the government. Also I never suggested a totally taxless lawless society, a minimalist government that exists to protect negative rights and stays out of economic affairs is what will lead to a more peaceful and fairer world. A libertarian society is based on competition which will lead to innovation which will lead to prosperity. Also what makes you think an authoritarian society will last either? They are unsustainable because of the an inevitable ride to hell when authoritarian societies become large and powerful off of the labor and suffering of reluctant citizens and eventually they become decadent and polarized and then the empires will inevitably crash. Big government stunts any real progress and is always abusing the citizens. For every person big brother helps there is another that has been completely fucked over.</p>

<p>In the Lockean view, the government doesn&#39;t give any rights. It merely protects the right to life, liberty , and property.</p>

<p>In that view, a good government is a limited one.  Meaning that the current world governments are indeed evil since they recognize no limits.

<p>Your statement is not complete.  While you believe individuals will not act altruistically, you imply that the collective called &quot;government&quot; somehow is altruistic.  When you create a government that makes decisions for people (ie todays governments) they too do not function as intended unless they are run by the truly altruistic.</p>

<p>However, once you remove the government from making moral choices, it becomes much more mechanical and the altruism of the people involved becomes a much smaller issue.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure what to make of this comment.  These are two completely unrelated sentences stuck together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Liberty and property are mutually exclusive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they are not.  Property <em>requires</em> liberty.  You inherently have ownership of your body and nothing more.  You <em>then</em> have the liberty to use your body to acquire food, clothing, shelter, and any luxury items you may desire.  But you have no right to any of these things.</p>

<p>In short, you own your labor and its fruits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How free are you, exactly, when someone else controls the means of production - the means by which you live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no right to any factory that anyone else has created or the products it creates.</p>

<p>However, where we <em>do</em> have an issue is when the means of production are monopolized though force with government regulation.</p>

<p>Want to compete with the food corporations and start a baking business out of your kitchen?  Good luck getting your kitchen outfitted with the thousands of dollars of upgrades needed to get all the permits.</p>

<p>Want to start making tools in your garage and selling them to local stores?  I can&#39;t even imagine how much equipment an licensing you&#39;d need for that.</p>

<p>Basically, if you ever have any real entrepreneurial idea that could compete with the corporations, you have to ask the government/corporations for permission.  Then, you are extorted enough to ensure that the benefit is outweighed by the cost.</p>

<p>Or, you <em>could</em> skip that step and risk having men in costumes come after your with guns.  Yup.  They are doing a great job protecting my life, liberty, and property there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to disagree with you on your definition of government. It&#39;s not force, it&#39;s a collection of rules and people who uphold those rules. So there are rules that people pay taxes, (whether we agree with them or want to do it are other matters) or not kill people, etc.</p>

<p>While there are some bad people and rules I would say the government earns the taxation due to the services they provide. Yes, we don&#39;t really have a choice, but it&#39;s not like the government in general is taking your money for no reason.</p>
