<p>Link:   <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/newtown-shooter-planned-death-obsessed-columbine-article-1.1528626">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/newtown-shooter-planned-death-obsessed-columbine-article-1.1528626</a></p>

<p>Look at the ninth picture from top to bottom. The room is of a pale white with black plastic bags strewn across the threes windows. All articles mentioned rooms being closed off with plastic bags or curtains. </p>

<p>Now look at the configuration of the three windows. We see three windows with black plastic bags strew across them. Guess what the configuration of these three windows does not match up with any single part of the Lanza’s home. Open up google earth or something equivalent and see for yourself. These crime scene photos were taken entirely in a different location. Thus, they’re fabricated. </p>

<p>2. Not one parent viewed their child&#39;s body. A state official showed them a photograph of their child and said, &quot;Sorry, your child is dead, and we can&#39;t show you the body.&quot; ... and 20 parents just smiled and said, &quot;Well, Ok, if you say so.&quot; I don&#39;t think so. And anyone with children knows better than this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the day of the shooting, they officials showed photographs to the
parents because they didn&#39;t want them at the crime scene. The medical examiners were at the  school until after midnight. Later, the bodies were all released to the parents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3. Police Scanners indicate up to 6 suspects. News helicopter footage shows Police chasing several people into the woods, and detaining them. Police scanners also indicate 2 possible suspects in a van, possibly dressed as nuns. Eyewitness footage during an interview indicates that one of the men detained was placed in the front of a police cruiser. And none of it was ever mentioned again. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The police checked them out and determined they had nothing to do with
the shooting, so they were released. Duh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4. Police Scanners indicate MULTIPLE weapons found inside the school &#39;including long rifles AND shotguns&#39; (plural) ... which is more than any one person can carry, yet ... the Media says ONLY handguns were used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before the first official announcement about what weapons were used (the
morning of December 15), the media reported rumors of what weapons were
used. Some of the rumors were wrong.</p>

<p>These are the weapons that were that were found at the school: &quot;(1) a Bushmaster Model XM15-E2S semi-automatic rifle, found in the same classroom as the shooter’s body. All of the 5.56 mm shell casings from the school that were tested were found to have been fired from this rifle. (2) a Glock 20, 10 mm semi-automatic pistol found near the shooter’s body and determined to have been the source of the self-inflicted gunshot wound by which he took his own life. (3) a Sig Sauer P226, 9 mm semi-automatic pistol found on the shooter’s person. There is no evidence this weapon had been fired. (4) a Izhmash Saiga-12, 12 gauge semi-automatic shotgun found in the shooter’s car in the parking lot outside the school, and which was secured in the vehicle’s trunk by police responding to the scene. There is no evidence this weapon had been fired.&quot;</p>

<p>After December 15, some people posted vidoes from before the December
15th news conference, implying that they were new reports. They were
not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5. The mainstream media reported several versions of the official story, starting, of course, with the shootings being committed with an AR15, then changed their story AGAIN to say that only handguns were used. They also fail to mention one word about the multiple rifles and shotguns found inside the school in correlation with Police Scanners.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See #4. The media make mistakes. It&#39;s not unusual.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>6. The official story claims Adam Lanza shot out the &#39;bullet proof glass&#39; to enter the school using a .40 caliber handgun. This is what happens to &#39;bullet proof glass&#39; when you shoot it point blank with a .40 caliber handgun: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5IcFl7rx1w">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5IcFl7rx1w</a>  Any questions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The glass was shot out with 5.56 ammunition from the Bushmaster XM-15
and I&#39;ve never seen any mention that the glass was bulletproof.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>7. NO surveillance footage has been made available to the public, even though mainstream media KNOWS people are not buying it, as evidenced by how they felt the need to &#39;debunk&#39; those &#39;crazy conspiracy theories&#39; surrounding Sandy Hook.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The security system did not have a video recorder. I don&#39;t know why it
would make a difference if there was a video. If hundreds of people are
going to lie about Sandy Hook, they could just as easily fake a video.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>10. There is very little evidence that &#39;Adam Lanza&#39; ever existed.<br/>
11. Peter and Nancy are documented as having only one child ... Ryan Lanza.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously? This is bullshit. Lots of people knew them both.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>15. The Chief Medical Examiner claimed that ALL wounds were inflicted by long guns, the Media claims ONLY handguns were used. So ... which is it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See #4.</p>

<p>16. Robbie Parker laughing and smiling before his speech to the press, then saying, &quot;Are we ready to start?&quot; while he proceeded to change his smiling, happy expression to one of badly acted out grief.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>18. Many of the parents of Sandy Hook were new to town (Newtown) then mysteriously moved away afterwards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the parents had been there for at least 5 years. I think only one two of the twenty had been there less than a year. I hardly think that there is <em>any</em> mystery as to why some would want to move away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>20. There has been NO EVIDENCE presented that Sandy Hook actually happened. All evidence has been sealed and new laws have even been enacted to keep all evidence away from the public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No evidence ... except for what was said by the local police, state police, FBI, ATF, firefighters, EMTs, parents, school officials, the governor, the state medical examiner, the funeral directors, parents, relatives, and so on.</p>

<p>If you assume that hundreds of people are lying for no conceivable reason, then there&#39;s no evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>21. No survivors were taken to any hospitals. Natalie Hammond &amp; another individual, who was never named, were said to have been shot in their lower extremities, yet, no records exist of them being admitted to Griffin Hospital.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two children had signs of life and were transported to hospitals.
Hospital admission records are not public records</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police scanners (@ 11:23:27 am) confirmed this when confused officers started to contact dispatch about why no survivors were arriving.     </p>
</blockquote>

<p>BECAUSE ALL THE CHILDREN WERE FUCKING DEAD!</p>

<p>Initially the police called for <em>all</em> available ambulances to be sent. As they checked all the children and teachers in the two classrooms, though, they only found two that had any signs of life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>22. There is no record of the crime scene being cleaned afterwards by any State Approved Agency, which is a law relating to any situation where bio-hazards, like blood, are found.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, show me any records of other crime scenes being cleaned up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>25. There was a FEMA drill scheduled the same day as the supposed shooting occurred, (19 miles away). It&#39;s called L-366 Planning for the Needs of Children in Disasters. (<a href="http://www.ctemscouncils.org/downloads/FEMAL366.pdf">http://www.ctemscouncils.org/downloads/FEMAL366.pdf</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, there was a FEMA class in another town. So what? It&#39;s a very general class about disaster planning. You can take the online version yourself: <a href="http://emilms.fema.gov/IS366/index.htm">http://emilms.fema.gov/IS366/index.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>26. There were several pages posted on the internet about the Sandy Hook shooting BEFORE it supposedly happened. Including donation sites for the victims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As has been demonstrated many times, the dates on the Internet are not reliable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>30. The children who were supposedly killed at Sandy Hook sang at this year&#39;s Superbowl. (For smart people ... this should be a really big clue) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv4-5yQL3-Q">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv4-5yQL3-Q</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They aren&#39;t even the right age.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>32.  Interestingly, most everyone involved in Sandy Hook happens to be an actor. From Gene Rosen, to the parents of the supposed children, to many of the &#39;eye-witnesses&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, there&#39;s an actor with the same name who lived in another state. The parents of the victims have a variety of professions. I&#39;m not aware of any of them being actors. There were some other parents in the school who had worked as actors in the past, but I don&#39;t think any of the victims&#39; parents were.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>36. The &#39;Newtown Bee&#39; initially reported that principle Dawn Hocksprung gave an account of the shooter entering the school. How can this be possible when Dawn Hocksprung is also reported to have been one of the first victims to die?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They made a mistake.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;They aren’t even the right age.” Take into account the whole video. The pictures broadcasted on the media were taken of the children five to six years ago, thus they are exactly the right age. Very odd that you can get not one but a group of kids that look like older versions of the victims. Teeth don’t lie. </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;As has been demonstrated many times, the dates on the Internet are not reliable.”</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That’s a very broad debunking. Yes, many of the claims were in fact wrong. However, not the tweet put out by the creator of the Sandy Hook tribute video. The tweet was sent out days before the shooting, and many people saw this tweet before the shooting. Twitter timestamps are near impossible to manipulate. </p>

<ol>

</ol>

<p>Explain why dozens of players were wearing FEMA badges at the firehouse. Representing their roles. We could also see, “an everybody check in sign” and people with clipboards instructing the players who also had badges. </p>

<p>&quot;Why did a parent slip and say that she hasn’t seen her son in over three years??”</p>

<p>Why do we see in the helicopter footage small pine trees lined up in the back of the firehouse?? Of course these trees were used to represent the victims. Hmm.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not even sure what you&#39;re trying to say here. During a breaking news story, the media put out a report from unnamed sources and it later turns out to be wrong. This happens over and over. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/breaking-news-consumers-handbook-pdf/"><em>The Breaking News Consumer&#39;s Handbook</em></a> from the radio show <em>On the Media</em> about just this issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Teeth don’t lie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t bother you that they&#39;re all the wrong age? You have to imagine a whole other level of unnecessary complication in order to explain that discrepancy. &quot;Your story is falling apart.&quot;</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t even make sense that they would be there under any scenario.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, not the tweet put out by the creator of the Sandy Hook tribute video. The tweet was sent out days before the shooting, and many people saw this tweet before the shooting. Twitter timestamps are near impossible to manipulate.</p>

<p>That tweet said &quot;I just uploaded &#39;My Movie&#39; to vimeo.&quot; Nothing about Sandy Hook. As he <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/threads/debunked-vimeo-video-proves-sandy-hook-was-preplanned.1055/">explained on Vimeo</a>: &quot;On Vimeo there are times if you wish to delete any video and replace it with another, the date remains the same from the original date the original video (being replaced) Got that so far? I do this multiple times if I decide not ot pay for additional bandwidth space if I choose to upload more than allowed for the month. It&#39;s so sad and disgraceful that people would spread such a conspiracy of sort that I&#39;m doing something wrong. I&#39;ve been entertainer millions of people all over the world with music videos for 2 years now.. To bad it has to be a memorial video! Now, give this to all the people you know or may know to end this crap now.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explain why dozens of players were wearing FEMA badges at the firehouse. Representing their roles. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen pictures of people wearing ID badges there. Why do you think that they&#39;re FEMA badges?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Representing their roles. We could also see, “an everybody check in sign” and people with clipboards instructing the players who also had badges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see anything suspicious about that sign or clipboards. I would imagine that they were trying to keep track of which children had been picked up by their parents, among other things. If one parent picks up the child and 20 minutes later the other parent comes by looking for their child, there&#39;s going to a big panic if they don&#39;t know what happened to the child.</p>

You are all sheeple if you think this is real! This is another attempt by the government to get people on the side to ban firearms. This way no one is armed when people get sick of their government rapping them and will not be able to defend themselves from the oppressive ways of their own country. The US government fears it&#39;s own people. After the Arab spring, the US has been buying up ammo and creating mass killings to get their people to give up their rights, their freedoms, and they personal defense.
---- all the comments in the comment section are planted. Even the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; quotes, look at that comment. There is no material in it at all, nothing that has to do with the article at all. The first comment shows that its his ID picture, but its not labelled in the article as his ID picture. Every single comment looks staged, fucking incredible planting, and pro-conspiracy Planting? Wow.</p>

<p>Im more concerned/amused that in that article they post a pic of a random room and say &quot;the lanza house was full of clutter&quot; ahaha like wtf? its not enough that he killed his mother, now the have to shame her memory by saying she was a pack rat? Like what the fuck is the relevance to saying the house had clutter. </p>

<p>At the end of the day we all know there is a lot of spooky shit going on....but I wish we would stay on the real ones. Like what the fuck really happened to Chris Dorner. They murdered him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I have a good eye, and I just call it how I see it.  The windows might be the same size, actually, yet the covering on the left-hand window is definitely wider.  That&#39;s after accounting for perspective.  It looks like the left-hand window might have been re-taped wider.  I can see two lines of tape there, I think.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure such a little detail isn&#39;t relevant, yet I just call it how I see it, and the black coverings on the windows are not the same width, even if you were to account for perspective.  Like, give me a little credit, please, I know what perspective is.</p>

<p>I think reason is the only way to sort things out.  Let&#39;s begin with the fact that the media is fucked- so anything you see on tv is where the real retardation is occurring (to utilize your vernacular, if I may).  They report things inconsistently, and they&#39;re uneducated on many of the topics they report on (that&#39;s 2 huge reasons to be skeptical of tv news before you even consider corruption or willful misleading of the audience or whatever.).  So, you can attribute almost everything to the media causing confusion (if it weren&#39;t for the news people, how would you have ever heard of Sandy Hook?).  Or, let&#39;s take it a step further, let&#39;s just say for the sake of argument there was a drill done somewhere where they simulated this exact situation, yet somehow the news people confused it with real-world events and reported it as such, how would you know the difference?</p>

<p>As I said, I advise reason, and critical free-thinking and allowing others to do the same.  If it&#39;s too much for people to believe that there could be lies of such a deadly magnitude perpetrated by governments or groups within governments, please study history, there are examples.  I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s what happened at Sandy Hook, just that it is indeed possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, let&#39;s entertain the notion that this is indeed something sinister. What next? Time and time again people with actual points were lumped together with the ones who think the moon landing was staged, and that there&#39;s a massive alien combine which our world&#39;s leaders answer to.
One way or the other masses don&#39;t, and won&#39;t, care. People say that they&#39;ll care when it&#39;s too late, but I&#39;m starting to think they won&#39;t even realize anything&#39;s amiss. 
So even if all of this was theatre, who&#39;s going to listen?
Plus, in one of my earlier posts on this account, I&#39;ve linked a post about the German Peasants&#39; revolt. It&#39;s easy to draw parallels between what happened then and what&#39;s brewing now - that is, the many poor against the well armed wealthy (and you can&#39;t deny that they are indeed very well armed).
Perhaps in a century humans will be studying this time much like we studied the rise of the third reich, what with today&#39;s citizenry essentially allowing their rights to be stripped little by little. But I believe that will not happen, as those that do survive down the line will be offspring of the people who chose to sit at home and view today&#39;s activists as misinformed, left-leaning enemies of state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your references to the moon landing and alien combines have nothing to do with what has been portrayed by the media and journalists in their falsifying of what happened at sandy hook. This is about people expecting to watch the &quot;news&quot; that is put out on nationally televised &quot;information&quot; stations. Media corporations around the world promotes themselves as informative, honest, unbiased and &quot;factual,&quot; but the sandy hook situation blatantly puts their entitlement to shame. They are promoting news based on no evidence at all. Not one picture of the Lanza family has been put in front of any television viewer, that shows that there is absolutely no basic fucking attempt at investigatory journalism. They are telling people &quot;believe what we say, anyone who questions us is a &#39;conspiracy theorist nut&#39;&quot; when there is more evidence that goes against their claims than with them. There is no coverage of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which entirely takes away any right to a fair trial, an opportunity to face accusers and the opportunity of being released from indefinite detention from any number of prisons around the world. There aren&#39;t any reports on any news station in America that speaks about drone strikes killing an entire school full of children in Pakistan, so that the Pakistani government and the CIA can claim that they &quot;got a terrorist.&quot; There aren&#39;t any special bulletins explaining that when a president says &quot;YOU WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR INSURANCE, DINT WORRY&quot; and then not only not apologizing, but not finding a way to fix his &quot;mistake,&quot; should be immediately be impeached by lying directly into a camera that is viewed by the people he is expected to defend and support, especially when he is now hurting them instead of helping. This is about the erosion of reality projected on a screen, camera manipulation, screen panning every three seconds and using words that are found primarily in horror stories. Instead of reporting with integrity and facts, they use scare tactics. Scare tactics are easily seen by most consumers when they feel like they are being pressured to &quot;buy into something,&quot; but people want to trust someone they see on televison, someone who says &quot;trust me&quot; and are vilified as someone with integrity and honesty, but don&#39;t actually have the traits they claim. </p>

<p>The National Security Agency took away the right to privacy in 1958.
The Transportation Security Agency took away the rights of personal and bodily privacy, along with financial privacy and medical privacy by enacting completely unneccessary screening at the most important place for traveling invented thus far.
The Department of Homeland Security took away the right to not be stopped at random, searched, interrogated and harrassed as a citizen who has not committed any crimes.
The Federal Government, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency has destroyed my right to protest an unjust government, they have taken my right to speak freely and express myself as a person of earth. Their laws are for themselves, they want me to be afraid of what it would be like without them.
This is the course of all governments, of all people in positions of authority. Everyday your brothers and sisters are thrown in cages, beaten, molested and killed by sponsored menaces.
I am given a number and a tax bracket. I am not able to end my own life due to their laws, but they can end mine with their laws.</p>

<p>There is a vast gap between citizenry and government, something that should be one and the same. The government of America was meant to support the will of the people. This has not been done in 350 years.</p>

<p>While I understand many people around the world will encounter much more terrifying things daily than I will in my entire life, I can&#39;t help but think of how long it will be until their positions will be mine. Oppression and government have been synonyms for the entirety of human kind.</p>

<p>The sooner people realize that the color of your skin, the sound of your voice and your geographical location have nothing to do with you being alive as a human, things will get better. People will be happier, honesty will be normal and people will begin to speak to people they don&#39;t already know. How can this happen when most people look to their television for information in this world and are greeted by liars who promote stories that don&#39;t make sense and are made to terrify? There is an answer. It cannot happen. This is about more than gun control, this is about a fire driven by the fuel of greed and the lust for power. The only way to extinguish is by exposing the lies and demanding the power of the people be used in an honest manner. The future is between me and the people around me, those who stay out of the public eye, those with constant security surrounding themselves, those people are not the future. All things must come to an end. End of stupidity, end of non-realization of the truth, end of the restricting of life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, to start, you saw references where there were none. I said that people who make actual (valid) points are lumped together (mostly by mainstream media) with the conspiracy nuts- this makes it difficult to get your point across to the masses.
Regarding everything else you said, since my previous post really was not clear enough, you are preaching to the choir. I agree with most of what you say, but the problem is that I doubt anyone of any significant number ever will.</p>

<p>If you still believe that old chestnut you have a fucking lot to learn. Not all, but a lot (likely a majority) of people are fat due to poison in the medications and in the their food. shut down people&#39;s ability to digest food and they gain weight. Just like is being done to animals. Give them anti-biotics in their food, kill their intestinal flora and watch the weight gain.</p>

<p>Greenberg is married to Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, who currently represents Connecticut&#39;s 3rd congressional district. Financial disclosures filed in Congress indicate the couple are multimillionaires. He is a regular contributor with James Carville to the weekly Carville-Greenberg Memo at The National Memo website. He also has a business connection with agricultural biotechnology company Monsanto.</p>

<p>ROSA DELAURO</p>

<p>wiki. DeLauro&#39;s former Chief of staff, Ashley Turton…</p>

<p>(Ashley Turton was married to Dan Turton, who worked for the WhiteHouse until April, 2011. )</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0311/52188.html">http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0311/52188.html</a>)</p>

<p>Continued… Turton was burned to death in a car fire in her own driveway on Jan. 10, 2011, a mere two days after the shooting of Congresswoman Gabby Gifford (D-AZ) occurred in a Tucson grocery store parking lot, an incident in which a girl named Christina Taylor Green who was born on 9-11 was killed; Taylor-Green&#39;s father just happens to be a scout for the LA Dodgers and her grandfather is former manage the Phillies, the New York Yankees, and the New York Mets. January 10, 2011 Ashley Turton had planned to drive to the airport for an air trip related to her work. Instead, a neighbor telephoned at 4:49 a.m. to report Turton&#39;s garage was on fire.[1] Inside the garage, firefighters discovered her body in her 2008 BMW X5 SUV.[5] Her death was investigated by the Metropolitan Police Department with assistance from the city fire department, two BMW engineers, and the ATF.[6] The death of a lobbyist in a Capitol Hill garage fire last month has been ruled ACCIDENTAL by the D.C. medical examiner&#39;s office, which said Friday that 37-year-old Ashley Turton died from &quot;thermal burns&quot; and inhaling &quot;products of combustion.&quot; found “acute alcohol intoxication” and said she died from “inhalation of products of combustion and thermal burns”.[4] According to authorities, there was no indication of foul play and there were &quot;no obvious signs of trauma&quot;.[7] SO…. The &quot;low-speed&quot; collision apparently ignited the fire, Piringer said. WTOP radio has reported that experts are exploring the possibility that antifreeze spilled from the SUV&#39;s damaged radiator and was ignited by heat from an exposed headlight bulb. There were other flammable substances in the garage.” Seems plausible that a mother with kids gets drunk and goes partying the very day her company Progress Energy was going to have its most important day ever when it merged with Duke Energy!</p>

<p>&quot;In June, after the Gulf oil spill, DeLauro, Giffords and U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2, and 29 other House members called on BP to direct dividends to an escrow account dedicated to cleaning up the Deepwater Horizon spill and compensating its victims. &quot;</p>
