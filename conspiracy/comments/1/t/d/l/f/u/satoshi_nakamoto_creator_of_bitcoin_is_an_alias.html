<p>tl;dr: whoever created bitcoin may knew what nobody could guess that the encryption algorithm deemed to be safe (secp256r1) is actually flawed.</p>

<p>And also he called himself Satoshi Nakamoto, in Japanese - 中本聪 - &quot;central intelligent&quot; or CIA ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>these guys also are having fun sometimes, why not? </p>

<p>Why would a guy with 100% US or UK English name himself a fancy Japanese name and also know exactly when to step away? This shows a clear plan don&#39;t you think? </p>

<p>Apart from the fact that bitcoin is soooooooooooo elaborated that only now after few years people are starting to discover hidden options and functions. </p>

<p>There is just no fucking way one man could do it</p>

<p>I agree that could be a group of hackers though.... But this crazy discipline of stepping back and never showing again is something that you would find in a military org...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay very little experience with bitcoin and how it works etc.</p>

<p>bu the second i started mining, i had a thought, what if these &quot;number chains&quot; or whatever we are computing are just cogs in a cloud decryption program? were throwing huge amounts of processing power in to this to mine as much BTC as we can are we sure just what we are crunching? </p>

<p>this might explain the NSA abilities of cracking it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ha, that&#39;s the point that this team have chosen uncrackable algorithm</p>

<p>As if they knew that secp256r1 was back-doored by NSA and this would one day crash the whole bitcoin project if leaked (and things leak sometimes)</p>

<p>It&#39;s like they just were sick of banking mafia and they introduced this new paradigm of money, which is very simple by the way. Forget mining, the principle of bitcoin is common ledger. Any computer in the world just knows all the transactions and they can&#39;t be faked or bloated</p>

<p>Best not to judge a book by its cover. Or in fact, maybe we should. “Satoshi” means “clear thinking, quick witted; wise”. “Naka” can mean “medium, inside, or relationship”. “Moto” can mean “origin”, or “foundation”. Those things would all apply to the person who founded a movement by designing a clever algorithm. The problem, of course, is that each word has multiple possible meanings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t know what Satoshis interest were. We don&#39;t even know who he/she is. We can be pretty sure though that he has made a lot of money on bitcoin so far and that funds have been secured in other currencies.</p>

<p>Maybe he made a backdoor because he could? To prove a point? Maybe he though it could be useful someday? Maybe a backdoor can be used to track transactions and that information is worth more than money?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i am not a scientist to evaluate the encryption, but bitcoin probably is the most attacked technology, so make your conclusion</p>

<p>they created bitcoin for some reason and i bet it wasn&#39;t easy, but i doubt that they did it just to crash into a wall later</p>

<p>and also there are hundreds of people who looked into it </p>

<p>i honestly don&#39;t know what is the difference between secp256r1  and the other, just don&#39;t have time really, may be i should look into it...</p>

<p>I am not either, but the NSA backdoored encryption can only be broken by the ones who backdoored it...</p>

<p><a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/7781/satoshis-genius-unexpected-ways-in-which-bitcoin-dodged-some-cryptographic-bullet/">The difference is in the three parameters (P, a, b) that define the elliptic curve:</a></p>

<p>secp256r1:</p>

<p>p = 115792089210356248762697446949407573530086143415290314195533631308867097853951</p>

<p>a = 115792089210356248762697446949407573530086143415290314195533631308867097853948</p>

<p>b = 41058363725152142129326129780047268409114441015993725554835256314039467401291</p>

<p>secp256k1:</p>

<p>p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663</p>

<p>a = 0</p>

<p>b = 7</p>

<p>edit: apparently there are two other constants as well and they are (for secp256k1):</p>

<p>Gx = 0x79BE667EF9DCBBAC55A06295CE870B07029BFCDB2DCE28D959F2815B16F81798</p>

<p>Gy = 0x483ADA7726A3C4655DA4FBFC0E1108A8FD17B448A68554199C47D08FFB10D4B8</p>
