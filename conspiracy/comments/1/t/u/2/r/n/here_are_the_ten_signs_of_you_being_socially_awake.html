<p>I really hope that this list will help anyone here fight the trolls and shills that are trying to lose your time by playing dumb, pretending that these matters are still obscure around. You must always follow this simple rule on this forum - &quot;Never attribute to ignorance what can be explained by malice&quot;.</p>

<p>P.S. I would like feedback to know if you like better my edited Top Ten, or the original one. Cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. While right now the Fed isn&#39;t doing what it should be doing, I would take the Fed over a gold standard banking system. It&#39;s far from perfect, as you stated, and needs some overhaul but the basic idea of the Fed is good and IMHO solves more economic issues than it creates... as an ideal institute that is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fed charges interest but only creates principal.</p>

<p>The interest amounts are above and beyond all of the money that ever existed and cannot be paid because in the end, it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>All of the interest ever charged just piles up as permanent debt and grows all of the time.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a ponzi scheme, a scam,  it causes us to spend nearly all of our collective effort just to serve as slaves to a rigged system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you putting forward another plan? Is the gold standard better?</p>

<p>I just said the Fed needs some fixes, I agree with you. But it&#39;s one of the better alternatives we have. Yes it is a system that right now is NOT working as it should. And that is because the people who have beaten the system are now running it and overseeing their former employees and buddies. </p>

<p>I do not believe the actual idea of the Fed is bad. It&#39;s the people running it who have made it a shit show. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on what you subscribe to. I think everything can be explained.. eventually, but sometimes we have to fall back on &quot;woo woo&quot; which while fun and irresponsible isn&#39;t good enough. I think these people use some knowledge that we do not have at our disposal. They surely have technologies we do not -- esoteric symbology and systems being another form of it. </p>

<p>My point is r/conspiracy is only so good as it&#39;s usefulness.. unless people deem it&#39;s good enough simply as a place to have information available. I think we need more than that and have been looking elsewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is plausible for the goverment to have some secreat weapons. And thet are free to use them on unaware citizens. This is scary.</p>

<p>Esoterism is very simple to understand how it works, if any group of people have any knowledge that others don&#39;t have, they start believing that they have a secret, they are smarter. Basic psychology.</p>

<p>Most people posting on forums have a job and a family to care about. They still try to exchange informations in order to stay informed. Obviously professional conspirologists have more informations and skills than any average person.</p>

If there are <em>also</em> external forces that respond to such ceremony that is icing on the cake and bad for us. We should learn how to harness everything we have at our disposal and among the myriad of things people <em>haven&#39;t</em> one of them is the fact we live in a very very narrow spectrum of reality. </p>

<li>You know that the endgame is a one world control of the whole planet Earth.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am making the assumption that your &quot;endgame&quot; is a centralised one world government that has complete and autonomous control. I completely understand that a one world government would be incredibly open to corruption as lobbyists and people from groups with certain ideological persuasions would be able to transform a populations way of life by convincing them that it would &quot;benefit the whole&quot; or somesuch. However, I believe that a technocracy with a close relation to meritocracy using a centrilised government that somehow had MORAL (i mean it, but who determines what is morally right?) oversight. Also small government may work with small communities but it evidently doesnt work with large scale populaces, but i cant offer an alternative that would mean less officials and more efficiency. An anarcho syndicalist collective perhaps may work but it is pure communism and hasnt EVER been tried in its purest form. Im not advocating communism but socialism at its roots is caring for everyone, which is particularly like the preachings of Jesus/Mohammed/Budha et al.  For levity (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAaWvVFERVA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAaWvVFERVA</a>) My conclusion, and i havent scratched the surface and would like debate, would be that if a one world controlled government (which i think by your title is the &quot;endgame&quot;) wouldln&#39;t be too bad if controlled by morally sound individuals. Maybe if they had oversight and individual regions and control and micro-management it could would work. Maybe like a turn based strategy.</p>

<li>You know that there are esoteric powers manipulating our physical world.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please define &quot;esoteric&quot;. Lay lines/power lines/dowsing? Gods/Demons/angels? Bloodlines/Families/Dynasty&#39;s? Aliens/Cults/Secret Clubs or Governments?
Sorry but that is so open to ridicule that it begs more definition. Im trying not to be critical but you are being as specific as David Cameron when he said he would ban &quot;esoteric&quot; material. Sorry. I really dont mean to berate.</p>

<ol>
<li> You know that the power to change the world rests with you and you alone.</li>
</ol>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s not what you know, it&#39;s who you know.&quot; Honest. If it were down to the individual it would have happened by now. However, with social and the new media we can now communicate without the MSM and it may be possible to change things. I believe i change things for people around me by even broaching subjects that they would consider taboo or ludicrous. The spark of &quot;what if&quot; is all it needs to start people to change their mental awareness. Even for the most die hard anti alien, non-ufo believer to even see the validity of Drakes Equation makes my day. The mathematical proof of many things exists and if we can formulate ways of life using them, like Chaos Theory, we may survive the next cataclysm that we our dealt. </p>

<p>8 means that all the elites are trying to behave like the NWO, or eventually join them, because this way it is easier to control the masses. </p>

<p>9 means that the elites belong to secret societies that are based on obscure knoweldge / beliefs, that&#39;s it, it&#39;s the definition of esoteric. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>9 wasn&#39;t really explained by you.  Yes many who have read this far are aware of the definition of esoteric, but you have yet to explain why you think esoterism is so evil/bad.  Is it because such societies don&#39;t take the time or make the effort at transparency?  Is it because many &quot;elites&quot; are members of &quot;esoteric&quot; societies?  Or is more personal, for instance; you were denied admission into one of these societies and are now on a witch hunt?</p>

<p>I am not trying to say why you added esoteric groups into your list, but I&#39;m trying to understand your intent in adding it to your list.  If I have offended you I apologize, it is not my intent with this post to insult or belittle you.</p>

<p>What I see with my own eyes is that the system is currently like a crack addict using all the natural resources to maintain a buzz that is surely gonna end in a crash one of these days.   I think it&#39;s more about peak oil, etc, not really that there are secret eugenicists.  It also fits better with my few of human nature which is that greed is more powerful than wrath or bloodlust or anything like that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty good list IMO. I would respectfully amend/challenge your #5 as follows:</p>

<p>Through the &quot;interstate commerce clause&quot; of the constitution, the Supreme Court has, over time, figured out how to justify the federal government to regulate or legislate on just about everything in the country, including things they were never meant to control in the first place.</p>

<p>The three ways in which a federal law can control the affairs of a state through the interstate commerce clause are if the law pertains to 1) channels of interstate 
commerce (any channel through which interstate commerce passes), 2) instrumentalities of interstate commerce (any instrumentality substantially related to interstate commerce, such as federal regulations in the trucking industry), and 3) activities affecting interstate commerce (such as regulations on any activity that anyone can do, taken in aggregate, that would affect interstate commerce). </p>

<p>So through the channels and activities affecting doctrines, congress has been able to (and indeed ARE ALLOWED TO BY THE SUPREME COURT) legislate on morality as long as there is a means of pegging it to interstate commerce. </p>

<p>For example, cases in which the Supreme Court said that hotels and restaurants could not discriminate against black people because this discrimination, if common-place, would discourage black people from traveling, and this have a substantial affect on commerce that should be free to move between the states. </p>

<p>In another case, West Coast Hotel v. Parrish (1937), the Court reinforced the first ever minimum wage - just because. They were able to link the hotel employees to interstate commerce, and because it was on the FDR agenda to pass such minimum wages, the Court said that this was the moral thing to do. </p>

<p>While I wish it wasn&#39;t that way, it is, and to a great extent, the federal government had and will continue to assert &quot;morality&quot; on the people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry mate. You are clearly missing the point here. Even if the government is able physically to make laws regarding morality, they obviously cannot intellectually, because usually the government members are not scientists, but only statists. What #5 basically says, is that people are often aware that some laws are being made only based on political bias, not on scientifical knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you really need to know this. It is mandatory to know as much as possible on what kind of knwoledge / beliefs societies are based exactly. If people from an occult society believe that human life is easily expendable, we are abviously all in extreme danger. I hope somebody would help you. Personally I don&#39;t believe anybody who belongs to any occult society. It is enough for me to knwo that they are occult, in order to be dangerous.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to a lot of my understandings through personal research. It&#39;s been slow going but mostly I&#39;m convinced now all there is to do is to act. If people could see themselves as I see.. maybe. I dunno.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not trying to be overly critical, but judging all occult beliefs as dangerous without knowing what they are about is bigoted.  Not all occult beliefs/believers are evil and out to kill/enslave everyone that doesn&#39;t agree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9 wasn&#39;t really explained by you.  Yes many who have read this far are aware of the definition of esoteric, but you have yet to explain why you think esoterism is so evil/bad.  Is it because such societies don&#39;t take the time or make the effort at transparency?  Is it because many &quot;elites&quot; are members of &quot;esoteric&quot; societies?  Or is more personal, for instance; you were denied admission into one of these societies and are now on a witch hunt?</p>

<p>I am not trying to say why you added esoteric groups into your list, but I&#39;m trying to understand your intent in adding it to your list.  If I have offended you I apologize, it is not my intent with this post to insult or belittle you.</p>
