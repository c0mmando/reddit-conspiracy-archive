        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Plain and simple we&#39;re fighting an uphill battle. Some of <em>the best</em> content that gets posted to this sub never finds its way out of <em>&#39;new&#39;</em> because of some systematic down-voting activities, perpetrated by entities that don&#39;t want you to be exposed to the content. </p>

<p>&#39;They&#39; aren&#39;t down-voting threads into oblivion, they just make sure the rating never goes above 1 or 0. Excellent content then soon gets buried. I absolutely refuse to believe, based on the discussions I&#39;ve had with and read by folks on here, that this community would much rather up-vote a silly meme image over the more substantial, intelligent conversational and informative pieces. </p>

<p>There is no fix for it within the confines of the Reddit voting system. If you were to start submission and comment scores at zero and only allow up-voting, we&#39;d just see the same shit -- meme images with 1,000 up&#39;s overshadowing posts with less than half the attention.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the perps will have created the environment they desire -- an echo chamber populated by pop-culture heads being spoon fed cherry-picked content with no dissenting opinions or critical thought seeping through the cracks. Reddit will be, if it is not already, just a fucked up version of Disqus -- no better than the comment section on a CNN article. </p>

<p>A lot of quality content will disappear and there will be nothing but cats, un-boxing&#39;s of the next backdoored electronic device or the fifteenth edition of Call of Duty and AskReddit&#39;s probing and fishing your thoughts for the next clever way to exploit the user base.</p>

<p>Blah. We&#39;ve heard it all before. Go to another site, create another site, stick it out -- whatever. The battle is lost.</p>

<p>The free exchange of ideas is one of the greatest threats to these power-hungry traitors and they won&#39;t stop the shilling and manipulation -- it&#39;s too easy. The only way to win this war is the same way we&#39;re going to win the war for civil liberties in this country [speaking for the U.S.]. Find out where these pricks work and put so much god-damned fear into them that they piss themselves at the very thought of touching a keyboard. It&#39;s extreme, but every system, every popular site will be infiltrated eventually.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like the idea of having to deal with this bullshit indefinitely. What a bizzaro fucking world we live in. Bitches taking a dollar to oppress their fellow man, and in many cases, themselves.</p>

<p>One: Hoax theories, like Sandy Hook, Boston Marathon, Batman shooting, the &#39;no planes&#39; and &#39;hollow towers&#39; theories of 9/11, and the theory that the JFK assassination was a hoax (a theory I&#39;ve presented and been downvoted to hell for).  </p>

<p>Two: Global climate change skepticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What floor?</p>

<p>The theory is that most of the floors were never built out for occupancy.  Even according to the official response from the Port Authority many of the floors remained unoccupied during the 3 decades of existence.  It was a grand opportunity for many companies and other intelligence agencies to engage in insurance fraud, fake death of agents, etc.  The buildings would be much easier to prep for demolition and may have even been built with this in mind.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the place that has done the research (including FOIA requests)  on the hollow towers theory:</p>

<p>I counted about 56 comments myself (maybe 55).  Two subthreads are hidden but available if you click on them.  </p>

<p>Do you still not see them?</p>

<p>And 19 upvotes and 9 downvotes doesn&#39;t seem that out of the ordinary, but I would still bet many of the 9 are trolls or shills. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has an auto mod that will not allow an account less than 3 days old to post threads or comment.

    <div class="md"><p>Somebody should create a front end for reddit, something like a &quot;metareddit.&quot;  It could keep track of its own vote counts and order articles appropriately.</p>

<p>If serious <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posters all used the metareddit, the original reddit voting system would not matter.</p>

<p>Scammers and shills could choose to use the metareddit (in which case their IPs and vote-brigade patterns would be logged and accessible to more than just the reddit admins), or to avoid the metareddit (in which case their votes would be ignored by metareddit).</p>

<p>The front end could also be used to work around shill mods, like at <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.  (Just because something is deleted at reddit does not mean it is deleted at metareddit.)</p>

<p>And then over time, the metareddit could evolve to have a new back end, replacing original reddit entirely.  Ideally a distributed, de-centralized back end... but that&#39;s a different story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree about the motivation part.  :)  That&#39;s why a group project might work well.</p>

<p>Having servers is a good thing, too.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see something that is totally open, so people could get most of the info from the DB, so there were no fears about admins hiding / abusing info, and so that the whole thing could be evolved into something distributed and hopefully more shill-resistant in the future.</p>

<p>As far as motivation / effort goes, I could probably supply some assistance, but I think it would make a nice open group project for something like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to tackle.</p>

I started my Reddit career on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> this past February and have since moved on to posting in the larger subs, only to be met with an incredibly organized downvote brigade immediately after each Israel/zionism related post goes up. I&#39;ll literally have my lone upvote and 2 or 3 downvotes In a matter of seconds, its very frustrating. I can&#39;t get anywhere on those subs and am thinking about giving this sub the majority of my attention again. Also there&#39;s the fact that <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> moderators hassle me daily, I&#39;ve been banned and unbanned from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> twice in the last month and am getting pretty tired of explaining to them how the AMERICAN Studies Association academic boycott of Israel is in fact US politics my eyes are going to pop out of my head,  the willing cognitive dissonance on behalf of those moderators is really unbelievable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the second one . . . . for sure, that&#39;s the type of thing that is buried here.  That falls into the hoax theory I mention above.  Sort of.  One could make a whole new category for controlled opposition.</p>

<p>There are lots of people like me that argue Snowden, Assange, Anonymous, et al., are controlled opposition honeypots and you will see people comment on this but a lot of negative votes.  Could be simple disagreement because people fell for the ruse and fell into a hero worship role and feel like it&#39;s bashing.  But why wouldn&#39;t people that believe Snowden and Assange to be the real deal be open to hearing conspiracies about them being controlled?  Most conspiracy people (like me) don&#39;t just shoot down theories without examination.  If I hear someone suspects a source I previously trusted of being controlled opposition I&#39;ll consider it.</p>

<p>Btw, I like Willy Loman for his openness to hoax theories and controlled opposition theories but it&#39;s possible he&#39;s deep cover controlled opposition as well . . . one must be ever vigilant . . . but I like the topics and theories he covers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 1st one is interesting, too cynical for me - but it makes some points.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s just kind of everything is bad and beyond repair.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s engaging - people have issues they think are especially important and this really doesn&#39;t touch on anything specific it&#39;s possibly too general.</p>

<p>The 2nd one seems like Snowden bashing.  I don&#39;t think many people get down with that, that he&#39;s part of a double conspiracy essentially.</p>

<p>The 3rd one I don&#39;t even know what&#39;s going on in that gif, i remember seeing it the other day and thinking &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in this gif&quot;</p>

<p>I seem super negative, but I think it&#39;s possible things don&#39;t succeed because people just don&#39;t connect with the way the content is being presented or just disagree with the point it makes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the 3rd one I&#39;m confused as well but intrigued.  I agree with OP that it doesn&#39;t deserve a downvote.  I assume most people just went, &quot;Meh, another NASA/moon landing hoax theory&quot; and downvoted it.  It doesn&#39;t make sense that organic users of a conspiracy sub would downvote that content, especially if they were confused.  </p>

It is sad that we cannot know who exactly is trying to sabotage this thread, this system is defective and against genuine posters. </p>

<p>The voting system is obviously making this place weak and very easy to be corrupted by the enemy. The only solution is to ask the mods to disable the voting system here on r/conspiracy, or at least making public informations about who voted and how. Otherwise it is useless posting here. Normal forums without voting bullshit are way better against trolls.</p>
