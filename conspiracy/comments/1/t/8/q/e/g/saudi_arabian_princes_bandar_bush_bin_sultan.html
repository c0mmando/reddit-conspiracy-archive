       Saudi Arabian Bandar and his brother Sleiman are financing the attack on Syria. The SULTAN BROTHERS are a 2 man crime wave across the planet and somehow they avoid arrest and prosecution by BLACKMAIL with Saudi flow of Oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       BANDAR is the real leader of AlQeda and mastermind behind 9/11 attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes Saudi Governemnt liable to USA for war reparations...
and now we know he may have been the main support of every major regional war since 1971.
      </p>
      <p>
       1- 1971 Nixon lost of confidence of the world so they started pulling out the GOLD from USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       2- France asked for its GOLD BACK, Nixon refused to give it and gave them PAPER instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       3- To back the paper he cut a deal with Saudis King Faisal to sell Oil for dollars only, making Oil &amp; dollars = Gold in value. In return USA pledged to protect SAUDI ARABIA. The Deal With The DEVIL!
USA told Saudis, do whatever you want, you will be protected
      </p>
      <p>
       4- This arrangement was clever and created 2 countries with ability to print unlimited money. This WAS a mistake and a FRAUD on all nations and USA has been paying the price for it because the Monstrous Saudi Kings proved to be an ugly bunch... Real Ugly.
      </p>
      <p>
       5- 1973, Saudi Kings led the Oil Embargo of 1973 to test America's sincerity. USA was brought down to its knees with long GAS lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       6- 1979 internal strife bring a young man Named Usama Bin Laden to Grand Mosque where he demand the King steps down. They settle with Usama by promising him UNLIMITED money to go JIHAD so long as hee keeps it OUTSIDE Saudi Arabia.
      </p>
      <p>
       7- 1982 1st country the Islamic Brotherhood (AlQaeda was just starting) attacked was Syria1st and soon Assad had Hama put down. (The world never let him live down the Hama Experience, but it seems he was suffering a Saudi Arabian Bin Laden just cutting his teeth on TERROR.
      </p>
      <p>
       8- 1982-1989 after getting chased out of Syria, Afghanistan was next.
Bin Laden was funded by Hit-men of Saudi Arabian Monarchy and went to fight Russia in Afghanistan... Not for the Americans but for the SAUDIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       9- 1992 Saudi Monarchy had its sight higher and soon Bin Laden's Ahmad Yousef (No Relation - Yousef is like Smith in USA, Jews, Christians and Muslims use that name) Ahmad tried to bring down the World Trade Center.
      </p>
      <p>
       10- 2001- on 9-11 that day, 15 Saudis committed the worst TERROR attack in history on USA and to date. To make the insult bigger Bandar Bin Kharah(Now Hold important position in that thuggish country) was in the Whitehouse while the planes were on their way to hit the Pentagonâ€¦
      </p>
      <p>
       11- Today (literally today) AlQuaeda Saudi Thugs under direction of Saudi Arabian Monarchy Bandar (Baboon) are shooting Missiles into Unarmed Christian Village called Malula.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Source: Thomas L. Friedman's book, Hot Flat &amp; Crowded) Here is my summation, including personal observation:
      </p>
      <p>
       I urge all to call their Senator (USA) demanding arrest of these 2 international thugs
       <em>
        Call Senate 202-224-3121
       </em>
       !
Saudis have financed EVERY war and conflict since 1971...

       I thought it was common knowledge that the Saudis were behind this. It didn't surprise me that such an attack would happen during a Bush-led administration. The Bush family has strong ties with Saudi Arabia.

       A supposedly rich country, which wants to wage war, willingly depends and relies on the US and US is the victim here? Is that what you're saying?

       I wouldn't say the US is "victim" but I'd go for Hanlon's Razor, stupidity (or Machiavelism) instead of "pure malice" in this Devil's Conrtact. Unlike US-Israeli relation which rise from within, US-Saudi relation is more of a sad symbiosis (petrodollars).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway Russia coming back to the international scene, along with recent American foreign policy direction in the Middle East, will certainly put this "alliance" in question.
