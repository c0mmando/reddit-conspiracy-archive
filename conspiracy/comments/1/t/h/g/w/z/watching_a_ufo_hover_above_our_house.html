        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One night I go down to the kitchen to drink water (at about 4am) and I hear this weird - kind of low pitched humming sound coming from outside. I go out to the backyard and shit you not, I see this fucking bright rounded object (UFO) hovering about 600 feet right above me. I just froze there. I almost felt like I was paralyzed for a moment. I watched it ascend higher into the air and take off at an incredible speed and disappear into the wintery clouds. That night I had a dream that I was abducted. Now when I think about it, I wonder if the dream was real but was purposely made to seem like a dream? I obviously don&#39;t know for sure but fuckin scary shit man!</p>

<p>Edit: It&#39;s really hard to remember what exactly happened in the dream but I&#39;ll try my best:</p>

<p>They laid me in bed and started exploring my body. They seemed very interested in body cavity - From my nostrils, down to my anus. They had big egg shaped black eyes, small noses, bald egg shaped heads and grayish skin tone. The room which I was in was super bright. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been interested in this subject for a very long time and have done a lot of research on it, im a terrible and incoherent writer so bare with me and make up your own mind, this is just the dots i have connected. This phenomenon is recorded  before Christ by the Ascene Gnostic tribes. Archons are noted as 4th dimensional parasitic type of being with hive-mind. Extremely telepathic, emotionless, soulless and demonic in nature. Because they are fallen they do not posses a soul and hence the ability to procreate or create life <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgone">Orgone</a> energy which was discovered by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Reich">William Reich</a>, it is possible for us to produce POR and DOR energy. To survive they must feed on those who posses and can create this energy. That would be us. So we are basically cattle on a farm and they are the farmers, that is why you will not see an invasion, the farmer just inspects his stock once in a while. We create Orgone which they feed on but because they are a low vibrational existence beings they feed on the DOR negative fear energy. I believe the vampire mythos is based on them. 
I think think this energy culminates in the ionosphere and during the storms they come down to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQmwFQJdL5A">feed</a> on it. And the poster above me had it right. They manipulate our culture with fear and war propaganda and unhealthy sex habits to create more of this energy. There is also evidence that they have a hybrid breading program, i think they are trying to find a way to be able to be on earth permanently because they cannot be on our dimensional plane for too long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be hard to explain. Take a look at this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LPtnzLhYsg">video</a> to give you a basic idea</p>

<p>I have seen many several videos on alien contact or dead bodies. They may or may not be true, i would lead towards not real myself on this one.
I think what would make a difference is people knowing who is pulling the strings. Knowledge is power.</p>

<p>I have read numorous reports that calling for Jesus Christ stops the abduction. I am not a Christian myself so im just passing over information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortuanely, stupid people nowadays try to act smart.</p>

<p>Time! Exactly! As I mentioned, I went down at around 4am but when I was about to sleep, it was already dawn. I didn&#39;t think much of it tho, I just went to sleep. </p>

<p>Yes, I searched my whole body the next day and found chipped flesh/skin on my left earlobe and underarm. Almost like a chickenpox skin but deep. They were NEVER there since I have my ear peirced so I would&#39;ve noticed it before.</p>

<p>One of the strangest things I felt was that they were using telecominucation as I was laying there in bed. I don&#39;t remember exactly what they said but I think they were asking me to stay calm.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been quite interested in aliens, ufo&#39;s, and abductions for most of my life. I assume that makes me a bit biased.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been interested in this subject for a very long time and have done a lot of research on it, im a terrible and incoherent writer so bare with me and make up your own mind, this is just the dots i have connected. This phenomenon is recorded  before Christ by the Ascene Gnostic tribes. Archons are noted as 4th dimensional parasitic type of being with hive-mind. Extremely telepathic, emotionless, soulless and demonic in nature. Because they are fallen they do not posses a soul and hence the ability to procreate or create life <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgone">Orgone</a> energy which was discovered by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Reich">William Reich</a>, it is possible for us to produce POR and DOR energy. To survive they must feed on those who posses and can create this energy. That would be us. So we are basically cattle on a farm and they are the farmers, that is why you will not see an invasion, the farmer just inspects his stock once in a while. We create Orgone which they feed on but because they are a low vibrational existence beings they feed on the DOR negative fear energy. I believe the vampire mythos is based on them. 
I think think this energy culminates in the ionosphere and during the storms they come down to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQmwFQJdL5A">feed</a> on it. And the poster above me had it right. They manipulate our culture with fear and war propaganda and unhealthy sex habits to create more of this energy. There is also evidence that they have a hybrid breading program, i think they are trying to find a way to be able to be on earth permanently because they cannot be on our dimensional plane for too long.</p>
