       I realize a lot of Reddit has issues with religion and for good reason. While Christianity is a wildly popular religion worldwide, spanning over continents with thousands of different branches and core beliefs. Many people have very conflicting ideas within the church, from other religions, or from non religious groups or those in strict opposition to any kind of organized religion. Naturally parts of the Bible seem very conflicting, especially between the Old Testament and New Testament. Explaining all the contradictions would take a whole post of its own, as the contradictions mainly occur from translation issues primarily, but more broadly speaking it comes from different time periods with different physical samples, mixed with a whole cast of different authors each with their own understanding of the world and a unique narrative to each one.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all that being said here is the conspiracy, in 325 AD a meeting named
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea%20was%20formed%20as">
        The Council of Nicea
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Its main accomplishments were settlement of the Christological issue of the nature of the Son of God and his relationship to God the Father, the construction of the first part of the Creed of Nicaea, establishing uniform observance of the date of Easter, and promulgation of early canon law."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Romans and the Catholic Church were in agreement that they wanted control over what they wanted the messages of the Bible to be, and the Roman Emperor wanted to mix in pre-existing Pagan traditions with the narrative of the New Testament, which is where we get Jesus' birthday being November 25th, being born of a virgin, salvation, 3 day resurrection, sign of the cross, 12 disciples, the fish and water symbolism etc. Now coincidentally the actual founding father of Christianity as history chronologically first dates, was the Apostle Paul. The Bible also tells us before Paul was blinded by light on the road to Damascus he was known as Saul. Interestingly enough,
       <a href="http://www.sullivan-county.com/news/pmithra/">
        Saul was into a Pagan sun cult
       </a>
       . Interestingly the deity Mithra was praised in many parts of the world and
       <a href="http://www.truthbeknown.com/mithra.htm">
        shares many similarities with Christ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So that being said that would mean Christianity is a mostly Mithra worship, with Pagan traditions and roots. However, I would argue that the Christ still was very real, but he certainly had no say in the creation of any organized religion, rather the character seemed to be more opposed to it. Also from this point out I will refer to Jesus Christ to his original Hebrew name, which is "Yeshua," which correctly translates to today's "Joshua" in English. What needs to be carefully examined are the books of the Bible that were not allowed to be canon, or were essentially banned. Many philosophers of the time had access to these books and writings, and their influence actually does carry quite far into many occult traditions, mysticism and other religions. The first and probably most important text we should examine to better understand the true Yeshua's teachings is the
       <a href="http://gnosis.org/naghamm/gosthom.html">
        Gospel of Thomas
       </a>
       . Now this text is written as a compilation of sayings of Yeshua, as told to his disciples after his supposed resurrection or ascension. Some of the quotes he gives are actually represented in the other gospels of Mark, Luke, Matthew and John. But this text didn't try to do any story telling, which is likely why it was left out, it really is unfitting stylistic wise with the other gospels. But some of the things this guy says are wonderfully enlightening. He speaks so strongly, with excellent parables and tricky use of paradox, which the disciples often have to ask for clarification. The main points he is stressing though are that everyone for themselves hold the keys for enlightenment and ascension to the kingdom. He claims the Kingdom is "within so without," or "As Above so Below" which is actually a quote credited to
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus">
        Hermes Trismegistus
       </a>
       the "Thrice Born." By some mythologies and occult traditions this guy is said to be a reincarnation of the gods Mercury or Thoth, and this philosophy is often regarded as one of the most essential to enlightened thinking. Yeshua never claimed to be a God, he claimed to have the Truth, and that he was only the teacher, and that we all have a way to live for and use the teachings he gave. He claimed he was capable of great things but that his disciples were capable of greater. He truly knew that we were all one and the same, a mass consciousness living as individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all the true merits of Christianity or worth examining, because they've been misunderstood and have been given harsh critiques for many years, but that's because it was molded for an agenda, and that agenda is mostly irrelevant to today's age, making it either blind hope and faith for some, or a ridiculous and unnecessary train of thought for others.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR; The true accomplishments and brilliance of the true Jesus Christ's messages were shrouded in myth and conflicting ideas with a conspiracy by the Romans and the Catholic Church to create a controlled society. However, the shining nuggets of truth can easily be found if one does the proper research and makes the connections of the context of the time and setting of when Christ actually lived versus when the Catholic Church began to try and raise and control a religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've done a lot of personal research in my own time about a vast array of topics from ancient symbolism and archetypes, religion, philosophy, ancient literature, occult schools and traditions, mythology, folklore, shamanism, you name it on any topic of ancient oppressed knowledge or history, and I can take questions. I don't claim to be any expert at all, but I am quick to make connections.

       Also another related side note, the John who wrote the Book of Revelation also wrote another book, called the
       <a href="http://gnosis.org/naghamm/apocjn.html">
        "Apocryphon of John."
       </a>
       This one was also banned, but for a more interesting reason. The narrative of this book was an angel appearing before John, not with a vision of an apocalypse but rather reeducating John on the full story of everything leading up to Genesis and to the "Fall of Man" from the Garden. It's like a way more badass version of the Adam and Eve story, but the God who banished him was basically the bad guy and the serpent was just honestly trying to help.

       Oh man, the ancient sumerians have a very similar story. Anu was high leader of the annunaki, and his two sons were sent to earth to rule over a gold mining operation. Enlil was to rule the north, enki was to rule the south.
      </p>
      <p>
       The annunaki who were doing the mining found it to be hard and tedious dirty work. So enki, being a geneticist, decided to make the adamu (humans) to do the work for them as a slave species. Enki found empathy for the humans, and manipulated their genes so they could be taught. he gave them knowledge and the other annunaki didnt like that (for an educated population is much harder to control than a zombified uneducated population). So there was a war within the annunaki, in which enki lost (i think).
      </p>
      <p>
       Enki, the one who empathized with the adamu, was labelled as bad. Coincidentally, his symbol was that of a serpent! He was the ruler of the underworld (the southern hemisphere), later to be manipulated to mean hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       So similar indeed! This kind of thinking has made me think about researching satanism to see what their theology is. But, thats a kind of scary proposition for obvious reasons...

       Well if you're going to look at Satanism realize that what most people claim to be Satanism isn't actually Satanism. Many occult traditions are falsely labeled as devil worship, and they might pay homage to other deities or none at all. Satanism in particular if it were looked at the most true definition, Satan would be the opposite of God, Oneness vs. complete separation. I personally have no interest in trying to relearn separateness. They focus on so much materialism I can't find what's worth sticking around for. That being said the symbolism is rich and mythologies connect to other religions, it's interesting to read about.

       Seems like part of the Council's aim was to remove true spirituality from Christianity in those days. Many texts that the Gnostic Christians favored were removed (Gospel of Thomas/Mary, etc), leaving only 4 gospels. One Bishop was supposedly quoted as saying, 'God saw fit to create 4 directions, so we saw fit that there should be only 4 gospels' or some such.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, seems like this is the time were fundamental 'literalism' was born into Christianity (which inevitably favors a hierarchical control-system, the preference of Leaders), leaving the 'symbolists' (the Gnostics) to be shunned, ostracized &amp; eventually a lot worse. Forcing them underground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty sad, because as the new Pope is showing, the kernel of truth about How To Live &amp; How To Treat Each Other, has become alien to many Christians. The numbers that are reacting negatively to the new Pope's message is a clear indication of that.
      </p>

       It disappoints me greatly that the new pope is greeted with such disrespect for trying to recapture the truth, he seems like the most honest leader the catholics have had for quite somtime. Regardless, that church in particular needs someone like him right now, I just hope he amounts to enough that he could provoke some big positive change in the world. He has so much power for good, and I suppose I understand why he might have to take things slowly, it has been thousands of years after all.

       The new Pope is the most powerful man on Earth. The Jesuits lead all the intelligence services. As Karen Hudes, amongst many others, pointed out, that's where the money trail ends! They are the top of the food chain. The Rothschild's are just some of the bankers of the Vatican. Nothing else.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone touches him, they will burn. And their houses. And their families. And their animals. And anyone carrying the same name. And anyone with any genetic resemblance in the Papal NWO archives of us cattle. And their country will be struck with poverty for generations. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am afraid you overestimate the holy fathers Christian love. At least if your interpretation of Christianity has anything to do with modesty and forgiveness. Try and read about the Jesuits, you are in for the wildest ride!

       From what I understand Jesus was not that far from Buddha; they both were speaking of presence. They recognized the uniquely human affliction of fear of death and were enlightened enough to see salvation in moving past that. "The kingdom of Heaven is within
       <strong>

       Amazing how that got co-opted to make people fear death, feel shame, and worship that which is exterior.

       Interesting post OP.  I was raised a strong christian, and personally very devout.  At about age 25 I finally allowed myself to begin questioning my faith and religion.  There were many things I saw within my religion that did not seem very Christ like.  The internet was young but became a brand new tool that allowed me to search for the "Truth" from home.  It was not hard to dismantle my faith with all of the inconsistencies I was able to find.  The council of Nicea and its implications being one of them.  Through a determined study of science I became an atheist.  I abandoned all belief in a God/Creator.  Anything that was not measurable, physical, provable I cast off as unreal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I slowly shifted towards agnosticism.  With humility I began to realize that both God/Creator existing or not existing was unprovable, so the atheist has to have a level of faith equal to that of creationist.  I had large life upending events occur in 2008 (divorce, loss of good job).  I began reading self-help/motivational books and had a renewed interest in the pursuit of truth.  Every book, or lecture seemed perfect at the moment and something in it lead to the next.  I was still agnostic at this point and stayed away from things that spoke of spirituality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went down the rabbits hole of things like aliens, ancient aliens, Annunaki, Paladiens, Sirians, UFO's, crop circles, telepathy, remote viewing, OBE (Out of Body Experiences), NWO, False Flags, and so on.  What I had was an intense desire for truth.  At some point during all of this I came across a spiritual teacher, a teacher of Enlightenment that helped me make sense of it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       He spoke of the experience of the Mystic.  I had to look up what a Mystic is.  He explained that the experience of the Mystic has been the same throughout all time, cultures, or religions one was raised in.  They all speak of the same condition.  The experience of God Immanent.  He explains Enlightenment is the awareness of Oneness, Allness.
      </p>
      <p>
       What helped me was that he pointed out that the Buddha was the teacher of Enlightenment, and that Jesus was the teacher of Salvation.  That the purpose of our lives is to return to the awareness of God as Self, but that it is very difficult to do so.  The Buddha had many previous lives and it was his awareness that the only way to transcend the pains that go with human life (sickness, old age, suffering, and death) was to become Enlightened and no longer identify with the EGO, or self with a small s.  Because it is so hard to transcend the EGO, Jesus came on our behalf to teach Salvation.  Jesus says, Romans 10:13 for "WHOEVER WILL CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED."
      </p>
      <p>
       I had been previously stuck in a mindset that either Christianity or Enlightenment were correct.  Not that both could be correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am on a path were Enlightenment is my goal but where if I fall short Jesus is my Savior.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a comment here that talks about the possibility of this world being a virtual reality and I can say that from what I have learned about the path to Enlightenment, using VR as an analogy for the world we live in, is not that far off.  The Matrix and Avatar can also be used as good analogies, just without the evil aliens or war mongering humans in the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like the OP have studied long and hard and do not claim to know it all, but can make connections quickly.  If you have questions I am happy to answer if I have an answer.

       I really like how this is put, so simple yet I think it really captures what I think Jesus was trying to teach. So many people today are caught in shameful cycles of sin and forgiveness, but when does it end? Sure Jesus has saved you but you go back to doing the normal things you do everyday. You can't put all your faith on teachings of a 2000 year old guy that maybe lived, you have to truly feel to understand the teachings, apply what works for you and what you think is true, follow your heart and the Christ consciousness and salvation and enlightenment will be yours.

       I noticed you are "enlightened" enough to include OOBE's in your search for truth. Would you please elaborate why you included OOBE's in your search for truth. Take care my friend, the conclusion to our story is upon us.

       Yes I am familiar with the law of attraction.  I dated a woman after my divorce that was a firm believer in the law of attraction.  This was my first acquaintance with it.  I was new into my spiritual quest and it did make a lot of sense to me.  I never gave thorough investigation to it but lightly applied it in my life.  I recently heard the spiritual teacher I referenced in my first post, speak of the law of attraction in a youtube video.  He said that the law of attraction is a new packaging of an old spiritual truth.  The Buddha, the Mystics all spoke of the same thing.  What you hold in mind tends to manifest.  He did not knock it at all, just warned not to be spellbound by the presenter of such truth or the commercialization of it.

       I did a post on Enoch on r/psychonaut a while back, I really think that's a super important text as well, it just paints such a bigger picture than all of the Torah in my opinion. Enoch wrote a better book as his only book than Moses could do with five.

       You seem very knowledgeable. Since my mid twenties, I have grown to be agnostic over the years because I have found religion to be little more than a social construct. It was then hi-jacked by kings and popes to ensure social compliance. Much of the folklore and tradition has evolved out of ancient man's mythology over the daily "battle in the sky" between light and dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun fact: There is a theory being discussed that we may be living in a "digital simulation" or sim program. Apparently, some very smart people are seeing signs that we may exist in a program of a student from the future. I know it sounds absolutely bizarre. I don't know if that is the case or not; however, it would make for a fascinating creator or god.

       I think this is impossible, there are too many feelings and emotions to program human beings to feel, for instance, I would rather stick it in my wife's ass then her vagina, for a myriad of reasons, there's no way a computer program could control that, and I'm not being facetious, I'm trying to point out a minute detail in one persons emotions and feelings to show that this can't be predicted by a program.

       That is a valid opinion; however, impossible is like the word "forever". It's an ideal that cannot be achieved. In a very real way, we are all just carting around an organic CPU in our heads.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think emotion will be a threshold that machines "acquire" at some point along their evolution. AI is on a staggering learning curve right now. Boston Dynamics (a military robotics pioneer) has just been purchased by Google. A robot is little more than AI and sensors, in general terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just reading that Watson (the Jeopardy supercomputer) is "reading" hundreds and hundreds of medical books, scientific journals, reference manuals every day. Watson is much "smarter" today than it was when it cleaned everyone's clock on the TV game show, just a few years ago.  Imagine the scope of knowledge Watson 3.0 or 4.0 will have in a decade?

       Hey, OP, good stuff. Have you read any John Lash? I just read his book "Not in HIS Image," which is basically a breakdown of the Gnostic teachings of the Nag Hammadi Codices, essentially the Pagan intellectual response to the "salvationist religions," as he calls them. He also authors the web site
       <a href="http://www.metahistory.org">
        www.metahistory.org
       </a>
       on these same topics. I thought his book was fantastic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, are you familiar with John Allegro's work, "The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross"? He was a Dead Sea Scrolls scholar who concluded that early Christianity involved the use of psychedelic mushrooms. He's very well-known.
      </p>
      <p>
       Curious about your thoughts on this stuff or any more perspective; you seem knowledgable on these subjects. The Council of Nicea was most definitely a true conspiracy, and very central to understanding the crazy religious world we live in today.

       I have heard of both of those authors but haven't actually read their work, so thanks for the info! The ties betwen psilocybin and Christianity is certainly interesting as well. I am more familiar with Terrence Mckenna's Food of the Gods, and understand how at least early humans were using psychedelics for shamanistic practices or even early religions. Hell there could be a lot of religions that were influenced by these drugs, I know there is something very special there, I haven't gotten around to trying many real psychedelics myself, just regularly smoke pot to get those creative thoughts running haha ;)

       You should eat some mushrooms someday, for real! It's a potentially life-changing experience, no matter how smart and in tune you already are. Do them at night in a quiet, ceremonial setting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Terence McKenna was great, yeah. Someone who's been adding a lot to that line of research is Graham Hancock. He's found that about 40,000 years ago we see a lot of cave art suddenly appear in different parts of the world that's now accepted as shamanic artwork. There is a lot of very specific imagery that represents what people often see in DMT, ayahuasca and mushroom experiences. This correlates with the rather sudden rise in art, early religion, basically the whole creative side of humanity. So speculation abounds.

       As for shrooms, yes. I totally agree. Ive done both lsd and shrooms, but shrooms take the cake. Its so natural and the lessons i learned are going to be with me for the rest of my life. Empathy was one of the biggest lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
       If done right, it is my belief that shrooms are one of the best and most essential tools to guide one towards enlightenment. It only reveals that which is already inside of you. But it does so in such a gentle, natural way, through empathy and acceptance of the natural beauty, that one cant help but try and find a meaning behind the experience. That, and the path to enlightenment, are one and the same.

       Graham hancock has authored a book called Supernatural. He talks about ayuasca and the DMT experience in regards to spiritualism and stuff. He claims that studies have shown that while experiencing the realm of DMT, the user (or every user for that matter) sees the same sorts of "spirits/entities". He postulates that this is because these are real beings, and the DMT allows our minds to tune into their frequencies in order to perceive these beings, though without the DMT we are locked in our physical world oblivious to these beings presence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is an interesting read, amd i like to connect it to a possible ulterior motive for keeping psychedlics like DMT and marijuana illegal--that is, not for health issues, but to keep the human race enslaved to the five senses and to disallow them to transcend this physical world into the spiritual realm.
      </p>
      <p>
       He goes further and talks about the oldest cave paintings, and postulates that because the paintings themselves are located in such great depths that are extremely hard to access inside the caves, that the painters themselves had to have done that on purpose, and possibly was using a psychedelic of some sort in addition to senory depravation inside the cave in order to have access to these spiritual beings an record it in the caves.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would you connect this to christianity and its alledged connection with psilocybe species?

       For how history seems, it looks like from the years after the council of Nicea that psychedelic use likely dropped, as people were being drawn into this new religion, with new rules and core beliefs. The catholic church may have wanted to make use of such drugs to be viewed as "sinful" or dangerous, which is much of the reaction we get today. I can't say for sure whether this council is the reason Christianity may have lost its more spiritual roots with psychedelics. I can say that it was never completely lost either, as the gnostics, hermeticists, alchemists of various sorts, masons, rosicurians or whoever retained some of the more ancient knowledge and tradition, but many of the more shamanistic traditions were forgotten as the groups were phased out by the growing power of the church.

       I think Yeshua lived, who may or may not have been crucified, or perhaps falsely crucified and then moved to India. That's an interesting conspiracy on its own, the one that suggested that either there was a fake crucifixion or none at all and Yeshua went to study or teach in India afterwards, as there is some claim in a city somewhere in India that has Yeshua's bones. It's still hard to test or prove with any degree of accuracy, but with all the myths and stories I do think there was some messiah character, I just think he was a pretty regular guy who just had it figured out at the time, he is credited to have said we are capable of great works. But that being said I also believe everything he teaches is just as important and worthy even if the character never literally existed.

       I wanna point out, soke articke i read awhike ago on the life of jesus stated that the first thrity years of his life he was either highly disliked or  travelling to distant kingdoms learning their cultures and religions. He returned as an enlightened one and literally most of what we know about him is in the very last three years of his life, during which his teachings had occured. The article goes on and explains that it wasnt until years after his death was his teachings recorded and his influence bolstered.

       It's highly unlikely that a literal physical human named 'Jesus' existed and did the stuff talked abut in the Bible. But that doesn't really matter because the story is outstanding. I have zero problems using Jesus as a model for behavior and thought. A lot of people laugh at those 'What Would Jesus Do?' stickers, but I think they're great. I may not be a Chrstian in the conventional sense, though it still makes me think about the paths of action I could take and which one would be the best of all selections.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was a tangent - sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be careful about assuming Jesus was a literal 3D guy that walked and talked. The Nicean Council played a lot of tricks and fucked with a lot of things. This is worthy of attention. In fact I always filter my readings of The Bible through, what I assume, is the Nicean view so that I can remember that the latent point is a political text more so than a religious one. Still, when you remove a lot of the pleas to authority [Divine Right of Kings] and read, in particular, the Sermon on The Mount you can come away with a lot of wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think on Jesus the same way I'd think on Sherlock Holmes; both fictional and both make good models for behavior.

       Humilities obviously the norm. Of course, I'm prepared to appeal your case. Can you be more concise about where you were at when you lost your way? Was it an issue of trust, or was it a matter of circumstances?
How could you actually see the glory of this universe and then let go of the truth?

      <p>
       Your question necessitates that I was on a path and that I knew about this path. Trust assumes that I trusted someone and that said trust was broken. Your usage of the word "Truth" suggests that you think it's the most important thing in life. You also assume that I had "Truth" and then let it go; as though I no longer posses a "Truth" that you think may be The One Real Truth.

       I have a free gift for you to watch. It's a full length motion picture made by academic theologians. In it they explain how and why the Christian Church went wrong and stayed wrong up until this very day. I've condensed these thoughts into a famous quotation, which sums it all up most eloquently;
      </p>
      <p>
       " Ultimate power corrupts ultimately"
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the most well meaning men and women can't step outside themselves and their earthly desires. The movie is called what else;
      </p>
      <p>
       "Revelation-the Bride, the Beast and Babylon" it can be viewed at any number of free movie streaming websites. After you watch it, I'd be curious about your thoughts. I hope you're prepared to discus OOBE's with me. I have an incredible tale to tell. Thanks, take care my friend.

       Interesting film, not much information that I didn't have already but it is good information presented in a a way that many who are still under the mind lock of the church may see through their illusion.

       I have studied many occult texts, grimoires, Libers, you name it. I've studied the lesser and greater mysteries of a forgotten time. The mystery schools that taught Pythagoras, Plato, Socrates and the other great thinkers never really disappeared. In the end, you have to live through yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you mention OOBE's, the great thing that shows you that you're something much bigger than the conception of your everyday self. I've traveled through the stars, seeing worlds I've never conceived before. I have seen many fascinating things in the dream world/astral planes. I know not of their exact nature, besides that they reflect everything that is Above and Below.

       I appreciate frank discussions too my friend. What first presented to my scientific mind was an OOBE, however any fundamental investigation soon exposed the lie. Are you aware of the origin of the verse you keep quoting;
      </p>
      <p>
       "What is up, is as is below"?
      </p>
      <p>
       You see I'm a highly trained scientist, the origin of this phrase stems from ancient alchemy, the statement, or the question is to begin a riddle.
      </p>
      <p>
       To paraphrase; the heavens are just a reflection of life here on Earth. It's also the answer to an old alchemical formulaic quest for godlike power; eternal life and/or earthly riches, in this case the philosopher's stone converting lead into gold.

       I am very familiar with the origins of the phrase. I have studied the Emerald Tablet with incredible care, and I take the Great Work, or the consecration of the stone, to be likely the one of the most important paths to enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as Buddhists, Taoists and many other Eastern philosophies stress the importance of being in the present moment I am not sure they are always the best to overcome all the challenges of the human psyche. I could meditate every day and gain great benefits from it, but we are still predominantly waking, conscious beings, and the way we speak and interact with others also needs a method of training.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calcination, Dissolution, Separation, Conjunction, Fermentation, Distillation, and Coagulation are the names of the 7 Alchemical processes. 7 phases of consciousness, that we don't necessarily work through all at once or in perfect order. To each their own, the processes laid out in the Emerald Tablet are a teaching of our true nature, one that doesn't place us in a world of subservience. It's not selfish to want to be a better person.

Previous peoples had some part of truth and made of it what they could, or perhaps they once had all of the truth and it was lost or watered down into their particular paganism. Really, if any of it is true, you would expect many similarities in religions.

       More interesting to me than Mithraism is Zoroastrianism. Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu, etc.

       I suppose I shouldn't really say one is the mostly the other or vice versa, but they share similarities, and those similarities do indeed branch from zoroastrianism.

       Very awesome post!
      </p>
      <p>
       Though i was a bit diappointed that you didnt mention the book of enoch. However, wwhatever amount of disappointment i had, it was more than made up for when you mentioned how chritianity is based on pagan beliefs. Ive had discussions recently about a theory that the holy crusades were meant to wipe out the pagns and their history and books, to eliminate all evidence that the stories in the bible was tampered with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive done my share of research on the biblical apocrypha. Very interesting indeed! And i believe you have hit this nail right on the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       (How would you connect the book of enoch into all of this??)

       The reason I didn't cover the book of Enoch specifically in this case was because I was focusing more on the narrative that the New Testament was given by the Catholics and Roman leaders. The book of Enoch was also very interestingly not included in the Christian Bible, and I would assume it was not included because it was conflicting with some of Moses' teachings. The Torah had been praised for thousands of years, but then again Enoch was also studied a by many ancient religious figures or wise men. Enoch went on a pretty psychedelic trip, and learned the nature of why everything in the world is the way it is, he is a humble man who was rewarded with fantastic knowledge. Perhaps the better reason why Enoch was banned was because of how it covered the Nephilim, as it basically gives a several thousand year old proof for either gods or an alien race descending to create a hybrid race with early earth females. It would give credibility to the argument that there is a line of darkness on earth, and that they have thrones on earth, why would the catholic church or the Romans give the people a chance to make the connection that their rulers may have descended from the Nephilim. I'm not necessarily saying that the Roman Empire has Nephilim or Annunaki blood, but they did shelve one of the greatest apocryphal texts of all time. Enoch is simply a brilliant text, richer in symbolism and meaning than most other religious texts, and is pretty easy to read.

       I read a book once called Celtic Christianity, I don't remember much about it but it had an interesting summation that the Celts had a better understanding of true Christianity because of the tin trade between Jerusalem and the British Isles shortly after christs death.

       Also, have you read the book called "uriels machine"? It talks heavily about the gnostics of ancient british cultures. I dont remember exactly how much it connected to christianity, but its a book id recommend as it touches on some if the meanings of the cosmos in these ancient peoples, and describes how they built their monoliths to be stellar calendars and how the pagans worshipped the sun and venus and how it all plays into their belief system. I found this information to be at least relevant to the time before the council of nicea.

       From what I've read about the British Isles was that their ancestors were actually some of the giants discussed in Enoch and other texts describing Nephilim. It's pretty hard to prove the existence of giants, but the fossil record does have at least a few samples to show that giants did walk on the earth at a time, and it would explain some of the monolithic structures that would be too large for humans our sized to be working with at their time.

       Easter was always a pagan thing.  It related to the solstice.  Passover was always a Jewish thing.  It was always the first full moon after the barley in Jerusalem was tender (or something like that).  Easter never had anything to do with Christianity until after Constantine grouped all religions together under Roman Universalism.  Technically it was two emperors after Constantine that really solidified all that. But for some reason Constantine gets the credit.

       The gospel of Thomas was widely mocked in the writings of ECF's such as Iraneus and Eusebius.  It was a Gnostic text, and any time it was mentioned, it was mentioned in the context of being not recomended reading.

       I was more getting at the fish connection with pisces here, and I also agree the 12 disciple archetype is likely paired with the zodiac and since Christ also happened to come with the age of Pisces, only recently has the Age of Aquarius begun, but everything you say about the literal fish symbol that came to be used is correct

      <p>
       I think what Jesus was trying to illustrate here was not a literal divide between male and female but a mental or spiritual one. It just wouldn't make any sense if all of a sudden Christ was a sexist, but rather he is trying to say the female should also be like the male, and while he didn't say it, also implies the other way around. It's the Hermetic principle of Gender, they are just two opposites that are conversely and paradoxically the same.

       I absolutely agree.  all those guys are fully pagan.  (except Buddha) Dec. 25 has absolutely nothing to do with Jesus in any way prior to about 350 AD.  In fact, according to the bible, it would be impossible for Jesus to have been born anywhere near Dec. 25 because shepherds did not "tend flocks" at night out of doors on Dec. 25 in Bethlehem.  Additionally, you can add up the dates of what Jewish holy days were going on when Mary and/or her relative got pregnant.  It is nowhere near 9 months prior to Dec. 25.  The Dec. 25 thing was all Constantine.  It was never "Christian"
