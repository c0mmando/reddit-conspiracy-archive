I just realised that there might be somebody here who is unable / unwilling to talk about certain matters, because is biased by political, religious, social, biological or whatever else barrier towards certain Conspiracy Theories that are about groups of people the posters belong to.</p>

<p>Because of this I wonder how many here are real free thinkers, that are completely free from any taboo inhibitions and are able to discuss any kind of Conspiracy Theory, without being afraid that people from their group might be exposed / damaged?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not open minded then.  </p>

<p>There are other reasons they do what they do other than the excuse of being psychopath. </p>

<p>· nature - fittest and smartest survive</p>

<p>· entitlement- their family gained the wealth, and want to be able to share it with their offspring. </p>

<p>· grand scheme- maybe they have to do what they are doing in the grand scheme of things.   </p>

<p>You cannot place them in a box and call them psychopaths and be done with it.  Thats closed minded, and very simple.  This whole thing is complicated and giving them no benefit of the doubt, regardless of how evil the things they do seem to be is just simple minded.</p>

<p>Their belief in reincarnation is one thing you should consider </p>

<p>How many here are completely free from any bias?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know any human ON EARTH that is &quot;completely free from any bias&quot;.  Matter of fact, I don&#39;t think there IS a human on Earth that is completely free from bias.  Such a thing is part of what being human <em>IS</em>.</p>

<p>The goal is not to be completely free from any bias, but to have proper and <em>well-balanced</em> biases - to be free from those biases that serve to keep one out of balance and from being a decent being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heck even watching MSM programming involves a level of bias.  <em>Everyone</em>, it seems, is biased.  I, again, haven&#39;t seen any human that isn&#39;t - especially considering that bias is simply another way of describing &quot;choice&quot;.  You see, whenever you make a choice and are <em>choosing</em> a thing - any thing - you are being biased <em>in favor</em> of what you are choosing as opposed to what you are <em>not</em> choosing.</p>

<p>Ultimately, being biased isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing in and of itself.  It&#39;s more about HOW YOU DIRECT the natural bias that all of us inevitably have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of people are starting to get their information from alternative sources as well as mainstream sources which at least leaves you questioning and presented with multiple points of views. In that way, a lot of people are less biased than if they only get their news from the mainstream sources. But still, everyone has an agenda, and it is very difficult to not be somewhat biased. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Id like to suggest that i could represent the kind of free thinking you are asking about. Although i believe we all approach any given situation with a certain amount of bias, i make it a point to try and remove said bias during discussions.</p>

<p>It helps that i dont affiliate myself with any religion or any particular political stance (i.e. democrat, republican, etc.). </p>

<p>I believe there are plenty of respectable folks here, but as you pointed out recently in one of your posts, they often get buried underneath &quot;trolls&quot; &quot;shills&quot; or simply people having an emotional response. </p>

<p>With that said, i also believe that good-minded people do sometimes get in a funk and produce reactionary statements that dont really represent their typical behavior, if that makes sense. I mean, there will be times where each of us will give in and argue for the sake of arguing. Actually, one of my new years resolution is to try and limit that exact thing as much as i can.</p>

<p>What do you think, OP? Do you feel you fit in that category you asked in the post? (I think this is a fair question..)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is unbiased, it is wired into our biology, neurological structures and processes, as much as language, ethnicity, cultural and social milieu exposure, personality type, personal history, and so on. These influences and forces are inescapable, make what is defined as &#39;human&#39; collectively and subjectively.
Perhaps the only kinds of people who exist here (on earth) who arguably aren&#39;t, would be those persons historically who reveal a teaching that becomes a religion and a tradition, ie. those beings who claim ontological distinction from the rest of us, and reveal something direct from the Ineffable itself. Of course, that claim in itself, and all it implies, is biased, and cannot be proven, only investigated. And that is a wild divergence from the original question..
Short answer: no one is free of bias. It&#39;s an impossibility.</p>
