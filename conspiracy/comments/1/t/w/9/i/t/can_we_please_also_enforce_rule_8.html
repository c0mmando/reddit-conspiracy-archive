       Memes were banned because it got to the point there were just too many of them. They got real old real fast. I don't think the rule should be changed.

       Why do you want to censor /conspiracy.

       Can you give me one example of an image or meme or quote that you consider detrimental to /conspiracy? A single example would go a long way to make your point.

      <p>
       See, the problem is that you will not be able to give an example. And of course that means that you just want to control the free flow of information without any basis in reality.

       I think, as has been said on various occasions in response to this request, that there are times when a quick image can illustrate a rather complex topic or subject, and can in a quick flash give the general point to those unwilling or unable to read through a long article or sit through a long video.  In that sense, that would seem to be a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that this can lead to a lot of spam, etc, but I also don't think that
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       meme is useless.

      <p>
       Just my opinion.

       That seems decently fair.  I wasn't aware of/forgot about the fact that there's actually a different subreddit for conspiracy memes only.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...Doesn't that kind of marginalize, divide, and, as such, dilute the subreddit in general to an extent that it doesn't necessarily have to be though?  i.e. if you want your NONmeme conspiracy material, go here...if you want your meme conspiracy material, go there, etc.  I haven't investigated the possibly deleterious effects of allowing memes in this subreddit one way or the other, but is doing so (allowing memes) that much worse than anything else going on here?  I mean people
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       allowed to post a shit ton of non-meme articles that can still be interpreted in an almost spammy way (or actually
       <em>
        be
       </em>
       spammy), so what's the difference between posting an insightful meme that gives a good conspiracy idea on one end, and posting a long non-meme article or video that might be full of crap on the other?  It would seem that the former would be better to post up than the latter, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not really arguing for one side or the other actually.  Just wondering about these things is all and playing devil's advocate a bit as things occur to me.

       There is a large amount of content on here that people don't come here specifically for.  There's tons of stuff on here that I don't really care about.  I just ignore that stuff.  Some days I even get a little bit frustrated or impatient because the general amount of content doesn't involve things that I'm personally really all that interested in.  That doesn't matter though.  I just ignore what I'm not interested in and pass it on by.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not going to cast a vote on whether certain types of conspiracy-oriented content should even be submitted or not just because we didn't come here specifically for it though are we?  We just upvote or downvote and move on, or respond to it with whatever criticism we might have, no?

       If "stick men, kids drawings, and lame one liners" is what it is, then I would agree that that's pretty lame.  Maybe I just haven't payed that much attention to the top ten to realize that that's what it is though...

       I guess I just kind of peruse what I find interesting and ignore what I don't.  Some days there's a lot more uninteresting stuff than otherwise, but I figure since I'm not a mod nor do I want to be, I just ignore the aspects of the sub that I'm not really to keen on.

       That doesn't seem like a bad response.  No idea why you got downvoted for that.  That being said, I would personally say that it seems some memes can be pretty thought provoking and promote discussion as well though.

       agreed, if you like them, goto memes and see all you want? here though, they dilute and distract and to be honest many are low quality crap that somehow get a +1 from the "like" crowd. that is really the problem, an image is an instant like or dislike reflex and that drives them to the top of the sub, pushing out and down, superior, more informative and intellectual posts.

       I love memes and images, I want more memes and images. Why deny me what I like when all you have to do is skip over the memes and images?
      </p>
      <p>
       All you need to do, to have what you want, is not look at them; it's really not that difficult, is it? Somehow I have a feeling that you just want to restrict the open flow of ideas. If the images sucks it is buried, no problem; if it is awesome it is upvoted, still no problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I would like rule #8 removed. Awesome memes and images spread the word to the general public much better than anything else. Of course if you want to neuter the reach of the voice of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , then please continue your quest to censor.

       Guess you don't get it, or you just don't want the general population to be exposed to concepts posted here, then fine, stifle free discourse. I have found that generally people that try to ban memes and images are control freaks and censors.

       Slow your roll, there, Captain America. No one is trying to censor anyone. No one is being oppressed.   I am all about discussion, information and the exchange of ideas. It is my opinion the meme isnt as effective to elicit discussion as a complete article, but that is just my opinion and preference. If I wanted to have a bunch of poorly spelled memes shoved in my face a dozen at a time, I'll go to lolcats.

       I'm not sure if you remember when the censors took over /atheism, but here's a short version of what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       /atheism used to allow images and memes. On any average day there were maybe 20-30 posts that hit the main reddit page or /all in the top 500 posts. There were usually 3 or 4 on the first page consistently. These were posts that the general population that were not subscribed to /atheism were able to see. Many people said that they were instrumental in changing their opinion on religion. That's because they put across an idea simply and succinctly.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the censors had their way there were maybe 3-4 posts from /atheism that hit the top 500 posts in /all. The censoring of memes and images neutered the voice of /atheism for visibility for the general population. If you go look at the top 500 posts in /all right now, there are only 3 posts from /atheism. This is a massive destruction of the reach of /atheism from when it allowed images quotes and memes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If in fact, this is what you want for /conspiracy, then you are an enemy of spreading the word. That's your choice. It is not my choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it so fricking hard for you to just skip over the posts you do not like? Why deny me what I want if all you have to do is not look at something.
       <strong>
        Please
       </strong>
       explain this to me. It makes no sense unless you deliberately want to restrict the free flow of information.

       No. The more you hear an idea the more you will come toward accepting it. It's why they play those crap songs on the radio over and over and over, and why they say things like "we know Iraq has weapons of mass destruction" over and over and over ad nauseum. If someone saw it one time and changed his mind you can lay it at the feet of the meme - otherwise it is just hypnosis.

       People don't want this forum to turn into ConspiratorialAdviceAnimals. Imagine logging in to find reddit is 90% posts mooning over song lyrics. That's fine in a place specifically for that, but most of what one person finds deeply moving or esoteric is just "Meh" to the other guy or he thinks "Okay, I see where you are going, guess that's all there is to say". Posting memes is intellectually lazy, as well. Make an argument using your words so we can all discuss it.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: In fact that's what you've done above - made an argument, and I am responding. Were it a meme I'd have ignored it.

       People that are not conspiracy theory oriented will never spend a second looking at a deep intellectual discussion about a conspiracy. A meme or image puts a thought in their mind that is instant. Little by little that will change their perspective.

       I'm talking about posts that hit /all. These posts are seen by all people that browse reddit and are not /conspiracy people. A good image or meme will put a little dent in their perception, whereas a long intellectual discussion will not even be glanced at.

        10 memes, 10 frickin images.
       </strong>

      <p>
       In the last 6 days there were 1000 posts in /conspiracy, extrapolated, that means there were over 5000 posts in /conspiracy in the last month. Do you actually want me to believe that 10 posts out of 5000 is going to hurt your intellectual sensibilities. YGTBFKM. That is .2 of 1%. You really need to get a grip.
