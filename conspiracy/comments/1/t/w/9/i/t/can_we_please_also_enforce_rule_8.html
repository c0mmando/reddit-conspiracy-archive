    <div class="md"><p>I think, as has been said on various occasions in response to this request, that there are times when a quick image can illustrate a rather complex topic or subject, and can in a quick flash give the general point to those unwilling or unable to read through a long article or sit through a long video.  In that sense, that would seem to be a good thing.</p>

<p>I understand that this can lead to a lot of spam, etc, but I also don&#39;t think that <em>every</em> meme is useless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems decently fair.  I wasn&#39;t aware of/forgot about the fact that there&#39;s actually a different subreddit for conspiracy memes only.</p>

<p>...Doesn&#39;t that kind of marginalize, divide, and, as such, dilute the subreddit in general to an extent that it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be though?  i.e. if you want your NONmeme conspiracy material, go here...if you want your meme conspiracy material, go there, etc.  I haven&#39;t investigated the possibly deleterious effects of allowing memes in this subreddit one way or the other, but is doing so (allowing memes) that much worse than anything else going on here?  I mean people <em>are</em> allowed to post a shit ton of non-meme articles that can still be interpreted in an almost spammy way (or actually <em>be</em> spammy), so what&#39;s the difference between posting an insightful meme that gives a good conspiracy idea on one end, and posting a long non-meme article or video that might be full of crap on the other?  It would seem that the former would be better to post up than the latter, no?</p>

<p>Not really arguing for one side or the other actually.  Just wondering about these things is all and playing devil&#39;s advocate a bit as things occur to me.</p>

<p>If &quot;stick men, kids drawings, and lame one liners&quot; is what it is, then I would agree that that&#39;s pretty lame.  Maybe I just haven&#39;t payed that much attention to the top ten to realize that that&#39;s what it is though...</p>

<p>I guess I just kind of peruse what I find interesting and ignore what I don&#39;t.  Some days there&#39;s a lot more uninteresting stuff than otherwise, but I figure since I&#39;m not a mod nor do I want to be, I just ignore the aspects of the sub that I&#39;m not really to keen on.</p>

<p>I guess I have kind of a bit of a &quot;meh&quot; attitude about it all really...</p>

<p>All you need to do, to have what you want, is not look at them; it&#39;s really not that difficult, is it? Somehow I have a feeling that you just want to restrict the open flow of ideas. If the images sucks it is buried, no problem; if it is awesome it is upvoted, still no problem.</p>

<p>Personally I would like rule #8 removed. Awesome memes and images spread the word to the general public much better than anything else. Of course if you want to neuter the reach of the voice of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, then please continue your quest to censor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guess you don&#39;t get it, or you just don&#39;t want the general population to be exposed to concepts posted here, then fine, stifle free discourse. I have found that generally people that try to ban memes and images are control freaks and censors.</p>

<p>Again, I like memes and images, they get concepts that relate to this subby seen by more people than detailed articles. </p>

<p>Please explain to me why you want to deny me something I want when all you have to do is ignore those posts. There is no way I would want to censor something you wanted if all I had to do is not look at what you want. Please explain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slow your roll, there, Captain America. No one is trying to censor anyone. No one is being oppressed.   I am all about discussion, information and the exchange of ideas. It is my opinion the meme isnt as effective to elicit discussion as a complete article, but that is just my opinion and preference. If I wanted to have a bunch of poorly spelled memes shoved in my face a dozen at a time, I&#39;ll go to lolcats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if you remember when the censors took over /atheism, but here&#39;s a short version of what happened.</p>

<p>/atheism used to allow images and memes. On any average day there were maybe 20-30 posts that hit the main reddit page or /all in the top 500 posts. There were usually 3 or 4 on the first page consistently. These were posts that the general population that were not subscribed to /atheism were able to see. Many people said that they were instrumental in changing their opinion on religion. That&#39;s because they put across an idea simply and succinctly. </p>

<p>After the censors had their way there were maybe 3-4 posts from /atheism that hit the top 500 posts in /all. The censoring of memes and images neutered the voice of /atheism for visibility for the general population. If you go look at the top 500 posts in /all right now, there are only 3 posts from /atheism. This is a massive destruction of the reach of /atheism from when it allowed images quotes and memes.</p>

<p>If in fact, this is what you want for /conspiracy, then you are an enemy of spreading the word. That&#39;s your choice. It is not my choice. </p>

<p>Why is it so fricking hard for you to just skip over the posts you do not like? Why deny me what I want if all you have to do is not look at something. <strong>Please</strong> explain this to me. It makes no sense unless you deliberately want to restrict the free flow of information.</p>

<p>No. The more you hear an idea the more you will come toward accepting it. It&#39;s why they play those crap songs on the radio over and over and over, and why they say things like &quot;we know Iraq has weapons of mass destruction&quot; over and over and over ad nauseum. If someone saw it one time and changed his mind you can lay it at the feet of the meme - otherwise it is just hypnosis.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t want this forum to turn into ConspiratorialAdviceAnimals. Imagine logging in to find reddit is 90% posts mooning over song lyrics. That&#39;s fine in a place specifically for that, but most of what one person finds deeply moving or esoteric is just &quot;Meh&quot; to the other guy or he thinks &quot;Okay, I see where you are going, guess that&#39;s all there is to say&quot;. Posting memes is intellectually lazy, as well. Make an argument using your words so we can all discuss it.</p>

<p>EDIT: In fact that&#39;s what you&#39;ve done above - made an argument, and I am responding. Were it a meme I&#39;d have ignored it.</p>
