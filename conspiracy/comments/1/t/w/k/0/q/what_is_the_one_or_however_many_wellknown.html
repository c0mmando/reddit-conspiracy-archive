       The idea that holograms were used to

       planes hitting WTC 1 &amp; 2.

       I always use this as my go-to example of dis-information.  It makes anyone discussing the irregularities in the government 911 story look like a loon by associations. Even if you had the technology, why would you risk it when it was so much simpler just to fly planes into the buildings, by whatever means.  There is NO return on this added investment.

       In this case, Occam's Razor shaves closest.

       The nonsense theories about 9-11 are too numerous to count, and in my opinion are sustained only to divert attention away from the real 9-11 conspiracy, which is Israeli involvement, and possibly also the involvement of Saudi Arabia.

       It reminds me of something I read about the JFK assassination, where one investigator, when asked "Who was involved with killing the President?" replied "Who

       trying to kill him?"

       There are so many real fingerprints all over 9-11 that it would be hard to find anyone

       involved... other than the 19 who supposedly are responsible.  But bury the facts under bullshit...

       the involvement of the cia/fbi/nsa and probably at least the (fore)knowledge of UK, French, Australian, and Russian intelligence is being covered up too. i doubt the latter groups played a direct role but i suspect they are involved in the cover up - there is a global agenda after all.

       It wouldn't make sense to include any other parties about the 9/11 plot. That's just more loose ends and more people who might leak the information later. Just like I'm sure MI6/SAS never shared anything with the US or other nations about their involvement in Diana's death. Why bother?

       Compartmentalization is what keeps secrets secret. Everything is on a need to know basis. People in DHS/FEMA only need to know how to respond to a
       <em>
        theoretical
       </em>
       incident. They don't need to know which of those
       <em>
        drills
       </em>
       is a planned event.
      </p>
      <p>
       On such a huge event like 9/11, there's no way 'they' could let anyone in on the full plan. I'm sure each group only knew what they needed for their part of the mission. You got the guys flying the planes (hijackers, remote controlled, whatever), the guys wiring up the buildings with explosives, and the MSM wagging the dog with the 'official narrative' and media given to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government has a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of experience with pulling off shady things.

       Im glad i came back up and read this after seeing your other comment thats been downvoted to oblivion. Im just trying to understand your position. If you wouldn't mind indulging me, but in no way are you required....
      </p>
      <p>
       So are you're saying that the conversations about how the towers went down is disingenuous and disinformation to the true conspiracy, which is who actually carried it out? Or you saying that personally you don't care how they went down, damage done, now show me who is responsible?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean to come off confrontational or dismissive and if I have I apologize. I'm just curious how one is able to claim Israeli involvement while simultaneously dismissing their connections to the actual demolition of the towers and building 7.

       Here's a tidbit I remember from years ago.  A German airline company bought some of the selfsame Boeing jets in question and proceeded to rip out all the avionics systems before allowing them into service because they didn't trust the remote control capabilities built into these planes at the factory.

       the first 9/11 inside job site I ever saw was by the webfairy, Rosalee Grabel. She gained public attention with the pod planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://thewebfairy.com/911/binaries/Splitscreen%20Low.wmv">
        http://thewebfairy.com/911/binaries/Splitscreen%20Low.wmv
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       She considered herself something of a video expert.
      </p>
      <p>
       She liked to point out that the planes went into the buildings like butter. No bending parts were observed, No parts broke off as the planes hit the buildings. Butterplanes she called them and went seeking some explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       She concocted this hologram  theory and was soundly kicked out of the   9/11 community for it along with the no planes theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I  had already at that point joined her email group for a year being the only 9/11 contact I had encountered at that early date.
      </p>
      <p>
       I learned a lot from  the members who  were sincerely looking for evidence and answers
      </p>
      <p>
       But for the most part  It was exactly as you say, disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The members of the group talked a good act as the infamous no planers but if someone came up with anything  that seemed like hard damning evidence the main players in the group steered away from it or denounced it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I came, I observed, I left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Along the way Ms. Grable gave me web space  to store  relevant files
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of them remain and I use them here occasionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most have been deleted or degraded  by someone unknown after I lost the ability to change the files.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line there is no one left supporting the hologram theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rosalee Grable was the only one who ever did as far as I know.

      <p>
       This is such a succinct description of my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       When 9-11 happened, I wanted to know what the hell happened.  How could the most massive intelligence apparatus in the history of the world be so completely clueless?  So I spent hours and hours reading and assimilating as much information as I could.  Nobody wanted me to come to family gatherings any more because I would try to make everyone realize the discontinuities between the official story and the evidence that was there if you just looked.  Nobody wanted to look.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a while, I realized I was too involved.  I utilized Dr. John Lilly's methodology - immerse, disengage, evaluate, assimilate.  I learned to be
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       more discriminating, so it was a valuable experience.

         testimony

       of the sixth man to walk its surface, astronaut Edgar Mitchell.
      </p>
      <p>
       {edit} Sorry, not the clip I was looking for.  I thought it was Mitchell that said we were warned not to come back to the Moon by... others.

       There's an interesting theory that I heard the other day which put the two arguments together for this. Basically, the idea that it happened but not exactly in the way presented. It goes something like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon landing is
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       a hoax, meaning that we surely
       <strong>
        did
       </strong>
       land on the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        However
       </em>
       , two possibilities of why there is doubt:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) There were technical difficulties which prevented us from getting actual footage. In order to save face, we created something to show for our efforts. Couldn't afford to be an embarrassment during the space race.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) What we actually encountered was far too much for the public to handle. Whether it was UFO/ET encounters, another civilization, whatever wild thing you can imagine. The 'tame' footage was produced to show the public something without showing them the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either one of these possibilities does lend credence to
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       it seems doubtful and possible discrepancies existing. It also makes sense why NASA has "somehow lost all original footage of the mission."

       it's pretty incredible to think that either the U.S. sent someone to the moon or the U.S. faked it... either way it's quite a feat and the fact that there's some uncertainty is even more incredible
      </p>
      <p>
       it's also worth noting that one of the moon landings could have been faked but that doesn't mean nobody has ever been to the moon before

       i'd say its worth discussing. it's at the very least connected to other conspiracies in a way that's worth considering:
      </p>
      <p>
       *operation paperclip (brought over nazi scientists)
      </p>
      <p>
       *9/11 (half of the people on the review board of popular mechanics when it's 'debunking 9/11 report' came out were current/former employees of NASA)
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't looked into this much but I'd be surprised if NASA isn't covering
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       up.

       it was cheaper, safer, faster and less risky just to fake it. the important thing was winning the propaganda and "technology" space race with the russians, not actually going to the moon.

       I live near a ski resort and they regularly seed the clouds to try and amp up snowfall amounts.  I don't know much about chemtrails but it's not much of a stretch.  I know the military admitted spraying chemicals into the air to try and block enemy radar transmissions so chemtrails wouldn't really surprise me.

       crop circles. over the years i discovered many "conspiracies" that i found preposterous at first (ones i had done little or no research on, surprise surprise ;) were actually true but crop circles still makes me don my "skeptic" hat. ufo's too i suppose, upto a point. i believe in alien life in the universe 100% i just have never seen a really convincing video or picture of them or their craft. i do believe the rendlesham forest uk incident.

I had a guy here try to convince me on this one, and no matter how hard i tried to listen to him and follow his reasoning and fact check the claims, i just could not be convinced. It was an interesting idea, i admit, but it just couldnt convince me.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for chemtrails, im on the fence. I know a few decades ago they were cloud seeding by shooting silver mixed with other chemicals/metals into the clouds that caused them to precipitate their moisture, and they even caused a flood in a small town that killed a number of citizens. So i dont think its too farfetched of an idea, i just feel like to attribute it to a nefarious agenda would require one to subscribe to several other theories as well. So, im on the fence til further notice.

       The conspiracy about 19 Saudi hijackers being directed by a guy on the run in a cave in Afghanistan - It's utterly ridiculous, yet many people believe it on faith in authority.

      <p>
       Under full view and surveillance they managed to hijack 4 planes, fly them into 3 buildings, and demolish skyscrapers.   The cave complexes in Afghanistan, that Rummy said they had many of...didn't exist either.

       Really? I'm always flabbergasted when people dismiss this one. We know absolutely that weather modification (like cloud-seeding) is a real thing. That it wouldn't even be worthy of consideration is an amazing position to hold!

       If there is the budget to research the spraying of nano particles into the atmosphere, surely there is the chump change to pay online trolls to refute what we already know to be true. In fact, the online trolls must be an integral part of the program because the operation would be so visibly obvious and people would begin to discuss the phenomenon on their own.

       I don't know about paid shills for chemtrail coverups... I honestly just see it as so many normal people being duped into believing that geo-engineering doesn't take place - except when it's humanitarian - that they no longer need to actively hide it. That's the ultimate goal of a coverup - self-policing the truth - and I would say they succeeded.

       I agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I'm saying is if there is the money for corporations like Lockheed-Martin and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories to devote to the research &amp; development of spray apparatuses, nano particles and to lend financial grants to universities that employ geoengineering advocates like David Keith, then there is also probably the chump change to pay a few trolls to keep this discussion to a minimum. They would be seriously remiss in their duties if the disinformation campaign aspect of the program was not fully realized.
      </p>
      <p>
       The websites most often referenced by the deniers is high school graduate Mick West's websites: contrailscience.com and metabunk.org: you have to wonder why a person would go from a computer programmer to running these disinformation websites full-time. I'm sure most of the comments vehemently denying aircraft spraying are unpaid people innocently attempting to preserve a safe, sanitized worldview in their minds, but that wouldn't change the fact that there are also likely people being compensated by the very people behind the programs.

       I agree; weather modification is a real thing. There are numerous patents for methods of altering the weather, and governments are starting to realise that there needs to be an international regulatory framework to prevent rogue countries or even corporations from messing with the weather.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this has nothing to do with the long white persistent trails which cover the skies on some days, which people commonly referred to as chemtrails, and which have been happening since 1922. If and where geoengineering is taking place, it is done with specially modified aircraft. It is not done using every commercial airliner in the sky, leaving criss-cross patterns of toxic chemicals in an otherwise clear blue sky.

       Sorry, I don't get it. You know, if they are christian, for instance, then they may accept that satan is a power in the world, and try to use this to consolidate their own power? If they are not religious, then I see how they would view it as a waste of time.

       It's an important distinction from the outside to make, I think, that someone who
       <em>
        believes
       </em>
       in the efficacy of a thing will do that thing regardless of objective fact.

       Hah, that reminds me of when someone on here mentioned Phillipine de Rothschild being a Satanist. I was initially super skeptical, thinking that the commenter must have been totally crazy.

       That's pretty hard to justify as not being Satanic. Weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT- I assume this is the wine label. It's not as Satanic looking as I thought and could be explained away as "1999." Weird jewelery though. Who knows..

       That's exactly how I feel about it. Whether or not she is or isn't a Satanist, to be consistently wearing
       <em>
        that much
       </em>
       Satanic iconography in public pictures is
       <em>
        pretty dang strange
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Amusingly, one of the few pictures where she isn't wearing a Satanic bling necklace, she's holding up a silver platter with a golden ram statue on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I saw it I was like "Finally, a picture sans Satanic bling." and started looking down and went "WTF!"

       Indeed it is. Now I agree and didn't really notice that at the time I had seen it that it could just be "1999" (I was just skimming through and it caught my eye).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the "9" characters near the goat actually are drawn much more similarly to a "6" flipped over than an actual "9" character (notice the particularly long tail - 6 has a longer tail than a 9), and the tails also have less curve than that of a "9" typically does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also notably it's missing the "1" and most people that would say to omit the one would also omit the first nine so the goat kicked up "'99", which is the common abbreviation for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's just speculation from looking at it right now.

       It does look weird, and, as you say, all those necklaces aren't accidents. If I wore those necklaces, I couldn't be offended if people speculated.

       Of course, the best defense is simple disbelief. Had the commenter I mentioned not linked to these pictures, I absolutely would have dismissed it, and I'm used to considering crazy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just found it very odd and quite amazing really that it's so blatant, like "Represent! Satan bling y'all!" in basically every picture of her (I see some older ones without - maybe she's a convert).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think as anyone who has delved into the untold history and the mysteries of our world has realized, a lot of times, reality
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       stranger than fiction, so maybe "this lady is a Satanist" doesn't sound so far fetched after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, what other reasonable explanation is there for why she's plastering herself with Satanist iconography? I don't have one.

       There are many popular conspiracies that should not be taken seriously. The one that bugs me the most is the crazy belief that the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were brought down by planted explosives. This one will not go away, in spite of its absurdity. Every time I mention this, I get down voted. I don't care. This conspiracy theory is wrong. It flies in the face of common sense. It's downright silly, and I won't pretend that it has any plausibility.

       There is nothing absurd about it. WTC7 could not have collapsed the way it did unless all of the main vertical supports failed simultaneously. To suggest it collapsed because of a fire flies in the face of history, because no steel frame skyscraper has ever collapsed from fire even when it's burning from ground to top. If the structural damage from being hit by a plane engine caused a weak spot which led to the collapse, then the building would have fallen in that direction and not vertically inside its own footprint.

       WTC 7 did have some exterior structural damage due to falling debris, but you're absolutely right about the collapse. The only way it falls the way it did is if
       <em>
        all of the load bearing members disappear simultaneously.
       </em>
       Fire can't do that.

       You think explosives is a less plausible hypothesis than the NIST explanation that Towers 1,2 and 7 collapsed into their own footprints due to fires?
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, there are many thousands of attested examples of explosives causing steel and concrete buildings to collapse into their own footprints.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you know of some examples of fires doing the same thing, then it's the official explanation which is low on plausibility.

       it's pretty incredible to think that either the U.S. sent someone to the moon or the U.S. faked it... either way it's quite a feat and the fact that there's some uncertainty is even more incredible
      </p>
      <p>
       it's also worth noting that one of the moon landings could have been faked but that doesn't mean nobody has ever been to the moon before
