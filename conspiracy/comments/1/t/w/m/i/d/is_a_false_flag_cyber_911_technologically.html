    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean by your bank being unable to get your pin? And the fact that the target hackers got the encrypted pins doesn&#39;t mean much, if anything... Encrypted pins are useless, unless you can decrypt them. And depending on the level of encryption (which was probably pretty high), it would take a very advanced computer to begin cracking them (like, NSA secret supercomputer level advanced). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for the bank and how they handle their customers pins, but Target saying later on that hackers had obtained customer pins doesn&#39;t seem that odd to me. It can take time to discover just how much of your network was breached... For the life of me, I can&#39;t remember what company it was, but I seem to remember at least one other company recently being hacked and saying that &quot;they only got into X&quot; and then later saying &quot;we&#39;ve discovered that they also hacked into Y, as well.&quot; I want to say it was Sony with their PSN account info, but I can&#39;t say for sure. But it has happened. </p>

<p>But ya, I would like to also say that the idea of a cyber 9/11 is very interesting. I know a lot of people (myself included) tend to rely on debit cards, and I can only imagine what would happen if we woke up one morning to see that the &quot;terrorists&quot; had drained our accounts, and that it was going to take two weeks or so to get everything sorted out... I know I wouldn&#39;t have enough cash on hand to get by for that long </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a cryptographer and familiar with how this works. Usually pins and passwords are hashed, not encrypted. </p>

<p>Hashing is a one way function that always turns a specific input into a specific output, and cannot be reversed. There is no &#39;key&#39; or &#39;decryption&#39; possible. Instead of storing the raw password in the database for all to see, you store and compare hashes. In the event of a compromise, the real values are never exposed. For example:</p>

<p>With the MD5 hash algorithm, the string &#39;password&#39; always hashes as &#39;5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99&#39;. You store this string in the database. When the user comes along later and wants to use their password, you hash what they gave you at login and make sure it matches &#39;5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99&#39;. (An online MD5 tool is at <a href="http://www.md5.cz/">http://www.md5.cz/</a>)</p>

<p>So when the bank says they can&#39;t get your PIN, it&#39;s true. All they can see is the hashed value &#39;5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99&#39;. Remember, there is <em>no</em> decryption key. </p>

<p>The problem is, this is very susceptible to brute force attacks, especially with something as short as a pin. The key is to try every possible input, until you eventually land on the one that gives you &#39;5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99&#39;. </p>

<p>You can actually google that string, 5f4dcc... and you&#39;ll find a bunch of websites with lookup tables that will give you the answer (also called a rainbow table). Things can be complicated with salts and more rounds, but there&#39;s really not much you can do with something as short as a pin. </p>

<p>TL;DR: Pins aren&#39;t really encrypted, they are hashed. Target doesn&#39;t have access to the raw pins, but with a little bit of work, they can be brute forced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>More than likely, no. They got the encrypted pins, which will have to be decrypted before they are of any use. Depending on the encryption method used, it could take a very, <em>very</em> long time to do that. For example, here is an excerpt from an article I was reading about the subject of 128 bit AES encryption:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you assume:
Every person on the planet owns 10 computers.
There are 7 billion people on the planet.
Each of these computers can test 1 billion key combinations per second.
On average, you can crack the key after testing 50% of the possibilities.</p>

<p>Then the earth&#39;s population can crack one encryption key in 77,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m honestly surprised it hasn&#39;t happened yet. Even if its a small op, say a power plant shutting down, this would totally justify tighter internet regulations and possibly even some sort of ID system to authorize internet use.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s something I&#39;ve often voiced when talking about IT security; why does every machine need access to the Internet anyway? If I had a nuclear panderplant, those machines would be on a LAN with no physical connection to another network at all.  For the sake of convenience - and I get it a lot from the &quot;why can&#39;t I have Facebook access from my work PC during working hours it&#39;s not fair GOD DAMMIT&quot; crowd - it&#39;s surely a lot safer to separate sensitive machines from a global network?</p>

<p>Btw, there is something called a &quot;fire sail&quot; or something like that in the hackers world. Its actually used in the movie &quot;live free or die hard&quot;. </p>

<p>Its like a protocol to shut down a government, first by cutting communications, then transportation systems and traffic lights, then energy from power plants (not sure if i got the order right). So taking this fire sail idea and what you are talking about, amd adding in the already known capabikities of the NSA, i find your theory plausible. Especially considering their &quot;reactionary&quot; response to make a cyber patriot act of sorts...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean by your bank being unable to get your pin? And the fact that the target hackers got the encrypted pins doesn&#39;t mean much, if anything... Encrypted pins are useless, unless you can decrypt them. And depending on the level of encryption (which was probably pretty high), it would take a very advanced computer to begin cracking them (like, NSA secret supercomputer level advanced). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a cryptographer and familiar with how this works. Usually pins and passwords are hashed, not encrypted. </p>

<p>Hashing is a one way function that always turns a specific input into a specific output, and cannot be reversed. There is no &#39;key&#39; or &#39;decryption&#39; possible. Instead of storing the raw password in the database for all to see, you store and compare hashes. In the event of a compromise, the real values are never exposed. For example:</p>

<p>With the MD5 hash algorithm, the string &#39;password&#39; always hashes as &#39;5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99&#39;. You store this string in the database. When the user comes along later and wants to use their password, you hash what they gave you at login and make sure it matches &#39;5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99&#39;. (An online MD5 tool is at <a href="http://www.md5.cz/">http://www.md5.cz/</a>)</p>

<p>So when the bank says they can&#39;t get your PIN, it&#39;s true. All they can see is the hashed value &#39;5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99&#39;. Remember, there is <em>no</em> decryption key. </p>

<p>The problem is, this is very susceptible to brute force attacks, especially with something as short as a pin. The key is to try every possible input, until you eventually land on the one that gives you &#39;5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99&#39;. </p>

<p>You can actually google that string, 5f4dcc... and you&#39;ll find a bunch of websites with lookup tables that will give you the answer (also called a rainbow table). Things can be complicated with salts and more rounds, but there&#39;s really not much you can do with something as short as a pin. </p>

<p>TL;DR: Pins aren&#39;t really encrypted, they are hashed. Target doesn&#39;t have access to the raw pins, but with a little bit of work, they can be brute forced. </p>
