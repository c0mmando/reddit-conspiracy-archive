Mainly because I see them every single day over my property.

<p>I propose those like minded on this sub meet at a central city in the country and have a protest.  Somewhere downtown or at an airport (where the chemtrails are likely being loaded onto planes).   Anywhere where we can get some media attention.  I feel I need to do this for my kids as I don&#39;t want them growing up ill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t me attacking you, but what do you hope to achieve? </p>

<p>Protesting in my opinion is an ineffective tactic to affect change. It can be useful in raising awareness about an issue, but awareness alone isn&#39;t enough. </p>

<p>Also why stop at Chemtrails? If you know the NWO is responsible why not go after them? </p>

<p>Now personally I haven&#39;t done the research on Chemtrails. I kinda view the &quot;NWO&quot; as a metaphor for the institutions and people that have dramatically seized more control over our lives. I think going after the symptoms is a waste of energy. </p>

<p>In my mind, the solution is to eliminate the class divide.  Income inequality and liberty are only part of the solution. The class systems that subjugate people (to varying degrees) is the problem. </p>

<p>Now as much as my solution sounds like an abstract concept, I think it&#39;s still practical. The class divide can be measured in ways like purchasing power, standard of living and access. By upholding this simple principle we can work to undue the damage on everyday people.</p>

<p>I think there is something very dubious about them. But I can&#39;t disagree with the debunker that first posted in this thread. </p>

<p>How can you protest something about which you have no real proof aside from photographs? I&#39;ve seen &quot;What in the world are they spraying?&quot; and a number of other docs that are very convincing on the surface, but when I am asked to provide proof, there is no smoking gun.</p>

<p>Instead of protesting, maybe people should be collecting soil and water samples in heavily sprayed areas? I&#39;d be willing to do so in my area, but I don&#39;t know the protocol for testing these samples.</p>

<p>Protesting in this situation, however noble, I think will just be brushed aside without a consistent variable that causes concern. If anyone wants to organize some sort of group testing effort, please message me.</p>

I have a few friends who are quite passionate about the chemtrail issue; and I would be too if I had more verifiable information about it. But right now, all I have is some sketchy photos, documentaries, and certainly a good deal of fear along with the fact, so I&#39;m not sure whether its worth investing my time into it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not here to change your point of view. Some of those pictures are pretty damning. Just wander through them. Investigate for your own best interests if you like!</p>

<p>Since I&#39;ve been on this blue ball for many years, these are not <em>normal</em> skies to <em>me</em>. I have some crazy video on my phone and my camcorder but I&#39;m torn about doing the whole youtube account. I filmed the edge of the storm that hit Calgary, Canada. Shots of bizarre rainbows and skies that go from crystal blue to shit haze. </p>

<p>My testament, of course isn&#39;t proof. I&#39;ve also watched three buildings in one day vanish and I can&#39;t prove how or why but by hell, the government is lying about that as well!</p>
