       I think by now it's pretty clear that the petition website is a giant joke yet people keep posting them here every other day. not one petition on that site has brought about any change whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a tool they use to make you feel like you did something to prevent you from actually doing something like protesting or calling your congressmen. See that website for what it is, a tool to keep the status quo, to keep people complacent with whats happening by making them feel as if they did something when all they did was willingly put themselves on a list of dissenters.

       I think banning it might be a little much, and I also think that it might - just might - set a bad precedent...but I personally
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       think petitions are generally pretty darn laughably pointless, and if a ban did take place, I certainly wouldn't lose one wink of sleep over it in the least.

       Ah.  Interesting.  At the time of this message that I'm typing here, the OP shows that there are "8 comments".  However, counting the number of comments one can see on this post (not including this one that I'm typing this moment), there are only 6.  That's interesting.  That being noted, however, I wonder how societaljustice figured (or new?) that the shadow banned individual was responding to me in particular and wasn't perhaps just responding to your OP in general.

       Most likely a new account, not shadow banned.

        /r/conspiracy

       has automods that won't allow an account under 3 days old to post, however the number of comments will reflect the invisible comment.

       Did he look at the comments on the title page and have it show 2 comments? The he probably assumed your comment was the first and someone responded. Interesting.

       Yeah but even if that were the case, that type of scenario doesn't necessarily mean that the response was TO ME in particular as opposed to the OP in general.

       Okay that just flew
       <em>
        right

       over my head.  What's the difference when one logs in with a different account?  I mean wouldn't it show the same thing regardless of which account one logs in with?  You log in using one account and see a comment count of 3 but only 2 comments on the board, and then if you log in using another different account...you should see the same thing no?

       Position: We should definitely not ban it. I think that there are some petitions than do need awareness. This sub should strive to be one of the best places on reddit to gather that when the time is needed. But i do realize that the amount of petitions that are submitted is a little much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solution: Everybody do their part and vote or comment accordingly. This community needs to become more active for a lot of the natural filtering mechanisms take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S: I want to add that i do realize they are not effective. Although they do gain a lot of media attention and public awareness and that is what we need right now.

       if anything the governments petition website stifles free speech by making people feel as if they did something when all they did was put their name on a list, it prevents people from going out and actually making change happen. we shouldn't be signing fake petitions that don't change anything we should be calling our congressmen and protesting but instead we sit down on a computer attach our personal information to an issue and call it a day and that's not going to bring any change to this country. the only reason the website exists is to keep the status quo.

       Can we ban your free speech so you never make such a stupid suggestion again?

       whats so stupid about banning the governments petition website? they raised the signatures needed from 5000 than to 25000 now it takes 100000 within 30 days to even get answered and when they do get answered (assuming they didn't just completely ignore it) we get a bullshit response. so why do people still think that petitions on that website have a chance to change anything? please point out one petition there that made change in the real world.
