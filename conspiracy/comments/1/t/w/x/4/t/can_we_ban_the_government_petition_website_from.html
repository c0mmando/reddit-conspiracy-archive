<p>Its a tool they use to make you feel like you did something to prevent you from actually doing something like protesting or calling your congressmen. See that website for what it is, a tool to keep the status quo, to keep people complacent with whats happening by making them feel as if they did something when all they did was willingly put themselves on a list of dissenters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah.  Interesting.  At the time of this message that I&#39;m typing here, the OP shows that there are &quot;8 comments&quot;.  However, counting the number of comments one can see on this post (not including this one that I&#39;m typing this moment), there are only 6.  That&#39;s interesting.  That being noted, however, I wonder how societaljustice figured (or new?) that the shadow banned individual was responding to me in particular and wasn&#39;t perhaps just responding to your OP in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay that just flew <em>right</em> over my head.  What&#39;s the difference when one logs in with a different account?  I mean wouldn&#39;t it show the same thing regardless of which account one logs in with?  You log in using one account and see a comment count of 3 but only 2 comments on the board, and then if you log in using another different account...you should see the same thing no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Position: We should definitely not ban it. I think that there are some petitions than do need awareness. This sub should strive to be one of the best places on reddit to gather that when the time is needed. But i do realize that the amount of petitions that are submitted is a little much.</p>

<p>Solution: Everybody do their part and vote or comment accordingly. This community needs to become more active for a lot of the natural filtering mechanisms take place. </p>

<p>P.S: I want to add that i do realize they are not effective. Although they do gain a lot of media attention and public awareness and that is what we need right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>whats so stupid about banning the governments petition website? they raised the signatures needed from 5000 than to 25000 now it takes 100000 within 30 days to even get answered and when they do get answered (assuming they didn&#39;t just completely ignore it) we get a bullshit response. so why do people still think that petitions on that website have a chance to change anything? please point out one petition there that made change in the real world.</p>
