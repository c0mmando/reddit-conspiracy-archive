Most of us in the tech sector were even talking about the room at the San Francisco AT&amp;T switching facility where NSA actually listened from like 5-7 years pre-Snowden.  Ever hear of Naris?  That would be the company that produces the hardware in that special room and again, we all knew about this company and their creepy Israeli ties long before Snowden came out.</p>

<p>Snowden is the one that got publicized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Publicized by an ill machine owned manipulated &amp; controlled MSM.</p>

<p>Another reason for me to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/O43yeeH.png">? hope.</a></p>

<p>I did not buy his Christmas fear message of ignorantly over dramatized inflated BS. His Xmass exaggerations &amp; continued soap opera drama inflates reality so that perceived reductions can be less or none. I am insulted that so many conspiracy types are buying snowdude on what is easily handed by an agent with sketchy job &amp; military backgrounds.</p>

<p>He was going to become a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden#Career">Special Forces badass warpig hero for the Army Reserves, but his legs got broken, thus he could not fight to freedumb the Iraqi peoples.</a> I look with suspicion @ all the mental impressions left by such a superman script provides to ones mind &amp; I smell BS reeking to almost all my seeking.</p>

<p>To the types of employers he had, GED = dope +no college degree = nope to his job placement history &amp; high security clearances.</p>

<p>IMO It is more plausible that snow dudes real scrubbed military &amp; college degree info would expose his spooky real self. His youth images &amp; background does not paint drop out type to me.</p>

<p>IMO dude is whistling a psyop tune of his non trustworthy toolers &amp; ill seeding masters.</p>

<p>IMO His seriously questionable computer whiz hacker exotic dancer girlfriend &quot;made for TV&quot; special agent image is laughable &amp; even his slacker stubble goatee look is likely playing a role. IMO <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0Hpoz9D.jpg">this shit eating smirk</a> of a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Hqade0V.jpg">clean cut</a> lover of government feel reeks of a backstabbing ass kissing soldier agent in training is likely closer to his true root nature, combined with following the teat of mommy court clerk &amp; daddy military officer. I grew up with people that had that look, as I am sure many have &amp; all humans I know can change their looks but to this day their nature that is set as kids &amp; young adults largely remains as the main driver. Teenage rebellion is not what we are seeing now, his shit eating smirk shows more of the true him IMO.</p>

<p>The only results I see are him &amp; Greenwald are getting rich &amp; famous. </p>

<p>Got results? NOPE! just milking it.</p>

<p>Fact is the eN-S-A is like a gang of secrets, some have left &amp; talked shit, but none have been placed or taken seriously on the worlds stage. Gang members that leave even on peaceful terms &amp; not ones that stole from the gangs &amp; then talk too much shit tossing on their former gangs under the big top stage are neutralized. All the worlds stage, as in staged controlled release trickles, to keep sickles long over due, @ bay longer, by releasing slow non &quot;ass to the fan&quot; info that has led to no convictions or court ordered halting of ill non constitutional behaviors. I only see weak trickled info on the ill machines terms to lead the asleeple to <del>drug</del> abuse like tolerance &amp; acceptance to more willingly take shit inward &amp; outward, all thanks to Edward Snowjob? <strong>info dealer</strong></p>
