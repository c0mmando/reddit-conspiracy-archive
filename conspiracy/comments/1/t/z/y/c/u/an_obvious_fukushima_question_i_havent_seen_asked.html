A measle type virus recently killed 1000 dolphins on the east coast of the US.   If radiation from Fukishima has reached the east coast either by ocean or atmospheric currents the public probably won&#39;t be told.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>The radiation has come to San Fransisco and It will take years more to slow the radiation at the source.</p>

I am not a nuclear physicist, but it seems like the thousands of nukes detonated across the world during the cold war and the 2 detonated during ww2 would be more problematic than Fukushima. What makes Fukushima different than Chernobyl or 3 mile island? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not an expert, so take this as it is:</p>

<p>I bekieve the difference is in the final products of the reactions. For instance, nuckear bombs are designed for efficiency in order to optimise the greatest amount of explosive yield per amount of material. The more efficient the reaction, the less radioactive it is (im guessing here.) At least as for as amount of radioactive materials thst are released. </p>

<p>At power plants, their goal is heat, not explosive yield. So their equations would be a little different, the reaction itself woukd be a little different, and so woukd the end products. Its also important to keep note that the actusl amount of radioactive materials in a powerplant such as fukushima is much more thsn the amount required for a bomb. And like i said, the purity of the materiak for a bomb is much higher thsn for a power plant.</p>

<p>I think this sheds light on why fukushima is much much worse than the stomic bomb testings. But like i said, im not an expert in nuclear physics. I would like to know if someone has some better understanding of this so they can confirm/deny my speculations, as your question has been burning in my mind as well...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am also not an expert, but in the last 3 years I have learned enough about this particular threat to consider myself &quot;well informed&quot;. And the main takeaway from my research is that there actually is no such thing as an expert who knows what they are doing. Respected nuclear engineers like Arnie Gundersen admit they are way out of their depth in their knowledge of what is going on and what to do about it. Quite simply, nobody knows what will happen if something sparks a criticality in the spent fuel pools or in one of the molten cores. It only takes 8 kilograms of plutonium to make a bomb and there are hundreds of tons of this insanely dangerous material on site. Some engineers have even speculated that the amount of tritium produced in a criticality could turn the whole site into a thermonuclear bomb which sets off a chain reaction of explosions in other nuclear reactors up and down the Japanese coastline. It is uncharted territory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, yes. Chaos theory teaches us about the interconnectedness of all things; how making even a slight change to part of a complex system can have a massive effect on the whole system. The ecological balance of the planet is one of its most complex systems, along with the weather. Fukushima seems to have tipped that balance. The effects can only get worse as the collapse of one species leads to the loss of dozens more. What we are seeing now is just the stirring of the leaves in a tree that hints of the storm which is to come. Don&#39;t bother trying to prepare for it, except to figure out a painless way to die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My rational brain refuses to take it in. It keeps trying to externalise it; to pretend I&#39;m watching a Hollywood disaster movie or something. The thought of the extinction of all life on the planet is too big for any mind to contemplate. But it is the truth. We are finished, we just don&#39;t know it yet. Personally, I can accept my fate with equanimity. I am over 60 and I&#39;ve had a good life. A heart attack 10 years ago nearly killed me then, and I been living on bonus time ever since. But I am about to become a grandfather, and the thought of my daughter and her unborn child being killed because of this makes me very angry. All of this could have been avoided if the Japanese hadn&#39;t been so greedy and stupid when they built nuclear reactors on top of a fault zone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not necessarily. There is always new,unknown diseases that harm species  in the oceans and on land.You can look at the Atlantic and find certain species being devastated by diseases currently unknown to science today. There were plenty of these events before fukushima and there will be just as many much longer after. The biologists researching these issues certainly are aware of fukushima but there is so many other environmental hazards that have a larger effect simply due to event proximity, by the time the radiation has reached america&#39;s coast it is extremely dilute. An industrial waste accident along the coast would do much more damage than the radiation in that area.</p>

<p>Please stop being so ridiculously alarmist, the human race is not going to die from this, nor will the ocean life (outside of the very immediate area of fukushima)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That has been proved to be a false assumption, when reports surfaced following the Eniwetok nuclear weapons test series. They discovered that strontium-90, Iodine-131, and cesium-137 do not dilute when they are introduced to salt water, but instead cluster into pockets of radioactive materials. Additionally, 400 tons per day for almost 3 years. Of course, you can act smug, and not actually look into it, or wonder why the US EPA just raised the maximum microSievert intake from 100 per year to 1100 per year, yet the whole world has not agreed with this. Or you could always consider the giant radioactive steam cloud that is a day off the California coast and closing in to be a wonderful sight, and run out to embrace it. Or, better yet, go swimming in Del Rey.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are just repeating a lie that you have been told. That&#39;s not how radioactive contamination works. Just as the claim that there is more radioactivity in a banana et cetera. Your claim ignores bio concentration. Heavy radioactive particles drop to the seabed where they are consumed by bottom feeders and plankton. They in turn get eaten by small fish, which get eaten by big fish. Each time, the radiation is concentrated in the higher life form. When we eat the fish it ends up in us. But unlike a banana, the irradiated fish is now speckled throughout with particles emitting beta radiation. When that gets in us each particle goes to work killing or mutating the cells around it, and very soon we have cancer. 
Also, analysis of the ocean currents in the Pacific shows that the radioactivity is not being spread far and wide, but concentrated into a plume which is now hitting the West Coast of America.</p>
