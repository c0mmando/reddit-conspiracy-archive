       I've read in a couple places that the Unabomber was in Project Moonstruck, though I haven't found a source that confirms this definitively. The LA Times printed he was in MKUltra experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT- Many mind control projects involve electromagnetic "biocommunication," this could be an explanation for his developed aversion to technology. There's an interview with his brother, wherein, the brother expounds on how these experiments likely affected who he chose to send bombs to, etc.

       A philosophical question, right? If a mind has been warped by mind control intrusions, are all said mind's creations after that the product of the mind or of the intruders? I would say the intruders would have a profound impact, and, likely, account for his sudden hatred of technology.

       Fallacy: The Count on Sesame Street isn't technically a vampire, nor does the show claim that he is.

       Interesting fact. Being compelled to count things is actually from vampire mythology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because they don't show him murdering other muppets and drinking their blood doesn't mean that it doesn't happen, in the fictional context of Sesame Street.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, even the source material is contradictory regarding his Nosforatic status
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Count's profile on Sesame Workshop's website refers to the character as a "number-friendly vampire" and suggests that he may be a distant relative of Count Dracula. In addition, the book Sesame Street Unpaved describes the Count as a "Numerical Vampire." In contrast, the 2001 Sesame Street Muppets Drawing Guide insists "The Count is not a vampire."" Also in early episodes, he has demonstrated the ability to enthrall people, he has not had a reflection, and he also has been said to not like garlic.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I also do not believe that the Count is a vampire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking everything into consideration, I have come to the conclusion that The Count von Count is merely a Romanian Goth pimp with OCD.

       It has nothing to do with it being sanctioned by some outside force. It has EVERYTHING to do with killing innocents. While I agree that sometimes violence is the only recourse afforded, I disagree that one should be willing to plant explosives in a public forum where you will only harm those you SHOULD be fighting to protect.

       Oh no? At what point do the people that support the machine become culpable for the crimes of the machine? We recognize that people who cooperate with a crime, even though they do not actually personally commit the crime, are culpable for the crime as if they personally took part (accessory). So I hold that this situation is not as clear cut as some would like.

       Were the gorilla tactics used by the Vietcong to fight their occupiers right and just?  When backed against a wall, people will act accordingly.  The fact of the matter is that the public once viewed him as insane and an absolute criminal.  Now we're seeing that he was absolutely right.  His manifesto is incredibly sound, and given the once unbelievable truths uncovered, is even more true today.  He was tortured unreasonably under programs that make me sick.  While not ideal, I cannot fault him for his actions.

       Oh really? I question that conclusion. I will give you that most of us don't see it as a preferential solution, more of a last ditch type of thing. However the fact remains that many, if not most of us are seeing that, violence is rapidly becoming the only solution left on the table that has a hope in hell of winning.

       You're speaking for everyone else here. People are aware that violence will be responded to in a vicious fashion coupled with the news reports calling people terrorists and anti-American. Violence is a last resort when all political avenues have been explored and ignored. There is still people that are capable of changing things although it would be incredibly difficult to do so considering how entrenched corruption is in the political system.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in any case, why do you suppose violent uprisings are seen as a positive and heroic gesture in places like Syria but swiftly condemned when it's on home turf? Because agendas are being met with uprisings elsewhere and if it was on some politicians door step in the UK/US for example, it would be terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, there won't be any crackdown on citizens via force in the US/UK because of the attracted outrage and attention it would bring. Laws are passed that slowly cripple your ability to fight corruption, loop holes are closed and the grip of control is tightened spanning decades. There won't be a mass battle or murder squads, it will be a series of laws passed to cripple anyone's ability to make any kind of opposition or movement.

       The Constitution, for all intents and purposes, simply no longer exists.  I've watched corrupt judges side with their masters in the face of unconstitutional behavior.  I can't trust the Supreme Court to stand up for what they and everyone else knows is true.  The people will not stand for this.  Those who are enemies of the Constitution are my enemies.  They will see the light of justice.  We will not take this lying down.

After that... well, it's going to be scary, but good men and women must make sacrifices so that their children and the generations that follow will live in a world that is truly free from oppression.

          Those who are most sensitive about “politically incorrect” terminology are not the average black ghetto- dweller, Asian immigrant, abused woman or disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of whom do not even belong to any “oppressed” group but come from privileged strata of society. Political correctness has its stronghold among university professors, who have secure employment with comfortable salaries, and the majority of whom are heterosexual white males from middle- to upper-middle-class families.

          Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have an image of being weak (women), defeated (American Indians), repellent (homosexuals) or otherwise inferior. The leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior. They would never admit to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems. (We do not mean to suggest that women, Indians, etc. ARE inferior; we are only making a point about leftist psychology.)

          Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful. They hate America, they hate Western civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality. The reasons that leftists give for hating the West, etc. clearly do not correspond with their real motives. They SAY they hate the West because it is warlike, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where these same faults appear in socialist countries or in primitive cultures, the leftist finds excuses for them, or at best he GRUDGINGLY admits that they exist; whereas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY points out (and often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in Western civilization. Thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist’s real motive for hating America and the West. He hates America and the West because they are strong and successful.

        50 The conservatives are fools: They whine about the decay of
   traditional values, yet they enthusiastically support technological
   progress and economic growth. Apparently it never occurs to them that
   you can't make rapid, drastic changes in the technology and the
   economy of a society with out causing rapid changes in all other
   aspects of the society as well, and that such rapid changes inevitably
   break down traditional values.

       And please correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel Mr. K takes the stand-point that I do politically that the left/right are really the same side of the coin. It's a fallacy to believe the left/right represent the two polar extremes--they only represent the extremes in a limited system. For instance, a true libertarian would neither agree with left/right ideals, but instead their own ideals that might align with others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sides are fake as the full picture is not allowed to be seen. The only options left are the same decision perpetuating the current system.

       And you've done...what? I am not saying I would follow his example, but in his shoes that was not a bad response. He knew he couldn't seek redress anywhere. He knew that much better than all of us, he had been through MKULTRA, if anyone is culpable for his actions it should be the CIA. They made him what he was and then punished
       <em>
        him

       some interesting passages towards the end:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        216 If leftism ever becomes dominant in
   society, so that the technological system becomes a tool in the hands
   of leftists, they will enthusiastically use it and promote its growth.
   In doing this they will be repeating a pattern that leftism has shown
   again and again in the past. When the Bolsheviks in Russia were
   outsiders, they vigorously opposed censorship and the secret police,
   they advocated self-determination for ethnic minorities, and so forth;
   but as soon as they came into power themselves, they imposed a tighter
   censorship and created a more ruthless secret police than any that had
   existed under the tsars, and they oppressed ethnic minorities at least
   as much as the tsars had done. In the United States, a couple of
   decades ago when leftists were a minority in our universities, leftist
   professors were vigorous proponents of academic freedom, but today, in
   those universities where leftists have become dominant, they have
   shown themselves ready to take away from everyone else's academic
   freedom. (This is "political correctness.") The same will happen with
   leftists and technology: They will use it to oppress everyone else if
   they ever get it under their own control.
       </p>
       <p>
        217 In earlier revolutions, leftists of the most power-hungry type,
   repeatedly, have first cooperated with non-leftist revolutionaries, as
   well as with leftists of a more libertarian inclination, and later
   have double-crossed them to seize power for themselves. Robespierre
   did this in the French Revolution, the Bolsheviks did it in the
   Russian Revolution, the communists did it in Spain in 1938 and Castro
   and his followers did it in Cuba. Given the past history of leftism,
   it would be utterly foolish for non-leftist revolutionaries today to
   collaborate with leftists.
       </p>
       <p>
        219 Leftism is totalitarian force. Wherever leftism is in a position
   of power it tends to invade every private corner and force every
   thought into a leftist mold. In part this is because of the
   quasi-religious character of leftism; everything contrary to leftists
   beliefs represents Sin. More importantly, leftism is a totalitarian
   force because of the leftists' drive for power. The leftist seeks to
   satisfy his need for power through identification with a social
   movement and he tries to go through the power process by helping to
   pursue and attain the goals of the movement (see paragraph 83). But no
   matter how far the movement has gone in attaining its goals the
   leftist is never satisfied, because his activism is a surrogate
   activity (see paragraph 41). That is, the leftist's real motive is not
   to attain the ostensible goals of leftism; in reality he is motivated
   by the sense of power he gets from struggling for and then reaching a
   social goal.[35]
       </p>
       <p>
        221  Because of the restrictions placed on their thoughts and behavior
   by their high level of socialization, many leftists of the
   over-socialized type cannot pursue power in the ways that other people
   do. For them the drive for power has only one morally acceptable
   outlet, and that is in the struggle to impose their morality on
   everyone.
       </p>
       <p>
        229  The leftist is oriented toward largescale collectivism. He
   emphasizes the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of
   society to take care of the individual. He has a negative attitude
   toward individualism. He often takes a moralistic tone. He tends to be
   for gun control, for sex education and other psychologically
   "enlightened" educational methods, for planning, for affirmative
   action, for multiculturalism. He tends to identify with victims. He
   tends to be against competition and against violence, but he often
   finds excuses for those leftists who do commit violence. He is fond of
   using the common catch-phrases of the left like "racism, " "sexism, "
   "homophobia, " "capitalism," "imperialism," "neocolonialism "
   "genocide," "social change," "social justice," "social
   responsibility." Maybe the best diagnostic trait of the leftist is his
   tendency to sympathize with the following movements: feminism, gay
   rights, ethnic rights, disability rights, animal rights political
   correctness. Anyone who strongly sympathizes with ALL of these
   movements is almost certainly a leftist.

       Its articulate, but I'm not sure I agree with all of it. Yes, society is a mess, but arguing over the left and right or labels at all means that he believed in the smokescreen. The fact is, the control and influence on society comes from the overlap between capitalism, media and politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The feminism comment is stupid. It doesn't take into account the misogyny that we must all fight against - Robin Thicke, the High School Football rape case (sorry, I'm from UK so I don't know their names) this whole sex based pop industry. Im male and I can see female oppression everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem isn't technology - the industrial revolution was the start of mainstream capitalistass manufacturing - but you could argue that the plough or agriculture were human technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that we aren't in charge of our own lives. We all work for someone else - a chain that goes right to the top, we're dumbed down and laziness means we don't have to think - just eat and consume. There are great things about modern society that I love, many technologies too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is at the top, not sideways.

       Open your eyes. Have you seen the video. Its a shit song with a deliberately controversial, 'envelope' pushing nude video to grab attention. Manufactured pop plastic forced on the mass media. He's covering his tracks now its out, playing dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quote from him "What a pleasure it is to degrade women, I never gotten to do that before"
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether the people in the video were married, had kids or consider themselves good people. The message is what will linger.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could say that a few songs have weird lyrics and artistic dark undercurrent (Sting - stalking and saving prostitutes!)
      </p>
      <p>
       But I refuse to believe this is art and not an attempt to generate interest, sell a product and create controversy. The fallout is from anyone who takes him seriously.

       The Unabomber's insanity is rather plain from the start. It's best to take the manifesto with a grain of salt. While there seem to be some insightful observations, they appear to be vastly outnumbered by thinly disguised rants in which the Unabomber and his imaginary fellows transferred 'their' own psychological instability upon others in order to justify his violent impulses. Someone can be intelligent while still being deranged. It's dangerous to ignore the derangement simply because of intelligence.

       His observations might be true to a degree, but his tactical response is totally inadequate. Yeah, abandon technology, thus ensuring almost nobody will join your movement, and those that do will be utterly annihilated by the rapidly advancing technology using competition.

       Everything was spot on until point 109.

       "If the Founding Fathers had lost
   their nerve and declined to sign the Declaration of Independence, our
   way of life today would not have been significantly different. Maybe
   we would have had somewhat closer ties to Britain, and would have had
   a Parliament and Prime Minister instead of a Congress and President.
   No big deal. Thus the American Revolution provides not a
   counterexample to our principles but a good illustration of them."

      <p>
       This is not accurate. The American Revolution is one of the most significant events in history.

       Just because someone was a bomber doesn't mean you can discount all of their views. The fact you think someone is entirely wrong because they did something wrong points out just how small minded you are yet you come here proclaiming your disgust for 'conspiracy theorists'. Up until this point, the comments have been far more thought provoking and interesting than your small minded points and put downs.

       No one in this thread including me has been in agreement in what he did,
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       . What I said (quite clearly) is that some of his views make sense. That doesn't add up to being sympathetic to someone that killed people nor would I follow that path or condone anyone's actions who were the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone is a potential bomber in your eyes because of views they express which is fear mongering and straight out of the excuse book people in the government use to warrant the kind of laws we have. Are all Muslims suicide bombers because they share views from the Quran? Are patriotic people terrorists because they share views about refreshing the tree of liberty from time to time?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can agree with someone without sharing all their views.

       I don't know if this was ironic or not, but mein kampf was a brilliant piece of work... Thinking of hitler as an inheritly evil thing is exactly what the unabomber talks about in his manifesto.

       edit: I should note that this really has nothing to do with the NSA, and i'm curious as to why this was posted with this title, but seeing the unabombers manifesto on here was the first thing that actually seemed semi-intelligent that has been posted on

       Explain to me how you can use a single piece of technology in 2013 without being tracked or traced in some way. Anywhere you go in public your every move is being recorded and stored. The escape to the cabin in the middle of nowhere really is the only way to opt out of this insane Brave New World/1984 nightmare-scape.

       If it isn't constitutional, opt-in or not, it isn't legal. The idea that technology is opt-in is a ridiculous premise, especially as time goes on. Technology is now essential to daily life.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't just say "by signing this cell contract you give up all constitutional rights." If the contract violates your rights, it is void.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please tell me how exactly you can opt out of licence plate scanners, smart meters, cameras in every public place, state issued identification, retina/facial recognition scanners, stop and frisk among other new police tactics? If you're going to work, you must put up with all these things, and more.

       A job is an example of technology. No cave man ever worked an hourly wage. Now if you wanted to pick and choose what technology you'd like to opt into, that's going to be difficult. I'm sure some people would love to still live in an era of the 60's or 90's or whenever.

       Yes, because the game is rigged to make sure we
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to play. Some of us would like to opt the fuck out and go live in the woods, but property taxes alone make that impossible. We have to earn coin to be able to keep our land or the government will take it from us. So we then have to take part in the rigged game, giving up our chosen way of life. On top of that the over socialized morons think that is okay as it makes sure we are part of their collective. Great system, if enslaving people is your goal.

       discussion; Telling someone that tech is 100% opt-in is misleading. I would say perhaps it is not.

       I would argue telling someone that tech is 100% opt in wouldn't really be true for the same reason we can't release animals back into the wild who have spent their entire lives in captivity. We aren't raising people to be able to take an objective look at which lifestyle would be best for the human condition and the system we have now that tells a person at 18, "Hey, you can go live in the woods now" sets them up to fail at ever really giving them a choice. Now we KNOW humans developed and evolved up to the point we were living at 200,000 years ago so we must assume that is the most natural way of living while offering the most choice in life. e.g. It's the safest, best, most natural state of living.

       Why should you be able to do that?
      </p>
      <p>
       The land you would be building on is still protected by the US military from outside invasion, the land, air and water is still protected by the EPA, any access to products like food, paper, lumber or anything else you might purchase without building with your own hands is the product of an economic system that was built up over generations.

      <p>
       Just because you don't want to pay your taxes doesn't mean you shouldn't be obligated to give back to a society that has already given you a huge advantage on others in the world.

       Again, what about environmental and military protections you are getting for free?  Sure you have a right to shelter and food, but no where does it say you can "opt out" of the protections offered without leaving the country,  this isn't Walden anymore, its a modern state that while horrible in some things it does, provides much more than a lot of states.

Now we KNOW humans developed and evolved up to the point we were living at 200,000 years ago so we must assume that is the most natural way of living while offering the most choice in life. e.g. It's the safest, best, most natural state of living.

       With that said, I still agree with you but I've found anarcho primitivism very interesting with compelling arguments.

       What's your point? I was calling the guy out for citing Wikipedia as a source. That's like citing The Count from Sesame Street as proof of vampires.

       Again, what about environmental and military protections you are getting for free?  Sure you have a right to shelter and food, but no where does it say you can "opt out" of the protections offered without leaving the country,  this isn't Walden anymore, its a modern state that while horrible in some things it does, provides much more than a lot of states.
