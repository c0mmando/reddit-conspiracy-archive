       I sometimes feel like the NWO is watching me and trying to control me.  Especially after I log on to this subreddit or another conspiracy forum.  I can hear clicking sounds in my head like they are trying to tap into my mind somehow.  I try to post as many of my thoughts as I can so they don't gain control.

       You should seek out a licensed psychiatrist as soon as possible. Auditory hallucinations and what seems to be significant paranoia are hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia.
      </p>

       I'm sorry if that seems crass or offensive, but proper treatment could seriously improve your quality of life my friend.

       I think they go after a lot of conspiracy minded people to try to control them.  They don't want us speaking out and telling the truth.

       Frankly, I don't think they would spend 5 minutes worrying about you unless you join the ultra-hysterical "let's shoot down a chemtrail plane" crowd. Babbling on about the NWO, vinegar, auditory hallucinations, chemtrails, and how the government shills on Reddit are trying to silence you, paints you as a paranoid nutcase. I notice that the usual people who post about these supposed conspiracies are nowhere to be seen – perhaps even they think you're a bit too unhinged to support. It's a shame because you have a lot of energy which you are wasting by tilting at windmills. As a farmer you are rightly concerned about GMOs and their effect on health and the ecology. Now this is a real threat, unlike the rest which is just hysterical bullshit. Concentrate on that and forget the rest of your perceived problems, and people may take you a bit more seriously in future.

       Honestly, i dont think that is the case. If you try and figure out your exact influence on society, and cross reference that proportionately to the damage you alone are causing to TPTBs agenda, youll find that you, and each on of us here, are quite insignificant. They may listen, but to actively interfere woukd require much more resources, and unless you broadcast to a bunch of people like alex jones or whoever, i think they be bored with you, and with me, and with most everyone here...

       Can i first ask you some question, do you hear those clicks outside too? When was the last time visiting the dentist? For how long do you seek in this stuff &gt; NWO etc.? 
I'm from Germany and a secret service dude reported some nice informations a long while ago.His job had primary to do with microwaves so the victim was handled by him.The victim gets sick, hearing tones and so on.The goal of this actions are exactly like "thepipesacall" said, "go to a psychiatrist you have paranoia" and then half a year later you sit on a chair with bubbles coming out of your mouth (overstatement) but you get what i mean.

       I won't lie... sometimes I have nights where I read so much conspiracy stuff (good stuff, not just junk) and the pieces start to fit together... the cogs turn.. and I get a little jumpy.

       But really, I don't consider myself a target like Hastings, Snowden, or Assange. At times I wonder what 'the database' has on me. Some days I worry, other days I don't care.

       no one's been brigading you, you just went off the deep end claiming Snowden is a CIA operative, that GMO's are altering human DNA, hearing sounds in your head claiming its the NWO trying to use brain control, posting videos claiming if HIV exists, talking about zionists obtaining time travel and even having alien DNA. you need to get a grip of yourself and go see a doctor, a real one, there's being a conspiracy theorist and then there's going off the deep end. the latter seems to have happened to you.

       Yes but you always champion the mainstream view. Oh so politely, but with your absolutely precious superior attitude. You ain't special and you understand nothing more than most of us.

       Of course I follow the scientific maintstream. I'm a scientist. I'm not trying to force any conclusions on anyone, only methodology. I'm firmly of the opinion any epistimological claim should be grounded in rigourous empirical backing. So I try to hold others to that standard when facts are being discussed.

       If we can't agree on empiricism, I'll be the first to duck out of the conversation, because we'd really be speaking two entirely different langauges.

       You offered a Monsanto-linked scientist who obtained questionnaire data sent to farmers in Canada. Furthermore, that data comes from a sociological questionnaire which in no significant way quantifies legitimate and relevant information on miscarriages.

       Because in order to determine if exposure to a substance and miscarriages are linked, you need to know both if a subject/subject's family has experience a miscarriage, and what their mean exposure level is to the the substance.
      </p>

       You get both of these by asking the subjects these questions.

       If you're going to write off entire fields of mainstream science in order to try to prove a point, then you're obviously not to terribly bound in empiricism, so it looks likely that we're so epistemologically separated that not much is going to come of further discussion. I haven't got anything better to do though, so fire away.

       I believe that the three issues which should be of most concern on the basis of established science receive little or no discussion. These are: 1. that introducing the same gene into 2 different types of cells can produce two very distinct protein molecules; 2. the recent observations that the introduction of any gene, be it from a different or the same species, always significantly changes overall gene expression and therefore the phenotype of the recipient cell; and 3. the possibility that enzymatic pathways introduced to synthesize small molecules such as vitamins can interact with endogenous pathways to produce novel molecules. The potential consequence of all of these perturbations could be the production of biomolecules that are either toxic or carcinogenic, and there is no a priori way of predicting the outcome.

       I'm not aware of any known instances in GMO's where this is the case, but it certainly could plausibly occur due to ribosomal differences between the crops and the donor species. In any case the currently marketed GMO's wouldn't be Roundup resistant if this protein molecules differed substantially from that of the donor species (Agrobacterium tumefaciens)

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I haven't seen any papers that claim this either, but I suspect it is true, but not worrying. The whole point of genetic modification is to induce beneficial phenotypic differences in the organisms, and if "significant" is being used here in a scientific context, as I suspect it is, then it's just a recapitulation of something we already know; that gene modification changes the plant.

         the possibility that enzymatic pathways introduced to synthesize small molecules such as vitamins can interact with endogenous pathways to produce novel molecules.

       </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There certainly might be such enzymatic pathways, but we don't currently know of any specific ones  and don't have any particular reason to expect to find one. If we do find such a specific pathway though, that will certainly merit further investigation and ultimately may change the landscape of the GMO safety debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will note that such pathways have been founds for herbicides such as Roundup, but those are distinct from pathways that could occur due to genetic modification of plants.

      <p>
       This is mostly correct if such chemical pathways do exist, but like I said, there's no compelling evidence to indicate that is the case. I say it's only mostly correct, because even if such a pathway were found, it still could be studied sufficiently to show whether or not in will lead to increased toxicity.

       That could be nothing further from the truth.  Those willing to buy propaganda without evidence may support GMO.  While those who are true intellectuals that demand independent, long term human safety studies are the ones I align myself with, and view as correct.  As stated, long term human health studies performed by independent, unassociated people and groups has simply not occurred.  Until this happens, you are utterly foolish to believe the meritless human safety.  Look to our past to see how reckless this type of behavior is.
      </p>
      <p>
       People, such as these fictional experts you speak of, claimed asbestos was perfectly safe for humans.  It was the absoutely ideal substance.  As did 9 out of 10 doctors for cigarette and tobacco safety (paid for, of course, by big tobacco).  They pushed and pushed publicly until the evidence to the contrary was overwhelming to claim any further.  Don't be foolish with your own health.  Trust nothing until independent science is in your court.  Today, they most certainly are not.

       Of surprises your response is all fluff and no fact.  As stated clearly, the asbestos industry provided exactly what Monsanto has.  The proof is clearly in the lack of long term, independent human study.  They have had much time to complete this, yet it hasn't occurred?  It is possible, and likely, that it has, but with very poor results.  Something that will never see the light of day.

       But I'm not citing Monsanto, I'm citing peer-reviewed literature. And what did peer-reviewed literature have to say about asbestos as early as 1930 (which is the oldest asbesto study I can find) ?

       I've dealt with this Monsanto/GMO cheerleader. They don't like anyone demanding a "long-term human study of GMO consumption." They will link to 10 years of combined short-term studies as the answer to one long-term study. Then they will say that since there is no science to prove GMO causes any ill side-effects, that is proof of GMO safety. Then they will claim they understand the "science" behind GMO without linking to any science. When they do link to studies, it is from Monsanto funded universities.

       Do please share publicly here.  No need for PMs.  While you're at it, please also share the results of an independent long-term human study on the safety of GMO for regular human consumption.  The tests on animals have shown much.  Enough for them to be forced to use the people on their payroll to discredit the study for the most ridiculous and baseless of reasons.

       Absent a plausible physical mechanism for increased toxicity in GMO crops, there is no need for a long term study to evaluate the long-term safety. Even when human studies are (unnecessarily) done, the goalposts get moved and it's claimed they aren't "long-term" enough. So, to remove any vagueness from your argument and to preclude any goalpost moving, when do you consider a study on GMO's "long-term" and motivate it, scientifically, as to why that should be the cut of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said though, long-term studies aren't necessary when there isn't a plausible physical mechanism for increased toxicity. So to look at a specific case, by what chemical pathway do you suggest a modified 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase in Roundup Ready soybeans leads to increased toxicity in humans? Be specific.

       The credibility of your peer reviews is simply not there.  We've all seen the revolving door, propaganda of militant levels, and lies.  There is a reason for this, and it is not turning people on to poisoned food.  And as mentioned previously, come back with INDEPENDENT, LONG TERM HUMAN STUDIES, and then you may have a leg to stand on.  Until then, you're nothing but a shill.  Part of the propaganda mentioned earlier.

       You've to let me know what you consider a "long-term" study, and I'm not about to go out and find one so that you can move the goals posts and ignore it. Further, scientifically motivate the need for such a study, because tons of things we encounter in our everyday lives are considered safe, even without your achieving your arbitrary gold standard of " INDEPENDENT, LONG TERM HUMAN STUDIES"

       They do brigade my comments.  Several of them have been linked and they downvote the heck out of me.  They have even x-posted to Subredditdrama and they joined in.  If you look at my posts however, most of them are positive (240 karma as of now).

       As for not joining in the Snowden is a hero circlejerk, I do believe its possible the whole scenario is one big setup.  Its designed to get the public used to spying.  Its a means of control.  If the people know they may be being watched they are a lot less likely to do anything to upset the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the rest, those are my theories or what I believe to be possible.  Not everything I post is what I believe 100%, just what may be true.  The HIV video for example is just something that I found interesting.  The rest of it well maybe you need to open your mind a little bit more.  If its too out there for you or makes me look like a troll so be it.  Please skip my posts then.  There are others I can discuss those things here with.

       Of course I follow the scientific maintstream. I'm a scientist. I'm not trying to force any conclusions on anyone, only methodology. I'm firmly of the opinion any epistimological claim should be grounded in rigourous empirical backing. So I try to hold others to that standard when facts are being discussed.

       If we can't agree on empiricism, I'll be the first to duck out of the conversation, because we'd really be speaking two entirely different langauges.
