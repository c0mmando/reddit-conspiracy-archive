<p>&quot;Rehosted Content&quot; for the following article is not accurate...</p>

<p>Message:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1tuahp/obama_signs_ndaa_maintaining_indefinite_detention/">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1tuahp/obama_signs_ndaa_maintaining_indefinite_detention/</a></p>

<p>If you google &quot;Obama took a break from his Hawaii vacation&quot;, which is the main starting point for the article, you will find that all the other links reference TruthDig.com as the originator, not the re-hoster.  Please reconsider this pull, as <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is getting a reputation of being a place of censorship.</p>

<p>Further, if you search for NDAA in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and sort by &quot;new&quot; you cannot find good links that have reached the front page about the 2014 NDAA.  This is a VERY important issue for America, and it needs to be challenged. </p>

<p>Response from TheRedditPope:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&#39;t remove your post, but from what I count in the article, the author wrote 10 total sentences. That number drops to six if you don&#39;t count the sentences where he is setting up or linking to other content. The content rehosted in the article is more than double the original content, so can we truly say that this piece is really original work or is it just a few sentences wrapped around walls of copy and pasted text otherwise known as rehosted content?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My response:</p>

<p>If you are counting sentences as justification for removing content from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, I doubt others would agree with the assessment.  Most will find this a weak excuse and consider it censorship and wonder about the bias of the moderators.  You state that the author added 10 sentences to set up for content from other sources, but if you count the content added by sentences, only seven sentences were added.</p>

<p>Give the importance of this content and how it was pulled (from the front page of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>), I will be sharing your assessment and why you think it was pulled.  If you can find the moderator who pulled the content to further shed light on the reasons, please do.  People are getting more and more frustrated with the gamed voting and removal of content by mods.  If this continues, reddit will go the way of digg.com as users bail to find a better medium to share content.</p>

<p>Number of lines?</p>

<p>A single line could say, &quot;Moon Explodes&quot;</p>

<p>The NDAA is one of the most important current  political events.</p>

<p><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>  is a tainted place as far as I&#39;m concerned. </p>
