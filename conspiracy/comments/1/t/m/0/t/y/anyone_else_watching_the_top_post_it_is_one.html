Conspiritard is disgusting and any mod who sides with the pancake brigade needs to not only have mod privileges removed but he should also be banned from this sub. Reading his comments, its painfully obvious that this individual cares nothing for what this sub does and instead talks about us like a bunch of loons.</p>

<p>And can someone please send me evidence of this blatent racism that&#39;s so prominent in our sub. Regular contributors to this sub downvote 99% of the racist content and most of this content is obviously posted in a way to make us all look bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because that&#39;s not what <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is about. Sure their mods are weird (like their whole 6 year long war with NoLibs and some guy named Dusty who is now <a href="/u/ghostofdusty">/u/ghostofdusty</a>) and have some very disgusting things under their names (like the whole pancake/Corrie thing) but <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is about the insane side of conspiracy theories, of which this subreddit only plays a small part. </p>

<p>Seriously, do you regularly check their front page? Right now it&#39;s all about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> due to <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a>, but on the average day this subreddit makes up maybe one post in 20. Most of the rest is Facebook and Tumblr screenshots, links to fringe websites and links to other comments on reddit. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at their current front page. Only 5 out of the top twenty mention <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and they are all about the current drama. Going through the top 50 reveals only another 4, out of which 3 are related to <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a>.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s one post in 50 on average. I really don&#39;t see why people think that it&#39;s their entire schtick. There&#39;s enough crazy out there for everyone.</p>

<p>As for the racism, it&#39;s not as prevalent as it used to be. Most of the top users were also mods in <a href="/r/whiterights">/r/whiterights</a> and other KKK related subreddits. It&#39;s since gotten a lot better. And while I know that this is opening up a whole can of worms, anti-Jewish bigotry is also fairly well accepted on here. It&#39;s not uncommon to see comments advocating for the expulsion of all Jews from the US and praising Hitler for his hatred of them.</p>

Because virtually every &quot;argument&quot; I see on here consists of the same opinions and anyone who dares criticize said opinions is instantly downvoted and called a &quot;shill&quot; as if the only possible way differing opinions can exist would be if they were getting paid to say so. Perhaps you&#39;ve seen otherwise, can you point out instances of criticism of this subreddit? Or its popular conspiracies? I mean sure you <em>sometimes</em> see criticism, like a recent instance where the top post was an image with text claiming to quote a &quot;US Air Force pilot&quot; on chemtrails, but the comments argued that there was no evidence for the existence of such a quote. But most of the time anyone who dares state the opinion that (deep breath) chemtrails don&#39;t exist, the Twin Towers were brought down by two planes crashing in to them, 11 million died in the Holocaust, there&#39;s no organized brigade of trolls seeking to ruin <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, private drones are nothing like military drones, the US doesn&#39;t support the Al Qaeda groups in Syria, Muammar El Qaddaffi was a terrible dictator, Ron Paul has a handful of great ideas in a barrel full of nutty ones, the Sandy Hook shooting was an incident where an insane madman named Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six adults, Bradley/Chelsea Manning knowingly and willingly committed treason without checking if the documents actually exposed any war crimes, or that there is nothing wrong with GMO crops will be instantly ridiculed, downvoted and called a &quot;shill&quot; no matter how much evidence they have. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is a dirty way to fill a rather dirty vacuum caused by the  single mindedness of the majority of the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> userbase.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are there <em>so many people</em> who come from conspiratard who have this really strange obsession about everything in this sub being perfectly logically sound and 100 percent skeptical of everything unless there is 100 percent proof? That&#39;s what r/skeptic is for, along with many other subs. The fact that so many of you are obsessed with this sub indicates some kind of weird mental illness because you would be much more suited to post in r/skeptic rather than r/conspiracy, where we THEORIZE about conspiracies. What is hard to understand here? Just go away if you&#39;re so upset with the content here. If you don&#39;t simply go away, I have to ask why. Why the fuck would you stay here? There are so many other subs perfectly suited to your interests. </p>

<p>Really? Because I don&#39;t see all that many <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> users who are &quot;obsessed&quot; with this sub. Maybe one or two. Can you point out to me who they are? And most of the criticism I see is not that it&#39;s rejected unless there&#39;s 100 percent proof. It&#39;s criticism of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> blindly accepting things that fit the popular narrative without a shred of evidence.</p>

<p>And stop with the &quot;you guys&quot;. I am not subscribed to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and I think that the mods are some terrible people. I visit <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> almost every day and I only comment when I feel that there is some massive misunderstanding, which is why you see a lot of my comments as being negative.</p>

<p>Me thinks that the average <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> user is so vain, self important and arrogant about their opinions, that they assume that there are armies of people being paid to challenge them. In reality it&#39;s just a fact of life that your average educated man will prefer to see evidence to extraordinary claims. Want to hear a truly fringe opinion? Shills don&#39;t exist on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. And the JIDF is one guy with zero influence. They are all figments of paranoid imaginations coupled with dogmatic opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this sub doesn&#39;t care about facts or evidence, then it is woefully irresponsible in doing nothing to stop the spread of false and potentially harmful misinformation.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard of someone so openly dislike a desire for facts or truth before. This isn&#39;t a creative writing sub, people come here usually on the assumption that if it&#39;s posted, it&#39;s probably true (or based in truth).</p>

<p>Also, he never said anything about 100% truth being required, that&#39;s a straw man. What is missing from the thought process of many of the &#39;creative writers&#39; in this sub is application of Occam&#39;s Razor, and actually following evidence to the correct conclusions. There&#39;s a very good difference between &quot;I believe this thing, because I feel that it must be true&quot; and &quot;I believe this thing, because of this good evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>People who honestly believe that 9/11 was an inside job for example, are basing that belief entirely on a series of false or misrepresented quotes, shitty special effects on youtube rants, physically impossible science bending, and one of the most improbable series of events imaginable involving the buying off/killing/silencing of the thousands upon thousands of people needed to pull off such a grand conspiracy.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that 9/11 was an inside job. None. And yet people still would bet their lives on it being true. You tell us to just go to other subs, but in those subs, we&#39;d be preaching to the choir. We aren&#39;t asking for scepticism and facts in this sub because we want to hurt it, we ask because the world is a better place when people actually know if things are true or not, and better yet, know how to get to the truth more reliably. This sub needs facts and truth and evidence, or it needs to be re-branded as a creative fiction sub about conspiracies.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t quite add up.</p>

<p>EDIT: Also notice the highest voted post in the topic is saying to use the upvote/downvote to vote for his removal. So it&#39;s got a highly net positive vote count and that comment gets upvoted, but the majority of the people in the comments think what whetstone does is ok? I don&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not too surprising.  A lot of people upvote posts they agree with without downvoting posts they disagree with.  That&#39;s just a sign that the community is split on the issue.</p>

<p>That makes it sound like it&#39;s 50-50. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s more like 70-30. And a lot of those 30% are from conspiratard, the sub dedicated to discrediting this one.</p>

<p>I think when you say things like this you&#39;re guilty of the very thing you&#39;re saying is bad. You treat everyone who posts here like someone who thinks every single thing ever reported is a conspiracy. This sub is made up of hundreds of thousands of people and we all have different opinions. You come here and perceieve a pattern and then you ascribe that behaviour to all of us. It&#39;s not the case. I don&#39;t even post here that often and when I do it&#39;s almost always from a skeptical point of view. The thing is that there are enough people in this community where pretty much every event is going to get posted about because SOMEONE out there thinks it&#39;s a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t go around lumping everyone from a 200k+ population into the same boat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t censor for content- so have an upvote for expressing your opinion. I think it&#39;s important to listen to criticism and think critically. You might have noticed that none of the mods here have removed a single post critical of me (including myself). Why? I want you to step back for a second and think this through. Really try to be critical of your own mind for a second.</p>

<p>I <em>actually</em> believe it&#39;s a good idea to be self-critical. Woah! Crazy talk! Yes indeed. Being self-critical is the first step in critical thinking. If you are willing to talk to people who disagree with you- or who are trolls- or who hate you and insult you- you can learn a lot. Those are the people who won&#39;t hold back. So I leave all these threads about me up- because your opinions are important too, even if I don&#39;t share them. I want to set an example that it&#39;s ok to disagree. It&#39;s ok to think differently and to have groups like <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> poking fun of us. We can disagree with them and still be ok with having our views challenged. That&#39;s really the whole point of this subreddit- challenging our views and challenging the views of others.</p>

<p>I know you&#39;re upset- it&#39;s clear that you are. And you&#39;ve put a lot of time into this post and the other comments you&#39;ve made. But on an unrelated note- you&#39;re a human and so am I- and I hope this stress doesn&#39;t ruin your holidays. Just take a breather, drink some whiskey, and enjoy the day off. Life&#39;s too short to get stressed out over internet forums.</p>

<p>1 year old account and he was banned. He&#39;s very active here. No warning or anything. No chance to edit the post when only a few people saw the word &quot;faggots.&quot; Absolutely ridiculous. I see people calling each other names here all the time and they aren&#39;t banned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trying to discuss with trolls who raid this sub with anti-Semitic material in an attempt to degrade the people who post here is wrong and worthy of censure.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the sub he is seeking assistance from is a group dedicated to destorying this sub via raids and comment manipulation. </p>

<p>This sub, about three weeks ago, was asked by <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a>  to stop reporting on censorship in other subreddits. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1rv28k/guidelines_update_moving_redditrelated/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1rv28k/guidelines_update_moving_redditrelated/</a></p>

<p>This is what reddit inc (Alexis and Erik) have tried to do with any big subs who have reported on PR firm manipulation on reddit. Alexis and Erik run the PR firm Antique Jetpack. That it was tried in this sub told me something was very wrong. </p>

<p>That <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a> thought it appropriate to discuss with Bipolarbear0 and others as to how to censor speech on this sub is a slap in the face to the years of work some of us have out in here. This place is a bastion of free speech, the very last one left on reddit. </p>

<p>I could give a fuck less if he talked to them. It&#39;s why he&#39;s talking to them that&#39;s got me up in arms. </p>

<p>On the last link, click history, see bottom post. Click to imgur link and see link flair. The blatant anti-semitism comes from him. There&#39;s always crazy anti-semitic rants here using accounts that are very new and/or have little activity at all. The &quot;anti-semitic problem&quot; is actually a Bipolarbear0 problem, and this person is giving solidwhetstone advice about how to run this sub. </p>

<p>Bipolarbear0 97 points (in the thread where solidwhetstone asks them for advice): </p>

<p><em>There&#39;s no doubt that I absolutely despise racism, and if there&#39;s anyone out there that hates racism more than me, then it&#39;s you -- which is why I was so shocked when I learned that you moderated <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Ask anywhere you go and you&#39;ll get the same answer: Of all the mainstream subreddits, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is certainly one of the most racist. I&#39;m quite familiar with it, in fact. I used to be a casual browser before I was turned off by the appalling amount of racism in the subreddit, and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s true of many others here as well. The most common flavour is almost certainly anti-semitism</em></p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s because you cry shill whenever someone disagrees with you, instead of offering proof of your beliefs.  It&#39;s a rather immature debate technique.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i am not here to educate you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You and others like you prove this by not offering any proof of your beliefs.  I would ask why you don&#39;t want to educate someone that disagrees with you, but since I don&#39;t expect a particularly enlightened response I&#39;m just not going to bother.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and we all know you aren&#39;t here to learn,</p>

<p>Actually, I came here because I wanted an alternative news source, and I stayed because I thought my knowledge of some events and phenomena could add to the discussion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you could simply look at the original post and decide for yourself. That thread had a lot of very strange activity and did not seem to even closely resemble the voting behavior of this sub in general. If you personally think nothing there is out of the ordinary, fine. I&#39;m sure most would disagree and that is all that I care about. I really didn&#39;t expect a consensus on this anyway, especially from r/conspiratard apologists like yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no apologist. I value the idea of a mod reaching out to our critics and asking them for their views. It doesn&#39;t mean we do anything they suggest but no one has a monopoly on good ideas and it is healthy to get some criticism occasionally.  I do not subscribe or frequent conspiritard as I think the point of the sub is repugnant and their contributions often destructive. However, at the time of making that comment, I read the small number of responses to the mod&#39;s post on conspiritard and found the replies broadly sensible. They were mostly saying, in a roundabout way,  that we needed to apply the sub rules more consistently.  </p>

<p>I do think there is too much anti-semitism in this sub and some of the evidence to support submissions is weak. I would like to see improvements here for the good of the sub in general. </p>

<p>We need to try different things occasionally, be brave and take risks if we are to make progress. If we do what we&#39;ve always done, we&#39;ll get what we&#39;ve always got. That&#39;s really what motivated me to comment.</p>

<p>On the last link, click history, see bottom post. Click to imgur link and see link flair. The blatant anti-semitism comes from him. There&#39;s always crazy anti-semitic rants here using accounts that are very new and/or have little activity at all. The &quot;anti-semitic problem&quot; is actually a Bipolarbear0 problem, and this person is giving solidwhetstone advice about how to run this sub. </p>

<p>Bipolarbear0 97 points (in the thread where solidwhetstone asks them for advice): </p>

<p><em>There&#39;s no doubt that I absolutely despise racism, and if there&#39;s anyone out there that hates racism more than me, then it&#39;s you -- which is why I was so shocked when I learned that you moderated <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Ask anywhere you go and you&#39;ll get the same answer: Of all the mainstream subreddits, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is certainly one of the most racist. I&#39;m quite familiar with it, in fact. I used to be a casual browser before I was turned off by the appalling amount of racism in the subreddit, and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s true of many others here as well. The most common flavour is almost certainly anti-semitism</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you are saying and I appreciate the links. It is clear that it is definitely not one sided. People, like Bipolarbear0 are submitting anti-semitic link(s) to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, that is clear. Some are doing it for shits and giggles, others are doing it to &#39;test&#39; the sub. Both reasons are wrong and must be discouraged. I hope he is banned from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> now?</p>

<p>What we need to do as a sub is not to be complacent either. We need to rebuff anti-semitism posts when they are posted and upvote comments that confront them. </p>

<p>Ideally,  for me, I would like the mods to delete the anti-semitic posts and post them on <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> for us to see. However, I appreciate others want more of a dialogue and for those anti-semitic posts to be just downvoted. </p>

<p>If these posts are upvoted by shills and commented on by shills we need to not be drawn into the fight. Just say our views calmly and leave. Soon the shills will self-identify and we can spot those who want to undermine the sub&#39;s work.</p>

<p>Finally, I really want to stress that this is ultimately a diversion. We musn&#39;t allow anyone to divide the sub and undermine its credibility as this episode has done. Brash and bad tempered calls for mods&#39; heads does us no favours, however, justified and urgent it feels at the time. Our most powerful weapons against shills are calm debate and evidenced based commentary. If we were all able to keep to those principles the shills&#39; oxygen would soon run out. </p>

<p>This is this sub in a single post. I&#39;m a user of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Not a shill. Not a conspiratard or whatever, and I don&#39;t mind what he did. He literally asked for advice in that other sub. They actually talked quite civilly and respectfully. You know, engaging in conversation? Not just pointing fingers and making crazy ass accusations. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know... have you ever stopped to think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> members are actually on his side? Hence, the upvotes and downvotes on said comments. Maybe some users have a different opinion and aren&#39;t trolls or shills. Or maybe a mod is going to PUBLICLY do something to discredit himself and the sub which he moderates. </p>
