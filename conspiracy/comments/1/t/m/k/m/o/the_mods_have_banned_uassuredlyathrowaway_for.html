    <div class="md"><p>He was making some good posts in the other threads. Seems like he&#39;s one of the ones who has a good grip on what is wrong here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> lately. <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a> must be having a mental breakdown if he thinks banning <a href="/u/assuredlyathrowaway">/u/assuredlyathrowaway</a> is an appropriate move for him. Its only making the case for his removal stronger.</p>

<p>I think we could use several more moderators here. Ones that will tackle the problem of the <a href="/r/conspiratards">/r/conspiratards</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Mocking</strong> is not discussion, neither is attacking the <strong>notion</strong> of conspiracy. Conspiracies are happening all the time in every area of life. It takes intuitive minds to begin to uncover these, and this is the very concept that is under attack in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Vote brigading and black ops from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> are the most damaging things to this subreddit, and this aggression will not stand.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn&#39;t matter what other subs think of the people here</strong>. What matters is that those people are not permitted to come in and make a mockery of the ideals of this subreddit. Let them have <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. We don&#39;t want them shut down, we just want them to stop harassing us.</p>

<p>We can solve this quite easily with several new moderators who will be vigilant in removing them whenever they create new troll accounts. I would love to be <strong>one</strong> of several to do this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should ban yourself for using the word faggot.  Its unacceptable and i am offended.  </p>

<p>You also banned my alt for the following: </p>

<p>One user said that downvotes would deal with racism.  The point was that needless racism would be dealt with by users of the forum.  As a joke, i wrote &quot;lets do a test: all niggers are faggots.&quot;</p>

<p>You banned me.  You wouldnt explain yourself either when i pmed you and made it clear it was a joke.  Clearly i dont think that all black people are homosexuals, nor do i have any problem with homosexuals.  I said the most offensive thing i could, predicated by the notion that it was satire.</p>

<p>If the word itself is grounds for a ban, even in discussion, then you also shouldnt be allowed to post here anymore, because you said faggot.</p>

<p>This, while unbanning people who purposefully disrupt discussion here, which is also against the rules.</p>

<p>Its easy to go on a moral crusade when you have zero accountability.  If certain words offend you, dont fucking use them.  If you use them and ban others for using them, youre being, well, use your imagination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, when its YOU context matters, because you know that you arent racist, or homophobic.  When you banned me, you did it simply because of the word i used, regardless of context, and thereafter wouldnt explain yourself.</p>

<p>So while youre correct that context matters, you arent applying it justly.  Youre applying it in a heavy handed way when it suits you, and when it serves your purpose, you say context matters.</p>

<p>I dont know about the other guy, but in my case i think it was clearly a joke.  I also didnt make it up, its quoted from a David cross skit about trent lott being a ridiculous racist.</p>

<p>I should add that if youre so concerned about offensive language, you ought to reconsider going to a forum the moderators of which also mod a sub about pancakes which is in reference to a murderded activist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a valid ban I think. Calling people faggots is low-level. As a daily lurker and sometime commenter here I am not always able to follow the plot of the many dramas that go one in here.  Could you please post some sort of explanation of your recent actions/dialogue with r/conspirard because it seems at best misguided and at worst deeply shady and I think the community deserves an explaination as to your motives. I personally don&#39;t understand enough facts to make any kind of judgement.. You are being villified by many here and thier charges seem valid because I have not heard your side of the story. Please clear things up so we can move on and focus on other conspiracies. Thank you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. This must be a real strange occurrence for the lurkers.</p>

<p>The gist of this is that I went to a subreddit that is critical and parodies <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and conspiracy theorists to ask them politely what they would do to improve this subreddit. Since I am here every day, I am already aware of what this userbase thinks, so I wanted to get a fresh perspective.</p>

<p>Some vocal users here didn&#39;t like that I did this since they see this other subreddit as &#39;enemies&#39; (even though many have stated that they subscribe to both). So essentially, by asking for advice from a group that is critical of this group- this group has decided to witch hunt me- calling me untrustworthy, etc. The fallout then has been all the threads you&#39;re seeing- which you can decide for yourself how reasonable the users posting in them sound.</p>

<p>I hope I&#39;ve done a good enough job explaining myself. My core feelings here is that we should be willing to critically examine ourselves and our beliefs at all times- so even when another person or group is critical- there may be something there to listen to. It turns out that the people in that group had some interesting criticisms to make- and they were very cordial about everything (although some of it was probably misleading information).</p>

<p>Nothing here has changed. No rules have been added or removed, and the enforcement of rules hasn&#39;t changed. All removed posts can still be found at <a href="/u/uncensorship">/u/uncensorship</a> and I haven&#39;t banned any users for anything other than what is in the sidebar (which today has just been a few rule 10 infractions).</p>

<p>Hope that clears everything up! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They need to clarify rule 9. Someone mistakenly a comma. I think it says you can&#39;t crosspost threads made in this sub to another sub, and can&#39;t link comments made here to anywhere else? But maybe it refers to the opposite!</p>

<p>The way it is written, though, it means that if you crosspost links to a sub that has rules against that sort of thing then that other sub might ban you!</p>

<p>Nobody liked your proposal to move reddit related conspiracies to a sub with a whole 220 some members.</p>

<p>Nobody liked the masonic worship images you plastered our backgrounds with in your new design.</p>

<p>Nobody thinks you should be asking our trolls how to make this sub more palatable to their trolling. </p>

<p>Reading through the conspiratard thread it seems their largest complaint with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is being banned from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  Sure they bitch about racism, but all the top complaints are people bemoaning their &#39;unfair&#39; bans. Instead of thinking that maybe they just want to be allowed to troll here without consequence you decided that they must all be good people and removed their bans simply for the asking.</p>

<p>So how is it that you think you are aware of anything that this userbase thinks?  You openly admit to being &#39;too busy&#39; to read through comments here so how would you know?  You&#39;ve shown again and again that you have no clue as to what we want.   </p>

<p>Seriously, when have you shown yourself to be aware of what this userbase thinks?  I can think of no example, but I gave you several examples of you being completely unaware of what this sub is about.  So will you go on saying that you already understand us or will you simply admit that you have no idea what this sub is or what it stands for?</p>

<p>And please stop kidding yourself on this one.  It is absolutely not a small amount of vocal users having a problem with your actions. Read through all the comments on the thread asking you to step down.  I see not one saying that you shouldn&#39;t step down.  Even your new <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> friends aren&#39;t saying that you shouldn&#39;t step down.  They&#39;re just arguing semantics and trolling the comments as usual.  You do see that right?  They&#39;re not helping you or standing up for you, they&#39;re not weighing in that you should not step down.  They are simply arguing semantics and constructing straw men, like usual.  you should be disappointed that you did so much for them and they don&#39;t even like you enough to say &#39;no&#39; on a yes/no survey.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I do appreciate hearing your side of the story I hope you take time to hear mine. As of only yesterday my inbox is a dirty mess of messages and comments from trolls and conspiratards. The main messages coming from posts that made it to the top list here. Others from various subs I&#39;m posting in. I can assure you <a href="/r/gardening">/r/gardening</a> and <a href="/r/homestead">/r/homestead</a> have little to no trolls. Some I was OP and others I was commenting in. They have arrived like a virus with a downvote brigade and a trolling mentality. This is not condusive to a healthy sub. I&#39;m not placing all the blame on you. But somehow this whole thing has opened pandoras box on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I really enjoyed this sub. Now I&#39;m questioning my involvement if this will be allowed to continue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pay no attention to the underline point. The point this guys making is that the problems steam from the conspiritard subreddit not <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. If this guy is being harassed by members of <a href="/r/conspiritards">/r/conspiritards</a> arn&#39;t sirens going off in your head? They do not have a valid point to mock, spam and vote bridage. And they definatly should not then harass memebers of the reddit community just because they have an opinion! If I got a group of guys and started a subreddit /r/eatinghealthyisforretards and then spammed, mocked and vote birgaded <a href="/r/eatinghealthy">/r/eatinghealthy</a> reddit community what would happen? Would the mods of <a href="/r/eatinghealthy">/r/eatinghealthy</a> try to exstend the olive branch? Or would the admins and mods realize that my group was established just to stifle discussion of a legitimate topic of discussion. Nuff said! Get a clue!</p>
