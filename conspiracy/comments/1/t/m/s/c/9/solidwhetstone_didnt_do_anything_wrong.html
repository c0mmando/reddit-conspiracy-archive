        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>He asked for ways that r/conspiracy can improve, not how it can be made worst. It is also worth remembering that no changes have been made as a result of his post on r/conspiratard. To ignore dissenting voices does us all a disservice and shows selective ignorance. I have moderated here for a number of years and know solidwhetstone is not a biased voice. He did however misjudge his post and made an error in how he handled the question of making <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> better. </p>

<p>Does that mean he is devil spawn? </p>

<p>He was the first mod to approve the top <a href="http://i.imgur.com/FTr2KyQ.jpg">post asking for him to step down</a> because he wanted to listen to all of your opinions.</p>

<p>I understand that he has possibly gone about things in the wrong way, we all make errors of judgement. Put things into perspective before persecution. We all want this sub to move forward and asking for criticism cannot be viewed as a bad idea. </p>

<p>Nothing has changed as a result of his post. If you have issues with the way this was handled then tell us, but don&#39;t all reach for the pitch forks. </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Moderator solidwhetstone has volunteered that he will be removed to the bottom moderator position as a result of his conspiratard post. We have agreed that if any user has issues with him - or his future moderation duties he will be removed immediately. Please see this as a reasonable suggestion from an honest moderator, not someone who wanted to harm the sub or its readers. </p>

<p>Edit 2:</p>

<p>What would you like to see as a fair outcome of the solidwhetstone episode? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As somebody who browses here a lot but very rarely posts, I think he was correct, and I do think conspiritard is made up of some people that are put off from this sub, for a group of &#39;open minded&#39; redditors and people that claim to work objectively, massive amounts of this sub is just &#39;anti-system&#39; propaganda that is more about stroking peoples egos, with those who question becoming shills. Posters should have to post solid proof of what they say or mark it as opinion, and leave their egos behind. The mod people are having a go at is not the problem some of the redditors are. This is my honest opinion of this sub, some of the people here are more like sheep than those that listen to the MSM.</p>

If you asked for his removal you should be ashamed. Ask your all so mighty selves, if you are the watchmen of this world, pointing out the wrong in others, who watches you? 
My reasoning for the comment above is also because of the burden of proof, some claims made here are opinion, pure and simple, that people try to reprisent as fact.
The world you are all so sick of will never change while you act the way you do.
I will fade back into the background now, but would like to add;
We are supposed to be those that start a revolution of minds and society, the leaders and guides of those who start learning how screwed we are being, instead some of you look at this as a title &#39;I&#39;m better than you because I know the systems fucked, and you&#39;re just a zombie, and if your view is different you must work for the government</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, but if we jump on someone (anyone for that matter) for a poor choice/bad decision/momentary lapse of reason, it does not help anything. </p>

<p>Like I said, if said behavior continues, then I would be one of the ones asking for judgement to be passed. Mistakes can be learned from, if someone cannot learn from their mistakes, or poor judgement then so be it, then it&#39;s time to act on it.</p>

<p>But I feel this is more of a divide and conquer effort, seems to be working well as the front page is full of discussion regarding this, and has &quot;distracted&quot; from the &quot;real&quot; issues of topic.</p>

<p>Carlin said &quot;they&#39; don&#39;t want people that can think, even more, they don&#39;t want people that think having discussions with others that can think.  OMG it&#39;ll become a movement...  =)</p>

<p>If I had to guess, of course this is a &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; line of thought here, I would say that in earnest he sought to find out from r/conspiracy&#39;s biggest critics &quot;Why&quot; they hate on this sub so hard, to address what it was about the sub that causes their ire and maybe a way to bring more into or back into the &quot;discussion&quot;.</p>

<p>I may be wrong...</p>

<p>But a lot of energy and time has been wasted on this petty crap.
No deep thinking here, which is what we come here to do, engage our minds in critical discussion to figure out truths that would otherwise be quickly swept under the rug from view, and dismantle the nonsense.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents, which under today&#39;s dollar isn&#39;t anything anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you must listen to the community but how do you define the &quot;community&quot;? A noisy  minority of commenters out of 204k subscribers? What period of time is needed to determine a reasonable per cent of the community has read your post and had its&#39; say?  A few hours or days?  A few hours mean you are only listening to subscribers in or near your time zone. That is not fair.</p>

<p>At the moment, the noisy minority has a megaphone in this sub, all they are missing    are pitchforks.  More time is needed to get a broad and considered opinion. Who could be against that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He still needs to be removed as a mod and this is the entire community speaking. Let me explain to you why, it&#39;s not because he simply asked conspiritard a question but because of the way he speaks about his own community to a community created entirely to discredit and belittle this community. In reading his comments on the thread in question it&#39;s painfully obvious that he thinks very poorly of his own community and where he should be defending it instead he&#39;s openly talking shit about it. I want mods who feel as passionately about this content as I do and he seems like just a dip shit kid who thinks this is a fun hobbie.</p>

<p>I hope its understood why people would be skeptical of another call for sweeping changes, especially when it appears a pattern is emerging with mod action. And thats ignoring the constant calls from brigadeers to declare this sub dead, or for everyone to move to a new sub.</p>

<p>The primary issue in the west regarding speech isn&#39;t legal protection for speech(Free Speech). It is the <strong>ability</strong> to be heard against <strong>bullying and ridicule</strong>. Manufacturing complacency and silenced &quot;consensus&quot; is the game those in power play now. This is the issue most faced by conspiracy theorists. One that has taken its form on Reddit as <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. <strong>This doesn&#39;t need to be further fueled by <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods.</strong></p>

<p>What we need are some mods with proper understanding of this and the willingness to save this community by the removal of <a href="/r/conspiratards">/r/conspiratards</a>. <strong>Disagreement is fine, trolling is not</strong>. Its a slap in the face of everyone here that this trolling is even &quot;state sponsored&quot;. My suggestion is getting several new moderators with the sole purpose of removing <a href="/r/conspiratards">/r/conspiratards</a> until they are no longer a problem. I volunteer for for one of these positions and I&#39;m sure many others here would as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I don&#39;t care for <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> it&#39;s just a circle jerk of this sub, some people claim shill this &amp; troll that, really &quot;up/downvote brigades&quot; would pose a bigger threat &amp; you can do the same to them if it&#39;s such a problem.</p>

<p>Really I see that sub as &quot;oh so wise (/s) and critical&quot; of this one, and perhaps all Solid wanted was to see what they would do that&#39;s so much better, perhaps he/she never considered actually enacting whatever they suggest.</p>

<p>&amp; I can think of worse things a Mod could do that would certainly deserve removal would be censorship or banning/deleting posts for illegitimate reasons, and if indeed the charges of racism are true which I think you&#39;d have to be insane to say there has never been racist things said on this sub, then he might have good reason to ban/remove posts but he never has.</p>

<p>My vote is I think he should stay, maybe he regrets his decision, and it&#39;s lesson learned, I mean look at the backlash, and we all go back to what we were doing, what did we lose from him going to &quot;the enemy&quot; for advice?</p>

<p>I will most likely get downvoted for my opinion but if giving even a single fuck aboot my karma was my forte I&#39;d have just shown myself the door, and really I&#39;ll just laugh because according to Reddiquette, you don&#39;t downvote opinions, and if you do you at least say why, that&#39;s what bothers me not imaginary points but when someone is all &quot;eeh-click&quot; without showing their fuckin&#39; face.</p>

<p>This is much harder to do when the subreddit is being actively vote brigaded with mod approval.</p>

I&#39;m not really following this controversy much but you think a mod here would know that that place is essentially modded by Israel firsters who make Rachel corrie jokes and are likely paid to do things like that, or are just plain psychotic.
