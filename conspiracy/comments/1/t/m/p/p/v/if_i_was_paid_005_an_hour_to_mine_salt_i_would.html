<p>One idea I think I heard was employees working for ownership of the business. The idea being the worker if has a stake, will work harder for his own things.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s unclear; that&#39;s the point of wage slavery. Chattel slavery was more-or-less cut and dry in the matter, and thus could not survive in an age of increasing literacy; though indentured servitude was a compromise that kept it going quite a while. I suppose one could argue that wage slavery is indentured servitude on an installment plan; which is enforced more through artificial market shortage than state coercion.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t think about slavery in terms of what job it is or in terms of how much or how little you get paid.</p>

<p>Lets not confuse things and lets get educated.

<p>I suggest any book from Friedrich Hayek, for example the road to serfdom, individualism and economic order, etc...</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s an oversimplification.  MOST viable businesses (that are not a sole-proprietor-type setup) are not started by a man with a vision.  They are started as a funded idea, with investors, etc.  Investors will demand to be paid back.  &quot;Investors&quot; can also be people who are willing to work for a stake of the company, rather than putting in money and expecting a return.  If paying back investors is not a deterrent to starting a business, then assigning partial ownership to labor should not be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the question is more serious than you think. Only in the beginning the slaves were working for free. Then the ownners started giving money to their slaves. They were payed the minimum in order to survive, and were incapable to ask for more of course.</p>

<p>The problem with slavery was that slaves sometimes were able to start local insurrections. Because of this the owners invented capitalism, which basically means that the majority of citizens are still slaves, but they are unaware. And are still being payed the minimum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that simple.</p>

<p>Besides the question you&#39;re raising, wages themselves are more complex.</p>

<p>The problem is that a specific number amount does not in itself adequately describe someone&#39;s earnings.</p>

<p>I would suggest running a search &quot;consumer basket&quot; or &quot;GINI.&quot; In essence, that 5 c might earn you a week&#39;s worth of food in a different country where prices and wages are differently computed.</p>
