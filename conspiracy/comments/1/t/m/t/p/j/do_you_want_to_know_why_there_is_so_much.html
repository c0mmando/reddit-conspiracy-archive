<p>On the last link, click history, see bottom post. Click to imgur link and see link flair. He took the screenshot logged in as Bipolarbear0, then uploaded the screenshot and used it on his alt account to discredit r/conspiracy. The blatant anti-semitism comes from him. There&#39;s always crazy anti-semitic rants here using accounts that are very new and/or have little activity at all. The &quot;anti-semitic problem&quot; is actually a Bipolarbear0 problem, and this person is giving solidwhetstone advice about how to run this sub. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Bipolarbear0 97 points (in the thread where solidwhetstone asks them for advice): </p>

<p><em>There&#39;s no doubt that I absolutely despise racism, and if there&#39;s anyone out there that hates racism more than me, then it&#39;s you -- which is why I was so shocked when I learned that you moderated <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Ask anywhere you go and you&#39;ll get the same answer: Of all the mainstream subreddits, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is certainly one of the most racist. I&#39;m quite familiar with it, in fact. I used to be a casual browser before I was turned off by the appalling amount of racism in the subreddit, and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s true of many others here as well. The most common flavour is almost certainly anti-semitism</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for being one of the only people in this thread who want to actually talk about this thread. </p>

<p>For anyone reading, see the post histories of every account on here that is talking about Jews. (I&#39;m counting 4 1 month accounts, and 1 10 day old) It&#39;s just one guy (probably Bipolarbear0) who is upvoting all of his posts about Jews. He will then probably use another alt account and post a link to this thread in r/conspiratard so that they can all circlejerk about how anti-semitic this sub is. Ridiculous and obvious. </p>

<p>Becouse that would be anti zionism. If you actually dislike how the nationalism became excluding instead of inclusive, that would be a different thing. 
Every country has a nationalism (allthough sometimes inclusive) - else no country would exist, becouse no national identity could be formed and therefor we would have either a global form of regime or anarchy.</p>

<p>Compound words depend on their etymological meaning more than their literal definition. In the case of &quot;Anti-Semite&quot; the history of the term is that it was coined to mean &quot;to be bigoted against Jews&quot; and has never in history ever meant any thing else.</p>

<p>Just so I have this down on record, you are saying that the guy who published <a href="http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/images/sturmer/ds34-40.jpg">this</a> should be considered a martyr and a hero? Am I reading this right? Let me guess, you also feel that he was not an anti-semite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just want to add in my two cents here on this post so you can add this info to any further posts made on this topic.  </p>

<p>The same people behind r/Conspiratard are the same people behind the r/worldofpancakes (originally used to also mock Rachel Corrie who was an American protester bulldozed into the ground by the IDF in gaza). They are also behind r/EnoughPaulSpam (an anti Ron Paul subreddit) and were extremely active during the last election. A lot of people on <a href="/r/ronpaul">/r/ronpaul</a> got tired of their trolling which the moderator permitted and set-up a rival Ron Paul subreddit called <a href="/r/paul">/r/paul</a>. It was brand new at the time and here&#39;s where the story begins. </p>

<p>Somone on r/enoughpaulspam made this post on r/enoughpaulspam. It was tilted:<br/>
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughPaulSpam/comments/x60u1/top_post_in_rpaul_made_by_racist_antisemitic/">&quot;Top post in /r/paul made by racist anti-semitic Dusty impersonator. I don&#39;t know if this is sad or hilarious&quot;</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s is the screenshot of the top posts on r/paul at the time which this post linked to:<br/>
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/FSQsf.png">http://i.imgur.com/FSQsf.png</a>  </p>

<p>The EPS member was accusing r/paul subscribers of upvoting a post by an anti-semite which isn&#39;t actually immediately apparent unless you were familiar with the user&#39;s history. There are not many subsribers to r/paul so the post just needed 6 upvotes to become the top post. </p>

<p>But if you examine the screenshot the EPS member took, you will notice that they have RES installed. Consequently you will notice that they have upvoted this &#39;anti-semite&#39; they are criticizing 17 times.</p>

<p>So I go into the thread on EPS and call the poster out on having upvoted this same alleged anti-semite they are criticizing 17 times. You know what he tells me? &quot;I always upvote crazy in the Ron Paul subs&quot;. </p>

<p>So he goes into Ron Paul subs and purposely upvotes posts by people he accuses of being an anti-semite. Then he accuses the subscribers of those subs of upvoting anti-semites! Doesn&#39;t take much of stretch of the imagination to guess who is behind the anti-semite account to begin with.  </p>

<p>Then of course my posts are deleted and I am banned from the r/enoughpaulspam. I took a screenshot of the thread before this happened though:<br/>
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/90H8x.png">http://i.imgur.com/90H8x.png</a>   </p>

<p>And here is an alt source for the image showing his 17 upvotes in case they delete it:<br/>
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/1s912.png">http://i.imgur.com/1s912.png</a>  </p>

<p>Here is a thread on <a href="/r/NolibsWatch">/r/NolibsWatch</a> where I have posted about this before:<br/>
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/comments/x7fd0/reps_member_criticizes_rpaul_for_having_a_top/">http://www.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/comments/x7fd0/reps_member_criticizes_rpaul_for_having_a_top/</a><br/>
They are a watch group for these people.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as people would like to believe it...you cannot paint all Jews with one broad stroke.</p>

<p>I&#39;m Jewish but I criticize Jews when it&#39;s warranted, I criticize Christians when it&#39;s warranted. I am only after the facts; the truth.</p>

<p>It is troubling to me that Jews (Ashkenazi Jews usually) are behind so many of the world&#39;s problems. Even Carl Bernstein, one of the greatest journalists of our time, recognizes this. Still...you cannot lash out at ALL Jews for the sins of a few. </p>

<p>Do Jews run the media, congress and Hollywood? Yes. Do they act in America&#39;s best interest? Hardly ever. BUT...these people are about .00000001% of the Jewish population. Most of them are <em>Zionists</em>. Look at Biden; you don&#39;t have to be Jewish to be a Zionist.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not anti-Semitic to speak the truth (yet) but just remember that MANY of us are NOT on the side of the racist asshole Jews who are causing disharmony in the world. Most of us are just like you...not in some criminal cabal, not screwing over the taxpayer...just going to work and paying our taxes like everyone else.</p>

<p>The &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; card has been played FAR too much...it has lost its original meaning. We have groups like the ADL to thank for that.</p>

<p>Just a reminder...all Jews are NOT Zionists and, in fact, we actively fight against it and the crimes and atrocities of Israel. We are no &quot;better&quot; or more &quot;chosen&quot; than anyone else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And Hitler actually agreed with the Zionists in classifying Jews as a race.  Both Zionists and Hitler&#39;s Germany had laws based on racial classifications.  Hitler also worked with Zionist organizations to remove Jews to Palestine.  </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ll point out that Americans also suspected a whole race/people of a certain origin as being &quot;enemy aliens&quot;--Japanese Americans.</p>

<p>So while I <strong>certaintly</strong> don&#39;t agree with the anti-semitic (or &quot;racist&quot;) laws Germany enacted, the Americans enacted similar laws and actually there was less evidence of Japanese hostility to Americans then there was Jewish hostility to Germany.</p>

<p>xanaxinator is totally correct that most Jews in Germany didn&#39;t support Zionists so it was unfair to target them but many Zionist organizations, including many German Jews, were hostile to Germany.  Zionist organization declared &quot;war&quot; on Germany and tried to turn German Jews against the government.  There was nothing equivalent that Japanese Americans did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol you are getting trolled hard, makes me want to pretend to be an alt just to feed your paranoia. Wake up! </p>

<p>Also that looks a little photoshopped. I mean that DahvieVanity is clearly either joking or you wrote it yourself. It sounds so much like what you think Bear does and completely the opposite of what he actually talks like if you read his posts.</p>

<p>You need to grow up and stop lying to incite witch hunts, like by pretending the information in your top post is new or that these PMs either a) really happened or b) were from bear&#39;s &quot;alts&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going with CowgoesMooz. Are you Mooz? I know you are not the kind of person to post much on your own account here. But you also have delusions and think everybody you are speaking to is bipolarbear, and that is racist for a Jew to ironically troll a known haven of anti-semites by posting anti-semitic material and seeing how many upvotes it gets.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve convinced yourself but there will be regulars and new accounts saying bad things about Jews in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and a very very small of them would be BipolarBear, if any. He has a lot more to do reddit-wise than he did 6 months ago.</p>

<p>Anyway, have a good christmas and ease on the paranoia. Not everything is a false flag by the exact person you dislike. </p>

<p>also, if he does it for a job like you are pretending, why is he stalking you and following your posts on a christmas morning, and why would he TELL you? This is like fiction written by a 14 year old.</p>

<p>edit: and i love how you downvoted a comment that contributed to the discussion with an alternate viewpoint. But it&#39;s totally the conspiratard brigade that misuses reddit right? He literally said that people here think Jews run the world, which is at least slightly true. Amos_quito obviously spends all his time wracking in fear over Zionism and says he has been personally targetted by them. So it shows how much you are soapboxing and not discussing for you to insta-downvote him. How come you NLW guys won&#39;t respond whenever I mention actual anti-semitic accounts that prove your theory wrong?</p>

<p>What do you think of the users who deny or question the holocaust? You really think they&#39;re fake? 2to4 is an actual literal white supremacist.</p>

<p>But Bear tried to play on conspiracies anti-semitism (which wouldn&#39;t have worked if there were not) 6 months ago for like 4 threads. Therefore holocaust denial literally never happens here and nobody has ever said anything anit-semitic.</p>

<p>This is also from 6 months ago and as an alt of one of the NLWers I think you know this.</p>

<p>He did that once 6 months ago. There is no evidence he has done it since. All the evidence you provide is literally rehashed shit from 6 months ago and you know it. I was there when the idea came up on IRC and then it kind of failed and didn&#39;t go over well with <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> who said &quot;well aren&#39;t they just going to use this as flimsy proof that they do get infiltrated&quot;? So why would he keep going? The only reason he would is if he really wanted this place to be anti-semitic, and if without his posting it stopped being anti-semitic. I don&#39;t think you can make that claim though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But please don&#39;t pretend that talking about Israel or a very small subpopulation of racist-supremacist Jews is &quot;anti-semitic,&quot; because it isn&#39;t. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right but articles like &quot;the jews got kicked out of places forever because they&#39;re savages&quot; and &quot;jewish guy gets banking position near obama&quot; and posters who actively question the holocaust.</p>

<p>Just so we can be clear. Denying the holocaust IS anti-semitic, right? If you don&#39;t think it is anti-semitic to intentionally minimise the suffering of jews on nazi propaganda then you don&#39;t really understand anti-semitism. Even the usual &quot;well actually semite just means arab, and Jewish people actually caused WWII!&quot; that goes on is concern trolling to try to minimise that suffering.</p>

<p>I hope that you do view such things as anti-semitic, but many many regular members of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would disagree. And nowhere else in the world would you hear the argument that denying the suffering of millions based of your own personal distrust of a modern shadowy cabal is pretty damn bigoted. </p>

<p>90% chance you&#39;re being trolled by people who realise you&#39;re paranoid and will believe them if they just say that they are bear and they&#39;re watching you.</p>

<p>10% chance you photoshopped them yourself</p>

<p>0% Bear is spending his christmas saying &quot;You are being watched&quot; to alt accounts of NLW guys who spend all their time trying to create witch hunts against him because of his political views. That would just be feeding the trolls.</p>

<p>You need to stop stalking me and posting after me. Just beacuse I revealed to people that you actively question the holocaust based off of anti-semitic organisations information, and deny that it was even a holocaust (300,000 of a population and allegedly hitler had plans to move them away? That&#39;s pretty much blatantly saying there was no attempt at genocide.)</p>

<p>Please stop following me around and posting on what I say.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that may account for a single incident, but it certainly does not account for the dozens of various posts that have made it to the top of this subreddit that are blatantly bigoted towards Jews of all stripes and colors. And I&#39;m not talking about the old canard of anti-Zionism getting mislabled as anti-semitic by Foxman et al. I&#39;m talking about blatant hatred and distrust of Jews. Examples below, note that most of the comments are supportive of anti-Jewish bigotry and many come from prolific posters of this subreddit:</p>

<p>So to answer your question, OP, yes I do want to know why there is so much anti-semitism here. But I think I know the answer, it&#39;s because there are a lot of people here who hate Jews. </p>

<p>Now OP, some questions for you.</p>

<p><strong>WHO THE HECK ARE YOU?</strong> You&#39;ve only been on here a month, yet you seem to have knowledge of many of the inner workings of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and related subreddits. So, is this your second account? Your tenth? Who are you shilling for? How many times on average do you upvote a single post? Transparency, man, we need it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1st link- Attempting to tell a religious group that they should see everyone else as equal? Call the cops!</p>

<p>2nd link: The guy hasn&#39;t said a word in a year. And the down/ups are equal. This was stupid of you to even post this. </p>

<p>3rd link: This guy has barely any activity. Looks like a standard Bipolarbear0 alt account to me. Horrible example. </p>

<p>4th link: It&#39;s a title that was taken right off an Israeli news site. Are you serious? </p>

<p>5th link: The guy was either banned, or deleted his account. Regardless, there is nothing wrong with talking about a country with a bunch of agents here. OP is clearly talking about Israeli agents, not Jews as a race. </p>

<p>6th link: That is a disgusting problem. If it was about Catholics, you wouldn&#39;t be so butthurt over it. Get over yourself. </p>

<p>7th link: An interesting coincidence, and it should have been mentioned that they weren&#39;t trying to refer to Jews as a race. I&#39;ll half-ass grant you think one, but it is a far cry from anyone saying stupid shit like &quot;dumb big nosed kikes are controlling the world.&quot; That would be something worth mentioning, but clearly you won&#39;t be able to provide anything even close to that. Why? Because this isn&#39;t an anti-semitic sub, troll. </p>

<p>8th link: That is a proven Bipolarber0 account, and I&#39;m pretty sure he was caught brigading that specific post for upvotes, but I&#39;ll have to check. Either way, he said nothing about &quot;big nised kikes,&quot; so again you are butthurt over nothing. </p>

<p>9th link: Another deleted account. That&#39;s interesting. The title shouldn&#39;t have been sensationalized like that, but nothing there is racist in any way. </p>

<p>10th link: Almost no activity coming from that account. Again, what a coincidence. And nothing there is racist. It is actually calling out racism. Why do you have a problem with that? </p>

<hr/>

<p>Ok, so 1, maybe 2 posts you can <em>really stretch</em> the definition of &quot;anti-semitism.&quot; This is hardly even close to what I would call &quot;evidence&quot; that this sub is racist or anti-semitic in general. The most blatant anti-semitism comes from Bipolarbear0 as I have already proven, so go tell him to stop his bullshit instead if you really care about racism and anti-semitism. But you won&#39;t do that because you have an agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was banned on another account in another sub that I sometimes participate in. Instead of using 2 accounts to participate there and here, I simply deleted it and made this one. I also tend to make different aliases ever so often just to keep my name from being connected to other accounts that I use online, like twitter, facebook, etc. I&#39;ve been doing this since at least 2005 when I started noticing all of the creepy &quot;connect your account to this, and connect your email to that.&quot; I like to stay anonymous. I shouldn&#39;t be a target for suspicion because I am not here attempting to discredit r/conspiracy. Correct? I even messaged the mods here explaining this entire situation when I first made this account so that I could be an approved submitter with a new account. I&#39;m sure they have the records. </p>

<p>So no, it was not a valid point. I&#39;m not trolling anybody and I&#39;m not pretending to be anti-semitic.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re the one stretching things. The first link is blatant anti-semitism. Let&#39;s focus on that for a second and your apologetics about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1st link- Attempting to tell a religious group that they should see everyone else as equal? Call the cops!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, Jews are not exclusively a religious group. Some of the most powerful Jews of the 20th century were open Atheists, like Theodore Herzl, the founder of Zionism. </p>

<p>Second, that&#39;s not at all the implication from the link. The author is saying that Jews should &quot;start behaving like civilized people&quot; and that the reason for all the expulsions were because they were not &quot;behaving like civilized people&quot;.</p>

<p>So basically what the link is saying is that Jews, no matter what color or creed, have always behaved like uncivilized savages and it&#39;s always been their fault that they&#39;ve been discriminated against so they should step up their game.</p>

<p>I guess that you also believe that racism comes from blacks acting like filthy subhumans and if they don&#39;t want racism, they should act more human?</p>

<p>As for you, I think you should stop with the accusations of &quot;shills&quot; based on account activity until you either have at least 6 months on this account or post all of your other accounts in a public thread, instead of being all secretive and spooky about it.</p>

<p>Why are 95% of Jewish politicians against the U.S. Constitution and are extremely antigun?</p>

<p>Explain that to me please. Would LOVE to hear an answer.</p>

<p>I personally believe that Jews consider themselves to be &quot;God&#39;s chosen people&quot; and their plan is to rule over all of their goyim slaves and live like kings.</p>

<p>The only way they will ever be able to do that is to disarm everyone.</p>

<p>Masters do not allow slaves to own guns.</p>

<p>Free people own guns, slaves do not. </p>

<p>Why in six years in the United States military did I never one time meet an active duty, guard or reserve Jewish solder? I met thousands upon thousands of soldiers. I served with everyone from Muslims to Mormons.</p>

<p>But never once...not one single time did I ever meet a Jewish soldier.</p>

<p>Jews hate the constitution. Jews hate the second amendment. Jews hate their goyim slaves. Jews hate our country and they hate us. They endlessly endlessly push for gun control. They will never stop. </p>

<p>The Jewish gun grabber is a bigger threat than a Muslim suicide bomber to the freedom of the United States of America. </p>
