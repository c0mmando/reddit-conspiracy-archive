       Hear me out for a second, no need to be reactionary about this. I'm in no way suggesting women caused any of this. I work in tech and i personally think people should be compensated based on their skill set and education, not on their sex or skin color.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why in 2013 are we still talking about skin color and sex? Because globalists want us to fight amongst each other while they completely rob and dismantle our nation? Divide and Conquer is the name of the game and in reality every source of unhappiness experienced in america today is a direct effect of the current system, even down to animal/child abuse (Lack of EQ, lack of education, pharma). This power construct uses heart-song issues as a control mechanism. feminism, racism, religion and 2-party politics are all used to manipulate certain groups into scapegoating and ostracizing their opposing groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       A graph on Wage stagnation, the date wages flatline correlate perfectly with women entering the work force en masse, rapid corporation growth via consolidation, use of tax havens and corporate takeovers.
       <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/10/compensation_productivity.jpg">
        http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/10/compensation_productivity.jpg
       </a>
       The Elite took notice and allowed wages to flatline, the idea was this "Households are now making twice as much and can now get by with half as much pay" - Fred J. Borch (president and CEO of GE from 1963-1972). And through Movies, music, books, opinion pieces disguised as fact and TV shows they strengthen the hate and devision amongst groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want to nurture our hatred for each other to the point of violence, they want us to stay divided, they don't trust community (for good reason, historically a strong community is what ushered in activism). We need to stop looking for hate and look for love, the mainstream media loves racism and feminism because it's reactionary but it doesn't accomplish ANYTHING.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want equality you're angry with the wrong people. I love every one of you and i haven't met any of you, i want your children to be educated, i want your children to live with out fear, i want you to make the salary and wage you should. Most importantly i want that for EVERYONE not just women.
      </p>
      <p>
       I post this quote too much but it's applicable to almost everything right now. Remember this quote next time you attempt to sling mud on a perceived opposing group, remember that only equality, love and community can save america and the longer the elites keep us divided the more control they stand to take by force. "If the American people ever allow banks to issue their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation [by having to maintain a vital circulation by perpetually re-borrowing principal and interest as subsequent sums of debt, increased perpetually so much as periodic interest], the banks and [bank owned] corporations which will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property, until their children wake homeless on the continent their fathers conquered."
      </p>
      <p>
       Most importantly, remember that racism, sexism and religion are nothing more than control mechanisms at this point. If you want to relinquish yourself from the chains of oppression find love and cast out every feeling of hate, hate keeps us divided and scared.

       It's funny in the former Soviet Union we never had feminism b/c we were raised to consider the the sexes equal &amp; stronger together as a community. If you looked at jobs throughout the economy...it was women &amp; men in every kind of position. In school we were seat girl-boy, girl-boy.

       modern feminism is the single worst thing to happen to women in the western world in centuries. not to mention the negative spillover effect it has on men, families, and children. i have to say, the people who engineered the feminist movement (and yes, it was deliberately engineered) sure did a damn good job

       Centuries implies a nice long time scale, such as women acquiring the right to vote (LESS than one century ago).

       That is true. But white women were one hundred and forty years behind their male counterparts, and black women were about fifty. And that is just the United States (I am not really caught up in history of feminism in other countries.)

       Feminism is just identity politics for women, just like black politics, white fear politics, and others. Just more ways to divide the people. Feminism is just another part.

       All the feminists I know don't act like that in any way, though the angry ones are out there. Here's what I've learned from my more cool-headed female friends:
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a whole host of issues regarding inequality that stems from the commodification of the female body. Feminism is firmly rooted in the idea that the sexual agency of women became a sort of property after the agricultural revolution. That is, when surpluses became a thing in human society, and property owners needed to ensure a lineage to pass that surplus down to, they coveted the chastity of a woman so that the babies they pump out are "theirs."
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, this was thousands of years ago, and is often pointed at as the point where women started to have their sexualities valued as something to be coveted. The way women have been treated by men throughout the years since then has morphed and changed in different ways, but the idea is still the same: Women and their magical baby making abilities are managed and controlled through various institutions in order to determine the "rightful" passage of private property after owners die, and how to properly allocate private property to children. Think about it, we don't use the state to allocate resources to children, a group of humans in our society that we have collectively agreed shouldn't do work before say, age 10; we use the institution of family. This means that if some kid ain't "your" child, then he doesn't get to share with your family's resources, the surplus. The lines are a bit blurred nowadays, what with step parents, adoption, kids born "out of wedlock," etc. But think about what life looked like 200 years ago, 100 years, even 50. The lines have always been blurred, but the reigning idea is the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I tell you this is because it's important to note why there's a struggle in the first place. Very little of real feminism outside what the puppet masters goad out of people has much to do with fair pay wages, man hate, and the like. It's rooted in beliefs that don't particularly get along with ideals of private property as presented by most free market capitalists. Instead of actually taking about the issues like this, we are left with the mainstream media's bullshit take on feminism, and men who have no property to share with a child and thusly can't find a mate resenting feminism, angry disempowered women using the mainstream media's version of feminism to be divisive, and a whole host of other ways that the conversation skirts around the central issue of feminism: the sexual agency of women is not a piece of property. Whether you agree with the wording or not, that's what feminism is based around.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: This may be a bit garbled because I'm dead tired today, but I had some time to cram all this together on my lunch.

       Feminism is based on private property and thusly typically does not get along with right-wing ideologies. I'm not saying that they CAN'T get along, but until we start to frame the conversion in this way, feminism will always seem angry, hard-workin' family-providin' men will always be puzzled by it, and feminism will look like a tool of the powers that be to those that don't trust it.

       Well said and you honestly made me think about a couple things, it's absolutely amazing to me how complex most of these social issues are yet the talking heads only seem to concentrate on the most vapid components of feminism, racism, politics and religion.
