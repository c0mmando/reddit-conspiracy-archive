The PR firm of A&amp;E and the editors of magazine GQ have coluded to break the record they set at the beginning of their first season. They allowed the masses that tune in to watch the creators of the most popular hunting gear ever created, while gaining the most views in the history of televison.</p>

<p>The PR firms that represent A&amp;E allowed the editors of GQ to runa story that contained controversial &quot;homosexual condemning comments&quot; to create uproar and gain momentum for the premier next season.</p>

<p>&quot;Phil&quot; was suspended indefinitely, but the thing to remember is that all seasons of television shows are recorded and finished BEFORE the season premier of the current season. </p>

<p>Now we just have to wait for the summer to see the commercials that will crowd the show with mystery &quot;Will Phil Return?&quot; The realistic hold of television and tabloids is being exploited by a company that created one of the worst dialogued shows ever, and they won&#39;t stop at anything to continue their reign of prime-time garbage production. It&#39;s ingenious, and insulting, to see fictional characters carry over into the real world while its eaten up by consumers.</p>

<p>A&amp;E makes their money off of &quot;ratings&quot; through the ability to show &quot;they have viewers&quot; to potential companies that air commercials. This can be considered the biggest PR stunt, and dare I say trickery and fraud, in television history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just thinking about this all being a stunt. It&#39;s also a way to keep us talking about the show in between now and the season premiere in January. I don&#39;t think there would be very many current viewers that would boycott the show if they didn&#39;t suspend him, but there are a lot that have caused an uproar since they did. They made it clear he&#39;s not fired, just suspended, so they will bring him back to huge ratings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Talking about slavery in a positive light, trying to recreate a dehumanizing era that has been forbidden due to human decency, is completely different than this man being ill-informed of homosexuality. The family is on the show for nothing other than their shock value, because they&#39;re &quot;different,&quot; in terms of slang, dialect and the ability to have fun no matter what. It&#39;s a false reality. Again, he can say what he wants, but that issue didn&#39;t get authorization to print unless someone at the A&amp;E PR department agreed. He is a public &quot;icon&quot; and is noticed, when you leave your job you are more than likely not noticed as a worker of that company while drinking at a bar. He doesn&#39;t have that option. A&amp;E, GQ and Phil all knew what they were doing. And it will pay. Mark my words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. You&#39;re a liar. And it&#39;s not up to him, he signs a contract, and has to follow their rules according to their contract. People act differently around different people. He&#39;s an actor, and you met him as a fan or a customer, you think he acts the same way around his family? No. Now, you&#39;re going to try and say &quot;yeah, but...&quot; But nothing, I don&#39;t care how you believe he will act or feel. This is what happened, and you can&#39;t lie your way into making him look better. He signed the contract, he follows the rules or he doesn&#39;t get paid. Now go lie somewhere else. He&#39;s entertainment, and that&#39;s how it works. Scripted to the fullest.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>I, personally, don&#39;t give a fuck if you believe it or not.  I&#39;ve met him on numerous occasions <em>way</em> before the Duck Dynasty show.  I&#39;ve only seen a few episodes of it, by the way.  I live in West TN.  West Tn is home to reelfoot lake.  Reelfoot Lake is some of the most prime duck hunting land in the country.  In knowing that, Phil and his guys hunt there a LOT.  Being that I live here, I&#39;ve hunted there too quite a bit.  There is a local resteraunt in Lake County (Home of Reelfoot Lake) named Boyettes.  They serve fish, ham, ect.  Lake County is such a small place that Boyettes is the only place in the county for good food.  I&#39;d run into him a lot in that restaurant during duck season.  I had noticed them from Duck Commander (their hunting show from way before Duck Dynasty) so I introduced myself.  There had no contracts at that time.  They were very homey and polite.  Me and my hunting buddies actually ate with them.  </p>

<p>Having said that, Duck Dynasty is absolutely scripted to the fullest.  The scenarios are set up.  Their personality, however, is true.  They are a good family that are very polite.  I don&#39;t care that A&amp;E did this but if they ban him, they are digging their own grave.  The Robertson family is the reason A&amp;E is, or was, huge.  </p>

<p>But please, continue telling me that I&#39;m lying you fucking douchebag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you&#39;re trying to convince me that you&#39;ve met them according to where you &quot;live.&quot; This &quot;douchebag&quot; doesn&#39;t care where you live, if you know where a restaurant is, or what they serve. Stop trying to convince people of your bullshit on the Internet. You&#39;re trolling forums constantly contradicting yourself, and somehow, someway you&#39;ve never mentioned in any other posts that you&#39;ve met him, or that you live in Tennessee. I never said they were going to ban him, I said they were going to &quot;suspended him&quot; and run commercials that say &quot;will Phil return???&quot; And reap off the profits to have another season with &quot;the highest ratings of a premiere ever recorded.&quot; So, with a run down of your terrible reply we can conclude : 
1. You&#39;re really angry that someone has called you out on lying about meeting a minuscule celebrity, as if him saying words to you and making eye contact is something impressive and should be held in high regard.
2. You&#39;re really angry that A&amp;E suspended one of their employees for making their company look like they hire low-intelligence families for a terribly scripted show, when, if I&#39;m wrong (though I know I&#39;m not) in fact they did do that. But they didn&#39;t, because again, this quote was printed on purpose. Why? Because all PR members for all actors are there for all interviews, so that either shit like this doesn&#39;t happen, or so they can tell the editor what and what-not to print. This is why they have PR firms, and almost the only reason.
3. I&#39;ve heard that most hunters in western Tennessee hunt deer for sexual pleasure. Shooting animals and having sex with the bodies while they&#39;re still warm so that they can say &quot;I had sex once,&quot; so it was nice for you and your friends to gangbang the deer you killed
4. It seems like you DO give a shit about what I say, and I&#39;ve refuted everything you said. Your arguments are founded on your ability to not read my statements, which isn&#39;t surprising in a highly-ranked welfare state. 
So : leave the thread, no one cares about your ability to lie. It&#39;s very obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree. I don&#39;t care what he says, I&#39;m offended by nothing. Words truly mean nothing. It impossibly easy to abuse any form of language. They&#39;re harping on the feelings of people who don&#39;t understand this. People are offended by things people say, forgetting that all words are a way to express opinion, an emotion or a (often inaccurate) description. I don&#39;t watch the show, I just believe in showing people what methods they&#39;re being exploited by. That&#39;s no crime.</p>
