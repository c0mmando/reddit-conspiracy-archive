        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I thought I should make that clear to anyone who is more concerned about having <em>us</em> prove our theories than questioning government propaganda and the mainstream media.</p>

<p>Everyone who does not begin their line of questioning towards the official narrative I consider questionable until proven otherwise. I never accuse people for disagreeing with me, that would be a ridiculous claim, I question those who disagree with every information presented here regardless of its merit.</p>

<p>Whenever someone posts a link, that in and of itself is what the OP agrees with. If you want to debunk the article or understand what is being presented, you should question the author of the article, not the OP unless he is the author of that article. The OP is merely stating information he thinks deserves some attention. <strong>Mocking, criticizing, ridiculing and poking holes at the first opportunity adds nothing to the debate.</strong> The OP does not need to give satisfaction for his <em>opinion</em> since it is already stated in the link he posted. <strong>Poke holes in the article, on the article</strong> if it has a comments section which most do nowadays. This should be an incentive to have you investigate yourself if you think the information presented is bunk. However, like I&#39;ve said over and over again, this should only begin to be done if you feel the official narrative is 100% bullet-proof.</p>

<p>When the media and government have 100% irrefutable evidence and sound logic to back up their narrative they don&#39;t need to be afraid of people questioning them, because the people will not have any questions to ask. The facts will speak for themselves. It won&#39;t even be considered a conspiracy theory, it will just be facts.</p>

<p>If the official narrative stands up to scrutiny, which is what we are <em>supposed</em> to be doing here first and foremost, then we can disregard the theory presented, <em>not</em> the other way around. People shouldn&#39;t have to prove their theory is true, because that&#39;s all it is, a theory, <strong>no one source has all of the information required to put all of the pieces together, otherwise it&#39;s a fact,</strong> <em>not a conspiracy theory</em>.</p>

<p>Self posts are an invitation to collaboration and debate, where it makes sense to try and understand how OP reached that conclusion since the description is where the case is made. It makes no sense at all to question OP on link posts if he is not the author.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe a theory is worthy of being investigated, it&#39;s not a theory, it&#39;s news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think this should go for every theory.  If I post a comment saying that Bigfoot shot JFK I hope somebody would say &quot;No he didn&#39;t.  You&#39;re making us all look stupid.&quot;  Debate is necessary to weed out the ridiculous claims and fine tune the ones that are feasible.  Listen to/read about every theory with an open mind but be willing to question the parts that don&#39;t make sense.  Those who are supporting certain theories should also be willing to defend them with whatever reasons or evidence they have.  I don&#39;t see it as a necessarily bad thing so long as the debate isn&#39;t just a bunch of ad hominem attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to outright call you out. I&#39;m going to let logical deduction do the job for me. Let&#39;s begin:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You never post anything in this sub. This means that your personal views are never exposed. To not say you don&#39;t post <em>anything</em>, we can use <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1qeknr/my_thoughts_on_lee_harvey_oswald_being_the_lone/">this one</a> as an example. You claim LHO acted alone and was an extremist, exactly the same story told by the government but you added your own little twist. It received 4 upvotes and it&#39;s been around 1 month. Meaning: your opinion was not well received. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ssq7o/signer_at_mandela_ceremony_has_extensive_criminal/">This post</a> also was largely neglected. It was from <strong>The Times of Israel</strong> (let&#39;s not get into the whole semitic thing, ok). It was not critical of the government&#39;s agenda. It was just an observation.</p></li>
<li><p>Like my post stated, all I have seen from you is questioning the theories brought on by this sub, never the  official narratives. Even though you fiercely engage in posts by others, especially Sandy Hook and the other carfully selected topics on my litmus test, you never post about them.</p></li>
<li><p>You say you don&#39;t owe my &quot;mini-TSA checkpoint&quot; any satisfaction, but other people <em>must</em> give you satisfaction for their opinions beyond the shadow of a doubt.</p></li>
<li><p>You will not take my litmus test because you don&#39;t want this information on record, for 2 reasons: 1. If you say Yes that the Boston bombing was a a false flag, you will never be able to engage in those topics requiring piles of evidence since you already stated here you think it was a hoax, and 2. If you answer contrary to too many of my answers, it puts you in a complicated situation because all my answers are the ones most debated against by those who choose to question the theory and not the narrative.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion, it&#39;s really hard to take you seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole point of that post about Oswald is to say exactly the opposite.  He didn&#39;t act alone.  You either didn&#39;t read it or you didn&#39;t comprehend it.  I also was the first person to post the article about Tamerlan Tsarnaev believing he was a Manchurian Candidate which got 130 or so &quot;upvotes&quot; before about a dozen other people posted the same article but I don&#39;t care about upvotes or downvotes.</p>

<p>Edit:  Also this idea of yours that you think that people shouldn&#39;t &quot;question the questioner&quot; is ridiculous and kind of hypocritical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read your post, Here is my analysis:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Killing the President is obviously a radical political statement [conjecture]. We are told that Oswald had ties to Russia and Cuba and Communism in general. [citation needed]</p>

<p>If Oswald was the lone gunman who killed Kennedy this was the best case scenario for him. [official narrative]</p>

<p>Instead of taking this time to explain his political views and why Kennedy needed to be taken out Oswald vehemently denies involvement in the killing, claims he is a patsy, and says, somewhat cryptically, that he hopes someone can come forward and offer him a defense. [exactly what the conspiracy theorists claim, that he was innocent]</p>

<p>The only reason I can see for Oswald not to take this opportunity to explain his grievances with the President/American Government are if he really was not involved, or if he was a part of something bigger and thought he still could get out of this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And finally, your own, unsourced opinion, or twist. You made an unsourced, unproven claim and <em>that</em> was fine and dandy. If we say Lanza was a patsy, we must have 24/7 footage of him not being there as well as an alibi to be able to convince you.</p>

<p>I also was the first person to post the article about Tamerlan Tsarnaev believing he was a Manchurian Candidate</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am offering the official story of LHO as a way to compare that to how somebody who was <em>actually</em> a political extremist would act (in my opinion).  If LHO was really a radical communist who killed Kennedy for political reasons he would want his message to be known.  He wouldn&#39;t pretend he didn&#39;t do it.  He would use the cameras to say &quot;Kennedy needed to die because of X, Y, and Z.&quot;  And if you think trying to be a professor by asking for citations is analysis you are pretty weak.  I&#39;m assuming most people here have at least read a little about the Kennedy assassination so no citation is necessary.  This isn&#39;t a group of first-timers.  I am agreeing with the conspiracy theorists but a big part of my reason is based on how Oswald acted following his arrest.  We all know about the magic bullet and the ties to CIA and all that other shit so I was offering another bit of information that maybe people didn&#39;t consider.  That is the crux of what this post was about.  I wasn&#39;t stating it as a fact.  It was an opinion.  Opinions aren&#39;t sourced unless I should cite myself for an original thought?  You need to go ahead and unsaddle your high horse.  </p>

<p>Nothing to analyze here but the article itself, professor. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sysgm/bostonbomber_tamerlan_tsarnaev_believed_he_was_a/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sysgm/bostonbomber_tamerlan_tsarnaev_believed_he_was_a/</a></p>

<p>No, it was not a comparison by any means of the word. The title of your post: <strong>&quot;My thoughts on Lee Harvey Oswald being the lone gunman.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Could it be a coicidence that the government also thinks he was a lone gunman?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If LHO was really a radical communist who killed Kennedy for political reasons he would want his message to be known. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why he didn&#39;t share his &quot;message&quot;. There was no &quot;message&quot; to share. This is the official narrative, again.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists don&#39;t think he pretended, they think he didn&#39;t do it at all.</p>

<p>In what instance?</p>

<p>Like your own,  unsourced opinion.</p>

<p>Try to keep it civil, please. Is all this scrutiny making you uncomfortable? All of a sudden this idea of yours that you think that people shouldn&#39;t &quot;question the questioner&quot; is ridiculous and kind of hypocritical.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now, in regards to your post:</p>

<p>edit: Reminder: Your post was <strong>just a link to Yahoo News</strong>, mainstream media. It did not contain your personal view of the incident whatsoever.</p>

<p>From the article: <em>The 26-year-old, who was killed in a shootout with police, carried out the twin bombings with his 19-year-old brother, Dzhokhar, who was later captured and charged with an act of terror.</em> <strong>OFFICIAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sysgm/bostonbomber_tamerlan_tsarnaev_believed_he_was_a/ce2lv0y">This was the first comment</a> you made on that post, and it was making apology to someone who used a series of ad hominem attacks.</p>

<p>Comment: <em>How is it that in the news we are hearing nothing about his victims and the tragedy he caused in Boston . The sooner he is tried and executed the world will be a much better place. If they need help executing him, count me in.</em></p>

<p>Your response: <em>LOL.. she is so informed that she doesn&#39;t even realize that this is the brother who is dead. (Apparently she didn&#39;t even read the article because it mentions within the article that he was &quot;killed during a shootout with the police).</em></p>

<p><strong>That is you, confirming the official narrative</strong>.</p>

<p>I rest my case.</p>

<p>Because the post title is: <em>My thoughts on Lee Harvey Oswald</em> <strong>being</strong> <em>the lone gunman.</em> Are you suggesting your post title was misleading?

<p>Why is it after people begin to run out of arguments they always fall back on &quot;you must be trolling&quot;. I&#39;m making an informed analysis using the information you provided yourself. If it doesn&#39;t hold up to scrutiny, you only have yourself to blame. Saying I&#39;m trolling you is just fucking lazy. Any convincing fact I present to you can be accused of being &quot;trolling&quot; just because you have no comment to actually debate my points. After all, I&#39;ve dissected all your comments, sentence by sentence and you were not able to reference my rebuttals in any of your follow up comments. Ignorance is bliss?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not questioning you anymore, I stopped after you refused my little pop-quiz. Now I&#39;m scrutinizing your claim that you have a legit reason to do so and throwing rhetorical questions to prove my points. It&#39;s not my fault your replies raise more questions than they answer.</p>

<p>Now, tell me how this is trolling? I haven&#39;t insulted you <em>once</em> or dismissed your comments using conjecture. I&#39;m using your comments and sources to prove that you have an agenda, and so far you&#39;ve done a poor job of convincing me otherwise. You came into <em>my</em> post voluntarily and the first thing you did was question my claim that how things are done here is wrong before looking at the current situation and then proving without a shadow of a doubt that I was wrong.</p>

My title is &quot;My thoughts on Lee Harvey Oswald being the Lone Gunman&quot;  and when you read my post you see that my thoughts are that HE WASN&#39;T the lone gunman. This would be similar to if I was writing a basketball article and I titled it &quot;My thoughts on Lebron James being the best basketball player ever&quot; and then I give some of his stats and conclude that he is, in fact, not the best basketball player ever.  You are the only person who has read that post and not picked up on that.  This is why I think you are fucking with me.  I lay out the official narrative and then I say that that doesn&#39;t make sense because if the official narrative was true then LHO would have acted totally differently than he did upon being arrested THEREFOR the official narrative does not seem to be true.  It is crystal clear what my post says and you are ignoring the end.  You keep acknowledging where I am laying out the official narrative version of him being a &quot;communist radical&quot; and then ignoring the end where I say that this doesn&#39;t hold true BASED ON HOW HE ACTED AFTER BEING ARRESTED.  You are either intentionally ignoring this or you truly don&#39;t get it which if that is the case then I dunno what to tell ya.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah cause you are just a barrel of laughs and jokes.  </p>

<p>What is happening here is that you think I am a shill.  You are drawing that conclusion and then working backwards to make the evidence fit the conclusion.  You need a break from the internet.  When I post something it is open forum for people to discuss.  Just because somebody gets upvoted for mocking the content of the post doesn&#39;t mean I need to swoop in and interrogate them (as seems to be your style).  I&#39;m not a nanny or a referee to jump in and control how the conversations go.  Everybody on here can handle themselves and I trust that they follow the rules of the sub and it&#39;s up to the moderators to intervene if anything gets out of line.  A lot of people commenting did discuss the mind control program and offered links to each other for more information about this sort of thing.  Again you are looking for things that agree with your conclusion (I&#39;m a shill intentionally posting propaganda) and ignoring the things that don&#39;t support that.  I assume this is also the same approach you take to your other conspiracy theories.  Only look at the stuff that supports your ideas and shout down everything that doesn&#39;t.  That isn&#39;t the way I operate.  I accept all information and if some of it proves me wrong, then I admit I&#39;m wrong.  You only see one side of every argument: your side.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who did I mock?  The person posted a comment about one of the comments in the yahoo article.  I mocked the yahoo article poster (the same way that the person commenting about her did) because she had no idea what she was talking about.  Again your lack of reading what actually happened has lead you to a false conclusion.  Plenty of people upvoted this post and the majority of the posts were people who realized that the only important part of the article were the claims of mind control.  Again, you are in the minority who misses the big picture because you are presupposing that I must be a shill because you are sad that I disagreed with you about something in the past so you flagged me.</p>

<p>How the hell am I supposed to be responsible for everything that everybody comments on one of my posts?  If nothing was accomplished just because somebody had a differing opinion and people attacked him.  What does any of that have to do with me?  I&#39;m not sitting there reading every comment on my article.  What am I supposed to be the NSA?</p>

<p>And as far as that article being propaganda, you are missing that what it really was was a main stream media article revealing that Tamerlan Tsarnaev claimed to be a victim of mind control.  That is the important part.  If Tamerlan was telling the truth that disproves the entire official narrative so the rest of the article wouldn&#39;t even matter.  </p>

<p>Now let me guess.  You had some other account(s) and people downvoted you a lot or maybe you got banned for ridiculous posts and that made you think &quot;oh man, there must be a bunch of shills attacking me because I&#39;m onto some real truths here!&quot; so you made up this account and are now on some crusade against the &quot;shills&quot; and trying to change the way business is done on this sub instead of just making a new sub and running it the way you think it should be run.  I mean, obviously this isn&#39;t your first account since it&#39;s only been active for 18 days.  How would 18 days even be long enough to think you know how the conspiracy sub should be.  You are constantly posting about how the purpose of this sub is not to debunk alternate theories etc.  It&#39;d take longer than 18 days to notice any real pattern of activity on here.</p>

Your abilities to theorize about conspiracies by posting an article from Yahoo News (of all places) where the author confirms and is apologetic to the official narrative (which you collaborated in driving traffic to that tripe) is somewhat, just a tad, lacking. The first comment you made also had no relevance to the article itself, rather you commented about a comment a user made about a comment a misinformed person made on the site. Holy. Fucking. Shit.

<p>You opened the door to that possibility by posting propaganda from a mainstream media site. <em>You</em> made that behavior possible. That&#39;s what you had to do with it. So much for looking at the &quot;big picture&quot;. Cause and effect. You left the troll door wide open and polluted the site with meaningless comments, of which the very first, most upvoted was nothing more than an attack.

I have double that and more link karma from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> alone in 18 <em>days.</em> I don&#39;t think you&#39;re here to contribute much.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And as far as that article being propaganda, you are missing that what it really was was a main stream media article <strong>revealing</strong> that Tamerlan Tsarnaev <strong>claimed</strong> to be a victim of mind control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait, so did the article it reveal anything, or did it just claim what a 67-year-old who claims attended a Boston mosque with Tamerlan told the Globe? Tamerlan didn&#39;t affirm anything. This was told by some guy we cannot confirm the identity of at all based on that article alone! </p>

<p>Are you paying attention, champ? This is what scrutiny and objective investigation looks like. Try to keep up.</p>

<p>The &quot;important&quot; part was all speculation and hearsay. It contained no verifiable information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Tamerlan was telling the truth that disproves the entire official narrative so the rest of the article wouldn&#39;t even matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How about you start looking for the truth instead of having Yahoo News spoon-feed it to you? Mainstream media is a last resource, not the first thing you consider when dealing with conspiracies.</p>

<p>What the fuck, man. Conspiracy theorist? You?</p>

<p>Now, do you think based on all the present information, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was responsible for the bombings based on this article?</p>

<p>Completely irrelevant. Upvotes are meaningless here considering the existence or puppet accounts of which you yourself accuse me of having. My negative karma count is a testament that I don&#39;t care if people &quot;agree&quot; with me. I choose to let the facts speak for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I guess I didn&#39;t realize that you were the authority of &quot;all things conspiracy.&quot; You should start your own sub (as I am now suggesting for the 5th time). But <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> already exists. Make it an invite only sub so that you only have your shills buddies. Hey, maybe only invite in people who don&#39;t question the narrative at all, the way you like it. This will be pretty fun cause then you&#39;ll have your little sub of all people who agree with you and nobody will ever downvote you or make you feel sad again. That&#39;ll show us all! </p>

<p>As far as how invested I am in this sub? I comment here and post here as often as I like. I have free will. I never once tried to suggest changes to the way legit <strong>people</strong> post, comment, or debate topics. </p>

<p>Whenever someone posts a link, that in and of itself is what the OP agrees with. If you want to debunk the article or understand what is claimed, you should question the author of the article, not the OP unless he is the author of that article. The OP is merely stating information he thinks deserves some attention. Mocking, criticizing, ridiculing and poking holes at the first opportunity adds nothing to the debate. The OP does not need to provide satisfaction, his opinion is already stated in the link he posted. Poke holes in the article, on the article if it has a comments section which most do nowadays. This should be an incentive to have you investigate yourself if you think the information presented is bunk. However, like I&#39;ve said over and over again, this should only begin to be done if you feel the official narrative is 100% bullet-proof.</p>

<p>When the media and government have 100% bullet-proof evidence and sound logic to back up their narrative they don&#39;t need to be afraid of people questioning them. I have changed my mind about a lot of things thanks to people sharing information with me and being willing to look at things critically. This requires hearing more than one side of the argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t need to create a sub.  I&#39;m not the one here with issues about how this sub is being handled.  I get along with most of the people I encounter here and even when we disagree about things it isn&#39;t ever taken personally.  You&#39;re the first person to really dig in on this idea that everybody who disagrees with you is a shill.  </p>

<p>For example, I don&#39;t think Oswald shot Kennedy, but somebody a while back made a post about how Jackie Kennedy actually shot Oswald and offerend links that allegedly show her ties to the CIA.  That is a claim that I think is patently absurd (as the Zapruder film shows - along with many other reasons) and therefore I commented on that post that it didn&#39;t really have much merit.  Now, this wasn&#39;t me endorsing the official narrative, but rather it was me disassociating my ideas about what happened from this whacko theory.  Ya, see there is a big difference between being a shill and being a person who wants legitimacy within the conspiracies being presented.  I don&#39;t believe the official narrative about 9/11 but when somebody makes a post saying no planes hit the buildings, they were holograms positioned perfectly to match the location and time of the explosions, I say that that is ridiculous because I don&#39;t want all 9/11 &quot;truthers&quot; to be lumped in with a nutjob idea.</p>

<p>Also if I am a shill I think I would be fired cause a majority of my posts are on cringepics, thewalkingdead, breakingbad, movies etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thinking most people who enter the conspiracy sub have <em>already</em>questioned the official narrative and are here for other information.

    <div class="md"><p>The shills do not serve to convince those that naturally question the narrative. They serve to ridicule them and show the newcomers it&#39;s not worth their time in order to stop the numbers from growing and creating more skeptics.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But a lot are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once here, you begin to question all of the information to find out what makes sense and what is just fantasy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then they reach a controversial front page post about a recent questionable news event and the comments are all ridicule, as proven by your Boston bomber article.</p>

<p>This drives newcomers away and makes them more dependent on official-narrative-parroting mass media because they slander conspiracy theorists as nutjobs, naturally confirming what the media says and the ridicule they observed here from the theorists. Against theorists. After that they will never question the media again. Mission fucking accomplished. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically nobody should post anything because it might get ridiculed?  And in your world somebody ridiculing something renders it instantly unbelievable and nobody will pay attention to it because somebody said it was stupid?  If you are very weak-minded and don&#39;t have courage of your convictions or evidence on your side then, yes, I could see how somebody calling you a name might make you change your mind.  I, however, don&#39;t care if somebody says something I think is stupid.  I post information that I think is worth sharing.  I don&#39;t monitor or censor the conversations that the post leads to (the same way that I don&#39;t ever downvote comments or posts because I don&#39;t want them to disappear.  People should be able to read them and decide for themselves).  People are free to believe what they want based on the information provided and their judgment.  Most of my friends in real life don&#39;t believe any of the shit I do about JFK, 9/11, USS Liberty, World Banking, Fed Reserve, etc.  That doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t friends or they are some sort of government gatekeeper.  It just means we don&#39;t agree about some shit.  You are taking things to some intense extreme where there are 2 types of people here:  People who believe ONLY the conspiracy theories, and shills.  There is a little more nuance to these sorts of topics than you are allowing for.</p>

<p>I give these theories the benefit of the doubt. <em>That&#39;s</em> critical thought. If I want to know the &quot;official&quot; version of events, I&#39;d stick to TV news or <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a></p>

<p>Critical thought is examining the information available and forming a conclusion consistent with all of the facts. You do not begin with a default stance on any particular theory. You do not give any idea the &#39;benefit of the doubt,&#39; you examine every new idea for flaws and toss those that don&#39;t hold up.</p>

<p>Finding flaws in official stories is the best and easiest way to open minds. <em>Proving</em> a particular conspiracy is impossible, because nobody has all of the information required to put the pieces together. It&#39;s better to find holes and let people think for themselves.</p>

<p>I agree with that, but debunking poorly thought out conspiracy theories is vital for two reasons. One, chasing false leads wastes time, and two, if we never question any conspiracy theory, no matter how incongruent it is with reality, we lose all credibility. Credibility is precious as it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Fucking finally</em>, I was getting impatient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Critical thought is examining the information available and forming a conclusion consistent with all of the facts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first information available does not come from conspiracy theorists. It comes from government sources and the media. Are BBC/Fox/NBC articles and government statements scrutinized to see if <em>they</em> are consistent first? People who begin to do that are the first marginalized.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You do not begin with a default stance on any particular theory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The government reports it through the actions taken by law enforcement (sandy hook for example) and the media embraces and reports on it. The mainstream media itself does no scrutinizing, they parrot government reports,  as do most of the people who&#39;d rather scrutinize OP rather then official sources.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You do not give any idea the &#39;benefit of the doubt&#39; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>People&#39;s opinions should always be considered. That is the primordial purpose of this sub. To hear what <em>the people</em> are saying. You <em>have</em> to give them the benefit of the doubt, otherwise what makes it different than the official narrative? Are you suggesting people don&#39;t have a right to their own opinions?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you examine every new idea for flaws and toss those that don&#39;t hold up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should always examine the &quot;established&quot; idea for flaws <strong>first</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finding flaws in official stories is the best and easiest way to open minds. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that is <em>not</em> what happens here most of the time. This is my point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Proving a particular conspiracy is impossible, because nobody has all of the information required to put the pieces together</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People shouldn&#39;t have to prove their theory is true, because that&#39;s all it is, a theory, &quot;because nobody has all of the information required to put the pieces together&quot;, otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be a conspiracy theory, it would be news.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s better to find holes and let people think for themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People who find holes in government stories and media sources are the first to be ridiculed and scrutinized. These kind of &quot;skeptics&quot; are not thinking for themselves, they use the official story as a base for their opinion. &quot;You say Lanza was not at the school?&quot; &quot;Well, kids were shot, police were there, as reported by THE NEWS.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I agree with that, but debunking poorly thought out conspiracy theories is vital</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said, if the official story doesn&#39;t hold up <em>first</em>, no scrutinizing of the conspiracy theory is needed, it becomes established fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One, chasing false leads wastes time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You only know it&#39;s false after you begin to chase it. You don&#39;t assume it&#39;s false and give up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>two, if we never question any conspiracy theory, no matter how incongruent it is with reality, we lose all credibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We already have no credibility, conspiracy theorist are borderline criminal according to the government and the media, but it is they who must be put to the test <em>by us</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Credibility is precious as it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we only get that by proving how the official narrative is horseshit, not attacking each other over who is more &quot;delusional&quot;, &quot;batshit crazy&quot;, or &quot;tin foil hat wearing conspiratards&quot;.</p>

<p>Discrediting ourselves is what makes us all those things.</p>

<p>I hope to <em>God</em> you get my point this time. It&#39;s like you all think in reverse!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called doing things away from the computer. But I&#39;ll play: I note that most of your theories rely on a rejection of science or other contradictory evidence. (The very heart of your message was an urge to resist evidence contrary to your conspiracy theory.) Likely there is nothing I can say to dissuade you from your beliefs. So I won&#39;t try, but I&#39;ll respond.</p>

<pre><code>Chemtrails. No. At least not most of them. You can actually get the flight info on an app and see what planes are leaving the trails. Many of the planes leaving trails are easily identifiable as public airlines. A Southwest 737 is simply not equipped for top secret spraying I think you&#39;ll agree, but you&#39;ll see the trail none-the-less. How do you explain that?

HAARP. No. Yes, the military has programs involving energy weapons. No HAARP is not one of them. It&#39;s too small and too well known. Probably a red herring.


Fukusmhima. No. If you mean an threat to some lives or alter human civilization, then possibly. If you mean a threat to end all human life on earth, no. There are many nooks and crannies on the rock. There is no getting rid of us that easily.


Comet ISON. No. Meaningless? As in it won&#39;t strike the earth, or as in you think it&#39;s a spaceship? Either way, no. I think it will pass safely.


Depopulation. Yes. Good. I support it. Where do I join the conspiracy? But I can&#39;t respond precisely unless you indicate who you believe is conspiring to depopulate the earth.


GMO/Monsanto: Yes, and no. Monsanto is bad for using the tool of GMO to monopolize the worlds food markets. However, genetic modification in itself is neutral.


Aspartame. No. Personally, I don&#39;t eat &#39;diet&#39; foods like aspartame, but I don&#39;t believe that is causes multiple sclerosis, lupus, etc. It&#39;s just crappy tasting.


Fluoride: No. Probably net good effect. I don&#39;t necessarily support it. I&#39;m generally against compulsory medication. But I do not believe all the negative claims about fluoride. It&#39;s not a communist plot, and it&#39;s not killing every one.


Vaccines: If I were sinister, I&#39;d support this conspiracy to thin out the herd. But no. I don&#39;t believe that vaccines cause autism, etc. Even though I have an issue with forced medication, there is a stronger argument for forced vaccines than for fluoridation.


Snowden: Good.

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;re a competent man of good character. We just disagree on a few things.</p>

<p>I posted no theories <em>at all</em>. I said either Yes, No, Good, or Bad to topics currently discussed on this sub. I did not elaborate on any of them. Those were my opinions that any skeptic should respect, as I respect yours. I&#39;m not debating any of your answers. Also, my answers were not a rejection of science. At all. 
That was a broad statement used to marginalize me. You should know better.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No. Again, my message was to <strong>reject the narrative before dismissing the theory.</strong> Stop seeing things where there are none. Critically think, man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, i can agree with this. Despite our past &quot;discussions&quot;, i like the point of this post. </p>

<p>However, for discussion purposes, i do see the legit purpose of asking for supporting information to alternative theories for the purpose of understanding what is claimed, as well as how the claim came to be, and to further the claim by adding supporting ideas, or even to identify holes in the alternative theories in a manner to fix said holes in order to stregthen said alternative theories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, partially. </p>

<p>This is where I disagree: The idea is to have people thinking critically. Whenever someone posts a link, that in and of itself is what the OP agrees with. If you want to debunk the article or understand what is claimed, you should question the author of the article, not the OP unless he is the author of that article. The OP is merely stating information he thinks deserves some attention. Mocking, criticizing, ridiculing and poking holes at the first opportunity adds nothing to the debate. The OP does not need to provide satisfaction, his opinion is already stated in the link he posted. Poke holes in the article, <em>on</em> the article if it has a comments section which most do nowadays. This should be an incentive to have you investigate yourself if you think the information presented is bunk. However, like I&#39;ve said over and over again, this should only begin to be done if you feel the official narrative is 100% bullet-proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is, it&#39;s a conspiracy most of the time, because little proof is there and there are 20+ contradictions provided by &#39;the news&#39;</p>

<p>I think most threads here should be split in half either ADDING to the article via other news articles, or experience (1st person or 3rd) or debating it using logic,reason,news items either U.S. or international</p>

<p>What I hope doesn&#39;t happen is if someone disagrees with the article being presented, that it&#39;s downvoted simply because one disagrees.</p>

<p>Downvotes are for vulgar,juvenile posts or totally off topic/rails type rants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Fucking finally</em>, I was getting impatient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Critical thought is examining the information available and forming a conclusion consistent with all of the facts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first information available does not come from conspiracy theorists. It comes from government sources and the media. Are BBC/Fox/NBC articles and government statements scrutinized to see if <em>they</em> are consistent first? People who begin to do that are the first marginalized.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You do not begin with a default stance on any particular theory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The government reports it through the actions taken by law enforcement (sandy hook for example) and the media embraces and reports on it. The mainstream media itself does no scrutinizing, they parrot government reports,  as do most of the people who&#39;d rather scrutinize OP rather then official sources.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You do not give any idea the &#39;benefit of the doubt&#39; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>People&#39;s opinions should always be considered. That is the primordial purpose of this sub. To hear what <em>the people</em> are saying. You <em>have</em> to give them the benefit of the doubt, otherwise what makes it different than the official narrative? Are you suggesting people don&#39;t have a right to their own opinions?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you examine every new idea for flaws and toss those that don&#39;t hold up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should always examine the &quot;established&quot; idea for flaws <strong>first</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finding flaws in official stories is the best and easiest way to open minds. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that is <em>not</em> what happens here most of the time. This is my point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Proving a particular conspiracy is impossible, because nobody has all of the information required to put the pieces together</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People shouldn&#39;t have to prove their theory is true, because that&#39;s all it is, a theory, &quot;because nobody has all of the information required to put the pieces together&quot;, otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be a conspiracy theory, it would be news.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s better to find holes and let people think for themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People who find holes in government stories and media sources are the first to be ridiculed and scrutinized. These kind of &quot;skeptics&quot; are not thinking for themselves, they use the official story as a base for their opinion. &quot;You say Lanza was not at the school?&quot; &quot;Well, kids were shot, police were there, as reported by THE NEWS.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I agree with that, but debunking poorly thought out conspiracy theories is vital</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said, if the official story doesn&#39;t hold up <em>first</em>, no scrutinizing of the conspiracy theory is needed, it becomes established fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One, chasing false leads wastes time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You only know it&#39;s false after you begin to chase it. You don&#39;t assume it&#39;s false and give up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>two, if we never question any conspiracy theory, no matter how incongruent it is with reality, we lose all credibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We already have no credibility, conspiracy theorist are borderline criminal according to the government and the media, but it is they who must be put to the test <em>by us</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Credibility is precious as it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we only get that by proving how the official narrative is horseshit, not attacking each other over who is more &quot;delusional&quot;, &quot;batshit crazy&quot;, or &quot;tin foil hat wearing conspiratards&quot;.</p>

<p>Discrediting ourselves is what makes us all those things.</p>

<p>I hope to <em>God</em> you get my point this time. It&#39;s like you all think in reverse!</p>

<p>The best part is that you actually think you were making good points and stunning me.</p>

<p>You failed miserably at proving the contrary. Your lack of rebuttals to my  dismateling of your nonsense is a clear proof of that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh man! Questioning my masculinity?!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, because I asked before if you were afraid to answer my questions and what did you say? <em>I could just as easily lie on every answer or just say what I think you want to hear.</em></p>

<p>You hinted at pleasing my ego. As much as I appreciated that, the fact the questionnaire remains blank, again, proves my point.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Do you know anything else other than make false claims? I&#39;m not even going to bother asking you to prove that. This is already pathetic enough as it is.</p>
