       The terms "Conspiracy Theorist" or "Conspiracy Theory" was invented by the CIA in the mid 1960's in order to silence people asking questions about the obvious JFK Assassination cover-up. As such, and by definition, there is no such thing as a "positive" Conspiracy Theory.

       No, it has been around since at least 1909 [per the OED], and has been recorded in use, with the current meaning, since 1870. Now, the more derogatory usage of it may have increased in the sixties, but claiming the term was "invented by the CIA" is completely unfounded.

       I am reminded of a lot of freemason stuff.  Supposedly the creation of a democracy and the American revolution were a "conspiracy" on their part.  They also had their own underground railroad during slavery times.

       If you believe the quotes by Rockefeller admitting to trying to create a world government with elites in control, he would probably believe this is for the greater good.  We're not good enough to run the world so they need to step in and save us from ourselves.

       Another one that I often think of is the UFO secrecy.  If they really exist and some governments have access to that technology, the conspiracy to keep it from the public may be a very positive one.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you have to do is think of what that technology would do in the hands of the worst elements of humans.  Imagine what North Korea would do with that tech.  A warlord in Africa.  A jewel thief.  An assassin. Sex trafficker. Being able to instantly transport anywhere on earth?  Cloak?  Go into outer space?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if the US government has been hiding this technology from the wider world it is most definitely a positive conspiracy.  And the fact that they haven't used it to take over the planet means they may in fact have positive intentions.

       See I have to disagree, if the US government did have this tech then the last thing I expect from them is to use it in a positive manner they can't even use drones in a positive way and that's tech that is available. Most likely if the US does have these techs than they are either testing them, trying to control/figure them out or for grueling out how to break it to the public without "aliens brought it here". IMO I would rather trust the Russians with alien tech than Americans because the US has a tendency on shoot first ask later.

       You should watch the video on YouTube by an exKGB agent who talks about how they use propaganda to turn the US population against their own nation.
      </p>

       Russia is just as bad or worse than the US on almost all fronts.  Had they our GDP and tax base they'd likely be much worse.  Considering how much havok the US could wreak in the world we're fairly constrained.

       I have no doubts in your statement the Russians are not by far any better than the US. The point I was trying to cross is the curent leader Putin, I have more faith in Putin than Obama espically considering recent events of The summer. I long for a life free of corruption in our governments escpically mine (I'm Canadian) but this will most likely not happen till my generation has absolutely no freedoms left and thus revolt In what I can hope to be a peaceful one at that. Domacracy is by far not the best system of government at least what they call "domacracy" the best system has yet to be found I plea that it will be found within my lifetime but this is doubtfull.

       I will admit that Putin does appear to be the adult in the world compared to Obama and many world leaders, which makes him even more dangerous.  We'll see how much he believes in Democracy when he has to step down.

       Well, conspiracy by definition means to secretly plan with others to commit a crime or harmful act, so by definition there cannot be positive conspiracy theories. I believe you are asking if there are any positive theories that most of the general public are unaware of. I believe there are! The theory of everything is a good start.

       There are numerous. Among them is the thinking that the "Illuminati" are actually acting in humankind's best interest, but must act in secret because of rival organizations and due to the general ignorance of the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same can be said about the Freemasons. They won the Rev. War, erected American democracy, built the Capital, structured the expansion west, etc, - mostly by secret plans.

       Another major conspiracy that could be considered benevolent (depending on your perspective) would be the run-up to the civil war, the war itself, and the abolition of slavery. I was astonished to see that even Spielberg, in his film "Lincoln" was largely honest in his portrayal of Lincoln's massive conspiracy to bribe, intimidate, and otherwise coerce the legislatures into capitulation. Lincoln was perhaps the most savage and dictatorial president. Nearly one million Americans were killed during his rule.

       I realize most conspiracy theories come from secrecy, and you're not going to be overt if you're up to no good. That said, is there a positive one? Maybe a person, or people, working behind the scenes to make life better for people and selflessness is their ultimate goal? I read a bit and I am really only seeing religion. I guess I'm not satisfied with that.

       Similar to Conspiracy Theories in that the knowledge of them is suppressed and made to look irrelevant:
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternative Histories and Philosophies that include a revision to certain 'official truths' that effect: rewriting the date of the first civilizations, origins of mankind, genetic manipulation, man's purpose etc ~ knowing our past will enlighten the path for a better future.  Check out Graham Hancock, Alan Watts, John Lamb Lash etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spirituality as a whole; from meditation to energetic exercises like Qi Gong, exploring one's consciousness through entheogens and opening the gates of perception.  You want First Contact?  Happened thousands a years ago when the jungle-shamans were exploring the stars from within.  No fancy rocketships or communication devices necessary.  You are the antenna to the universe.  Just turn on.  Check out Terence McKenna, Aldous Huxley, or DMT The Spirit Molecule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homeopathic Remedies and natural 'cures' along with other lifestyle modifications/choices (non-sedentary, proper diet, being secure in one's emotional state etc).  Check out Gary Null.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Sovereign Citizen" or "Freeman" concepts that plainly spell out the fictitious government we call THE UNITED SATES OF AMERICA (caps intended).  Check out Eustace Mullins etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Esoteric studies like; Sacred Geometry, Initiation into Hermetics by Franz Bardon, An Outline of Esoteric Science by Rudolph Steiner or other Western Divination Arts (Tarot, Numerology, Astrology/Astronomy, Kabalah, ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Many, many more positive conspiracy theories exist that can empower one to be a more authentic and healthy (emotionally, physically, spiritualy) being on planet Earth.

       The only ones I've heard of concern benevolent aliens. I don't put much stock in them, but to each their own. We need to find hope somewhere, I suppose, but I'd rather seek it out in whatever soul humanity has left- even though the looking can be tough.

       conspiracy simply means more than 2 people get together to act towards a common goal, in secrecy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, im sure there have been "good" conspiracies, i.e a group of people working on something that keep it secret until it is time for release..
      </p>
      <p>
       I think secrecy can be a good thing
       <em>
        if it is temporary

       It was good that we got in and stopped the oppression, yes.  Who knows where would we be today, or if you and I and everyone else born after the war would even exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, knowingly letting your own people get killed to step in is probably not the best way to go about joining the war.  Or dropping nuclear bombs on a country, killing thousands of innocent civilians in the blink of an eye, when it's reported that the Japanese were close to surrendering anyway, is not the best way to go about ending the war.  A lot of good came from the war itself, and the effects after the war, but:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) It's impossible to say the world would be in a worse place had Hitler managed to control Europe and Tojo and Hideki managed to control Eastern Asia.  It's literally imposisble.  We can come up with different scenarios, but until we develop time travel and inter-dimensional travel, it's impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) It's not as if the world we live in now is all sunshine and rainbows.

        knowingly letting your own people get killed to step in is probably not the best way to go about joining the war.

       Yea sure, but the country at the time would
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       have allowed for the war any other way. The isolationist movement was incredibly strong and gaining ground before Pearl Harbor.

      <p>
       Also I never mentioned the end of the war as being good or useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't think it's impossible to say things would be worse off if the Germans and Japanese had won. Their governments at the time were even worse than ours.

       Apparently not. I've defended this sub and it's members endlessly against the conspiritard crowd, but moments like this make yea really question that. How can anyone with half a brain think US involvement in WWII was bad for humanity??

       Why thank you but I have read quite enough.

       So the United States should have stayed out entirely? I don't understand how the people in this sub can pretend that WWII was unjustified.

       Lol. Maybe we could turn this into a good spy thriller. Get J. J. Abrams on the phone.

       Similar to Conspiracy Theories in that the knowledge of them is suppressed and made to look irrelevant:
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternative Histories and Philosophies that include a revision to certain 'official truths' that effect: rewriting the date of the first civilizations, origins of mankind, genetic manipulation, man's purpose etc ~ knowing our past will enlighten the path for a better future.  Check out Graham Hancock, Alan Watts, John Lamb Lash etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spirituality as a whole; from meditation to energetic exercises like Qi Gong, exploring one's consciousness through entheogens and opening the gates of perception.  You want First Contact?  Happened thousands a years ago when the jungle-shamans were exploring the stars from within.  No fancy rocketships or communication devices necessary.  You are the antenna to the universe.  Just turn on.  Check out Terence McKenna, Aldous Huxley, or DMT The Spirit Molecule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homeopathic Remedies and natural 'cures' along with other lifestyle modifications/choices (non-sedentary, proper diet, being secure in one's emotional state etc).  Check out Gary Null.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Sovereign Citizen" or "Freeman" concepts that plainly spell out the fictitious government we call THE UNITED SATES OF AMERICA (caps intended).  Check out Eustace Mullins etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Esoteric studies like; Sacred Geometry, Initiation into Hermetics by Franz Bardon, An Outline of Esoteric Science by Rudolph Steiner or other Western Divination Arts (Tarot, Numerology, Astrology/Astronomy, Kabalah, ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Many, many more positive conspiracy theories exist that can empower one to be a more authentic and healthy (emotionally, physically, spiritualy) being on planet Earth.
