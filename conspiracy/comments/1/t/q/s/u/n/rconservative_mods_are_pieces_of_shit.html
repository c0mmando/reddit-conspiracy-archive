        I didn't write that. This sub is supposed to be about conservatism, American conservatism at that, and there's nothing conservative about supporting a state that spies on us as well as takes our tax dollars to air strike Palestinians and surrounding countries.

       This was in response to one of their main commenters saying "DA JOOS" or some troll line like that to me, which was in response to me wondering why yesterday 3/10 top posts were about jerking off how noble and peaceful Israelis are and more stuff about Israel/Jewish people on Christmas in the American conservative sub (that type of concentration of topics doesn't happen, something was afoot).
      </p>

       I just needed a place to vent about this because I am pissed that you can't say anything implying that Israel commits wrong acts there.

       There's plenty of sources out there about this, but I'm lazy. Israel hires internet propagandists, along with the US and many other countries. I'm pretty sure they didn't forget about Reddit as an easy target.

       It's christian zionism. Basically, it's bible prophecy that Israel is created, that the world government gets set up there, anti-christ comes and runs it, WW-Apocalypse starts, then Jesus comes back and sets everything to rights. So, helping the plan along is doing God's work.

       Thank you. If I may butt in with a non sequitor: as a Christian, I get very annoyed when I am associated even remotely with the "Judeo" Christian construct. A) "Judeo Christian" is a contradiction in terms, as Judeo is diametrically opposed to Christian. There appears to be almost a conspiracy in how Christianity and Christians are portrayed in the media as being the yin to the Judeo yang- or, say, "buddies" with Jews. I believe this starts with the misconstruction of people assuming Jews use the Old Testament. They do not, they are Talmudists. Jews and Christians are about as related as say, Muslims and Jews. Oh how deluded are the zionists. In fact, Jesus himself stated that Jews are of the synagogue of Satan.

       I love when Israel supporters say that Israel hasn't stolen any land and that it's just their consolation prize from the Six-day War. It's even funnier when they call Palestinian's squatters. Oh, and don't even dare say anything critical of the nation-state of Israel because that means you hate all Jewish people and you're a Nazi sympathizer.

       You still have not (nor have the mods) cited a reason for my banning aside from making a comment that isn't pro-Zionist.

       Most people support Israel there? It will seem that way if anyone who says a word against Israel is banned.

       I don't care why you were banned. I'm just saying your reasoning is wrong. And I haven't seen anyone get banned for "anti-Israeli" statements. In fact, I'm sure I've made some before. I don't praise Israel blindly.

       When you say conservatism, do you mean conservatism within the context of the left-right paradigm, or conservatism as a stand alone construct where the left-right ideas don't apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just genuinely curious as to why you were participating on that sub.  I used to consider myself a conservative, but now realize I was just part of the problem, the problem being we live in a corporate-oligarchy more than the representative republic I thought we lived in.

       Even then you really can't.  The sources of death counts can be debated, and put into question quite easily.  If you can debate the nutritional value of wheat you can debate the necessity of nearly anything.  Same with the moon landing or the birth place of a president.

       From what you are saying (a link to the thread would be still appreciated), the people you are talking about are not simple Conservatives, they obviously belong to the Zionist association.

       Sorry dude, it was a link to a thread where pople are cheering each other, that's it. Not the link to the thread from your OP. We need evidences. People talking about Christmas and Jews means nothing about what you are claiming.

       You still have not (nor have the mods) cited a reason for my banning aside from making a comment that isn't pro-Zionist.

       Most people support Israel there? It will seem that way if anyone who says a word against Israel is banned.
