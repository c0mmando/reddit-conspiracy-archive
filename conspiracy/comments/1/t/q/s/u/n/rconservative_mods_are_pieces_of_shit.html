<p>I didn&#39;t write that. This sub is supposed to be about conservatism, American conservatism at that, and there&#39;s nothing conservative about supporting a state that spies on us as well as takes our tax dollars to air strike Palestinians and surrounding countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was in response to one of their main commenters saying &quot;DA JOOS&quot; or some troll line like that to me, which was in response to me wondering why yesterday 3/10 top posts were about jerking off how noble and peaceful Israelis are and more stuff about Israel/Jewish people on Christmas in the American conservative sub (that type of concentration of topics doesn&#39;t happen, something was afoot).</p>

<p>I just needed a place to vent about this because I am pissed that you can&#39;t say anything implying that Israel commits wrong acts there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. If I may butt in with a non sequitor: as a Christian, I get very annoyed when I am associated even remotely with the &quot;Judeo&quot; Christian construct. A) &quot;Judeo Christian&quot; is a contradiction in terms, as Judeo is diametrically opposed to Christian. There appears to be almost a conspiracy in how Christianity and Christians are portrayed in the media as being the yin to the Judeo yang- or, say, &quot;buddies&quot; with Jews. I believe this starts with the misconstruction of people assuming Jews use the Old Testament. They do not, they are Talmudists. Jews and Christians are about as related as say, Muslims and Jews. Oh how deluded are the zionists. In fact, Jesus himself stated that Jews are of the synagogue of Satan. </p>
