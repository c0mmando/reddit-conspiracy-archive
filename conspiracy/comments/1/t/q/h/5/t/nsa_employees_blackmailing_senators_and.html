<p>the NSA gathered information on barack obama since 2004.</p>

<p>if any of you remember, the rumours of barack obama not being born in america were circulated heavily when he was first elected. the media and political parties would simply tell you that people only thought that because they were racist.</p>

<p>but what if they werent? not all of them i mean. what if the NSA had investigated barack obama and found proof that he was born overseas? some NSA employees family would have talked, and it would have spread like wildfire among republicans. the NSA dropping proof of such a thing would immediately end his career. with that information, it may have even been possible to blackmail him into doing exactly what he was told.</p>

<p>I.E. the backflip on spying issues;</p>

<p>there is every reason to beleive that the NSA has dirt on every senator and congressman.</p>

<p>they could be blackmailing journalists and religious leaders, the leaders of other nations, large numbers of elected officials in foreign nations, even key players in the entertainment industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably not. This subreddit loves Occams Razor which would make the simplest explanation that they aren&#39;t doing that.</p>

<p>Yet this subreddit doesn&#39;t understand Occams Razor so I guess I&#39;ll just get down votes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Occams Razor does apply.  Why would Obama after preaching change radically shift his agenda.  My answer IAW OR is he is being blackmailed.  Hoover did it, why not some one else with even greater information sources than Hoover could ever hope for.  Obama may even be fighting back, as best he can given the fact that he has pissed off both the Israeli&#39;s and Saudi&#39;s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. Maybe not precisely that he wasn&#39;t born in the US. The subject of the blackmail itself isn&#39;t as important to the point being made with Occam&#39;s Razor.</p>

<p>Rather, you go from a guy who essentially says that he wants <em>transparency, change, accountability</em> etc. to someone who is blindly agreeing with every illegal act the NSA does.</p>

<p>Occam&#39;s Razor says that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one.</p>

<p>The simplest explanation (given evidence that NSA surveilled <em>Senator Obama</em> extensively) for this complete change in behavior and ideals is that they are blackmailing him.</p>

<p>Therefore Occam&#39;s Razor states that blackmail is likely the correct conclusion. QED!</p>

<p>(That said, I don&#39;t necessarily think the subject of the blackmail is related to his status as a US citizen. Who knows).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would venture to say that using Occam&#39;s Razor would imply that the reason for the downvotes is your condescending attitude.</p>

<p>It&#39;s okay to be skeptical, as a matter of fact I&#39;m fairly skeptical about a number of things. and I often make fun of posters here over at <a href="/r/conspiratard/">/r/conspiratard/</a> ...which would be the proper venue for doing this, assuming you&#39;re not just a troll.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious, was a pervasive multi-faceted NSA surveillance regime a conspiracy before Snowden started his leaks? Is it still a conspiracy? Because I would venture to say that, had there been no Snowden, you would be here parroting what you googled from some skeptic web site...</p>

<p>...from your other posts, it seems obvious that you are young, and don&#39;t have too much real world experience, you probably still think Ayn Rand was brilliant, possibly joined an Objectivist club at school, and you also probably have a skewed view of how corporations and government really work. Now I don&#39;t know how this got on the topic of Obama being blackmailed, I find that fairly far fetched, however, the idea that an unpopular senator would be blackmailed, is not.</p>
