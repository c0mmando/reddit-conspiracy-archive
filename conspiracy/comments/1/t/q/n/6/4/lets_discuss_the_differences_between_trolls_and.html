       I don't really care about drama, or OT other threads. As long as the posters are posting it in their own threads, without disturbing other posters, who are obviously willing to discuss serious matters in their own threads, without being annoyed by mindless spam.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the main problem here is, like on many othert forums, is the impossibility for many to understand what exactly a real troll is. There is really a big difference between people posting bullshit only in their own threads, and real trolls spamming other serious threads too.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as somebody is willing to talk about OT in his own thread, is not really a problem for anybody, because we can simply skip it, and there is still the right of freedom of speech. The real problem is when assholes start spamming somebody elses threads with bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This board, as many others is mainly based on personal knowledge and deductive skills, as the intellectual capacity to detect and elaborate on conspiracy theories based on facts and personal knowledge, or by using serious sources. It is understood that anybody making implausible claims or denying something plausible here, must be ignorant and unble to tell right from wrong, or just an obvious saboteur.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the spammers of other threads must be cenzored / banned, this is mandatory.

       I am not annoyed by this thread, because if I don't like it, I can simply skip it, and contionue with my own business in other threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am talking about is denigratory remarks or even long posts only full of ignorant bullshit that cannot disprorve the OP, but are only aimed at spamming the thread. I am sure you must have the average intelectual capacity to understand when this happens by yourslef, if you are really interested in conspiracies, and are not only posting here for amusement.

       Anyway here is just one example of serious thread being spammed by pointless remarks and long bullshit post:

       Sorry, dude. I gotta disagree with you here. That second link, the one about the doctors, there were no trolls there, man. What you ran into was someone who disagreed with you and presented their own (and opposing) view on the matter. Thats not a troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       A troll doesnt offer you the priviledge of informed opinion, and it turned out that that one commenter you responded to about his long post "without facts" was actually a well informed statement. He may not have provided sources or credible information, but then you couldve asked him to do so. It turns out that the ligititory society we live in, one which anyone will sue anyone for anything, doctors have to watch their own ass. Many of his other points he was trying to relay to you were actually valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, maybe he didnt address the part where the discussion was intended to be a speculative discussion on the possibility of it being a conspiracy, but even then, he offered you his opinion on the matter, which was in opposition to yours, and you immediately called him a troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost as bad as trolls are people flinging the term "troll" or even "shill" at people who are just disagreeing. Whats the purpose of discussion if your only interested in ideas that align with your own? Thats just confirmation, not real discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Id suggest holstering your "troll" gun until you at least try to get a poster who disagrees with you to clarify themselves further.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though some of the other comments were rude, they wouldnt qualify as a troll comment, as they posted once and were gone.

       Sorry dude, I don't think you are using the correct terminolgy for describing what you are talking about. All the posts were only pointless denigratory remarks, or mindless rants. With no proof or rational explanation. You really should know the difference between bitching mindlessly against each other, as only religious fanatics do, and seriously debating about the OP, by using constructive dialogue based on facts and arguments.

       I was referring to this guys comment and your immediate response thereafter. You accused him of intelligable rambling when he presented you with information amd reasoning for an idea that opposes your theory. he wasnt wrong, though he might have been able to be less abrasive in his delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
       You then ended your response by basically calling him a troll, which he was most definately not being a troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was offering constructive disccusion based on facts, where you failed to ask him for sources for his claims. Nothing in that guys comment was representative of a troll, and you resorted to emotional backlash that was unwarranted.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldve served you better to redirect the conversation at that point towards this being just a theory based on your links and sources and personal opinions rather than resorting to relating his opposing views to religious fanaticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, the definition of "denigratory" is:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        harmful and often untrue; tending to discredit or malign.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nothing in his post was harmful. What im trying to say, is he was just disagreeing with you. That happens in discussions and should be accepted with an open mind. If you dont believe his facts then you can always ask him for sources.

       Sorry dude, I repeat, your linguistic knowledge is failing you, there was no information, as links or facts in his post, and he was not reasoning, he was only spamming my thread by ramblings about my fully developed OP, based on facts and rational deductions.

       He was not disagreing, all he  was saying that doctors do not murder their unaware patients, because he likes believing it this way, which is not my concern, because my facts are proving the opposite. THios is acceptable only on forums like r/religion, when people bitch about something based on beliefs, not scientofical / factual evidences.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if you are just an alt account, or just an unaware kid who is experinecing difficulties with definitions because of lack of experience in debating, or just an adult who is ignorant or unapable of telling right from wrong apart, because mentally impaired.

        They spend most of their lives training to become doctors.

       i already admitted that i agree he did not present links or sources of any kind. But then again, you didnt ask him to present these sources before you accused him of being a troll. This is what i was bringing to your attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       My linguistic knowledge shouldnt be the topic in question. Your intentions, however, are starting to look questionable as you dont ask people for sources when they disagree with you and you immediately resort to emotional slander.
      </p>
      <p>
       the point is, this guy disagreed with you and provided the reasons why he disagreed with your OP. You then replied to him quite immaturely while deviating from the discussion your own OP was supposed to incite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like ive said previously, why ask for a discussion if you arent willing to even attempt to understand the opposing ideas or views?

       So you are saying you dont believe that doctors go through tough education to become doctors is a fact? Or that doctors must make sure to cover their ass lest they become sued for malpractice? Your saying those are not facts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to be clear, merriam-webster happens to agree with me on the definition of "fact" as:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        something that truly exists or happens
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Those phrases you call vague can only be interpreted that way if the one interpreting fails to comprehend its meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       He opposed your theory with his statements. He did so just fine. That doesnt mean your theory is wrong or baseless. I actually found it interesting. The issue here is that you seem to fail to understand the difference between disagreeing and trolling. That was the purpose of my comments this entire time.

       There we go. Now we are getting somewhere. Now that you cleared that up i can agree with that. Nothing he wrote directly refuted the facts you presented in the OP of that thread. What he did present, though, was relevant information that could explain the results of the facts you presented.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wanted to bring it to your attention, that it woukdve been much more constructive had you tried and discussed the matter with him, rather than resorting to calling him a troll and making a post complaining about trolls referencing that transaction with him.

       No. Because he is clearly uncable to make coherent arguments or counter arguments based on facts. He looks like another kid from around here who is only able to post raw links, and waiting for someone to start a discussion. I don't know / care why.

       If it is the kind of low IQ you are enjoying, I suggest you to talk with him, not with me. I really have no time in explaining obvious matters regarding basic knowledge or understanding about how to communicate betwen conscient adults.

       The title of your post literally invites discussion on the difference between trolls and the right of free speech. What i am trying to illustrate to you is that his comments were not at all like those of trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why wouldnt you have time to take part in a discussion in which you yourself called for? For someone who tacitly claims to be superior in the rules of engagement in terms of debate, this seems quite ironic and a bit counterintuitive.

       So you resort to calling me a troll because i am engaging you to take part in a discussion of which you yourself called for? Or are you implying that your own answers are bullshit and therefore you are the troll? The latter would make more sense, as i fail to understand why you continue to avoid the relevant discussion and go back to your typical reply of "the answer was vague and he was incapable of debate."
      </p>
      <p>
       Like i said, the title of this post calls for the discussion to discern the difference between a troll and a redditor practicing his right to free speech. I have repeatedly presented the case that this redditor in question is in fact not trolling and just practicing his right to free speech, while you continue to dodge the very discussion you yourself called for, and you repeatedly resist to elaborate your stance and resort to discrediting others intelligence without specifying exactly why you feel that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its ironic, because the very thing you claim others to be shares the same traits in which you are portraying via your own comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe i had mistaken you for an honest individual who actually wanted to partake in discussion? In that case, i yield.

       You know what? I will refrain from posting Conspiracy Theories here in future. It is evident that the majority of people on this forum are only capable to post links and to exclaim "Wow, it is a Conspiracy!", only because they managed to fiind a link on a cospiracy site.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are completely uncapable of own free thinking, because obviously are somehow deprived of deductive skills. "Always question yourself and everything around" is just an abstract quote here aropund. They are involved in mindless bitching with stupid trolls, believing them being intelligent posters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will do the same that makes the intelligent minority, just reading links provided here, which are the only skills required here, and making my own deductions by my own. Sheeple will die as sheeple, no matter where or how. But dying because unaware is just disgusting.

       That's right, I want the right of free speech being policed for every real poster of r/Conspiracy from being disturbed by obviuous trolls, because it is the topic of our choice, not of trolls. But you are another one who likes just bitching about topics, still being unable to use rationality. I think your skills are better suited for r/religion

       You don't really understand what "the right of free speech" really means, and that I am not talking about rules, but how rules must be written in order to be able to defend the user's right of free speech. If you want trolls, you are free to go to any trolling based subreddit.

       Unsubstantiated claims are all some of r  conspiracy posters have.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want non conspiracy posts banned, fine. Most of us give them the down vote and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a few weeks recently r conspiracy was flooded with the "your daily dose of outrage" bits, anti police, anti-public schools, general anti-government bs that is always featured by Yahoo news,AP Fox, wnd, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       We (r conspiracy users),  down voted and bitched, it has slowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banning and censoring  is such a loser game, use only for the kind of dangerous types who make threats and attack other users with revolting and demeaning language.

       Are you saying that you like your reasonable posts being downvoted and spammed by trolls that don't care about the OP, but only annoying you?
