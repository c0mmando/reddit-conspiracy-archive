        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s sorta like how 80% of people believe they are above average intelligence. It does us as a society no good to walk around assuming that 8/10 people are just useless stupid twats. The truth is that most people are actually like you, reasonably intelligent with a decent grasp of the world around them. Unfortunately these people are what are called the silent majority. It is an absolute lazy cop-out to just assume that most other people are stupid idiots. It takes any responsibility off of yourself because, &quot;What are you supposed to do when everyone else is an idiot?&quot;</p>

<p>If people started looking at at each other as true equals instead of 80% of people thinking they are better than most, then maybe we would start to move to make some improvements around here. But you guys are all fucking morons so that will never happen ;)</p>

<p>Edit: I would also like to add that this motif is perpetuated in the Customer/Employee relationship. An employee complains all day about how stupid the fucking customers are, then gets off work and goes to a store where he complains about how stupid the fucking employees are.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Wow, every comment except one or two has completely proved the point of my post. Everyone seems to think that the majority of everyone else is a dumb ass, but somehow they fit into the minority of intelligent people. Kinda funny how 95% of the comments here are saying that about 80% of all other people are stupid. Something has to give.</p>

<p>Also I am seeing a theme of people mistaking the loud minority as a majority as well as basing their opinions off of anecdotal evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people forget that we&#39;re all stupid in one way or another. I think a majority of Americans -- in one aspect of their life or another -- recognize the overreach of the current system, the pain it causes them, and how it limits them. Whether they have the same context that you do is another thing all together. We&#39;re all on here complaining but what are we doing? We&#39;re all ignorant of how to act in this point in time and quite a few of us are convinced that there&#39;s nothing we can do or that it&#39;s too out of control. </p>

<p>If we&#39;re all so concerned with how uneducated people are we need to do something about it. If you think that time is too short for that sort of thing, then: What do?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say people are generally dumb. That being said, I would also say people are generally good too.  I think the idea of caring for ones own before caring for those around you has been perpetuated by the media.  When was the last time you opened up a newspaper of flipped on the news and there was anything but BAD news? Once in a purple moon I&#39;d venture to guess.  This has caused a shift from generally good to generally selfish people.  This has made it harder and harder for any sort of massive social movement like we had during the 70&#39;s &quot;free love&quot; era.  One would guess that this has been by design, dividing us at the personal level, not just at the racial level, or even by social class.  Just a week ago I saw a woman run over another for a doll. A damned Barbie is enough to set us against each other.  A promotion is enough to put two normally friendly coworkers at each other&#39;s throats.  A gun is enough to divide a country in two.  </p>

<p>If divide and conquer is the strategy of TPTB (if they do in fact exist; and are not merely an excuse for each of our moral shortcomings) then they have already won.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most are very &quot;stupid&quot; may I call them sheep. Majority have no idea that their entire world is structured to kill them. Some are intelligent enough to have a inclination that somethings afoot but really don&#39;t have a clear picture.

Now how the media portrays us in general is how they want, violence, murder, immorality in every form. To degrade us down into a impoverished state. Of course they portray us as stupid. They think that (and is more than likely the case) the majority have no clue that they have something up their sleeve.

<p>As a person who does not watch TV, hardly reads any news, and simply observes and interacts with people, I really disagree with you.</p>

<p>At least in my limited experience and pool of people I&#39;ve interacted with, I can say that most are exactly like the &quot;Myth&quot; you stated.  Of those 80%, about 100% of them think they <em>are intelligent</em>, which perpetuates them being stupid as they feel no need to better or improve themselves.</p>

<p>Another problem I see is that good people, are too polite to call them on their bullshit, and they get away with their lies, and never get challenged on their ignorance - which perpetuates it further. </p>

<p>If you work in retail, the easiest way to spot the difference between a dumb person and an intelligent one when asking questions is their reaction to your answer.  </p>

<p>&quot;Where would I find.... windows software?&quot; <em>Near the big sign that says software</em></p>

<p>Dumb Person Response:  &quot;Oh, thanks&quot;
Smart Person Response:  <em>Embarassed</em> &quot;....Right in front of my face, geez.  Thanks&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit. Well, thank you sir. You are correct. But all of us on here did not receive proper education. We all went through the process of unlearning. We cannot call everyone dumb and rather than wasting time on only identifying the causes, how about we come up with antidotes? </p>

<p>What was different about us all? Did we all grow up in privileged environments? Were we upper middle class? White? Were our parents crack addicts? Were our brothers arsonists?</p>

<p>Come on, man. This <em>isn&#39;t</em> what&#39;s important. What to do about it is more so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve talked to a lot of people on the internet and off, about current issues and world events, and the &quot;moron quotient&quot; is high.  Rejection of anything that doesn&#39;t fit their worldview, refusal to do even a simple Google search or look at Wikipedia to read up on some facts or an opposing view, inability to reason logically, immediate resort to personal attack when you disagree with them.  I don&#39;t know about 80%, but it&#39;s bad out there (in here, too).</p>
