    <div class="md"><p>One of the big things that is eroding rights is the role of global warming. See that the <em>IPCC</em> have year after year put out completely debunked predictions of doom and gloom as a consequence of Greenhouse gases (frex: CO2 some of which is man-made but also methane which is natural and also nitrogen compounds, <strong>not</strong> N2 which is of course the main component of current atmosphere). the way this is being done is through taxes and regulations on the environment which is supported by dubious science at the best and can be logical disproven in a manner of ways. Also there is an extremley strong trend of science that is self interested have a look at <em>pay-walled</em> journals largely owned by a small group of companies there is about as much freedom in the academic world as there is in the mainstream press tv radio etc. When people say there is a scientific consesus you need to look very closely at which consesus they are talking about!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I am aware, no religious texts tell their followers to shun on deny anything from homosexuals. They may say things along the lines of &#39;they are an abomination,&#39; but never have I seen our heard of any religious teachings that outright tell you to treat them any differently than anyone else. You would think these religions who supposedly are based on love would be more accepting.
Even if homosexuality is considered wrong by a religion, wouldn&#39;t you be living a life closer to the basic ideology of said religion by fully accepting others and possibly teaching them instead of meeting people who do not fit the religion&#39;s &#39;mold&#39; with scorn, anger, and disgust.</p>

Personally I don&#39;t see how they could, in good conscious, do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the lumber scenario, if the KKK/white power members wanted to buy lumber I doubt they would give their business to a black owned business.
Though I absolutely see your point (which was a good one), I only worry that religious freedoms can be taken to far (in my opinion); for example there was a post recently in r/atheism about Muslims who work at a restaurant of some sort who refuse to sell customers beef/alcohol. If the establishment has a religious base/owners then I have no problem with denial of service based on religion. But if consumption of beef or alcohol is against your religious beliefs AND you work at a burger bar then you may want to look for another job rather than deny service to patrons who obviously do not share your beliefs. Hopefully this came out semi-intelligible. </p>

<p>To be perfectly honest with you, I&#39;m sure there are a lot of bakeries in Denver.   To me, the story I linked sounds more like a group of people bullying someone based on their religious beliefs than anything.  The fucked up part is the court upheld it.</p>

<p>I am religious (Muslim), but that&#39;s not really here nor there.  Fact is  the constitution grants him freedom to practice religion, bigotry and whatever aside, its this bakers right.</p>

<p>Let me think of a good analogy that fits here....</p>

<p>You have the right to bear arms, my dad was killed by a gun.  So I&#39;m gonna fight you tooth and nail to take your weapon from you, (not the best analogy, but hopefully it gets the point across.)</p>

<p>Read your bill of rights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1st amendment.</p>

<p>Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Petition</p>

<p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or <strong>prohibiting the free exercise</strong> thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people        peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does <strong>Exercise</strong> mean to you?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where in the bible does it say</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m Muslim, so  I can&#39;t quote the bible to you , but i can quote the Quran</p>

<p>Al-Maaidah verse 90: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;O Ye who believe! Intoxicants and Gambling, Sacrificing to Stones, and (divination by) Arrows, are an abomination, of Satan&#39;s handiwork; <strong>Keep away from such</strong>, that Ye may prosper.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as far as homosexuality being haram or halal ( forbidden or permissible )</p>

<p>(Qur&#39;an 27:55-58)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would ye really approach men in your lusts rather than women? Nay, ye are a people (grossly) ignorant! </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(before i go past this, let me point out the bible denies homosexulity as well).</em></p>

<p><em>..Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders. (1 Corinthians 6:9)</em></p>

<p>So there you go.</p>

<p>I brought proofs,</p>

<p>Maybe you can bring some next time instead of 20 down votes or <strong>just flat out ignorance of the law</strong> and the holy scriptures</p>
