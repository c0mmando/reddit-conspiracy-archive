       There is this book, The World War Deception, it is well written and explains that the two last World Wars were concieved by the jewish world wide conspiracy. Basically it says that the jews are behind military conflicts or revolutions around the world, and that because of this conspiracy unaware people were forced to fight each other.

       Do people really think Hitler was the only racist leader in that era? Turns out people care more about Jews than Roma, Croats, native Americans, Canadian aboriginals, African Americans, Japanese Americans, Chinese and pretty much anyone else who's not white.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're gonna talk about the culture of WWII make sure you remember the cultural context. Every major country committed unspeakable atrocities at this time. It wasn't a white vs black war. Everyone were shades of grey, Hitler just went a little to dark.

       A little too dark....right.
       <br/>
       Croats?   They were doing their damnedest to butcher everyone in their midst.  You can name who you want but Jews and Roma were put to death on a manufacturing line.  And then someone has the gall to say they conspired to make it happen?  That is laughable.

       starvation &amp; disease due to bombed supply lines, bombed infrastructure and deserting guards does not equal gas chambers. you think the people in those disgusting photos and newsreels were jews? what about the roma? the homosexuals? the disabled? the mentally ill? etcetera

       David Cole: the guy who said there's "No evidence" of gas chambers. The guy whose party line is/was "Let's get drunk." What, is it because he's a Jew does that make his testimony trump all evidence (despite, y'know, not having anything to do with the Holocaust personally)?

       , right (every world a new link, for non-RES). Or were those all built post-war for show, and the universally-repeated survivor's story about how women, children, and the infirm were given "showers" were an orchestrated coverup? They installed the

       No, I'm not saying the people in those newsreels are just Jews - but the majority are, given 6 of the 11 million killed were Jews (followed by the 3 million Russian POWs/civs, then other groups).

       Except the "ghetto Jews" were largely affluent members of society from every walk of life, from tradesmen to bankers - part of the justification of the Nazi hatred against the Jews (or at least, some tinder for the fire) was that Jewish communities fared well during the Depression due to cultural financial habits and, given the slightest excuse, the poor can be manipulated to hate their better-off comrades.

       I have to disagree on the side of "ghetto jews" being respected by the "upper jews". In Krakow you have very good examples, where there was quite a division between these two castes, not very dissimilar to the 18th century nobility posture.

       The thing is, the "ghetto" was
       <em>
        Nazi concept.
       </em>
       The Jews were moved from around the city and, to a greater extent, country into small, isolated communities prior to the widescale adoption of the concentration camps. "Ghettos" didn't exist - not, at least, in the sense of a tight-packed minority community living in poverty-level conditions that the

       In other words, the whole "ghetto Jew" vs "upper Jew" rivalry
       <em>
        didn't exist
       </em>
       because the two groups consisted of the
       <em>

       The concept of jewish Ghetto precedes Nazism by a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ghettos_in_Europe">
        long shot
       </a>
       . Where did you get your revisionist history?

      <p>
       Here is an example:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         In 1555
        </strong>
        , Pope Paul IV issued papal bull Cum nimis absurdum which created the Roman Ghetto, forcing Jews of Rome to live in a part of the rione Sant'Angelo of Rome. The area of Rome chosen for the ghetto was the most undesirable quarter of the city, owing to constant flooding by the Tiber River. At the time of its founding, the four-block area was designated to contain roughly 1,000 inhabitants. However, over the years, the Jewish community grew, which caused severe overcrowding. Since the area could not expand horizontally (the ghetto was surrounded by high walls), the Jews built vertical additions to their houses, which blocked the sun from reaching the already dank and narrow streets.
        <strong>
         Life in the Roman Ghetto was one of crushing poverty, due to the severe restrictions placed upon the professions that Jews were allowed to perform.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Roman Ghetto was the
        <strong>
         last of the original ghettos to be abolished in Western Europe; not until 1882
        </strong>
        , when the Kingdom of Italy conquered Rome from the Pope, was the Ghetto finally opened, with the walls themselves being torn down in 1888.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think you should educate yourself a little bit before making such uncorrect claims. How can you even be so upvoted is beyond me. Poland was somewhere of an exception, since Jews had quite some freedom compared to any other European country. Districs were assigned to them, and just like with Venice merchants/nobles and the rest of the venetians rabble, there was quite a difference between Jewish districts, and the upper classes of Jew would treat the "lesser" jews quite like a 18th century noble would treat a peasant.

       Okay, correction: the concept of herding your enemies into singular communities was
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       invented by the Nazis. However, those kind of communities did not exist en masse in Europe
       <em>
        at the time.
       </em>
       Your own source cites how the last of the Catholic-enforced ghettos was abolished more than half a century before the Nazis!
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, the Nazis reinstituted a practice that had largely gone out of use and been negated by the dissemination of Jews throughout the rest of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that there was no ghetto vs 1% going on, as you insinuated - that's like claiming that the blueblood vs new arrival prejudice from 1900s Irish communities was influential in the police behavior in the Boston Bombings.

       I am attacking this argument:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Except the "ghetto Jews" were largely affluent members of society from every walk of life, from tradesmen to bankers
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Giving Krakow as an example: there were huge synagogues where only the "upper" Jews could enter, the "lesser" ones could not, even if they were living just a few blocks away. The "ghetto" Jews had the usual shitty life, not so different from the common peasant. Your assertion that they were all affluent members of society from every walk of life, and that there was no separation between the "lesser" Jews and the "upper" Jews is not true. The following statement is also not true, also demonstrated by my simple example:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The point is that there was no ghetto vs 1% going on, as you insinuated
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now, if you are talking about how the affluent Jewish families from the past, such as the Rothschild, see the rabble right now, it is difficult to say, since they give very few interviews. Aside from the black sheep, Nat, the rest married with nobles or key families from the second industrial revolution, so it should give you an idea.

       "Revisionist history" is just that- revisionist. It's disagreeing with the consensus of actual learnèd historians for the sake of being contrarian. Historians agree that the Civil War was caused by slavery, because it was. And they agree that eleven million people were killed in extermination camps by the Nazis because it happened.
      </p>

       It's not ignorant to accept the opinions of the consensus of experts. It's ignorant to think you know better than they do.

       He was being arrogant and sarcastic, there is no reason to waste time with people like that. And there are among us people who will never wake up, awakening happens without any effort from the community. One is presented with information and depending upon how far the person's self delusion has spread it is possible to suddenly see the world entirely a new.

       There are various context for awakening, its a broad term, you have the spiritual awakening in mind when I'm talking about a different awakening.

       Well, zionists don't really care about other people, even other Jews who are not zionists. They consider other people just as expendable slaves. It does make sense actually.

       Actually, despite your sarcasm, it
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       make perfect sense. You have remember that the Zionists hate the common Jewish person just as they hate everyone else. So it was arranged for the "Holocaust" to go down in order to gain a huge political and economic advantage after the war. Now you might think "But that is Illogical". And you would be correct. But. The Zionists are not logical. They are barbaric.

       "The Jews" are a much larger collective than "Jewish people in charge of the Zionist Cabal." You do realize that. Don't you?  There are about 14 to 18 million Jews in the world. How many would you say control the Zionist Cabal? How many would you say have attended a telephone conversation, an in-person meeting, or assembled in any way whatsoever during which the Zionist Cabal made a political decision? How many would you say have as much power and influence as you?

       I dont know if this makes much sense to be honest. I think that zionism has had a far reaching implications for geopolitics in the 20th century and probably caused a backlash that may have "stoked the fires" of the wars but largely the wars were a result of German Nationalism that was co opted by industrialists.

       There's a lot of interesting info from this perspective on WWII.  Particularly how Germany starting a two front war makes no sense...Think about it...It really doesn't.   Hey look!  America just joined the war...we've made virtually no military mistakes so far...let's surround ourselves with enemies and basicly ensure our defeat!  Think about it...and the technological avances that happened due to WWII and how they changed the world drastically after that.

       Yeah, it is basically the same thing I am thinking too. Especially the fact that Hitler was obsessed with the jewish conspiracy, but now it seems that it is true, that the zionist conspiracy really exists, and there are already many documented proofs now.

       I've looked and looked and found no good reason to open up a second front.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allied perspective: Hitler was a mad-man bent on world domination. To continue to grow his war machine, it was necessary to commit seppeku to steal the vital resources in Russia. This answer has never sat very well with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Axis perspective (at least from what I've read): The Nazi's were terrified of a coming invasion from Russia and being taken as POW's. Instead of sitting back and allowing the Soviet's the opportunity to invade whenever it was strategically convenient, Hitler decided to try and wipe them out before that could happen. This answer also has problems. Why would he make such a strategic blunder for little/no reward? He opened a second front and sealed his fate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've asked everyone I know and the "classically" trained historians give 1 of the 2 bullshit answers above. Maybe I need to read the book first, but does it give any new insight? I wish the guy was alive so somebody could just ask him.

       This is a slightly different take on the war, but if you view the war as a proxy war by England against Russia, then the attack by Germany is the whole motivation. Russia threatened England's Empire in Afghanistan and thus India, the jewel of the Empire. England first used Japan to attack Russia in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war. The Germans/Jews also paid for Lenin's train to Russia to start the revolution. The 1% Brits/Zionist Bankers lost their capital in Russia and wanted it back. These were some motivations for using Hitler to attack Russia. WW2 clearly weaken both Russia and Germany. This was the desired result. Britian always tries to fight by proxy. After WW2, they used the US to fight Russia, and Russia was destroyed and you can see that the US has also been greatly weakened. The EU has emerged as the area with greatest GDP, and it forms a buffer zone for the UK to the right, while the US/Canada acts as a buffer to the left. The UK lost it's empire, but it won again in the end.

       Yes. It is only a matter of rational thinking. It is obvious that the nazies made a huge tactical mistake by opening the second front. And it looks highly implausible to think that their generals were not extremely skilled at war tactics by how they started the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will also never understand why the hell France surrendered instantly. It is a country of the same size as Germany, they had almost the same warfare power and as much many soldiers as the Germans. Very irrational, no matter what historical documents say.

       What do you mean by "I wish the guy was still alive"? Do you mean the writer of the book? As far as I know he is alive and is the owner of the site that I posted in my OP. You can even try to contact him via email.

You guys who spew this trash are the ultimate trolls.  Ignorant and backward thinking but can justify your beliefs in your small angry minds.  Whereareyour documentedproofs?  You have none.

       Kids: Here's where you end up when you take the bait hook line and sinker. Skepticism is healthy so exercise it whenever necessary. If something doesn't sound logical, question it. If you're called 'racist', 'fuckwit', 'human filth', etc. then be happy, because you're probably closer to the truth than you think, as obviously the facts are no longer on "their" side.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's clear that sheep like officematt would have thrown a proud Roman Salute with Valkyrie's romantically rising in the background, because he doesn't have the ability to question (as most people don't). officematt is the epitome of herd mentality that allows these types of things to happen in the first place. Most people need to belong to the herd and it's not easy to be ostracized intellectually, or otherwise. Sadly, it's not even his fault and I can't blame him as this is a very controversial subject that we're indoctrinated to early and often.

       I'll leave you with one of my favorite quotes and then I'm done:

       So tell me why you read racist drivel based on nothing and then think that I am part of 'theherd' when I question your pack mentality?  Racists can't think for themselves and are taken in so easily by such lies.  And no, you are not close to any truth.  You are just stupid, ignorant and breathing my air and wasting it.

       It's tough to have a discussion when the simple act of questioning history is automatically negated to being racist. I don't care the race; just want to know the truth and I don't believe the official story.

       Yet you have to go to such a book that is only written from such a racist slant?  I doubt your credibility.  There are much better sources.  Try your local library, try logic, try good taste.  Don't go for oddball sources that claim the war was a scheme, a deception, a massive conspiracy.

       I didn't read the book so I can't even speak on the source. We see things differently. CNN is oddball, FOX is oddball, The Warren Commission was oddball, as was the 9/11 commission. I'll save the bulk of 9/11 for another time...
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't question that WW2 happened. I do question if 6 million Jews were actually exterminated, but this isn't based on race. I find it odd that this 6 million number was so regularly used as early as 1897, published in countless newspapers and parroted by members of the WZO throughout the early part of the century (pre-Holocaust). I also think the Transfer Agreement and the Balfour Declaration are extremely suspect and seem to be left out of my 10th grade history class. If the Nazi's slaughtered 6 million Jews in gas chambers then they are bastards and deserved their fate, however, there's a lot of evidence to say that we aren't being given the full story here. Nothing is so black and white, especially in times of war. Why did we cover-up the Stalin's Katyn Slaughter (
       <a href="http://rt.com/news/katyn-massacre-documents-usa-816/">
        http://rt.com/news/katyn-massacre-documents-usa-816/
       </a>
       ), along with several other incidences just like it? Sadly, you are immediately labeled a racist Nazi if ask questions. I don't know of another situation in modern history that's so taboo to simply question. Ethnic cleansing is wrong, lying about being ethnically cleansed is also wrong (directed at WZO leadership and whoever in the hell else they were working with at the time, not day-to-day Jews).
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't believe in a global Jewish conspiracy. I do, however, believe in a global banking conspiracy with some very evil intentions. Take a look at the Business Plot from 1933 and thank God for Smedley Butler. He wasn't concerned with their ethnicity, being politically correct, or not offending people; he wanted the truth to be out there and he exposed it. The New York Times called it a "gigantic hoax" and there was no prosecution, yet the McCormack-Dickstein Committee deemed it a plausible threat and a very real plot. Who do you believe? I sure as hell don't believe the perps who orchestrated this plot, only to have it exposed, who then wrote about how it was a "hoax" in the New York Times the next day. Why were these conspirators never prosecuted and why isn't this covered in 10th grade history? Surely the government would want to expose such attempts on our sovereignty so that we stay vigilant and protect the country from all threats, foreign and domestic, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       General Wesley Clark is another example (
       <a href="http://youtu.be/9RC1Mepk_Sw">
        http://youtu.be/9RC1Mepk_Sw
       </a>
       ). Is he crazy? Did he go off the deep end? Is he making this up? I don't believe so. This is a 4 star general who's telling you the plan. And guess what? He's been right, with the exception of timing. Maybe the plan has evolved, but the countries he predicted to fall have fallen or are in process. You don't have to believe me. Believe the 4 star general who, at some point, I'm sure you trusted. Will General Clark be talked about in 10th grade history class 50 years from now?
      </p>

*Lebanon - In process. Stay tuned.
*Libya - Mission accomplished.
*Somalia - Had some upheaval. Maybe they decided to play nice? 
*Sudan - Boots on the ground. Stay tuned.
*Iran - In process but will be saved for last. Stay tuned.

       Let's move on to the Saudi's and 9/11 (
       <a href="http://nypost.com/2013/12/15/inside-the-saudi-911-coverup/">
        http://nypost.com/2013/12/15/inside-the-saudi-911-coverup/

       or

        http://www.businessinsider.com/report-of-saudi-arabia-links-to-911-2013-12
       </a>
       ). Is it racist to expose the Saudi Government's involvement? Should we remain quiet as to not offend Arab's or come off as bigots? No, we shouldn't. There's been plenty of people labeled "conspiritards" who exposed this plot from day one and it's only now gaining traction, 12 years after the fact. Why is that? Hopefully this one makes it's way to the "official story" so the next generation can hear about it in their 10th grade history class. Unfortunately, I think that will take a sincere re-investigation of 9/11 and that's just not a possibility right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the best explanation I can give you. These questions are very logical with very scary answers. I trust the sources and don't consider them "oddball". You've seen M. Night Shyamalan's "The Village", right? I can't blame the sheep. I used to be one.

       "History is written by the victors."  - And sadly, I can't tell you who said this because it's unclear. If we can't even attribute a quote, then how are we so sure that all these events happened just the way we're told they did, even in the face of mounting evidence that may say otherwise?

       Sorry, you lost me when you question the veracity of how many Jews were murdered in the Holocaust.   Basing your arguments on a grade 10 History class is a pretty embarrassing admission.   These classes are designed to endeavour further learning. How much can you learn in a half year or full year of once a week classes?   The education system does a poor job of teaching history, but to question what you have learned from a textbook is ridiculous.  It was never designed to tell the full story.   Instead you turn to atrocious 'sources' that are just not viable sources.  You can do better. Please do.

       So you're not capable of reading something you don't agree with in the first sentence and either dismissing, or suspending your disbelief to further absorb the point I was trying to make? I gave you sources on why I question the 6 million number. The sources were newspapers of the day and WZO mouthpieces.

       Please don't forget about the Bromberg Massacre. Very important to understand WWII.
      </p>
      <p>
       WWI separated Germans from Germany by creating the Polish-controlled Danzig Corridor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beginning in 1939, thousands of ethnic Germans were being killed in cold blood by Jewish-Polish partisans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler tried to bring this to the attention of the world again and again. He even went in front of the League of Nations to explain what was happening to these Germans...to no avail. They continued to be killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       To save these Germans Hitler decided to invade Poland on September 1, 1939. This so enraged the partisans that they decided to kill every ethnic German that they could before the German Army arrived...this led to "Bloody Sunday" on the 4th of September. On this day alone 58,000 ethnic Germans were killed in cold blood by Jewish partisans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amazing what the history books decide to omit...isn't it?

       If the Germans only wanted to liberate Danzig and reunite east and west Germany, why did that also ally with the Soviets in a joint invasion, grind all the way to Warsaw, and occupy Poland for six years after Danzig's liberation?

       You are correct...possibly because the guy was basically insane and on drugs??

       I think that Hitler used the Bromberg Massacre to his own ends...to justify invading Poland--so I agree with you there.

       they didn't open a second front, they let britain get away at dunkirk, hitler called a retreat because they didnt want to fight the british empire or invade britain. that "front" was not a "front" at all. so hitler turned east, then got buttfucked when yet another deal / plot was hatched to get america into the war, just like ww1.

       Haven't read the book, but the problem with any anti-semitism, is its over-generalization of the international Jewry (ignoring their importance in socialist and libertarian movements) and easily replaced by anti-Zionism (Israel) sentiment.

       Well, it is interesting that the writer was willing to research only informations concerning one jewish person in the beginning. But soon after somebody started persecuting him, he understood that there werer more than one person involved. He explained why and how he wrote the book on his site. Interesting read. And he didn't ignored the importance of the international jewry.

       I am attacking this argument:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Except the "ghetto Jews" were largely affluent members of society from every walk of life, from tradesmen to bankers
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Giving Krakow as an example: there were huge synagogues where only the "upper" Jews could enter, the "lesser" ones could not, even if they were living just a few blocks away. The "ghetto" Jews had the usual shitty life, not so different from the common peasant. Your assertion that they were all affluent members of society from every walk of life, and that there was no separation between the "lesser" Jews and the "upper" Jews is not true. The following statement is also not true, also demonstrated by my simple example:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The point is that there was no ghetto vs 1% going on, as you insinuated
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now, if you are talking about how the affluent Jewish families from the past, such as the Rothschild, see the rabble right now, it is difficult to say, since they give very few interviews. Aside from the black sheep, Nat, the rest married with nobles or key families from the second industrial revolution, so it should give you an idea.

       David Cole: the guy who said there's "No evidence" of gas chambers. The guy whose party line is/was "Let's get drunk." What, is it because he's a Jew does that make his testimony trump all evidence (despite, y'know, not having anything to do with the Holocaust personally)?

       No, I'm not saying the people in those newsreels are just Jews - but the majority are, given 6 of the 11 million killed were Jews (followed by the 3 million Russian POWs/civs, then other groups).
