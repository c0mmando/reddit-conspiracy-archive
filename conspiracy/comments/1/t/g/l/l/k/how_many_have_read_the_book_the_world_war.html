<p>Because <a href="http://www.deathcamps.org/gas_chambers/pic/bigauschwitz02.jpg">these</a> <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_sTCNaBFCWaM/SROob2jeosI/AAAAAAAAAAU/fFoQmEttxO0/s1600-h/Auchwitz+gas+chamber.jpg">just</a> <a href="http://www.deathcamps.org/gas_chambers/pic/bigtreblinka01.jpg">popped</a> <a href="http://codoh.com/sites/default/files/codoh/graphics3/dachaugas.jpg">into</a> <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/98/Auschwitz_-_Crematorium_II_gas_chamber_cross-section.jpg">existence</a>, right (every world a new link, for non-RES). Or were those all built post-war for show, and the universally-repeated survivor&#39;s story about how women, children, and the infirm were given &quot;showers&quot; were an orchestrated coverup? They installed the <a href="http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/othercamps/images/Bluprints%20crem2.jpg">shower systems connected to gas dispersal systems instead of water</a> for show, too, right, in the few days between the German retreat from the camps and the Allied liberations?</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not saying the people in those newsreels are just Jews - but the majority are, given 6 of the 11 million killed were Jews (followed by the 3 million Russian POWs/civs, then other groups).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The concept of jewish Ghetto precedes Nazism by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ghettos_in_Europe">long shot</a>. Where did you get your revisionist history?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Ghettos&quot; didn&#39;t exist - not, at least, in the sense of a tight-packed minority community living in poverty-level conditions that the true ghettos that define the era are considered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>In 1555</strong>, Pope Paul IV issued papal bull Cum nimis absurdum which created the Roman Ghetto, forcing Jews of Rome to live in a part of the rione Sant&#39;Angelo of Rome. The area of Rome chosen for the ghetto was the most undesirable quarter of the city, owing to constant flooding by the Tiber River. At the time of its founding, the four-block area was designated to contain roughly 1,000 inhabitants. However, over the years, the Jewish community grew, which caused severe overcrowding. Since the area could not expand horizontally (the ghetto was surrounded by high walls), the Jews built vertical additions to their houses, which blocked the sun from reaching the already dank and narrow streets. <strong>Life in the Roman Ghetto was one of crushing poverty, due to the severe restrictions placed upon the professions that Jews were allowed to perform.</strong></p>

<p>The Roman Ghetto was the <strong>last of the original ghettos to be abolished in Western Europe; not until 1882</strong>, when the Kingdom of Italy conquered Rome from the Pope, was the Ghetto finally opened, with the walls themselves being torn down in 1888.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you should educate yourself a little bit before making such uncorrect claims. How can you even be so upvoted is beyond me. Poland was somewhere of an exception, since Jews had quite some freedom compared to any other European country. Districs were assigned to them, and just like with Venice merchants/nobles and the rest of the venetians rabble, there was quite a difference between Jewish districts, and the upper classes of Jew would treat the &quot;lesser&quot; jews quite like a 18th century noble would treat a peasant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, correction: the concept of herding your enemies into singular communities was <em>not</em> invented by the Nazis. However, those kind of communities did not exist en masse in Europe <em>at the time.</em> Your own source cites how the last of the Catholic-enforced ghettos was abolished more than half a century before the Nazis!</p>

<p>That said, the Nazis reinstituted a practice that had largely gone out of use and been negated by the dissemination of Jews throughout the rest of the population. </p>

<p>The point is that there was no ghetto vs 1% going on, as you insinuated - that&#39;s like claiming that the blueblood vs new arrival prejudice from 1900s Irish communities was influential in the police behavior in the Boston Bombings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am attacking this argument:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Except the &quot;ghetto Jews&quot; were largely affluent members of society from every walk of life, from tradesmen to bankers </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Giving Krakow as an example: there were huge synagogues where only the &quot;upper&quot; Jews could enter, the &quot;lesser&quot; ones could not, even if they were living just a few blocks away. The &quot;ghetto&quot; Jews had the usual shitty life, not so different from the common peasant. Your assertion that they were all affluent members of society from every walk of life, and that there was no separation between the &quot;lesser&quot; Jews and the &quot;upper&quot; Jews is not true. The following statement is also not true, also demonstrated by my simple example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point is that there was no ghetto vs 1% going on, as you insinuated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, if you are talking about how the affluent Jewish families from the past, such as the Rothschild, see the rabble right now, it is difficult to say, since they give very few interviews. Aside from the black sheep, Nat, the rest married with nobles or key families from the second industrial revolution, so it should give you an idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Revisionist history&quot; is just that- revisionist. It&#39;s disagreeing with the consensus of actual learnèd historians for the sake of being contrarian. Historians agree that the Civil War was caused by slavery, because it was. And they agree that eleven million people were killed in extermination camps by the Nazis because it happened. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not ignorant to accept the opinions of the consensus of experts. It&#39;s ignorant to think you know better than they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont know if this makes much sense to be honest.

<p>I think if you look at modern companies say Dow Chemical company they played a roll in the wars and subsequent strife.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve looked and looked and found no good reason to open up a second front.</p>

<p>Allied perspective: Hitler was a mad-man bent on world domination. To continue to grow his war machine, it was necessary to commit seppeku to steal the vital resources in Russia. This answer has never sat very well with me.</p>

<p>Axis perspective (at least from what I&#39;ve read): The Nazi&#39;s were terrified of a coming invasion from Russia and being taken as POW&#39;s. Instead of sitting back and allowing the Soviet&#39;s the opportunity to invade whenever it was strategically convenient, Hitler decided to try and wipe them out before that could happen. This answer also has problems. Why would he make such a strategic blunder for little/no reward? He opened a second front and sealed his fate.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve asked everyone I know and the &quot;classically&quot; trained historians give 1 of the 2 bullshit answers above. Maybe I need to read the book first, but does it give any new insight? I wish the guy was alive so somebody could just ask him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a slightly different take on the war, but if you view the war as a proxy war by England against Russia, then the attack by Germany is the whole motivation. Russia threatened England&#39;s Empire in Afghanistan and thus India, the jewel of the Empire. England first used Japan to attack Russia in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war. The Germans/Jews also paid for Lenin&#39;s train to Russia to start the revolution. The 1% Brits/Zionist Bankers lost their capital in Russia and wanted it back. These were some motivations for using Hitler to attack Russia. WW2 clearly weaken both Russia and Germany. This was the desired result. Britian always tries to fight by proxy. After WW2, they used the US to fight Russia, and Russia was destroyed and you can see that the US has also been greatly weakened. The EU has emerged as the area with greatest GDP, and it forms a buffer zone for the UK to the right, while the US/Canada acts as a buffer to the left. The UK lost it&#39;s empire, but it won again in the end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It is only a matter of rational thinking. It is obvious that the nazies made a huge tactical mistake by opening the second front. And it looks highly implausible to think that their generals were not extremely skilled at war tactics by how they started the war.</p>

<p>I will also never understand why the hell France surrendered instantly. It is a country of the same size as Germany, they had almost the same warfare power and as much many soldiers as the Germans. Very irrational, no matter what historical documents say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kids: Here&#39;s where you end up when you take the bait hook line and sinker. Skepticism is healthy so exercise it whenever necessary. If something doesn&#39;t sound logical, question it. If you&#39;re called &#39;racist&#39;, &#39;fuckwit&#39;, &#39;human filth&#39;, etc. then be happy, because you&#39;re probably closer to the truth than you think, as obviously the facts are no longer on &quot;their&quot; side. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s clear that sheep like officematt would have thrown a proud Roman Salute with Valkyrie&#39;s romantically rising in the background, because he doesn&#39;t have the ability to question (as most people don&#39;t). officematt is the epitome of herd mentality that allows these types of things to happen in the first place. Most people need to belong to the herd and it&#39;s not easy to be ostracized intellectually, or otherwise. Sadly, it&#39;s not even his fault and I can&#39;t blame him as this is a very controversial subject that we&#39;re indoctrinated to early and often. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave you with one of my favorite quotes and then I&#39;m done:</p>

<p>“Question with boldness even the existence of God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear.”  - Thomas Jefferson</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t read the book so I can&#39;t even speak on the source. We see things differently. CNN is oddball, FOX is oddball, The Warren Commission was oddball, as was the 9/11 commission. I&#39;ll save the bulk of 9/11 for another time...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t question that WW2 happened. I do question if 6 million Jews were actually exterminated, but this isn&#39;t based on race. I find it odd that this 6 million number was so regularly used as early as 1897, published in countless newspapers and parroted by members of the WZO throughout the early part of the century (pre-Holocaust). I also think the Transfer Agreement and the Balfour Declaration are extremely suspect and seem to be left out of my 10th grade history class. If the Nazi&#39;s slaughtered 6 million Jews in gas chambers then they are bastards and deserved their fate, however, there&#39;s a lot of evidence to say that we aren&#39;t being given the full story here. Nothing is so black and white, especially in times of war. Why did we cover-up the Stalin&#39;s Katyn Slaughter (<a href="http://rt.com/news/katyn-massacre-documents-usa-816/">http://rt.com/news/katyn-massacre-documents-usa-816/</a>), along with several other incidences just like it? Sadly, you are immediately labeled a racist Nazi if ask questions. I don&#39;t know of another situation in modern history that&#39;s so taboo to simply question. Ethnic cleansing is wrong, lying about being ethnically cleansed is also wrong (directed at WZO leadership and whoever in the hell else they were working with at the time, not day-to-day Jews).</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t believe in a global Jewish conspiracy. I do, however, believe in a global banking conspiracy with some very evil intentions. Take a look at the Business Plot from 1933 and thank God for Smedley Butler. He wasn&#39;t concerned with their ethnicity, being politically correct, or not offending people; he wanted the truth to be out there and he exposed it. The New York Times called it a &quot;gigantic hoax&quot; and there was no prosecution, yet the McCormack-Dickstein Committee deemed it a plausible threat and a very real plot. Who do you believe? I sure as hell don&#39;t believe the perps who orchestrated this plot, only to have it exposed, who then wrote about how it was a &quot;hoax&quot; in the New York Times the next day. Why were these conspirators never prosecuted and why isn&#39;t this covered in 10th grade history? Surely the government would want to expose such attempts on our sovereignty so that we stay vigilant and protect the country from all threats, foreign and domestic, right? </p>

<p>General Wesley Clark is another example (<a href="http://youtu.be/9RC1Mepk_Sw">http://youtu.be/9RC1Mepk_Sw</a>). Is he crazy? Did he go off the deep end? Is he making this up? I don&#39;t believe so. This is a 4 star general who&#39;s telling you the plan. And guess what? He&#39;s been right, with the exception of timing. Maybe the plan has evolved, but the countries he predicted to fall have fallen or are in process. You don&#39;t have to believe me. Believe the 4 star general who, at some point, I&#39;m sure you trusted. Will General Clark be talked about in 10th grade history class 50 years from now?</p>

<p>*Iraq - Mission accomplished.
*Syria - In process. I believe China and Russia delayed this plan, but it will happen.
*Lebanon - In process. Stay tuned.
*Libya - Mission accomplished.
*Somalia - Had some upheaval. Maybe they decided to play nice? 
*Sudan - Boots on the ground. Stay tuned.
*Iran - In process but will be saved for last. Stay tuned. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s move on to the Saudi&#39;s and 9/11 (<a href="http://nypost.com/2013/12/15/inside-the-saudi-911-coverup/">http://nypost.com/2013/12/15/inside-the-saudi-911-coverup/</a> or <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/report-of-saudi-arabia-links-to-911-2013-12">http://www.businessinsider.com/report-of-saudi-arabia-links-to-911-2013-12</a>). Is it racist to expose the Saudi Government&#39;s involvement? Should we remain quiet as to not offend Arab&#39;s or come off as bigots? No, we shouldn&#39;t. There&#39;s been plenty of people labeled &quot;conspiritards&quot; who exposed this plot from day one and it&#39;s only now gaining traction, 12 years after the fact. Why is that? Hopefully this one makes it&#39;s way to the &quot;official story&quot; so the next generation can hear about it in their 10th grade history class. Unfortunately, I think that will take a sincere re-investigation of 9/11 and that&#39;s just not a possibility right now. </p>

<p>This is the best explanation I can give you. These questions are very logical with very scary answers. I trust the sources and don&#39;t consider them &quot;oddball&quot;. You&#39;ve seen M. Night Shyamalan&#39;s &quot;The Village&quot;, right? I can&#39;t blame the sheep. I used to be one.</p>

<p>&quot;History is written by the victors.&quot;  - And sadly, I can&#39;t tell you who said this because it&#39;s unclear. If we can&#39;t even attribute a quote, then how are we so sure that all these events happened just the way we&#39;re told they did, even in the face of mounting evidence that may say otherwise? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please don&#39;t forget about the Bromberg Massacre. Very important to understand WWII. </p>

<p>WWI separated Germans from Germany by creating the Polish-controlled Danzig Corridor.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1939, thousands of ethnic Germans were being killed in cold blood by Jewish-Polish partisans.</p>

<p>Hitler tried to bring this to the attention of the world again and again. He even went in front of the League of Nations to explain what was happening to these Germans...to no avail. They continued to be killed.</p>

<p>To save these Germans Hitler decided to invade Poland on September 1, 1939. This so enraged the partisans that they decided to kill every ethnic German that they could before the German Army arrived...this led to &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; on the 4th of September. On this day alone 58,000 ethnic Germans were killed in cold blood by Jewish partisans.</p>

<p>Amazing what the history books decide to omit...isn&#39;t it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am attacking this argument:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Except the &quot;ghetto Jews&quot; were largely affluent members of society from every walk of life, from tradesmen to bankers </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Giving Krakow as an example: there were huge synagogues where only the &quot;upper&quot; Jews could enter, the &quot;lesser&quot; ones could not, even if they were living just a few blocks away. The &quot;ghetto&quot; Jews had the usual shitty life, not so different from the common peasant. Your assertion that they were all affluent members of society from every walk of life, and that there was no separation between the &quot;lesser&quot; Jews and the &quot;upper&quot; Jews is not true. The following statement is also not true, also demonstrated by my simple example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point is that there was no ghetto vs 1% going on, as you insinuated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, if you are talking about how the affluent Jewish families from the past, such as the Rothschild, see the rabble right now, it is difficult to say, since they give very few interviews. Aside from the black sheep, Nat, the rest married with nobles or key families from the second industrial revolution, so it should give you an idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>David Cole: the guy who said there&#39;s &quot;No evidence&quot; of gas chambers. The guy whose party line is/was &quot;Let&#39;s get drunk.&quot; What, is it because he&#39;s a Jew does that make his testimony trump all evidence (despite, y&#39;know, not having anything to do with the Holocaust personally)?</p>

<p>Because <a href="http://www.deathcamps.org/gas_chambers/pic/bigauschwitz02.jpg">these</a> <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_sTCNaBFCWaM/SROob2jeosI/AAAAAAAAAAU/fFoQmEttxO0/s1600-h/Auchwitz+gas+chamber.jpg">just</a> <a href="http://www.deathcamps.org/gas_chambers/pic/bigtreblinka01.jpg">popped</a> <a href="http://codoh.com/sites/default/files/codoh/graphics3/dachaugas.jpg">into</a> <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/98/Auschwitz_-_Crematorium_II_gas_chamber_cross-section.jpg">existence</a>, right (every world a new link, for non-RES). Or were those all built post-war for show, and the universally-repeated survivor&#39;s story about how women, children, and the infirm were given &quot;showers&quot; were an orchestrated coverup? They installed the <a href="http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/othercamps/images/Bluprints%20crem2.jpg">shower systems connected to gas dispersal systems instead of water</a> for show, too, right, in the few days between the German retreat from the camps and the Allied liberations?</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not saying the people in those newsreels are just Jews - but the majority are, given 6 of the 11 million killed were Jews (followed by the 3 million Russian POWs/civs, then other groups).</p>
