        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am brainstorming a project. I know we have time capsules, but as far as I know, they are insufficient for thousands of years. Our satellites would most likely drift out of orbit or get destroyed by debris. The stuff we left behind on the moon and the robots on mars are probably our best bet, but you could land there a thousand times and possibly never see it. My question: Is it possible to build something on Earth that will last 10,000 years or more?</p>

<p>My thoughts are taking cell phones, tablets, coins, certain tools, and other miscellaneous items that give hints about our civilization. Sterilize and seal them in an airtight bag, which can be placed in various long lasting liquids like oils and honey, and then placed in a thick glass jar with glass lids. These jars could then be placed inside protective coffins made of long lasting material, and then cached inside a large stone structure, like a monolith or pyramid. Please share any information or ideas and methods of preservation.</p>

<p>P.S. Do you think our ancestors built monoliths to speak of their legacy, or to honor their Gods? Do you think their tablets and cell phones dissolved overtime and they failed to tell us about their technological achievements, or do you think they were strictly an agriculture/hunter-gather society?</p>

<p>Also It should lack any symbols or language as our descendents will likely not be able to understand.</p>

<p>Instead of words, we need to demonstrate math. Perhaps build several massive geometric shapes to mathematical precision and have them align with the planetary and solar positions to demonstrate our astronomical understanding.</p>

<p>Now, what if our civilization starts crumbling and an elite portion of our population gets sent out to live in space, and after rebuilding on a faraway planet send envoys to find out what became of good ol earth.. Where everything has been destroyed by nuclear war and survivors have become savages who workshop the &quot;aliens&quot; as gods..

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a what if... 
I was musing about how long the planet has been here and how relatively short humanity has been, in comparison.
We know the universe was a more violent place the further you go back. 
Who is to say a prior &quot;humanity&quot; or other &quot;inhabitants&quot; with an expansive culture was not present before, and completely erased by catastrophic meteoric events resulting in a complete destruction of everything on the surface and substrate of the planet, molten away, to begin again anew. Leaving no &quot;evident&quot; trace behind. A clean slate if you will...</p>

<p>Just a thought...  gloomy, but interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great question!! One ive asked myself on several occassions.</p>

<p>Ive come to the conclusion that this is why monliths like thebgreat pyramids, puma punku were built. Also, this is whybi think gobekli tepe was buried in sand. Stone could last for millions of years when buried in sand in an arid environment.</p>

<p>our best bet would be creating a monolith comparable to these ancient monoliths, though your idea to encapsulate information would work to an extent, i have doubts itll survive intact during the retrieval process, especislly when future civikisations arent expecting to be retrieving information in a manner you described.</p>

<p>think about our oil drillers, how would they know if they came across sncient cellphones like you described? Unless, of course, harbored in stone monoliths possibly buried.</p>

<p>i thjnk we shoukd excavate soil like a surface mine, build a giant stone structure that will house and keep safe certain seals containing information. I feel anything thst requires electronic capabikities will be a disservice to future generations who might have found a way around the need for electricity, so carving things into stone blocks or tablets using lazers would suffice better, in my opinion (as far as practicalities and longevity are concerned, at least.).</p>

I mean, that&#39;s how we&#39;ve found out about some previous civilizations right?  We dug them up.  And underground structures wouldn&#39;t be subject to as much erosion would they?  Like how long do you think NORAD will last or similar structures.  Just the vault/blast door at Norad alone, how long could that last?  I&#39;d love to hear comments pertaining to this.  Perhaps that&#39;s why Birtha stopped in Seattle?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point, has there been any new revelations on birtha? Any explanations for what stopped her? I feel like burying something like the monoliths at gobekli tepe would work extremely well in preserving information. I believe we have the means to do it, and because of that, i wonder if some people have already done so in modern times..</p>
