        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Well it has been a busy 48 hours. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be spending my Christmas Eve and Christmas Eve Eve responding to hundreds of concerned messages on reddit!</p>

<p>So I wanted to talk about a few things and hopefully lay everything to rest.</p>

<ol>
<li>First off- thank you so much to the many people who messaged me via PM and told me not to step down. I appreciate your kind words and support- and realize that negativity gets more upvotes than positivity. Also thank you to the folks at conspiratard for actually <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1tjcd9/discussion_in_the_midst_of_the_latest_kerfuffle/">considering toning it down a bit</a> as a result of my post (more <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1tlqam/carolers_in_front_of_solidwhetstones_place_on/ce9dl89">here</a>)</li>
<li>To the people who messaged me with concern- the main take away I got from reading those messages is that people were afraid I might do something to mess up <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Even today, there have been some accusations that I had unfairly banned an active member. I wanted to give this whole situation a few days so everyone could say what they want to say and I could think about what to do.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve decided to become the bottom mod. That means that any mod can remove me at any point if I am unfairly banning users, removing posts, etc. Additionally, I expect my opinions will have less weight in mod mail discussions since I am no longer able to remove any mods.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope this is a solution everyone here can live with. For those that wanted my head- I did my best to understand why you were upset. And I think you were upset because you didn&#39;t want things to change drastically here. You felt like you couldn&#39;t trust me. Now that I am the bottom mod- every action I do will be under scrutiny and I can be removed by any other mod. I still desire to help out this community to be the best that it can be, and I&#39;m willing to do it from the bottom spot. I hope you can forgive me for the feelings of mistrust I have given you and I hope that this action will be seen as a suitable way to move forward.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and I hope Christmas wasn&#39;t ruined.</p>

<p>sws</p>

<p>EDIT: Special thanks to <a href="/u/mr_dong">/u/mr_dong</a> for helping me figure out what to do. He&#39;s a good guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly and that&#39;s the thing. 70% are mentally ill patients and 30% are paid shills by propaganda wings like media maters, ADL, and others. These are not reasonable people, their life revolves around destroying conspiracy and derailing discussions and insulting people here, these are sociopaths, that need real help, need to be in a mental institution for their own safety.</p>

<p>So, we don&#39;t talk about banning people from <a href="/r/liberal">/r/liberal</a> or <a href="/r/socialist">/r/socialist</a> or <a href="/r/conservative">/r/conservative</a> or <a href="/r/cringe">/r/cringe</a> because its not their stated life goal to go around in conspiracy and try to subvert the place. </p>

<p>If a mentally ill retard was following someone in real life 24/7 every day of the year he&#39;d be put in a mental institution for the rest of his life where he belongs, here on reddit the equivalent in the ban hammer. </p>

<p>Sorry, but I can&#39;t do that. I have to tell the truth and the sad truth is that they are mentally ill retards and they need care, they need to be in mental institution. Its very sad, I mean I wish they had a brain, but its the sad truth, its way of life, someone has to be retarded.</p>

<p>this mod is severely misconstruing that sub, and seems to be attempting to point out to us the rationale inherent in diplomacy and criticism as though many here simply do not understand it, and as though this is the basis of the communication problem between the two subs. </p>

<p>he showed a large allocation of misjudgement when approaching that sub as he did, and i would feel more comfortable if he would step down as a mod and let someone more acquainted with the &quot;situation on the ground&quot; between these two subs take the job. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Says the manchild that apparently believes every word of the fantasy that is force fed to him my the mommy telescreen, yet is unable to reconcile historical events and facts that swim against his shallow preconceived notion that all that happened yesterday and couldn&#39;t possibly happen today.  Do you think project mockingbird was simply a one time exercise?  How about officially legitimizing government propaganda under the unconstitutional NDAA - Sec. 1078?  Direct question - do you think it is not actively being used on and against you need constantly?</p>

<p>Breaking it down, the <strong>only</strong> parody here is the sad excuse for a human being that submitted the post this message is in response to.  This overgrowm manchild is either a shill, or thanks to coming from a long line of mass breeding anti intellectuals of highly substndard IQ.</p>

<p>It is sickening how the fools so nothing but create more.  Seeimg the dumb creating even more and more idiocy with generation after generation.  Regrettably I&#39;m sure, though its not a atretch to believe that at least some of those created the next round of lesser mouth breathers with other family members.  Seeing parents (is that title of honor even deserved?), dishonorably create significantly lesser copies of themselves.  Stopping only when they or their parts break.  The result of extremely poor parenting and even worse schooling.  Void of <strong>any</strong> form of active learning or brainpower to look to history, to weigh evidence and testimoy, to actively determime credibility, or hell, even to just think critically.</p>

<p>[Note - the former has been identified thanks to public postings, though the latter very likely played a very large part.  The identified shills, such as <a href="/u/Bodertz">/u/Bodertz</a> and his peers, through the mental deficits mentioned earlier, somehow actually believe they are changing the minds, views, and opinions of others with their predictable and played out tactics.  Shallow methods repeatedly shown to have the exact opposite effect on the majority who can spot and see through it.]  </p>

<p>People and groups with even just mid-level intelligence tend to change their tactics when they recognize their efforts are failing.  It takes a very special kind of drone to continue on the exact same course, using the exact same failed actions, expecting them to miraculously start working on the masses.  Behavior such as this would cease entirely if they didn&#39;t see the massive threat of being exposed.  When such behavior becomes commonplace, it indicates that all other efforts have failed.</p>

<p>I can tell you that while I personally feel that most nonfiction today is largey rubbish, I <strong>never</strong> go out of my way to childishly mock those who do enjoy it.  I don&#39;t infiltrate their discussions.  I don&#39;t waste time reading ther posts.  I don&#39;t exert so much as an ounce of energy caring about what they believe or discuss.  What is your excuse, <a href="/u/Bodertz">/u/Bodertz</a> and the roughly 1/3 of the conspiri-tard participants in this thread?  Are each of you so mentally weak that must come in packs?  Are your lives so pathetically pointless that significant blocks of your <em>obviously</em> precious time is spent here attempting (see: failing) to counter undisputed facts and reports?  All this over topics and events that you publicly label fiction, and not a threat to you, your credibility, or existence?  Interesting.  <strong>Your actions, specifically the energy and time you selflessly spend here screams deafeningly otherwise.</strong>  The majority of us on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> see through your bullshit and lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel isn&#39;t a criminal state.</p>

<p>What&#39;s criminal is the refusal of the UN to give any Palestinian refugees the help that they need to find homes and jobs, as opposed to their current system of locking them in to perpetual refugee status.</p>

<p>This is done on purpose so as to perpetuate the Palestinian/Israeli conflict so that they can play them both as bad guys whenever they like because they both shoot missiles at each other and both have groups that engage in what could be categorized as &quot;terrorist activity&quot;, or extreme violence at the least.</p>

<p>The Palestinian/Israel conflict is way more complex than what people would like you to believe, as they&#39;re BOTH being used as pawns for political gains by individuals in positions of power who are actively helping to advance the NWO and they give no shits about anybody except for themselves.</p>

<p>Also, why must you specifically mention Israel?</p>

<p>This is what makes people think this place is racist, because you mention one thing and all of the sudden &quot;IT&#39;S DONE BY EVIL JOOS&quot;.</p>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s done by evil muslims and christians and atheists and all other sorts of HUMAN BEINGS. The fuck does race or any of that shit matter?</p>

<p>Everybody engages in propaganda and the American and Russian governments both actively engage in it and even have propaganda organizations that do this very work of going on to social media sites to influence peoples opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first sentence of your reply was read, and then the remainder was promptly disregarded for your utter blindness to what is right in this world.  Israel is a criminal state that clearly does not deserve to exist.  When their crimina
 existence forces the rightful inhabotants, those who are murdered and treated as inferior, they have shown their true colors.</p>

<p>I am clearly not alone in this belief.  The majority of the word despises the criminal state of Israel.  They deserve every ounce of negativity they receive.  Because ultimately you get what you give in this life.  You treat others as substandard, then you yourself are seen as even lower. Can you name one single positive, humanitarian act that the Zionist controlled criminal state of Israel has done selflessly for others on the last year?  The last 5?</p>

<p>Conspiratard on the other hand explicitly exists to make fun and stereotype conspiracy theorists. A cursory glance at the front page of conspiratard shows this to be true, hell, one of the <em>titles</em> of a post admits that most the subreddit is dedicated to making fun of posts here. None of the commenters seem to be in particular shock at this assertion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s right. I love you guys and r/conspiracy- this is my go to reddit and a large source of my news, but the conversation is much more...calm on the other side. </p>

<p>A lot of the arguments I have read here are about how nobody wants censorship in r/con, which I agree is the absolute worst thing that could happen in a place where people still have the right (and are willing to stand up for that right) to speak freely and share information. However, if you ban all of the r/tards, or kick off solidwhetstone for saying something or for speaking to others that you don&#39;t agree with, or like, or whatever, then isn&#39;t that kind of the definition of censorship?</p>

<p>Nothing gets solved without opposition. Opposition is what drives people to work harder, think critically, and learn humility. If everyone agrees with everyone, then there is no drive to go further. There is no new quest for information, there is no desire to keep going to find evidence, because when everyone agrees, that is all the confirmation that is needed and nothing gets done. </p>

<p>I get it that there is bad blood between the subs, and I don&#39;t doubt that there is good reason behind it. It sucks to be made fun of and to feel like you are being invalidated through what essentially comes down to bullying, and it isn&#39;t right. To react in the same manner in retaliation doesn&#39;t make it right. To instead use it to fuel your own fire- to make you better- that&#39;s how you win. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This outcome was not what the majority of the active users were asking for. By only demoting yourself, and not really addressed your wrongdoing, you&#39;ve pretty much done fuck all. Because no mod will delete you willy-nilly, it has to be a majority decision among themselves. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I think you were upset because you didn&#39;t want things to change drastically here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong. You seem to only show remorse for people being upset and not what you did wrong. A lot of users here have been ridiculed, undermined, and bullied by <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. What you did was give legitimacy to the bullies with your antics and turn your back to those who have made this place what it is. THIS is why we don&#39;t trust you, nothing else.</p>

<p>If I ever accept you as a mod, I&#39;d like you to address that and make sure to not disrespect the users here again. </p>

<p>On a side note, I have some suggestions that I feel would improve this place. The mods need to be more active in their interaction and only ban people as a last resort. Ask users nicely to edit out their wrongdoing first to keep things transparent. Besides dialogue, you can also add some guidelines outside of the rules on how to keep things civil. The rules are good, but they&#39;re too few and not efficient enough. You should also remove the silly symbolism like the &quot;Men In Black&quot; aliens and the pyramid to give more legitimacy to this subreddit to really own the word &quot;conspiracy&quot;. Maybe use a Reddit alien with a question mark above his head to symbolize an open mind? </p>

<p>However, seeing as to how little mods listen to users here anyway, you probably wont give a shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstood me. I meant the icons that are used in the layout. The content shouldn&#39;t define this subreddit, it should be an attitude of open-mindedness and respect for those who foster differing opinions than yourself. It&#39;s why I think the symbolism should go.</p>

<p>Upwards of half the content here is questionable to me. Someone posted an image from a Martian space probe that presumably had taken photos of pyramids on Mars. Most people in that thread entertained the idea, and many believed it, but I didn&#39;t. I still wasn&#39;t condescending to those who did and shared my skepticism in a civil manner and engaged in discussions with those who disagreed with me. It was a thread that was preposterous to me, but I still left it with more appeasement than most discussions I&#39;ve had in other subreddits. That&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to be done here. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a really interesting idea. There are challenges with this though. Often times, when a user does this, we look at their submission history for a pattern. That helps us decide on whether to ban. I&#39;m not saying that gets done all the time, but I tend to do it. But at the least, I remove the offending comment. Let me think on it.</p>

<p>I would like to know if you understand where he is coming from, and if you think his point has any validity??
If the answer to these is no, (honestly.... and your apology did not address, or reveal your opinion about that), I think you need to step down. It is a long term problem, and by your actions you have legitimized behavior that actively attacks users of this sub, and therefore you cannot hold your position with any legitimacy.</p>

Controlled opposition.  They didn&#39;t spend hundreds of millions on their propaganda machines and persona management software for nothing.  Especially as they attempt to make the masses believe their opinions are not shared and that the people must be disarmed for &quot;their own good.&quot; I&#39;m afraid they are fighting a losing battle, and far too many have awoke to see the truth for the first time in decades.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what is the difference between being a mod and bottom mod around here. I just know that all the mods concern around the world is about only trolls, who are ruining serious discussions of people who are willing to post on topic. I think that&#39;s all folks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is your evidence he&#39;s &quot;in cahoots&quot; with bipolarbear the fact that bipolarbear responded to his thread? Pretty solid!</p>

<p>I may have used the wrong term, by &quot;the fringe crowd&quot; I meant the people who went over the top because of what he did, I wouldn&#39;t use the votes in that thread to speak for the decision especially the way people throw around words like shill and brigade, and sometimes people voice their opinions and don&#39;t vote so knowing the actual for/against figures is kinda difficult, especially keeping in mind their &quot;downvote brigades&quot; argument.</p>

<p>My opinion is just that though, an opinion. he didn&#39;t do anything worth removal, asking &quot;the enemy&quot; for advice? On how to improve the sub and he made his case why he did that. He wasn&#39;t silencing dissent or banning people for not liking something they said yet your 68% treated him like he <strong>was</strong> bipolarbear, that&#39;s why I&#39;m calling them a fringe crowd.</p>

<p>I know this isn&#39;t a popular opinion but I could care less if they downvote me because I have my opinion and what I see here is smoking mirrors and self-mutilation, soon we will have no <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to discuss real conspiracies.</p>

<p>I completely disagree with that. That&#39;s the conspiratard mentality talking. They, as a group, want <em>everyone</em> with negative opinions of Israel to be called anti-Semitic. They want <em>everyone</em> with negative opinions of Zionism to be called anti-Semitic.  They want <em>everyone</em> with negative opinions of international bankers to be called anti-Semitic. The fact is that many here have those same negative opinions but are not anti-Jew. But for some reason, the conspiratard sub gets very angry about anyone knowing, for example, that the heads of  the Federal Reserve for the past 50 years have all been Jewish. To them, anyone pointing out that fact is &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;. They want to keep that kind of information hidden and out of everyone&#39;s mind. None of that has anything to do with the Jewish family next door but they want us all to think so.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Racism is not allowed here, per Rule #1 on the sidebar, and if &quot;a few people&quot; have told you it is then they&#39;re most likely trolls from the conspiratard sub using alt accounts.</p>

<p>Edit: As I mentioned earlier, solidwhetstone got trolled when he went over there and he still doesn&#39;t even realize it. Sadly, it looks like a lot of people don&#39;t realize it.</p>

<p>&amp; all you have to do is look at his history, &amp; if your not a selective reader you&#39;ll see there are plenty like him here to jump on the -scumbag israeli Gov.- hating bandwagon, ignoring other scumbag governments like say NK (but that&#39;s another rant altogether) and just quote Hitler, blaming &quot;Jews&quot; for everything.</p>

<p>I know zionism exists, I know the Israeli Gov. are quite devious, what I don&#39;t know is what the point of relating world problems to jews, we could just say bankers, the 1%, all kinds of labels, but pointing out their ethnicity/religion shouldn&#39;t make anyone wonder why you get written off once you go that route.</p>

<p>&amp; every president until obama has been white christian, china all chinese bankers have been chinese, what did I achieve by pointing that out? What is the solution to pointing out jews apparently have held a majority of financial/economic positions? Do we make it illegal for jews to have such jobs since them being criminals &amp; apparently all part of a system of the 1% makes them so hard to persecute, well Germany tried that, the Nuremburg laws, &amp; since you claim to not to be antisemitic I doubt you want that.</p>

I don&#39;t talk to anyone there, the people who I referred to, have history in this sub only, so no it&#39;s just my opinion that comments like the one I linked, &amp; many like it aren&#39;t protesting Israel but simply bashing jews. &amp; this I believe is what solid was against, &amp; they don&#39;t like someone getting in the way of their agenda.</p>

<p>Theres protesting Israel, then theres denying that there are bound to be neo nazis jumping in the mix, instead of simply admitting theres a problem &amp; not supporting/hiding it.</p>

<p>Nowadays most everyone in the west relates the world&#39;s problems to Muslims. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do you call those people racists? </p></li>
<li><p>If Muslims controlled most all of the world&#39;s usurious banks and people pointed that out, would you call those people racist too? </p></li>
<li><p>How about Christians? If Christians controlled the world&#39;s banks and people pointed that out would you call those people racist?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of your answer to those questions is &quot;no&quot;, then why do you insist it is racist to point out the fact that they are Jewish? Who has enough power to make you believe that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sammy Davis Jr. and Benjamin Netanyahu are of the same race</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IN SD Jr&#39;s case he is religiously jewish, in Netanyahu&#39;s case he is ethnically hebrew &amp; religiously jewish, so when people criticise jews without context like the comment I linked to you calling it racist isn&#39;t an impossibility, you seem to ignore this. &amp; your statement; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Muslims controlled most all of the world&#39;s usurious banks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Replacing Muslims with jews as you were making the point, could be considered, &amp; I was just pointing it out that calling unspecified &quot;jew counting&quot; racist is not incorrect, be specific which jews, then if you do, why does their ethnicity, or religion  matter at all if you&#39;ve identified them? Why is that so hard to answer?</p>

<p>Lastly why do you find one point I made that isn&#39;t incorrect &amp; twist it to look ugly then ignore an easier question? I find it a pity you&#39;d rather derail the discussion. &amp; I&#39;m now curious as to your mindset, are you trying to convince me or someone else that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1t4ct3/anyone_else_seeing_more_and_more_insane/ce4d7fy">comments/accounts like this</a> are not the least bit hateful?</p>

<p>[EDIT]; I&#39;ll refer to the side bar to make my point clear;</p>

<p>You might believe that applies to you &amp; the people you seem to be defending only but it doesn&#39;t, it applies to everyone, &amp; pointing out Bernanke, Greenspan, whomever of your last 5 &quot;Jews&quot; might seem like free speech, &amp; for the sake of argument lets say it is, let&#39;s pretend it&#39;s bad 5 men are apparently jewish &amp; that&#39;s somehow different than any given US president being Christian, the comment I linked you still isn&#39;t free speech it&#39;s clearly hate speech &amp; like I said a small group of people here are disrespectful if you disagree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&amp; by the way, it is not a position I hold it&#39;s literally the definition of the word jew, my mistake for saying judaism, you were right to use the term &quot;jew&quot;</p>

<p>So when someone says simply &quot;Jews control the federal reserve&quot; or &quot;Jews had nothing to do with this ad&quot; without context calling that racially ignorant is a belief that isn&#39;t illegal in tthis sub as per the sidebar;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>IN CONCLUSION: ELITES CREATE ENEMIES IN ORDER TO RE-ORDER SOCIETY IN THEIR OWN TYRANNICAL IMAGE. THEY DO SO BY COMMITTING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST THEIR OWN BUILDINGS AND BEAURACRACIES, THEN CHOOSING THE SCAPEGOAT. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THE 21ST CENTURY IS THAT THESE &#39;ENEMIES&#39; ARE MORE BELIEVABLE BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURED AND EMPOWERED BY THE ELITE. I WISH TO DRAW NO COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE 4TH CENTURY CHRISTIANS AND AL-QAEDA, BUT THEY WERE BOTH USED FOR THE SAME PURPOSE: TO BRING ORDER OUT OF CHAOS.</p>

<p>I hate how alternative opinions get downvoted, regardless of their contribution, and that&#39;s the real problem with this sub. We can continue to scapegoat this ONE mod but all of you know removing him will NOT solve this subs problems. </p>

<p>Please...just stop this circlejerk over your hate of our satire sub. Work toward more meaningful content, in-depth discussion, and less misleading titles that make bold claims but only link to pathetic fringe sites with no sources/facts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A moderators job is not an easy one.  It is often akin to being a cop because very rarely do you receive thanks...most often it&#39;s vitriol.  The last two days were no exception for you.  </p>

<p>That said, whether we agree or disagree with your gesture to r/conspiratard, I must commend you on both the level of transparency you maintained, and your willingness to respond to who knows how many people over this...not to mention calling a penalty stroke on yourself.  </p>

<p>I think at this point you appreciate and take seriously the concerns of the community.  As such, I am happy you are still a mod for r/conspiracy. Please consider the many statements made regarding what r/conspiratard is about, to include the documented instances of vote brigading, posting anti semitic garbage, and all manner of chickanery desinged to do one thing and one thing alone, destroy the sub you moderate for.  There is nothing wrong with speaking with your &quot;adversaries.&quot;  There is something very wrong with doing your adversaries work, to the detriment of the wishes of your commiunity.  Generally, that&#39;s referred to as treason...and right or wrong, I think that&#39;s what it felt like to many when you reached out to those guys.  </p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for the hard work, and Merry Christams!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t have to do with opposing views.  It really doesn&#39;t.  Really.  It&#39;s about banning regular users for naughty words (that we can all, as adults, deal with and judge as we please), and unbanning a group that is purposefully disruptive.  </p>

<p>I agree some people here are on a hair trigger.  I&#39;ve been called shill quite a few times, and there&#39;s nothing to say to someone that calls you a shill to prove you aren&#39;t.  I get all that.  I get the frustration.  </p>

<p>But the magic of this place is that the crazies and the normals and the academics and the whatever are all mixed in. </p>

<p>What annoys me about conspiratard is not that they don&#39;t like conspiracies.  Whatever.  That&#39;s their choice. </p>

<p>What annoys me is that they get off on wrecking what I consider to be a good discussion.  If I want their type of discussion I can go anywhere else online.  But <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is actually a good place to learn alternative news and see it discussed by people in an unfiltered way.  So I don&#39;t really get why anyone would be opposed to such a place existing.</p>

<p>Finally, all the Rachel Corrie stuff does make me kind of sick and it does cast a shadow on what those dudes do.  It&#39;s weird and creepy and gross and I don&#39;t respect it.</p>

<p>Yes we all know they are here. </p>

<p>Responding only provides what they want! </p>

<p>I do not agree with what <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> says and does in their sub and I dont feel you did anything horrific with your post their. </p>

<p>I do dislike when they come here and post fake things or try to provoke us, if talking to them and getting them to stay in their sub with comments or jokes is fine by me. As they have the right to free speech (even if it is hate speech, and making fun of people is hate to me) The best part of rights is, I have the right to not go to their sub!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you&#39;re saying, and if it is a case of shilling or trolling or otherwise gaming the diplomacy of this subreddit, then I find that sad. I&#39;m a fan of playing Devil&#39;s advocate, and it is possible that this is a fairly new user that has decided to explore reddit. From his past comments, it looks like he teeters on the edge of MSM and underground news, which is exactly the kind person that should be accepted in this community. However, the first time he appears to have ventured in here and participated in a conversation, he took an opposing stance to the general view of the conversation taking place, with a source to back up his claim (an argument on the validity of said source is a different conversation), and he was shut down. And subsequently deflected to Conspiritard. It looks to me like we pushed out a person who might have had an open mind, which is also sad.</p>

<p>What he did was bad. My philosophy on <a href="/r/constpiratard">/r/constpiratard</a> is to ignore them to the fullest extent. But solidwhetstone went a step beyond that by legitimizing their behavior. I was here before their subreddit even existed and have seen all their bullshit, but it hasn&#39;t had detrimental effects because <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has tried to ignore them completely. That&#39;s not the case anymore by having one of the mods here reach out to them and given them a platform. </p>

<p>Add to that that he doesn&#39;t even recognize what he did wrong and the only remorse he feels is that people got upset over it. There are a shitload of good people here who have a clearer understanding of the situation and deserve to be mods way before him.</p>

<p>&amp; all you have to do is look at his history, &amp; if your not a selective reader you&#39;ll see there are plenty like him here to jump on the -scumbag israeli Gov.- hating bandwagon, ignoring other scumbag governments like say NK (but that&#39;s another rant altogether) and just quote Hitler, blaming &quot;Jews&quot; for everything.</p>

<p>I know zionism exists, I know the Israeli Gov. are quite devious, what I don&#39;t know is what the point of relating world problems to jews, we could just say bankers, the 1%, all kinds of labels, but pointing out their ethnicity/religion shouldn&#39;t make anyone wonder why you get written off once you go that route.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the heads of the Federal Reserve for the past 50 years have all been Jewish.</p>

<p>&amp; every president until obama has been white christian, china all chinese bankers have been chinese, what did I achieve by pointing that out? What is the solution to pointing out jews apparently have held a majority of financial/economic positions? Do we make it illegal for jews to have such jobs since them being criminals &amp; apparently all part of a system of the 1% makes them so hard to persecute, well Germany tried that, the Nuremburg laws, &amp; since you claim to not to be antisemitic I doubt you want that.</p>

<p>IN SD Jr&#39;s case he is religiously jewish, in Netanyahu&#39;s case he is ethnically hebrew &amp; religiously jewish, so when people criticise jews without context like the comment I linked to you calling it racist isn&#39;t an impossibility, you seem to ignore this. &amp; your statement; </p>

<p>Replacing Muslims with jews as you were making the point, could be considered, &amp; I was just pointing it out that calling unspecified &quot;jew counting&quot; racist is not incorrect, be specific which jews, then if you do, why does their ethnicity, or religion  matter at all if you&#39;ve identified them? Why is that so hard to answer?</p>

<p>Lastly why do you find one point I made that isn&#39;t incorrect &amp; twist it to look ugly then ignore an easier question?

<p>You might believe that applies to you &amp; the people you seem to be defending only but it doesn&#39;t, it applies to everyone, &amp; pointing out Bernanke, Greenspan, whomever of your last 5 &quot;Jews&quot; might seem like free speech, &amp; for the sake of argument lets say it is, let&#39;s pretend it&#39;s bad 5 men are apparently jewish &amp; that&#39;s somehow different than any given US president being Christian, the comment I linked you still isn&#39;t free speech it&#39;s clearly hate speech &amp; like I said a small group of people here are disrespectful if you disagree.</p>
