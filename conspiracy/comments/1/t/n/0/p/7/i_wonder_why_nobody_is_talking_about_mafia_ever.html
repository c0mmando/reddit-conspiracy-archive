        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think that Conspiracy posters are missing a lot of informations, simply because are not interested in discussions about mafia. Mafia is a huge italian criminal organization. They are pretty much the owners of all the South of Italy. And now they have the same power as Freemasons have in the US. They have a lot of politicians, scientists, billionaires, mass media, corporations that are directly connected with them. I can even add that the Italian Mafia probably was involved in the 9/11 too, as any other suspected organization.</p>

<p>The same goes for other nationality based criminal organizations capable of operating in the US. They have billiions of money, political protections, contacts with mass media and ecetera, even if you don&#39;t see them on television. The world has changed. And for worse.</p>

<p>As soon as you  will realise that organized crime has evolved to the same levels as freemasonry is in the US, it would be easier to understand that the end of free world is relatively near. We probably will all be dead when this will happen, but it is obvious that one day normal people will wake up right in the Sodom and Gomorrah land.</p>

<p>No,You can&#39;t say this,  becoz, while &#39;the mafia&#39; <em>is</em> an &#39;organized crime&#39; group, the &#39;other&#39; organized crime &#39;groups&#39; i.e LAPD, CIA, NSA, etc cannot correctly be called &quot;the Mafia&quot; as it applies <em>specifically</em> to the organized crime <em>families</em> of <em>Italian</em>, originally from Sicilia and Calabria</p>

<p>TL:DR: the term; &quot;The <em>Mafia</em>,&quot;  can <em>only</em> be correctly used when describing <em>Italian</em> gangsters</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to a link I saw a while back - that I&#39;m actually too lazy to see if I can find at this point - the original mafia actually wasn&#39;t Italian at all, but Jewish, believe it or not...so there&#39;s that.  Take that for whatever it&#39;s worth.</p>

<p>Regardless of origins, however, the fact of the matter is that as far as &quot;organized crime cartels&quot; go, the <em>real</em> mafia is indeed TPTB and their government, police state, CIA, NSA, military minions (and, yes, even &quot;Italian&quot; mafia) that do all their dirty work for them whether they know it or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which is actually ironic because organized crime had historically always been a way for poor immigrants to come to the US and get involved in business they never would have been able to in the &quot;upperworld&quot;. It took a couple generations, but now all the grandsons and great grandchildren of mobsters at the Keavhoffer(sp?) Hearings have big stakes in legitimate businesses. </p>

<p>Yet all those legitimate business owners prior to 1920 (or the Fed) just created more and more carefully camouflaged illicit business after that point (it seems like that anyway).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. The Mafia are nothing more than mere pawns as are all the other low level players in the game.</p>

<p>Pablo Escobar may have thought he had it all with his women and money and mansion and blah blah blah, but how did he die?</p>

<p>He was shot to death trying to run across rooftops from the police.</p>

<p>People who get killed like that are not masters of the game, they are PAWNS.</p>

<p>This is why nobody talks about the mafia anymore, because they&#39;re puppets just like every other black market criminal organization that the government allows to exist to benefit their own agendas and wallets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I know. But I am tired of hearing it everytime. I think people wathed too much of The Godfather, or Goodfellas, and decided that mafia, or other criminal organization is only about simple crooks, gangsters, and killers living on the street. It was this way only in the beginning. Only Freemasons were ruling the US then. But soon after, especially during the era of prohibition, organized crime was able to earn so much money that they basically become the rulers of the US, on the same level of Freemasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And on that day, 11/22/63, La Cosa Nostra/The Mafia/The Outfit lost a lot of it&#39;s might in the eyes of this country... a lot of people know JFK was killed by Bush/Shadow government (with LBJ), and if not, they have an idea....But on that day these people (the military industrial complex, along with their Pentagon/CIA) showed they will kill (and kill anyone) who attempts to tarnish or destroy them.</p>

<p>That&#39;s now the real frightening power.  Maybe prior to that it was Curly Humphries and Tony Accardo... But after JFK, the real evil was in our government.</p>

<p>The Cartel is just like the Mafia, the highest ranking members of both organizations are SHIT to the people who are really at the top, and they use them as PAWNS.</p>

<p>That is why they die being gunned down in the streets or assassinated in their homes and their families raped and murdered as well. Happens to the Cartel, Mafia, KKK, Neo-Nazis, etc. </p>
