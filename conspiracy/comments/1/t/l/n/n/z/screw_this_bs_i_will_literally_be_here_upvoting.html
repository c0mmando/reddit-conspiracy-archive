      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The language of the totalist environment is characterized by the thought-terminating cliché. The most far-reaching and complex of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive, definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed. These become the start and finish of any ideological analysis.

       There is a sort of forced orthodoxy on this sub which stems from a reflexive denial of the merit of any opposing viewpoint. Much like in societies like China or North Korea where any ideologies save for the ones espoused by the powers that be are violently suppressed.

       You didn't stop the thought in my mind, you swayed other people's opinions with one quick easy substanceless line. Its not just in this subreddit that I have a problem with these, memes like "so brave" and "circlejerk" are used solely to make people who hold a popular opinion feel embarrassed without arguing against the opinion itself. As for the rest of your analysis, its wrong since you dont actually have a sound argument, only comparing popular opinion in and of itself and not whether it holds merit.

       It has happened for a long time. This isn't even the first crises. I joined this place when the entire Mod team was temporarily banned by one rogue Mod. The fact that in the face of that, the mods are just sitting idly while half the forum goes ballistic out of reasonable concerns, is what i find surprising.

       Ive always wondered what it takes to become a mod. Every other place I go, mods are usually unpaid committed users of the site.
      </p>
      <p>
       On this subreddit at least, the opposite is true. I hardly ever see a mod post or contribute. They only seem to come out of the woodworks when we bitch at them for sucking.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example I just saw solidwhestones posts and even he admitted he browses through the comments only a few times a week and had "no idea" of the antisemisim being force-bled into this subreddit.

       The thing is, why are we, the supposedly open minded, stand up against the man types relying on mods to regulate this subreddit?  We have the power of our own voting...if more of us were simply vigilant about participating we would hardly need mods for dealing with (I HATE this term...) shills.

       That seems to be the vast majority of what you do. Point fingers over the fence, or say "vote brigading" if something controversial gets downvoted.

       I havent checked it out recently(on phone), its sad that people dedicate so much time and effort to mocking people they disagree with, I dont like most pop music but I wouldnt go out of my way to spend every waking hour trolling them, that would make me even more pathetic in some ways.

       You guys should go over there more often. See what it's all about. Looking at the front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       right now, practically the only content do to with
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is to do with the ridiculous witch hunt some guys have churned up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest is links from imgur / facebook / youtube, etc. So really, when I hear about how
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       wants to "destroy
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       " it holds about much water as a bucket with a hole in it. They could drop every reference to you guys, and lose what, 10 - 15% of their content.

       All that is done is someone posts a link... which is just what you do. So, if it's brigading, then YOU are brigading.
      </p>
      <p>
       I note that you never did respond to why claiming a brigade based on downvotes is idiotic... and if that is your only "evidence", you're on very shaky ground. (if you have any other evidence, then take it to the admins... it's very against the rules)

       In other words, you have no evidence and you're simply doing exactly what you accuse others of doing... and if it's brigading when they do it, then it's brigading when you do it.

      <p>
       Perhaps the mods here should ban you, since you are openly trying to organise brigades...

       Since you're doing exactly what you accuse others of, and since you claim that is brigading... then that's exactly what you're doing.

      <p>
       Ditto for r/conspiratard... except you personally are very obsessed with their conversations. (and you keep on trying to brigade them... I mean, that
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       what posting a link to another sub is, right?)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We simply want them to stay over there.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why? Aside from the usual people from both sides acting like dicks, why do you want any dissenting opinions excluded? Is this just your wish, or do you speak for the whole sub? (and if you do, this sub really does not respect other views and opinions...)

      <p>
       Remind me to not try using any kind of sarcasm of humour with you... they wouldn't ban you because brigading of any kind is not mentioned in the sub rules here so what you are doing is perfectly fine by the mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny that... the sub that complains about it is fine with it, the sub constantly accused of it is the one with the rules/regs against it. (and you still have not provided any evidence at all for a brigade going on... and downvotes don't work for that, unless this subreddit is a singular hivemind that never disagrees with itself.)

       You do realize people get paid to sit around on the internet to manipulate various forms of social media right?  I mean, you can't really be so nieve to think that every thing that happens to become popular on reddit happens organically, can you?  So what I'm saying is, the answer to your question, "Why upvote posts that you don't like?"  is, clearly, money...

       Ok then, I clearly didn't/don't understand what you are saying then.  Who do you think are upvoting posts they don't like?  That also dosn't make sense to me...I guess it made so little sense to me that I thought you meant "Why are unpopular posts on r/conspiracy getting so many upvotes if the community seems to not like them?"  I see now that you and I are already on the same page as to why this would happen.

        I come to this sub less and less. The minority of people who have an opinion I don't have ruined it.  Luckily in the past five* years I've learned almost all I really need to know.

        For some really good, disagreement-free discussion, try
        <a href="http://memoryholeblog.com/">

        </a>
        It's especially good on Sandy Hoax. Owner James Tracy does not publish comments containing dissenting opinions.

       Aint that the truth! And I love how some people think people belive in conspiracy theories in general because it's easy and comforting... It's so ironic, because they're basicly beliving their own lies because it's comforting. For them it's the conspiracy theorists that are crazy, not the world we live in or the belief systems that govern us.

       RES tagging assists me to upvote or downvote more swiftly, because I can zone in concentration &amp; analyze who is who quicker.
      </p>
      <p>
       I RES tag trolls and shills to flag them, so as to downvote or ignore them, depending on the severity included in descriptions assisted by the colors of my tags.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I tag a redditor, I often add a "permalink" link to the RES tag pointing to a post that caused the tag.
      </p>
      <p>
       RES tagging is a great tool to mark positive &amp; negative posters that stand out.
      </p>
      <p>
       RES tags help me to know other redditors more deeply &amp; to sort mindsets I find healthy &amp; ill.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO if all used RES tagging then many that are widely considered shills &amp; trolls would not gain traction easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       If tons of comments in a thread are made, then tags of posters I enjoy reading stick out like easily like finding a neon blinking waldo in a room of time sucking confusion due to waldos regular bland stripes [u/whomever] blending easily in the crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       RES tagging opens the opportunity for group participation of no longer needed mod instituted bans by sorting &amp; shunning @ user level.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it fun &amp; interesting to see redditors whom I mark with probationary caution as potentially negative to sometimes make positive comments I upvote &amp; agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is IMO important to give users a cautionary chance if they are not blatantly acting negatively &amp; merely slightly negative. On more than one occasion I have changed a yellow or red tag to a green one.

       I only have a tiny handful that I downvote
       <em>
        almost
       </em>
       no matter what they post, to label spot them to easily seek them out to shun them as they act continually in ill fashion. These few redditors consist of foul rude posters that are IMO very very ill not adding to discussion ever that I have seen &amp; only after many strikes have they slowly made their way to becoming marked as such.
       <em>
        I still glance to read their comments before I downvote
       </em>
       , but do not need to spend as much time making the determination to downvote.
       <em>
        I imagine that if one day I read real change in their ways
       </em>
       then they have a chance to lose such a tag.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not immediately mark anyone for a heat seeking and almost instant downvote due to a first seen ill comment, as it takes much to get there. I think all humans have ill days where all individuals behave ignorantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: Racist comments I often mark descriptively to slowly sort out hard core racists from a person whom may have had a recent spell of acting out in a racist way. If a purple persons wife got raped by a green dude it is normal to have some racist stereotype behavior toward all green people to vent off tension to release. I do not condone such behavior, but I suspect all humans likely on rare occasion act in such a wide paint stroking ill way upon entire groups of others once in a while. A hardcore racist is not often worth my time to converse a position of tolerance to, whereas a person whom simply uses a racial slur once in a while often is worth sharing my energy in such a way with. NOTE: I do find most extreme racist of all types are often very deep rational thinkers in other areas of topic &amp; I do often upvote people that would likely hate me or others in person only on surface value.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate the ignorance often displayed by David Duke &amp; Louis Farrakhan, but find both on occasion to be very intelligent in positional points. I do not subscribe to their main positions, but I imagine both on occasion would get a few upvote points from me. Every word they utter is not ill like those on my tiny see change or likely shell &amp; shun to destroy list.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most often my RES tags just attempt to assist me to get to know peoples mindsets &amp; positional postures.  Extremes &amp; noteworthy positions can be labeled with RES &amp; I find it most helpful. I often label political positions if seemingly stuck like glue to one position in ill fashion no matter what.  I would label my self hostile toward police, military, illite, politics &amp; much other stuff, mostly of the ill machine. I often label seemingly anti homosexuality haters &amp; pro homosexuality extremists, whereas most when discussing the topic of homosexuality are not either of those extremes &amp; not worthy of a RES tag of any sort to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is often helpful to know peoples key areas of hard like &amp; dislike interests: aliens, freemasons, illuminati, banking, police state, ill machine, greed, eN-S-A, anti war &amp; pro war type stuff.

       No. You have only conceded that the CESARE memo refutes the NIST report. This is literally the first time you've said that you don't have the knowledge to refute the memo. So how could I previously accept this "answer" when it didn't exist before?

       You don't even need "knowledge" to understand some of the points made by CESARE. For example.

       "when the beam subsequently buckles, it is also REMOVED from the analysis. This is quite unrealistic."

      <p>
       Did beams vanish in the actual collapse once they buckled? No. They did not.

       This is where the evidence points. Sorry you don't understand it. Or at least pretend to not understand it so that you don't have to deal with it. But that's the way it is.

       There is no blatant attmept to subvert the sub. Were that true he would have acted via sockpuppets or pms. I believe it to be an innocent attmept at reconciliation and a truly honest fact-finding mission.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way I can see it being an attempt at subversion is if all the people calling for his head are his sockpuppets. If they get their way, the door becomes open to more stringent posting rules and wider weilding of the banhammer. That is a big stretch and a great crazy conspiracy theory in itself! Certainly untrue, though, right?

       Aint that the truth! And I love how some people think people belive in conspiracy theories in general because it's easy and comforting... It's so ironic, because they're basicly beliving their own lies because it's comforting. For them it's the conspiracy theorists that are crazy, not the world we live in or the belief systems that govern us.

       In other words, you have no evidence and you're simply doing exactly what you accuse others of doing... and if it's brigading when they do it, then it's brigading when you do it.

       I only have a tiny handful that I downvote
       <em>
        almost
       </em>
       no matter what they post, to label spot them to easily seek them out to shun them as they act continually in ill fashion. These few redditors consist of foul rude posters that are IMO very very ill not adding to discussion ever that I have seen &amp; only after many strikes have they slowly made their way to becoming marked as such.
       <em>
        I still glance to read their comments before I downvote
       </em>
       , but do not need to spend as much time making the determination to downvote.
       <em>
        I imagine that if one day I read real change in their ways
       </em>
       then they have a chance to lose such a tag.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not immediately mark anyone for a heat seeking and almost instant downvote due to a first seen ill comment, as it takes much to get there. I think all humans have ill days where all individuals behave ignorantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: Racist comments I often mark descriptively to slowly sort out hard core racists from a person whom may have had a recent spell of acting out in a racist way. If a purple persons wife got raped by a green dude it is normal to have some racist stereotype behavior toward all green people to vent off tension to release. I do not condone such behavior, but I suspect all humans likely on rare occasion act in such a wide paint stroking ill way upon entire groups of others once in a while. A hardcore racist is not often worth my time to converse a position of tolerance to, whereas a person whom simply uses a racial slur once in a while often is worth sharing my energy in such a way with. NOTE: I do find most extreme racist of all types are often very deep rational thinkers in other areas of topic &amp; I do often upvote people that would likely hate me or others in person only on surface value.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate the ignorance often displayed by David Duke &amp; Louis Farrakhan, but find both on occasion to be very intelligent in positional points. I do not subscribe to their main positions, but I imagine both on occasion would get a few upvote points from me. Every word they utter is not ill like those on my tiny see change or likely shell &amp; shun to destroy list.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most often my RES tags just attempt to assist me to get to know peoples mindsets &amp; positional postures.  Extremes &amp; noteworthy positions can be labeled with RES &amp; I find it most helpful. I often label political positions if seemingly stuck like glue to one position in ill fashion no matter what.  I would label my self hostile toward police, military, illite, politics &amp; much other stuff, mostly of the ill machine. I often label seemingly anti homosexuality haters &amp; pro homosexuality extremists, whereas most when discussing the topic of homosexuality are not either of those extremes &amp; not worthy of a RES tag of any sort to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is often helpful to know peoples key areas of hard like &amp; dislike interests: aliens, freemasons, illuminati, banking, police state, ill machine, greed, eN-S-A, anti war &amp; pro war type stuff.
