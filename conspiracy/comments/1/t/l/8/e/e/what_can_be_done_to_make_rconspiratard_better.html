<p>Provide evidence for claims.  </p>

<p>Whenever they show up here they use the same 2-3 arguments, never with any citation.  </p>

<p>&quot;This place is racist and its upvoted.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;This place is anti-semetic and its upvoted.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;This place never has any evidence and posts about [insert crazy bullshithere] are upvoted.&quot;</p>

<p>Listen, in a sub with 204k people, 2-3 upvotes doesn&#39;t count.  Just link to the comments/threads in question and let us see if you actually have a point.  If you don&#39;t have a specific gripe, why bother?  </p>

<p>That&#39;s why people here don&#39;t like it, not because its critical (we all understand that some theories are crazy.  that doesn&#39;t mean &quot;not entertaining&quot;) but if it crosses the line into &quot;retarded&quot; you might want to, you know, demonstrate that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious why people have reacted so strongly and negatively over all of this. If they have good suggestions (not saying they do, but if) then why not consider them?  Some times your critic has insightful ideas. If not, ignore the bad ideas and move on. </p>

<p>There is only one group where examing the historical record is off limits.  If victors would have claimed 12 million died at Nurember then you would be making the same claim that historians are &quot;anti-semitic&quot; for questioning the 12 million number.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very strange that you think that the mainstream and official historians believes that 300,000 Jews were killed and there was no real genocide and the &quot;zionists&quot; are actually responsible.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, you are just being disingenuous. Could you imagine telling an Armenian that Turkey didnt really try to genocide them and it&#39;s blown out of proportion? And basing that information on things you&#39;ve gotten exclusively from people who are known to be racist against Armenians? Because that&#39;s literally your argument. You base it all on the IHR, a known anti-semitic organisation. Or on the ramblings of David Irving who later recanted all his statements. </p>

<p>The thing is, only in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is saying such ridiculous things about WWII death counts of Jews would be accepted, especially while spending almost 50% of your comment talking about how evil Israel is these days and how it&#39;s nazi germany or whatever gets upvoted here. You could get away with it in <a href="/r/whiterights">/r/whiterights</a>, I guess.</p>

<p>To anybody who understands that mainstram and official historians would shake their head in disgust at the idea that the Jews did not face genocide and there were no gas chambers and hitler was actually not as bad as people say.</p>

<p>Horrible trolls, whose focus is on criticizing <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, might have good ideas about how to improve <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  No?</p>

<p>We&#39;re not above reproach.  We disdain censorship.  Why not hear them out?  Keep the good ideas, toss the shitty ones.  They&#39;re not going to hypnotize us or charm us into compromising our ideals so what harm can come from entertaining that conversation?  Worst case - we walk away with zero good ideas and our jimmies get all rustled.  Best case - we have a pleasant conversation, get some possibly useful ideas, and selectively ignore the bad ideas.</p>

<p>Personally I could care less if <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> completely ignored this subreddit, as there&#39;s thousands of other more ridiculous things on the net as a whole that could be linked to there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the mainstream and official historians who revised down the number of Jewish dead by millions at Auschwitz are &quot;denying the suffering&quot; of millions of Jewish people?</p>

<p>There is only one group where examing the historical record is off limits.  If victors would have claimed 12 million died at Nurember then you would be making the same claim that historians are &quot;anti-semitic&quot; for questioning the 12 million number.</p>

<p>You&#39;re a troll bully that is trying to shut down legitimate debate here.</p>
