       Into people who think we can still do what we do here and people who want to do
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       than that. I still think we should move and so far no one else has taken the initiative to make another subreddit, etc And people didn't even like the last post I made about it.. or anyone's for that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are one of the last bastions of hope on the internet. There are many forums, platforms, and fish but reddit is where everyone comes. So either we decide to fight for this place in someway or we pick a better position to defend. This is a war, remember?
      </p>
      <p>
       Upvote if you want to move. Downvote if no. We'll find out what you guys really think. Please comment on why, if you please.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: So far, as you can see, this is 50/50. Merely offering the idea that we may invest some time into another base of operations seems to be completely unreasonable or unwarranted. Apparently nothing is wrong with r/conspiracy. Let's see how far this goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Update: Mods looking to recruit for r/conspiracy mods (30min after this post) . More hope or a diversion? I'm not sure. Better safe than sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT/UPDATE: I guess I can conclude from what's happening to this thread that there is
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       wrong with r/conspiracy and that we simply needed to be given the opportunity to choose different mods. I'll assume also that the quality of this sub has
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       gone down, is not filled with only links, instead of something progressive, and that it is all in my head.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck, r/conspiracy.

       "You guys"? Oh, you mean shills. I think it's equally important that there are people who stay and think there's
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       that can be done. But I think those who feel we should leave should also be a part of creating another community. In case. Better safe than sorry. I just wanted people's honest opinions and opinions are divisive, by nature. But we don't have to be divided.

       Again with the "you guys". Do you not think that there is a real threat this place may eventually overrun? Look at the rest of reddit. You think somehow, magically, r/conspiracy will be unscathed and now you
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       seem to be saying there is
       <em>
        no point

       Look: this is an honest assessment of opinion. I've noted all the other threads talking about moving being downvoted to oblivion or being a straight 50%. With all of the people so uncertain about r/conspiracy's and reddit's future, you'd think we'd have a more honest discussion about it. This is what I want, and I hope other people would too. We can't give up.. but I personally don't think we can stay here. And, if we do we'd need to have people step up and fight back against what's going on in earnest.

       Upvoted. I would move to another place, where trolls are banned and where ignorant and inane posts are considered trolling too. Especially where users are willing to share their own theories, instead of only bitching about what they were able to find on conspiracy sites, and that were written by others. I think that's all that is being wrong with this place now.

       You were the only person so far to contribute anything substantial. Thank you. That is exactly how I feel. So far people are using this place for news stories and some drama thrown in here and there. We need to admit there are many of us who don't think that's enough and there's no reason not to still have a news foundation such as this place -- but that it has to have better standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all a question and for people to shun these ideas -- to say it's all the same things -- it's because we're all regurgitating the same shit.

       Believe me, I know what you mean. It looks like this place is populated mainly by link posting bots, they are completely uncapable of own free thinking, because obviously are somehow deprived of deductive skills It is almost impossible to see anything constructive in threads, only bitching.

       I see the same issue. I find it prudent to draw a line in the sand on reddit as well as move things elsewhere. Yes, people will follow, but if we start from scratch or become even more discerning we can minimize more and more. I think people are scared of the realization that this is, technically, the real world. We're dissidents. People are following because some of what we're uncovering or discussing is important to our freedom.

       So you think that it's safer to yell and say, "It's divide and conquer oh noes!" rather than look at it how I'm actually presenting it: this place
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       being taken over, if it hasn't substantially been already. People are acquiescing and saying it's fine, we can fight, we can input a mod whatever. I get that, it's good. But don't dismiss the idea that there should be an alternative... redundancies are the key to survival. I see this place turning into beforeitsnews.

       Every few months a new subreddit or platform is made like this. Sometimes they are private, often they are heavily restricted (no shill, no vaccine, no lizard, whatever the creator thinks is the problem.

       I think people are underestimating what's going on in this subreddit. But if people want to keep their heads in the sand and not prepare.. then I guess we'll be scattered to some other place, caught unawares. I like to hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Oh well.

       So.. you couldn't just browse through my history? You'd rather me give you some long rant about how I see nothing substantial on r/conspiracy, shills everywhere or the number of other things that have been repeated?

       You are asking mke to consider what you say without giving anything to consider except some vague problem you don't bother to explain. There's little sense having a forum like this if it's all "Illuminati - Do the Research - Peace Out".

       So you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       want me to repeat the number of problems people have pointed out, including but not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        repetition of stories
       </li>
       <li>
        shills
       </li>
       <li>
        evidence of forum sliding
       </li>
       <li>
        down voting / erasure of popular posts
       </li>
       <li>
        no real discussion about the future of r/conspiracy
       </li>
