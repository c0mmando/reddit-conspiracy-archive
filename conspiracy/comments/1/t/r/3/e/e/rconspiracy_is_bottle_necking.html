I still think we should move and so far no one else has taken the initiative to make another subreddit, etc And people didn&#39;t even like the last post I made about it.. or anyone&#39;s for that matter. </p>

<p>You are one of the last bastions of hope on the internet. There are many forums, platforms, and fish but reddit is where everyone comes. So either we decide to fight for this place in someway or we pick a better position to defend. This is a war, remember?</p>

<p>Upvote if you want to move. Downvote if no. We&#39;ll find out what you guys really think. Please comment on why, if you please.</p>

<p>EDIT: So far, as you can see, this is 50/50. Merely offering the idea that we may invest some time into another base of operations seems to be completely unreasonable or unwarranted. Apparently nothing is wrong with r/conspiracy. Let&#39;s see how far this goes.</p>

<p>Update: Mods looking to recruit for r/conspiracy mods (30min after this post) . More hope or a diversion? I&#39;m not sure. Better safe than sorry. </p>

<p>EDIT/UPDATE: I guess I can conclude from what&#39;s happening to this thread that there is <em>nothing</em> wrong with r/conspiracy and that we simply needed to be given the opportunity to choose different mods. I&#39;ll assume also that the quality of this sub has <em>not</em> gone down, is not filled with only links, instead of something progressive, and that it is all in my head. </p>

<p>Good luck, r/conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again with the &quot;you guys&quot;. Do you not think that there is a real threat this place may eventually overrun? Look at the rest of reddit. You think somehow, magically, r/conspiracy will be unscathed and now you <em>both</em> seem to be saying there is <em>no point</em> in putting any resources into another base of operations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look: this is an honest assessment of opinion. I&#39;ve noted all the other threads talking about moving being downvoted to oblivion or being a straight 50%. With all of the people so uncertain about r/conspiracy&#39;s and reddit&#39;s future, you&#39;d think we&#39;d have a more honest discussion about it. This is what I want, and I hope other people would too. We can&#39;t give up.. but I personally don&#39;t think we can stay here. And, if we do we&#39;d need to have people step up and fight back against what&#39;s going on in earnest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You were the only person so far to contribute anything substantial. Thank you. That is exactly how I feel. So far people are using this place for news stories and some drama thrown in here and there.

<p>This is all a question and for people to shun these ideas -- to say it&#39;s all the same things -- it&#39;s because we&#39;re all regurgitating the same shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see the same issue. I find it prudent to draw a line in the sand on reddit as well as move things elsewhere. Yes, people will follow, but if we start from scratch or become even more discerning we can minimize more and more. I think people are scared of the realization that this is, technically, the real world. We&#39;re dissidents. People are following because some of what we&#39;re uncovering or discussing is important to our freedom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think that it&#39;s safer to yell and say, &quot;It&#39;s divide and conquer oh noes!&quot; rather than look at it how I&#39;m actually presenting it: this place <em>is</em> being taken over, if it hasn&#39;t substantially been already. People are acquiescing and saying it&#39;s fine, we can fight, we can input a mod whatever. I get that, it&#39;s good.
