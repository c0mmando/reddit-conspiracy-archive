<p>He&#39;s a mod at the disinfo site 911blogger.  Please see <a href="http://redactednews.blogspot.com/2010/10/911bloggercom-accused-is-leading-911.html">this</a>, which was published on the front page of the now defunct but great little newspaper, the <a href="http://www.rockcreekfreepress.com/">Rock Creek Free Press</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three of the most well-informed, articulate and prolific CIT supporters were banned simultaneously on May 24, 2010, while in the midst of a heated online debate with 911blogger moderator Erik Larson (aka Loose Nuke). Truth activist Stefan S. of London, England explains it:</p>

<p>“The exact moment that Adam Syed, Adam Ruff and I were banned, we were in mid-debate with Erik Larson. Nothing remotely offensive or rule breaking was being said by any one of us, let alone all three of us at the exact same time.</p>

<p>“What was happening was that Larson had been backed into a corner over a blog entry of his, which was a listing of what he claimed were witnesses to the plane flying south of the Citgo station prior to it striking the Pentagon.</p>

<p>“Not a single one of those witnesses even mentioned Citgo, it was just a collection of laughably tenuous arguments for why ambiguous witness statements must be supportive of the official story. The list was submitted to an intensive analysis and it was shown conclusively that none of the witnesses supported the official flight path, that the list included several witnesses who stated that the plane flew to the north of Citgo, and most strikingly, several who explicitly stated that they were not even in the vicinity at the time of the attack.</p>

<p>“The discussion was drifting into increasingly embarrassing territory for Larson when — presto — all three of us were banned and Larson, in a completely childish fashion, proceeded to have the “last word” in full knowledge that he had just stopped the people he was addressing from being able to respond.</p>

<p>“Larson’s articles are disinformation; the information he puts out there is deliberately false with a motive to undermine genuine research. 911blogger is no longer a 9/11 truth site, that much is clear.”</p>

<p>You keep bringing up a small incident, but 911blogger have done so unbelievably much throughout the years. You think their shunning of the &quot;no plane theory&quot; warrants your disinfo accusations? A small gripe like that shouldn&#39;t make you attack them this much.

<p>You didn&#39;t go to <a href="http://redactednews.blogspot.com/2010/10/911bloggercom-accused-is-leading-911.html">the link</a> did you?  If you had, you&#39;d know that it&#39;s not just one incident.  It&#39;s a consistent pattern over the years to shut out the most incriminating aspects of 9/11 truth.  </p>

<p>You seem to be intentionally misunderstanding me, which makes me doubt your sincerity.  It&#39;s not just no plane theories.  It&#39;s the banning of supporters of <a href="http://www.citizeninvestigationteam.com/">CIT</a>, <a href="http://www.pilotsfor911truth.org/">Pilots for Truth</a>, and anyone with an account at WTCdemolition. It&#39;s <a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2011-02-10/critique-david-ray-griffin-s-911-fake-calls-theory">attacking authors like David Ray Griffin</a>.  </p>

<p>I am 100% convinced that 911blogger is controlled opposition, and so are many others.  See this:</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>The article is 2,367 words.  That&#39;s not exactly a book.  So rather than continue to argue with me, please just read it.  Yes, those are serious accusations and I&#39;m dead serious about them.  I have the evidence and will go up against anyone who wants to dispute me. For starters, here&#39;s an excerpt from that article.</h2>

<p>In part because of this decision by 911blogger, to reject Barrie Zwicker’s endorsement of CIT while publishing a childish hit piece from an anonymous source, Southern California 9/11 truth activist and We Are Change LA member Adam Ruff wrote:</p>

<p><strong>“In my view it is now 100% confirmed that 911blogger is an enemy of the truth movement as a whole and is engaged in an open campaign of attack on good truthers.”</strong></p>

<p>The RCFP interviewed Zwicker via email </p>

<p>RCFP: What do you find most compelling about CIT’s work?</p>

<p>Zwicker: A historically significant deception has been revealed by these eyewitnesses. The simplicity of CIT’s findings is also significant, as they don’t lend themselves to being undermined by obfuscations or convoluted scientific discussion. It comes down to this: South side of the gas station = official story, North side = inside job. Not even CIT’s detractors have found a way around this, try as they might. Any honest person who watches the interviews has to agree that the plane was on the north side proving inside job. It’s as good an example as any of critical truth, the primary goal of the 9/11 Truth movement.</p>

<p>RCFP: What do you make of those who say they appreciate CIT’s work but do not think they proved “flyover?”</p>

<p>Zwicker: Commercial airliners cannot make startling turns to left or right in such limited airspace, nor can they vanish into thin air. Flyover is the only rational explanation, not to mention that CIT provides a witness who saw the plane flying away. If this ever gets to a fair and uncorrupted court of law, I am as confident as I am of anything, that such a court will determine this plane overflew the Pentagon.</p>

<p>RCFP: Have you read the criticisms of CIT’s work from Arabesque, Jim Hoffman and Victoria Ashley, and do you think they have merit?</p>

<p>Zwicker: They lack merit because they do not provide counter-evidence. They have no firsthand eyewitness interviews from people who specifically place the plane to the south side of the gas station. Those I could weigh against the eyewitnesses interviewed by CIT. As far as I can see, Arabesque, whoever that is (I don’t care for anonymity), Hoffman and Ashley have provided none at all. They take snippets of third-hand printed media quotes, none of which are actually South of Citgo witnesses, just statements by people who said they saw the plane hit the building. Indeed, one particular detractor blog by “Caustic Logic” quotes a few people as “witnesses” who were not even in the area at the time of the attack! One was in North Carolina, arrived in DC the afternoon of 9/11, saw the downed light poles, and was thus presented as a “light pole witness.” This is in a blog entry titled “The South Path Impact: Documented.”</p>

<p>RCFP: What conclusions do you draw from 911blogger refusing to post your endorsement of CIT?</p>

<p>Zwicker: Actually, my endorsement was briefly posted for about 30 minutes, then withdrawn. It’s painful for me to learn that 911blogger, which I consider to be the premiere 9/11Truth site, is censoring CIT and those who support CIT. Even more distressing is that 911blogger has failed to censor some quite rude comments about CIT’s work and its team members. So it’s clearly one-sided. One conclusion that can be drawn is that there are players behind the scenes who have prevailed upon the moderators at 911blogger to stultify CIT and its findings. Since the censorship is so blatant and carries with it obvious penalties in the form of loss of credibility, those behind the censorship orders must really have their knickers in a knot about something. It’s a clear sign that those who control that website are trying to control thought when it comes to the Pentagon. Most people in the truth movement that I talk to in the real world are agreed that no plane hit the Pentagon. That the most visited 9/11 truth website would be so hostile towards evidence that supports this widely held belief within the ranks of Truthers is at the least disconcerting.</p>

<p>A little more than a month after Zwicker’s endorsement of CIT was rejected, the situation repeated itself, when retired NASA aeronautical engineer Dwain Deets recorded a video endorsement of CIT on August 30, 2010 and submitted it to 911blogger. Once again, 911blogger refused, without explanation, to post the endorsement of a highly qualified professional.</p>

<p>Prior to 911blogger rejecting these video endorsements from Zwicker and Deets, nearly all users at 911blogger who were vocal in their support of CIT had been banned. An informal poll easily came up with 25 former users of 911blogger who had been banned without explanation—about half of whom are CIT supporters.</p>

<p>I can assure you that they are very much aware of this thread and probably discussing it right now and trying to figure out who I am and how to discredit me.  <a href="/u/9-11-2001">/u/9-11-2001</a> (who claimed below to be a mod at blogger) will not be back anytime soon.  He has no response other than that they are a fake 9-11 truth site that allows plenty of discussion of the WTC because that crime can never be pinned on anyone in particular.  (They could always claim that freedom-hating Arabs got jobs on the cleaning crew.)</p>

<p>But a <strong>faked plane crash at the Pentagon</strong> can definitely be pinned on real live people who are enjoying the booty their participation in 9-11 earned them, and don&#39;t want to dragged through the streets by an angry mob any time soon.   Hence the concerted effort to keep that fact under wraps. </p>

<p>This idea that if we can’t prove a 757 didn’t hit the Pentagon then we should default to the official story is absurd. Why does the OS get a pass, just because it can’t be proven wrong? Why doesn’t it have to be proven right? Aren’t there enough questions about the Pentagon – involving proof or not – to support a new investigation? Isn’t that the goal?</p>

<p>At the bottom of his statement, Gage refers readers to several articles that he says will help them understand why he has soured on CIT. One of them is called “Debating What Hit the Pentagon: Exaggeration, Name-calling, and Threats” by Gregg Roberts. This article, which appeared on 911Blogger, is a response to an article in the Rock Creek Free Press accusing 911Blogger of working against 9/11 Truth.</p>

<p>In the article, Roberts suggests that “the complainers” as he calls the authors of the article were told how to behave, failed to listen, and then were told why they were banned. I don’t know if this is a fair account, but I know that I was banned after just two weeks as a member of the site, and I called no one names. I was also never given a reason for the banning – not even a response to my query on the subject. I doubt that I’m alone.</p>

<p>By jumping in bed with 911Blogger, Gage seriously damages his credibility on this issue. This site regularly bashes CIT while not allowing CIT to respond because they’ve been banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;This article is a response to “Is Leading 9/11 Truth Site Working For The Other Side?”, credited to “staff writers” at the Rock Creek Free Press, November 2010 edition, available at:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rockcreekfreepress.com/CreekV4No11-Web.pdf">http://www.rockcreekfreepress.com/CreekV4No11-Web.pdf</a></p>

<p>The “leading 9/11 Truth site” being referred to is 911Blogger.com. The authors of the article critiqued here chose to remain anonymous, and the article’s title doesn’t lend itself to an easily pronounceable acronym. Therefore I will refer to the article’s authors, along with their vocal message board sympathizers and Barrie Zwicker, as The Complainers. We will abbreviate Citizen Investigation Team as “CIT” and their video National Security Alert as “NSA” (noting the irony).</p>

<p>I normally prefer the high ground when it comes to accusations regarding intentions. However, since the Complainers routinely impute sinister motives to their critics, the reader must consider whether that behavior is more consistent with an intention to support or subvert the overall agenda of the 9/11 Truth Movement.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: The Complainers’ fallacies, confusion of facts with conclusions, absurdly improper emphasis on a controversial issue, and various forms of emotional manipulation have gone on long enough. We call upon them all, one more time, to retract and stop their personal attacks, stop rehashing the same arguments, and start taking a scientific and legal approach. Until they do that, and much more conclusive evidence regarding the Pentagon is released than has been released so far, the evidence for the controlled demolition of World Trade Center Building 7 and the Twin Towers will remain the centerpieces of a rational call for a real 9/11 investigation.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>if what they do is vote brigading, then what SRS does is vote brigading. And SRS will never go. No matter how hard you pretend it&#39;s organised vote brigades it&#39;s really just a parody sub of this sub with a much smaller usercount. You can tell from the Whetstone drama recently that the vast majority of vote patterns support the &quot;whetstone is a traitor and must go&quot;. So I dunno.</p>

<p>Whereas when someone linked to the thread of Whetstone talking in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, is that vote brigading? Of course not, it&#39;s just linking to a page. And your post here is currently at a positive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t run the sub. The two are both sub-reddits. They frequently link to infowars and other silly conspiracies, but roughly 30-40% of the links seem to be from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. What does that prove? And why 1%? Because I can&#39;t think of many bigger places to find and discuss conspiracy theories than a sub with 204k subbed members on the same website your community belongs to. Your 1 percent figure is a bit confusing.</p>

<p>And anyway, if what they&#39;re doing is inciting vote brigading, aren&#39;t you doing the exact same thing by linking back to them? I just don&#39;t really get it. The admins clearly define vote brigading as requiring an incentive (like how <a href="/r/niggers">/r/niggers</a> posts used to be like &quot;hey come help me yell at this black guy&quot; in the titles). Linking to other sub-reddits does not break the site-wide rules, otherwise this sockpuppet would&#39;ve been banned.</p>

<p>Anyway I don&#39;t think you really understand what vote brigading is. If SRS is still around then you&#39;re never be able too get a tiny parody sub-reddit banned just by linking to them over and over on an alt account. </p>

<p>Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can&#39;t do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Similar things were said about 9000sins. There was even an instance where a long-time inactive mod (who outranked everyone but illuminatedwax) logged in to see what had become of the place and fired all the mods. 9000sins was reinstated at the bottom of the ranking (below automoderator and uncensorship), he&#39;s now inched his way back up to 4th listed mod. And yet... the rules... almost all of them, but especially <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tr1oz/what_all_this_controversy_really_means_rule_10/">rule 10</a>, were written almost exclusively by 9000sins. After that mass firing, he became less of a drama showboat. I can&#39;t help wondering what was said to him in the aftermath of that by the likes of illuminatedwax and EnglishMunichFan that got him to finally accept his position as &quot;not the boss of this place&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyway, my point here is: overzealous mods aren&#39;t going to go away. There&#39;s still one waiting in the wings for his chance to rule the day once again.</p>

<p>That you&#39;re a beloved mod who the people of THIS subreddit don&#39;t want to lose? What UTTER NONSENSE.</p>

<p>All this shows is that you are seen as some sort of great hero by the trolls at r/conspiratard, presumably for trying to further fill this sub with their garbage spam, disinfo and personal attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a> needs to go.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll basically repeat what I&#39;ve been saying over the past few days. What we need from new mods <strong>more than anything</strong> is to remove the <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> trolls.</p>

<p>Due to the influence of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> here any objective reading of what needs to be done to improve <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is <strong>obfuscated</strong>. Discussions are tainted with phony posts and unbalanced voting patterns. One can stroll over to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and see that their frontpage is a majority of posts regarding <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and how they even brag about trolling users here with their <strong>sockpuppet</strong> accounts.</p>

<p><a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a> unfortunately seems to have <strong>encouraged</strong> this infiltration. What I&#39;m hearing from this post is that he will, under no circumstances be removed. This seems to be a mistake given the extent of his unconscious ignorance(or worse, his conscious approval) of this <strong>infiltration</strong>.</p>

<p>I would like to take on a moderation position for the purpose of removing the troll infestation. I spend a few hours everyday on Reddit after work that I would dedicate this time to the removal of <a href="/r/conspiratards">/r/conspiratards</a>. This will <strong>greatly</strong> improve <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in all aspects and should be the <strong>foremost action</strong> for new moderators. I can also say there is no <strong>&quot;good ole boys&quot;</strong> club or <strong>&quot;thin blue line&quot;</strong> with me. I will not hesitate to hold other moderators accountable in front of this community.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Mission Complete</p>

<p>Over the past few days <strong>I</strong>&#39;ve had the pleasure of being commissioned for a job that was simple enough: the forcing from power of <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a>. This has been <strong>a m</strong>ajor success. The game was basic, to create multiple accounts to influence and hijack the narrative against <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a>.</p>

<p>We radicalize the user base to achieve two ends: splinter the subreddit into smaller, private subreddits, and create enough discord to both remove <strong>solidwhetstone</strong> and become open to new, Israel-friendly moderators with pressure from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. It is too late to stop this.</p>

<p>The truth is, its always easy to turn you against yourselves. The end result is always the same in these things: You either end up in our control or you break up into seperate groups with little influence. The fix is in, gentlemen. Shalom.</p>

<p>He claimed he was involved in an operation to divide the community and hijack the opposition to solidwhetstone to so people would go to different subs, etc.  </p>

<p>It can&#39;t tell if he had his account hijacked or if he was actually engaging in this operation or if he was feigning this as a joke.</p>

<p>No banning posts about meta reddit censorship. No banning users if you want to insult the mods. Automod will never be trained to remove a user&#39;s posts and or comments. Automod will never be targeted to remove key words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think so. Heck, people are being nominated right now to do that very thing. </p>

<p>I think the reason whetstone isn&#39;t removing himself is because in his eye he still thinks he hasn&#39;t done anything wrong. If he were to step down that would be admitting that he was wrong. But if someone were elected and fired him from the mod position, then it would be out of his hands if you will. He keeps his integrity, and is removed from the mod list, which makes the subreddit happy. </p>

<p>Like i said, he he were to step down he would be admitting he was wrong, which he doesn&#39;t think he was. But if it were the decision of someone superior to him saying something like &quot;your antics are hurting the community&quot;, then he can comply on that basis of someone above him being in charge.</p>

If he&#39;s delusional that excuse could maybe fly. This isn&#39;t North Korea. This isn&#39;t complicated in any way. People have explained in detail just what exactly he did wrong and why he needs to go. All this political pussyfooting is a slap in the face of the whole community and what it tells us loud and clear is the rest of the mods are in on it too and part of the same problem, because by your own line of reasoning if one of the existing mods thought solidwhetstone did wrong and needed to go, they would have removed him already. </p>

<p>Here he&#39;s worried about &quot;haters&quot; accusing <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> of witch hunts and disrupting reddit. It&#39;s pretty clear these &quot;haters&quot; are outsiders. That&#39;s who he wants to appease. He wants to &quot;clean up&quot; <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and make concessions in hopes that outsiders will stop hating us. No thanks. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not &quot;pushing an agenda&quot; to try and stop a virtual mob from tarring and feathering innocent people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The (alleged) mob was not threatening <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. If our mods are protecting anyone, it should be us. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like the phrase &quot;pushing an agenda&quot; perhaps a different phrase would be better. But if you or I had our own just causes we would not have the same tools available to us. </p>

<p>I think I see where you are coming from. If I were mod I would feel morally obligated to try and stop innocent people from being harassed because of simple confusion. I would also be aware that allowing it to continue unhindered would not only reflect badly on the users you would have me protect, it would further stigmatize this subreddit in general, and in this rare case, legitimately.</p>

<p>...I honestly think you&#39;re just kind of jealous of mods ability to sticky their self-posts. ;)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really have much time to spend actively policing the mod queue (and don&#39;t really like removing much in general); but I do browse reddit frequently and will remove bad things that I encounter in my normal browsing.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is the biggest relatively unmoderated (other than spam removal) political/news subreddit around.</p>

<p>The name is IMO unfortunate because of the connotations it brings with it; but given how the largest sub-reddits have behaved lately we have to take what we can get.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t consider myself a conspiracy theorist; but I do value unsuppressed discussion forums.</p>

<p>To me it doesn&#39;t even matter who did 9/11.  The bigger travesty was everything that disaster has been used to justify since.</p>

<p>Edit: for those who don&#39;t have time to go to the link, 911blogger has systematically banned all supporters of Pilots for Truth and Citizen Investigation Team, as well as anyone with an account at WTCdemolition.

<p>Citizen Investigation Team (CIT) created some drama at 9/11 blogger with their eye witness pentagon claims.  The pentagon theories never go to well amongst any groups because there&#39;s so much misinformation, confusion, and lack of evidence.  We all can agree though the FBI/DoD should just release the dozens of tapes so everyone can see what hit it.  I believe CIT kept claiming the plane flew over the building without legitimate proof...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One goal we should keep in mind is to ban accounts that consistently make absurd and racist comments. The whole anti-semitic thing hurts our reputation as a whole and we need to enforce sidebar rule #1. Any comments that do not add to the conversation and just exist need to be deleted. For example, &quot;The Jews are to blame for this problem,&quot; should be deemed unnecessary to the discussion and and further actions should be taken to that user&#39;s account. </p>

<p>I do consider myself an anti-Zionist, but by no means am I racist against the Jewish people as a whole. I think there needs to be a distinction made about the two. I don&#39;t think we should impose censorship against people&#39;s opinion, but let&#39;s leave the racist comments on /pol. </p>

<p>We need a mod(s) that take this issue seriously.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m a critic of conspiracy, I don&#39;t believe 95% of the shit posted here.</p>

<p>I do believe that people have a right to talk about anything without being ridiculed about it. This place (conspiracy) is like a dog that&#39;s been beat its whole life, it will never trust a new master. It is conditioned to lash out at anything that threatens its little corner of the world and the slightest provocation will bring out its full wrath.</p>

<p>But like a dog that&#39;s been beaten its whole life, biting the hand of its new master will likely been the cause of its ruin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He started a nice, friendly discussion with people who want r/conspiracy destroyed, asking them what they thought would be good for this sub. Some of the people he was talking with are known trolls in this sub, who have deliberately planted posts intended to drive away readers, or even get this sub in shit with the admins. They have engaged in vote rigging, and have posted here deliberate anti-Semitic posts of the most insulting, degrading kind. These are also people who think it is fun to make a sub devoted to jokes about the brutal killing of a young female activist, who was murdered by an Israeli while she was defending the rights of Palestinians.</p>

<p>When informed by people in this sub that it was a poor idea to pal up with known trolls, racists, Zionist shills, and enemies of the sub, he protested innocence and continued to hang around with the &#39;tards.</p>

<p>The concensus is that he is no longer to be trusted as a mod of this sub, and must resign his mod status. He refuses to do so. This has generated animosity that is unlikely to die away until he removes himself, or is removed by somebody else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to volunteer as a moderator for as long as it takes to improve various aspects of this subreddit&#39;s stylesheet. I have 2 things on my mind: 1, the new upvote/downvote arrows are very colorblind-unfriendly. 2, the stylesheet commits a cardinal sin of replacing reddit&#39;s signature typeface (Verdana) with a much less readable font (Arial).</p>

<p>I work with CSS professionally and I&#39;m familiar with moderating large subreddits. I really have no desire for moderation power, and will voluntarily remove myself after upgrading the CSS.</p>

<p>I would think it is a good idea to pick a mod from a different timezone from the others. I know on a lot of subs most of them are americans so content goes downhill for people in GMT.</p>

<p>I see lots of content repeated constantly. So maybe if we compile top posts of each month then put them in the side bar so instead of repeating the same old video anyone can look in the sidebar for the highlights of each month?</p>

A &quot;resident debunker&quot;, if you will. Otherwise, from the people nominated on here, you&#39;re just going to get more of the same.</p>

<p>Edit: And if this sounds like a crazy idea, maybe try it out for a month or so then go from there.</p>

<p>Thank you!  It is all too rare in online forums for people to admit it when the other person has good points. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I can assure you that they are very much aware of this thread and probably discussing it right now and trying to figure out who I am and how to discredit me.  <a href="/u/9-11-2001">/u/9-11-2001</a> (who claimed below to be a mod at blogger) will not be back anytime soon.  He has no response other than that they are a fake 9-11 truth site that allows plenty of discussion of the WTC because that crime can never be pinned on anyone in particular.  (They could always claim that freedom-hating Arabs got jobs on the cleaning crew.)</p>

<p>But a <strong>faked plane crash at the Pentagon</strong> can definitely be pinned on real live people who are enjoying the booty their participation in 9-11 earned them, and don&#39;t want to dragged through the streets by an angry mob any time soon.   Hence the concerted effort to keep that fact under wraps. </p>
