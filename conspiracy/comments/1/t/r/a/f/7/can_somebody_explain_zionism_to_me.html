<p>So what is Zionism? What role does it play in Israel? What role does it play in America? What does it have to do with Jewish people?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be frank, there is a lot of antisemitism in the conspiracy community. Just the other day, there was a thread about Jews planning the first and second world war. Look through the comments in this thread and you&#39;ll certainly find some antisemitism. Also, many of the attacks against &quot;Zionism&quot; resemble the attacks Jews faced over hundred of years.</p>

<p>Zionism, simply put, is the belief that the Jewish people deserve a state of their own. That eventually evolved into a belief that the state should be in Israel/Palestine. The motivations weren&#39;t particularly religious. Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern political zionism was in no way religious. Zionism was mainly about escaping antisemitism in Europe, which was a common occurrence for many Jews.</p>

<p>After Zionism settled on Israel/Palestine as the home for the Jewish people, many Jews started to flee Europe and move to Israel/Palestine. There were already some Jews who had been living in the area, but this is where mass migrations began. In 1882, the ratio of Muslims to Jews was about 10 to 1. It was 5.6 to 1 in in 1914 and less than 2 to 1 in 1947. In the years after the second World War, there was a civil war between Britain, Palestinians, &amp; Jews. The U.N. proposed a partition plan and the British decided that they didn&#39;t want to deal with the conflict anymore and pulled out. After Britain left, Israel declared independence and a war ensued between them and the Arab States. Israel won and expanded it&#39;s borders to what is now considered Israel. Instead of a Palestinian state being created, Egypt took Gaza and Jordan took the West Bank. In 1967, Egypt, Jordan, and other Arab States appeared to be preparing to invade so Israel launched a preemptive strike and defeated the Arab states pretty easily. They took Gaza, the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and Sinai. Sinai was eventually returned to Egypt in a peace treaty between the two countries.</p>

<p>In the United States, Jews actually tend to be less supportive of Israel than the general population. The vast majority of evangelicals support Israel, while Jews are more split. Also, many very religious Jews are vehemently anti-zionist, as they think only god can give Israel to the Jewish people.</p>

<p>No it is not. Israel got their own state and they continue to take land away from the Palestinians AND the Lebanese. Zionism is the idea that the Jews are God&#39;s &quot;chosen people&quot; and that they are the most pure. Everyone that is not a Jew is the &quot;goyim&quot; and the &quot;goyims&quot; only purpose in life is to serve the &quot;pure Jews&quot;. </p>

<p>In the same way the Neo-Nazis want a &quot;pure White race&quot;, the Zionists want a &quot;pure Jewish race&quot;.</p>

<p>Holy fucking shit. Are you serious? You think that&#39;s &quot;hate speech&quot;? I don&#39;t hate Jews at all. People are such fucking pussies. Zionism is simply Jewish extremism.

<p>Alright man. I&#39;m not trying to offend anyone here. It just seems to me like we&#39;re at a point in this country where anyone can go off about how small minded and ignorant Christians and Muslims are, but the minute you say the same thing about a Jew, the sky is falling down. Whether it&#39;s right or wrong, &quot;Zionism&quot; is commonly used as a catch-all term for &quot;Jewish Extremism&quot;. I&#39;m not trying to be anti-jew by pointing that out.</p>

<p>Some criticisms of Zionism claim that Judaism&#39;s notion of the &quot;chosen people&quot; is the source of racism in Zionism,</p>

<p>Now that is not the same thing and a key word is &quot;some criticism&quot; not the literal meaning as you implied and where in that sentence does it say;</p>

<p>Everyone that is not a Jew is the &quot;goyim&quot; and the &quot;goyims&quot; only purpose in life is to serve the &quot;pure Jews&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m Sorry but I&#39;m skeptical of your motive here if that is your evidence.</p>

<p>]EDIT]; Here is that entire paragraph</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Critics of Zionism consider it a colonialist[8] or racist[9] movement. According to historian Avi Shlaim, throughout its history up to present day, Zionism &quot;is replete with manifestations of deep hostility and contempt towards the indigenous population.&quot; Shlaim balances this by pointing out that there have always been individuals within the Zionist movement that have criticized such attitudes. He cites the example of Ahad Ha&#39;am, who after visiting Palestine in 1891, published a series of articles criticizing the aggressive behaviour and political ethnocentrism of Zionist settlers. Ha&#39;am wrote that the Zionists &quot;behave towards the Arabs with hostility and cruelty, trespass unjustly upon their boundaries, beat them shamefully without reason and even brag about it, and nobody stands to check this contemptible and dangerous tendency&quot; and that they believed that &quot;the only language that the Arabs understand is that of force.&quot;[96] <strong>Some</strong> <strong>criticisms</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Zionism</strong> <strong>claim</strong> <strong>that</strong> <strong>Judaism&#39;s</strong> <strong>notion</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>&quot;chosen</strong> <strong>people&quot;</strong> <strong>is</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>source</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>racism</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>Zionism,</strong> [97] despite, according to Gustavo Perednik, that being a religious concept unrelated to Zionism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t say racist, I said hate speech;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone that is not a Jew is the &quot;goyim&quot; and the &quot;goyims&quot; only purpose in life is to serve the &quot;pure Jews&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am free to label that hate speech since you said it without context, directed at Jews, and changing your wording and saying I&#39;m calling anything r&quot;racist&quot; because I don&#39;t agree with your original statement is equally offensive to me.</p>

<p>Is jsut simply not true and you claim you copied that from wikipedia but a find on page search shows you lied. and just because you think that&#39;s what zionism means, that does not make you correct without a source, the article explains very clearly what zionism is, Israeli nationalism, the creation of the state itself.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And people wonder why <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> gets accused of antisemitism...</p>

<p>The &quot;Chosen People&quot; thing is more about Jews being required to follow a far more extensive list of laws than any sort of purity thing. Also, in case you haven&#39;t heard, pretty much every religion thinks of themselves as somewhat superior. That mindset is actually somewhat less common in Judaism than in other religions. Jews tend to be far more likely to be secular than Americans. Remember, the origins of Zionism are with an Atheistic Jew, so it&#39;s difficult to make the claim that it&#39;s basis is mostly religious.</p>

<p>If you think Zionism has anything to do with establishing a &quot;pure Jewish race&quot;, then you have no clue what you&#39;re talking about. Plenty of groups want a land for their own. The Jewish people are not unique in that regard.</p>

<p>Finally, remember that the wars in which Palestinians lost land were not wars of aggression by Israel.</p>

<p>The word literally translates to struggle, and like the christian bible the Quaran is open to interpretation.

    <div class="md"><p>Ill explain it as i understand from my own research on this topic:</p>

<p>First of all, we must clear the air and differentiate between Zionism and Judaism. Judaism is a religion, while Zionism is more of a movement. The importance of seperating the two terms lies in the fact that zionists can include non-jews, while there are some jews who are not zionists.</p>

<p>Zionism is basically the belief that the jewish people have a divine right given to them by their god to inhabit the holy land. Therefore, they believe that even those who are not related to the original jews of biblical times have a divine right to live there, more so than those who already live there who are not jews (i.e. the palestinians)</p>

<p>I did research, and the movement started with the ashkenazi jews, who are jewish people of european descent. You see, judaism was spread throughout europe as a portion of europeans converted into judaism. since they converted to judaism, they felt that they, too, had the divine right to the holy land. Herein lies the controversy, as several genetic studies concluded that the european jews have no heriditary connections with the original biblical jews. Despite this fact, those converted jews still believed they have the divine right as &quot;gods chosen people.&quot; The movement called for an mass immigration (some see it as an infiltration) into the holy land, kicking out some of the original inhabitants who have been living there for generations since and before biblical times. </p>

<p>Wikipedia has a fantastic section about zionism, and id recommend research on the various topics and tangents comprised therein. </p>

<p>As you can see, this becomes a very touchy topic, and is very easily misunderstood as a racial/anti-semitic issue, when the theories about this are actually targeting the zionists, not the jewish. </p>

<p>Its kind of like all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares. Except, its not all zionists are jewish, and not all jews are zionists.</p>

<p>I hope this helped... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zionism is the beilef that Jews need to have a country of their own in the region of Israel/Palestine. It has nothing to do with religion or &quot;divine rights&quot;. The founders of the zionist movement were secular. And to the OP: if you really want to learn about the subject- <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is not the place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Zionism is basically the belief that the jewish people have a divine right given to them by their god to inhabit the holy land.&quot;</p>

<p>Exactly.  This is something that anyone can get by reading just a bit of history.  Apparently, even that is too much to expect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that some key parts of this are incorrect.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Genetic studies have shown that nearly all Ashkenazi Jews are indeed descended from biblical Jews. For the most part, they are closer genetically to Semites than they are to European. I have no clue where you got that claim from, since it&#39;s pretty well established that Ashkenazi Jews are the descendants of Jews that left the Middle East 2000 years ago and are closely relate to the other diasporas.</p></li>
<li><p>I think you overestimate the religious basis for Zionism. It did not initially advocate for the Jewish homeland to be where it is now, that came later. Theodor Herzl was an atheist. The initial goal was to establish a homeland for the Jewish people, since the community had faced a ton of antisemitism in Europe. Later on, they decided that Israel/Palestine was the desired homeland. </p></li>
<li><p>Being the &quot;Chosen People&quot; is less about anything to do with Israel and more about following a lot of laws from the bible.</p></li>
<li><p>I disagree with your characterization of the migration to Israel/Palestine. Many Jews moved there to escape antisemitism in Europe and initially purchased land. They didn&#39;t kick anyone out at that point. The disputed part dates to the 1948 war, where after Israel declared its independence, the Arab States declared war and Israel won, expanding it&#39;s borders in the process.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, it is possible i had mixed up the ashkenazim with the whole khazar theory. Forgive me, because it was quite a while since ive done my research on this topic, hence why i made it a point to tell OP to come to his own conclusions based on his own research.</p>

<p>I appreciate you for correcting me where i may have been wrong. Seems like ill be revisiting this subject once again!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy is not quite right. The core justification of Zionism is that all jews are descended from those who lived there in the past and therefore have the right to the land now. As such, the inconvenient fact that Ashkenazi jews are primarily descended from Khazars is often lied about. </p>

<p>Although there have been genetic studies done (by zionists) that suggest this is not the case, there have also been plenty of genetic studies done finding the opposite conclusion. So at best, it is very much a controversial issue. </p>

<p>Whatever side you choose to believe, you must understand that this is ultimately a political question - those who are invested in Zionism will find that Ashkenazis are descended from old jewish roots no matter what, because to find it any other way is to deny the fundamental political justification of Zionism.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really not sure who is right in the matter, but he is only telling you the Zionist side of the story. The genius of Theodore Herzel, in my opinion, was that he successfully combined religious and political theories to produce one extremely powerful theory. </p>

<p>And quite frankly, the horror of the holocaust was exploited to found the Jewish state. It made it possible, politically speaking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im inclined to agree with you. After i stepped aside and did some little bit extra research in the past few hrs, i came to realize thst there are definately two different sides on this topic. Each side has found genetic evidence for their claim, and each side seems to be fervently against the other, dilluting the possibility of a clear answer to all of this.</p>

<p>Of course, the conspiracy theorist community will most likely side with the claim that zionism is somehow bad, and have acquired high level positions in the global banking cabal. For instance, the current chairman of the federal reserve is Ben Bernenke, and he is in fact, jewish. Theorists claim he supports zionism, though i have not yet found evidence of that linkage. But, as skeptical as theorists are, it is no wonder why they would assume this claim.</p>

<p>This claim that certain zionist leaders hold high level positions in the banking cabal leads some theorists to believe that they pull the strings behind the curtains. They even point out how immediate wall street fluctuates up or down depending on the word of one man, ben bernenke. </p>

<p>Ive found some pro-zionist sites, and in their own words they sum up their movement as &quot;the belief of a jewish homeland for the jewish people, in israel.&quot; </p>

<p>I also found references of a certain &quot;sect&quot; (i guess we can call it that) call hamas. And the hamas charter calls for the expansion of the zionist state into arab states and more. They base their belief on the protocols of the elders of zion. </p>

<p>However, even the protocols of the elders of zion has controversy over it, as some claim it is a forgery used as an antisemitic tool to justify the nazis intentions of killing all the jews. </p>

<p>This shit gets deep, so ill refer you guys to one link right quick, which i believe is pro-zionist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zionism is Jewish state nationalism. Imagine if someone thought that the only &quot;pure&quot; America was one of a single race of &quot;Pure Americans&quot;. That&#39;s what Zionism is. It is the belief that there should be a single Jewish state of only &quot;pure&quot; Jews because they are the &quot;chosen&quot; people. </p>

<p>It is Jewish extremism in the same way Evangelical Christianity and Jihadist Islam is. Except we don&#39;t find many Evangelical Christians killing people in a systematic way (obviously radical Muslims do). But Zionists are the ones that believe Israel is the &quot;pure Jewish state&quot; and the Palestinians have no right to live on their own land because their land is actually Jewish land that belongs to the &quot;chosen&quot; people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you&#39;ve already gotten some answers about what Zionism is, here&#39;s a few notes on why Zionism is bad. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Critics of Zionism see it as a colonialist or racist ideology that led to the denial of rights, dispossession and expulsion of the &quot;indigenous population of Palestine&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>And something interesting which I read tonight, after researching the end of Apartheid in South Africa and the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as President: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>14 July 1994</p>

<p>Defence Minister J. Modise issues a statement that South Africa is to end the special relationship with Israel. Modise compares Israel&#39;s Palestine policy with the apartheid years in South Africa, collaboration between the two countries on nuclear weapons states that South Africa is to assess every contract with Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, i highly recommend these two links for your resesrch. The first is pro-zionist, and explains their side of the story, while the second is authored by a Jew who explains why Zionism is bad and is against judaism and their religious laws.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zionismontheweb.org/zionism/">http://www.zionismontheweb.org/zionism/</a></p>

<p>This first one also has a bunch of links and sister sites, which would allow you to further your research from their point of view.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jewsnotzionists.org/differencejudzion.html">http://www.jewsnotzionists.org/differencejudzion.html</a></p>

<p>this second link is the one authored by a Jew, and its a looong read, but he explains what it means to be a Jew, he explains some laws and commandments and the tradional though of judaism, and uses these explanations plus some history and more to make his claim that zionism is bad and actually goes against tradional jewish religious law. I found the part of the articke that talks about the agudath israel very interesting. </p>

<p>I hope this helps you in your research, as these are good sources providing you insight for both sides of the aisle. </p>

<p>EDIT: make sure to check out the sidebar on the left in the second link, the page called &quot;zionism and the holocaust&quot; is surely going to be of interest as well...</p>
