<p>I wish I could say no with a straight face, but in the light of this recent revelation you may be right.</p>

<p>could it be the mods here are trying to sabotage the workings of their own sub in order to make it more in line with the tastes of the masses? Could be.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tshao/revelation_of_operation_stonecutter/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tshao/revelation_of_operation_stonecutter/</a></p>

<p>I agree this tactic seems to be a modus operandi.  The mods suggested a different sub for reddit meta conspiracies.  They also pop up to comment to support the creation of other conspiracy subs.  And I feel like I&#39;ve seen this a number of times in blog history . . . Digg is an example.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think any of the &quot;core&quot; mods (myself, mr_dong, sarah_connor) are doing doing anything like that. As far as the new mods (supercede, weedtastic, EnglishMunichFan and the others) go I&#39;m not sure yet. They all seem pretty solid to me, and we&#39;ve never noticed any shady dealings with any of them. I havent had many interactions with solidwhetstone, but we have vetted a few mods in the past that haven&#39;t worked out for one reason or another. Only once has a mod went completely nuts with power, and even he wasn&#39;t trying to destroy the sub, just to try to sabotage the mods and falsified messages in order to make it appear that we were up to no good. The only way that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will die is if people stop coming here and posting. And with the recent trend of exponential growth, that seems highly unlikely. No worries from here on out. We have a solid team and our eyes are open. </p>

<p>If anything, it&#39;s those use who seek to bring us down who would raise the biggest uproar.  I&#39;d be looking at conspiratards, personally. Asking them for their opinions gave them a perfect opportunity to cause a shitstorm.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the more sources for anything, the better. i must say that i strongly disagree with you. third, fourth, or sixty-second party candidates are almost invariably preferable when compared to any one or two party system, for media and politics alike. restricting options is not something that true truth-seekers should strive for. i watch cnn and fox among a multitude of other media outlets. sometimes you need to know all the lies to recognize the truth. obviously, i&#39;m not saying that alternatives are always more accurate than a mainstream source, but i think they should always be available.</p>

The more open communication the better perhaps, but it is few and far between that anyone will find what we have here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.

<p>What I would define as &quot;bona fide and active&quot; members of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> constitute a small percentage (perhaps as low 1%) of the 205k subscribers figure associated with the subreddit. </p>

<p>There isn&#39;t much doubt in my mind that a site which excluded the personae non gratae whose objective is to restrict legitimate discussion here (the shills, trolls, sockpuppets, conspiratards, brainwashed skeptics etc) would be a better place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, according to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tshao/revelation_of_operation_stonecutter/">this post</a> GlenBaskerville was engaging in &quot;Operation Stonecutter&quot; and was purposely dividing the sub.</p>

<p>He claimed he was involved in an operation to divide the community and hijack the opposition to solidwhetstone so people would go to different subs, etc.</p>

<p>Glen Baskerville <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tkq7a/can_we_get_a_petition_going_to_get_solidwhetstone/ce8xrvz">articulated the ideals for moderating</a> this sub better than anyone here and based on that I nominated him to mod this place, despite his lack of a history.  </p>

<p>It can&#39;t tell if he had his account hijacked or if he was actually engaging in this operation or if he was feigning this as a joke.</p>
