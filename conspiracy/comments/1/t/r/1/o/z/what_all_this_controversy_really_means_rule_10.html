       This clearly goes against everything we stand for. This rule must go! This rule has laid a heavy hand to censor everything around the current inner subbreddit controversy issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't present the conspiratard hate group a platform to falsely accuse subreddit of being full of racism and bigotry, then censor anyone who speaks out about it. Sure that was a stupid move, but not evil. Not everyone realizes conspiratard is a hate group that frequently mobilizes in our subreddit to make racist post, troll and manipulate people, and manipulate our voting system. Not everyone knows conspiratard has some very well rounded mods who are known for abusing their moderator powers and using them to falsely accuse people of racism and globally banning them for kicks. Then admitting it and receiving no repercussions. There is even accusations that their mod was involved in the mismanagement of the Restore The Fourth donations.
      </p>
      <p>
       While this is a complicated issue that needs dealt with, the mass censoring of this issue's discussion using rule 10 has been a travesty that has destroyed all credibility.

       As it stands it's WAY too vague and open to censorship. Plus it's completely unnecessary. I don't get this fear of speech people have. If someone's harassing you that falls under spam, stalking, and global rules, otherwise it's simply criticism or insult. Wtf is an "attack". Again, vagueness all over.

       I agree entirely! My primary account was just banned by u/solidwhetstone for "attacking" a user. What is this the playground at school, where r/conspiratard is allowed to come in here mocking and bullying and we can't stand up for ourselves?

       You'd like to blame conspiratard, but nope- you were banned for your own actions. As always- you're welcome to send a mod message and ask for your ban to be overturned. Just because one mod bans you doesn't mean a consensus has been reached per rule 6. We have overturned 2 bans today.

      <p>
       Can you clarify this rule for us? I just want someone to explain exactly what it means. It seems like you are saying the bans are just handed out haphazardly, then the un-banning happens by moderator consensus. If the mod who first handed out the ban simply doesn't want to consent to an un-ban, that means only one mod is needed to ban anyone they wish. If so, I think rule 6 needs to be worded better. Currently, it looks like it's just simply a false statement.

       This is very true. I think the answer is to demarcate between attacking a user and making a general statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying one user is a piece of trash over and over should probably draw a ban hammer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Referring to a group of evil people with vulgar slurs should never be banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       A nuanced, but important, distinction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would add that I think there should be unrestricted criticisms of moderators allowed (no harassment though); as it's too much of a conflict of interest to determine what's an attack on a mod and what's a legitimate criticism. Let the parties speak their sides of the story, and then allow the downvotes and upvotes do the talking in that situation.

       It's not that bad, provided it's enforced with an even-hand. Of course, it is open to interpretation and possible abuse, but hopefully rule 6 is there to deal with that.

      <p>
       You don't say what your particular beef is. You mention conspiratard and state that rule 10 is being used to censor some discussion of that? I saw one ban that seemed spot on and one that I thought was iffy and apparently got overturned by the mods altogether. You know better?

       All the drama is around conspiratard and our mod giving conspiratard the platform to make many many accusations about our subreddit being racists, without us having a recourse to defend ourselves. That is a complicated issue and the subreddit has tried to sort it out through comments and posts, but the rule 10 is being used to suppress that much needed discussion.

       I agree but rule 10 in part covers this.  Attacking this sub is a favorite tactic of the conspiratard trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Single comments like "you guys are retarded for believing in any conspiracies with no proof" or "this conspiracy is retarded" or "this is why this sub has no respect", etc., are attacks on this sub and distract from the conversation and add no value.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regulating attacks on other users or mods can be abused more because people get into heated disagreements and say stupid stuff (as they have against solidwhetstone) and I would rather tread lighter there.  Of course it can cross the line like with stalking, etc.

       Isn't that why trolls are banned because their only intent is to throw poop at the place they are visiting?

       Why should we allow trollish comments?

       What site on the internet allows this?  If someone went to I love puppies dot com and simply made comments about how people were stupid to love puppies and mocked them wouldn't they be banned?

       Because censorship is pointless and is open to abuse. If people want to say stupid shit then let them and they will be downvoted.

       If I love puppies had an up and downvote system they wouldn't need to be banned as their posts would be downvoted.

       I too have personally seen no evidence of racism here. I'm sure their are some, as  BipolarBear0 was recently outed, yet again, for organizing the posting of racism in r/conspiracy for shits and giggles. We are also a frequent target of trolls and randoms.

       No, getting rid of rule 10 will stop censoring the discussion around it, and discussions around the actions of the r/conspiracy moderator who gave them such a public platform for such discrediting accusations which we had no method to defend.

       I agree that shadowstopfollowing should not have been banned, unless he has a history of poor conduct from times past or something. All his comments seem really reasonable.

        I should have been banned instead of him

       Other than that it looks like everyone who got banned had it subsequently overturned by consensus?
