        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The moment you say anything to a cop they&#39;re taking notes and building a case against you. Say nothing because they will twist your words against you. Only answer a question if it is absolutely necessary and even then think twice. Cops are not your friends. </p>

<p>1.) Am I being detained?</p>

<p>2.) I do not consent to a search.</p>

<p>3.) Am I free to go?</p>

<p>They&#39;re code enforcement and they get the majority of their funding through extortion. Their guns are what gives them the ability to do this. Don&#39;t be fooled and don&#39;t be intimidated. When you are being stopped it&#39;s a guy with a gun who will shoot you if you fail to meet his standards. He will shake you down for whatever he can. He wants your money and will force you to give it to him through a &#39;ticket.&#39;</p>

<p>Fight the ticket.</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/Nrp5pFMbYx0">Marc Stevens</a> has a few ideas on this. His ideas are a double edged sword so do not use his ideas unless you&#39;re very very familiar with them and understand that neither cops nor judges will be lenient on you just because you&#39;re not willingly giving up your rights. In fact your lack of compliance with their claims to authority will cause them to be very hostile. Marc&#39;s ideas can be used, but they require a depth of understanding. I repeat: they are not for the feint of heart and can make things worse if you don&#39;t fully understand what you&#39;re getting into. People in government have guns and will shoot you. Never forget that you&#39;re dealing with a very dangerous group of people.</p>

<p>That said, if you want to stop playing their game just know that it&#39;s a game they&#39;re playing and all you have to do is understand the game to know how to stop playing it. Consider a rattle snake. Knowing how to handle a rattle snake makes it no less dangerous. It can still kill you. But if you know how to handle it you can minimize your exposure to the danger.</p>

<p>Learn what you can do you protect yourself from these armed bullies in costume.</p>

<p>HINT: &#39;No duty to protect.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found a great video that shows their tactics off pretty clearly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUZZGj6sqH8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUZZGj6sqH8</a></p>

<p>This girl challenges the border patrol to either let her go or detain her for suspicion of a crime. The border patrol spends 10 minutes trying to get her to comply without giving her any reason to compel her to comply.</p>

<p>Right near the end of the tape you&#39;ll see a senior officer come out of nowhere and start using all the typical intimidation tactics. He starts asking her to pull over for her inspection etc etc. When she continues to refuse he realizes that he actually needs to find out what the situation is and can&#39;t just use the standard intimidation to get her to pull over. As soon as they tell him what&#39;s going on he says &quot;oh give me a fucking break&quot; and tells them to be on their way.</p>

<p>So the guy didn&#39;t even know what the situation was and he rolls up and starts intimidating. It&#39;s part of their culture to getyou to give up your rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cops are people doing a job, remember a few simple tips and you&#39;ll make it much less likely you&#39;ll get yourself in trouble. </p>

<p>The day to day job of cops is to find violators of laws and either arrest and detain them, or simply ticket them. Most all of the people they deal with have in fact broken a law. </p>

<p>When YOU come into contact with a police officer, they will assume you&#39;ve broken the law (they usually will only initiate conversation if they believe that&#39;s the case, or they&#39;re off duty or on break).</p>

<p>Police look around. They need to for safety, and they often build their cases this way. If a cop can see it in plain view, you can be searched, etc. Be aware of your surroundings and don&#39;t give the police a reason to be suspicious if you can avoid it. </p>

<p>Most people incriminate themselves. There is nothing to be accomplished by admitting anything, ever. You might catch a sympathetic cop who let&#39;s you off with a warning, but that&#39;s DESPITE the confession you offered up. When you admit something you make their job easy and they can wrap it up. You always drive under the speed limit, and signal properly. </p>

<p>Besides admissions, getting people to consent to searches is the second most common way people end up getting arrested. If you&#39;re calm and collected you probably won&#39;t even be asked this. But, this is the most devious trick police use, they all use it all the time, many are very skilled at it. Tactics vary, but the casual &quot;you don&#39;t mind if I take a look,&quot; or the statement of fact, &quot;I&#39;m going to look in here....&quot; waiting for you to say &quot;ok.&quot; Sometimes they&#39;ll intimidate you by putting you in handcuffs first and/or having you sit in their car. Don&#39;t give in. It will not get better if you cooperate. TELL THEM NO if asked.</p>

<p>Once you have refused to consent they will probably act mad. You need to ask if you&#39;re free to go. AM I FREE TO GO? If they won&#39;t say, ask them if you&#39;re being detained, and ask them to explain and then ask again if you&#39;re free to go. Tell them, I KNOW YOU&#39;RE DOING YOUR JOB, BUT I HAVE SOMEWHERE I NEED TO BE. Repeat AM I FREE TO GO?</p>

<p>Always use words of respect, like &quot;Officer, Sir, Ma&#39;m, respectfully, thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>If you are arrested tell them you will not speak and want to call your lawyer. </p>

<p>EVERYONE they come in contact has broken a law. The hard part is getting the people to admit and self incriminate themselves. So many bullshit laws on the books the average American commits 3 felonies a day. </p>

<p>NOTHING TO HIDE? Everyone has SOMETHING to hide. </p>

<p>There is absolutely no justification for the arrest and detainment for 90% of non-violent offenders. Make no mistake. We are living in a police state and you are only free because the government ALLOWS you to be free. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously man, this is applicable to Germany circa 1936, why should we learn how to deal with this? These clowns work for US, they need to be reminded of this.</p>

<p>A better tactic for 2014 is to completely stop paying taxes. The only thing any of us should say to these pigs is &quot;am I being detained&quot; even if they&#39;re friends, I personally question anyone who has ambition to become a police officer at this point.</p>

<p>Fuck niceties and normality, even if a cop tries to spark up a conversation with me my response is &quot;am I being detained&quot;. I&#39;m not trying to be a smart ass but they&#39;ve proven time and time again that their &quot;brotherhood&quot; is more important than doing the right thing so they&#39;re all guilty by association. </p>

<p>It&#39;s sad that even upper middle class America is saying FUCK THE POLICE but they&#39;ve made their choice. You either side with the people you&#39;ve sworn to protect or you side with the plutocracy that writes your checks, they&#39;ve chose the latter.</p>

I gave it to him thinking nothing of it and it turns out I had a warrant for an unpaid seatbelt ticket that turned into a warrant. His whole attitude changed and he took me in since I didn&#39;t have the cash on me. Wouldn&#39;t let me call to try and get it, so I spent the entire weekend in NJ state jail. A 10x10 room with four other really sketchy guys. Really unnessessary asshole behavior. Totally overreacted and I still don&#39;t know why after a polite conversation he would even request my ID. So youre right,  cops are just people, sometimes they can be total assholes just like everyone else. The difference though, is that when a cop wants to be an asshole, they can really wreck somebody&#39;s shit. I&#39;ve honestly never been the same after that.</p>

The asshole I dealt with simply enjoyed it. Looking back now it was like he was toying with me for our entire conversation leading up to him asking for my id. The consequences were overkill for the crime. I was treated like a thief or rapist. If I could&#39;ve made any calls at the station before being taken to the prison I could&#39;ve gotten the money to pay the fine/warrant.</p>

Cops didn&#39;t want to arrest the guy after literally over a dozen violations. (They also assume most domestic issues will be dropped by the time the court date rolls around, despite me emphatically explaining that it was not an ex, but a solid stalking &amp; harassment case. I got tired of worrying if these hick cops were gonna get me murdered &amp; I&#39;m moving a fucking county away....)

    <div class="md"><p>No, not really. He was an asshole beforehand by even asking me for ID after a casual conversation. And for him to be so mad that he has to do his job to put me in state jail for three days with rapists and murderers for a sixty dollar ticket, he couldve just as easily said hey man, because your a nice guy I&#39;m gonna let you know you have to pay this fine right away... Your logic is fucked, that cop was fucked and fucking with me, and you&#39;re making a lame excuse for him. Pay your ticket? No shit. Three days of state jail for a sixty dollar seatbelt ticket? I agree with seatbelt laws, fine, but you know the only person I couldve hurt by not wearing it? Me. I was two blocks from the store we went to and one block from being back at my friends house. The story behind that is a bitch as well. I was the passenger in a car and I looked at a parked cop, made eye contact and he immediately rushed out of his hiding spot down the road to question my driver about a bunch of nothing. &quot; I thought I saw you had a headlight out&quot;, etc... Immediately after I saw him, before he even pulled out, I put my seatbelt on because i just knew. Maybe I was wrong to not have it on, but not jail wrong. My biggest offenses were making eye contact and later a friendly conversation with power tripping assholes. You&#39;re wrong and insulting given the circumstances and consequences. Think about it for a second. Your post really pissed me off, you&#39;re completely wrong. I didn&#39;t deserve any of that. This is only a bit of the injustice I had to suffer from cops. I&#39;m not even going to get into the time a cop thought my friend spit on his windshield (he didnt) while the cop was in a store and made me take my shirt off to clean it in the middle of winter. Stuff like this is why I hate cops, an with your logic, I honestly hope you get to be on the recieving end of it someday. I wouldn&#39;t wish things like what happened to me on my worst enemy, but someone like you could use the wake up call. I don&#39;t know what your second post is talkin about at all btw, you completely sidestepped logic there. None of that second post pertains to anything in the conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, retard who doesn&#39;t understand seatbelt laws.... </p>

<p>Edit: damnit, I sank to your level. My point is throughout all your comments, you whined about being ID&#39;d after an accident and the penalty for an unpaid ticket. Both are valid occurring events in the legal world. You should expect to identify yourself to police on the scene of an accident. You know that a seatbelt must be worn by the front seat passengers in most states. You know that the penalties for an unpaid ticket are listed on the ticket. </p>

<p>I have my own stories, try spending 8 days around the Thanksgiving vacation and making that collect call to my sister that no, I wasn&#39;t at the airport, I&#39;m in a private Christian jail cuz I skipped a court date, lol. But I don&#39;t ever leave out of that story <em>that</em> I skipped court... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your whole story sounds like made up bullshit to me.  You were just chatting it up with a police officer when, out of no where, he wants to run your ID.  Being ignorant of your rights and the fact you had an outstanding warrant, you gave it to him.  And then, you just &quot;happened&quot; to have an outstanding warrant for an unpaid menial ticket for what is probably the most trivial thing for which you can get a ticket.

    <div class="md"><p>I just dont believe that statement, I thimk it is a repeated adage people accept as true, but in general most people are good, but the repetition of the &#39;100 % of people will abuse power&#39; statement leads people to almost believe it is natural for them to abuse their power. I have known many people with power or authority who are not pieces of shit. don&#39;t let a cultural meme dictate your opinion of human behavior.
