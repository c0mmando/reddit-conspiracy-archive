       They are supposed to be awful for you.  But why?  So far as I know, when you eat something, none of the DNA of the organism passes to your system, what with being chewed, enzymed, soaked in acid, etcetera.  Are GMO foods not chemically identical to non-GMO foods?  Considering the stuff people routinely ingest, including germs (yogurt), mold (blue cheese), fungus (truffles &amp; mushrooms), plants that are toxic to other animals, the flesh of birds, reptiles, fish, and vertebrates, motor fuels (ethyl alcohol), and all sorts of other stuff, why would plants with slightly different DNA be bad?  Or even different?

       No that I know much about it, but what I always thought is that the GMOs are that way to allow the use of pesticides on the crops. The GMOs are immune to the damages, but still soak it all up, so we end up eating roundup and other poisonous stuff as part of the crop. Anyone else know more about this or can link to a study or something?

       Pesticides and Herbicides can be used on GMO crops, very efficient ones that might be harmful to non-GMO crops. Round-up the herbicide and Round-up Ready both by Monsanto are an example of this.

       From what ive gathered, the problem i find credible with gmos is that they have much less nutritional value than their natural "organic" counterparts. Sure, the gmo veggies and fruit are more aesthetically appealing, but that doesnt do much if they lack or have less vitamins and minerals than the originals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I havent fact checked this, so take it as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, with the same disclaimer as above, i also have read that an issue with gmos has something to do with pesticides, whether thats in their dna or used topically, im not sure. Im personally not too worried about gmos, but i do avoid them in general, just not to the point where i wont eat them, if that makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope i at least helped in directing you towards topics that you can further your research on..

       Close enough and probably correct, yes you can see that it has to do with the agri-industry as a whole with Monsantos Round-up Ready crops, GMOs designed to withstand a Monsanto Glyphosate Herbicide, the name of which is Roundup (and their crops are 'ready' for it).

       Considering that doing this results in heavily biased and sources with blatantly incorrect information, this doesn't really seem like good advice. It's better to entirely dismiss someone who resorts to the "Monsanto shill" argument and ask for the actual science. If there is a shill saying something incorrect, you can disprove that with scientific evidence. If someone says you can't trust the science because someone is bought off, whatever bias is being claimed should be evident in the methods of the paper and easily pointed out by anyone competent in the field. That's why I never trust anyone who just claims shill immediately without showing any legitimate evidence.

       This is something that has always annoyed me, if what they are saying is scientifically accurate and well supported why does it even matter if they are a shill?
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that the existence of a clear conflict of interest makes ones points invalid just seems absurd to me. I'm not saying that we should be oblivious to bias, but bias on its own shouldn't be the sole ground of dismissal.

       In this topic, I think it has more to do with people just not being familiar with how to interpret research findings or specific topics like agriculture, toxicology, etc. It's much easier just to skim to the funding source of a study or make some connection to a company than look at the actual evidence. For instance, correctly interpreting research papers in this topic often requires an M.S. or Ph.D level of science education and expertise in the specific field. This basically excludes most of the general public. Many people still want to comment though, so for some they take the sloppy way out and resort to a shill one-liner. It may not be appropriate at all in these discussions, but sometimes that's all people have to contribute when they have an overriding urge to say something. I can't fault people too much for not being familiar with agriculture or science topics, so I prefer to think it's simply a good-faith effort people are attempting to put forward rather than willful ignorance.

       you're wrong here, there is a long history of monsanto shills on reddit that people who have been here for a while know about.  I'm not going to waste my time citing a truckload of comments to belabor the point, just a friendly warning to new members in the community.  of course, the rest of your comment is common sense and people are free to make their own judgments and evaluate the science, etc etc.

       Source on this? Everything I've seen indicates it's harmless (i.e. requires both a basic stomach and the correct receptors, which we have neither). That would be big news that it actually causes harm and why, so I'd like to see where this is coming from.

       Since you mention it a lot, can you point out anything that's wrong with the Monsanto funded studies and their methodologies? Funding source alone is never a valid reason for discrediting a study. If there was some sort of bias, you should be able to point it out in the methodology, results, and conclusions. That's the criteria we use when deciding to accept or reject any scientific paper during peer review.

       As for studies with independent funding, this list might interest you:

       Then point out where that conflict exists in the actual paper. Show what they did incorrectly. This is essentially science 101, so there's really no room for disagreement on this topic. If there was a bias due to the funding source, you should be able to show that bias in the paper. That's why only pointing to the funding source doesn't tell you a thing. You need to get straight to the point and look at the actual methodology of the paper. That's the same thing any scientist has to do when peer-reviewing a paper to determine if it should be accepted or rejected.

       When you eat genetically modified foods, you're eating foods that are designed to be sprayed with glyphosate but not die from it.  Ask yourself whether you really want to be eating glyphosate, this is admittedly only one very small part of the overall debate there are many others (including monoculture for one).

       Here we have several in vitro studies of glyphosate/roundup on cell cultures in a petri dish. Again, when you look at in vivo studies none of these effects actually carry forward in humans/mammals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their was also mention of the Seneff study which was purely a correlation = causation study, and a weak one at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only in vivo study was on daphnia magna which is a small aquatic invertebrate, even ignoring that their results conflict with previous studies, drawing a conclusion that this effect on an aquatic invertebrate will also extend to humans is stretching. And again I already provided you with a list of mammal studies which have found glyphosate to be relatively safe at current application amounts to humans/mammals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arguing about the effects of glyphosate on aquatic animals is a different topic all together.
