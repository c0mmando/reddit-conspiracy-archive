So far as I know, when you eat something, none of the DNA of the organism passes to your system, what with being chewed, enzymed, soaked in acid, etcetera.  Are GMO foods not chemically identical to non-GMO foods?  Considering the stuff people routinely ingest, including germs (yogurt), mold (blue cheese), fungus (truffles &amp; mushrooms), plants that are toxic to other animals, the flesh of birds, reptiles, fish, and vertebrates, motor fuels (ethyl alcohol), and all sorts of other stuff, why would plants with slightly different DNA be bad?  Or even different?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what ive gathered, the problem i find credible with gmos is that they have much less nutritional value than their natural &quot;organic&quot; counterparts. Sure, the gmo veggies and fruit are more aesthetically appealing, but that doesnt do much if they lack or have less vitamins and minerals than the originals. </p>

<p>I havent fact checked this, so take it as it is. </p>

<p>Also, with the same disclaimer as above, i also have read that an issue with gmos has something to do with pesticides, whether thats in their dna or used topically, im not sure. Im personally not too worried about gmos, but i do avoid them in general, just not to the point where i wont eat them, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>Close enough and probably correct, yes you can see that it has to do with the agri-industry as a whole with Monsantos Round-up Ready crops, GMOs designed to withstand a Monsanto Glyphosate Herbicide, the name of which is Roundup (and their crops are &#39;ready&#39; for it). </p>

<p>Considering that doing this results in heavily biased and sources with blatantly incorrect information, this doesn&#39;t really seem like good advice. It&#39;s better to entirely dismiss someone who resorts to the &quot;Monsanto shill&quot; argument and ask for the actual science. If there is a shill saying something incorrect, you can disprove that with scientific evidence. If someone says you can&#39;t trust the science because someone is bought off, whatever bias is being claimed should be evident in the methods of the paper and easily pointed out by anyone competent in the field. That&#39;s why I never trust anyone who just claims shill immediately without showing any legitimate evidence.</p>

<p>This is something that has always annoyed me, if what they are saying is scientifically accurate and well supported why does it even matter if they are a shill?  </p>

<p>The idea that the existence of a clear conflict of interest makes ones points invalid just seems absurd to me. I&#39;m not saying that we should be oblivious to bias, but bias on its own shouldn&#39;t be the sole ground of dismissal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In this topic, I think it has more to do with people just not being familiar with how to interpret research findings or specific topics like agriculture, toxicology, etc. It&#39;s much easier just to skim to the funding source of a study or make some connection to a company than look at the actual evidence. For instance, correctly interpreting research papers in this topic often requires an M.S. or Ph.D level of science education and expertise in the specific field. This basically excludes most of the general public. Many people still want to comment though, so for some they take the sloppy way out and resort to a shill one-liner. It may not be appropriate at all in these discussions, but sometimes that&#39;s all people have to contribute when they have an overriding urge to say something. I can&#39;t fault people too much for not being familiar with agriculture or science topics, so I prefer to think it&#39;s simply a good-faith effort people are attempting to put forward rather than willful ignorance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you mention it a lot, can you point out anything that&#39;s wrong with the Monsanto funded studies and their methodologies? Funding source alone is never a valid reason for discrediting a study. If there was some sort of bias, you should be able to point it out in the methodology, results, and conclusions. That&#39;s the criteria we use when deciding to accept or reject any scientific paper during peer review.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then point out where that conflict exists in the actual paper. Show what they did incorrectly. This is essentially science 101, so there&#39;s really no room for disagreement on this topic. If there was a bias due to the funding source, you should be able to show that bias in the paper. That&#39;s why only pointing to the funding source doesn&#39;t tell you a thing. You need to get straight to the point and look at the actual methodology of the paper.

<blockquote>
<p>hus, a sufficient battery of studies has been
conducted to evaluate the potential for endocrine mod-
ulation. Taken together, results from all studies dem-
onstrate that glyphosate and AMPA are not reproduc-
tive toxicants and do not perturb the endocrine system.
The U.S. EPA (1998a) reviewed these studies and also
concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that
glyphosate produces endocrine-modulating effects.
The results of subchronic and developmental toxicity
tests on POEA also showed no evidence of endocrine
modulation. In addition, the metabolism of POEA
would be expected to produce short-chain carboxylic
acids and similar derivatives, which are not considered
to be endocrine modulators. The lack of any indications
of hormonal activity in subchronic toxicity studies with
Roundup herbicide supports the conclusion that POEA
does not possess endocrine modulating activity.</p>

<p>hey check it out - a study from july 2013 showing glyphosate toxicity!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t you mean an article from july 2013? </p>

<p>Here we have several in vitro studies of glyphosate/roundup on cell cultures in a petri dish. Again, when you look at in vivo studies none of these effects actually carry forward in humans/mammals. </p>

<p>Their was also mention of the Seneff study which was purely a correlation = causation study, and a weak one at that. </p>

<p>The only in vivo study was on daphnia magna which is a small aquatic invertebrate, even ignoring that their results conflict with previous studies, drawing a conclusion that this effect on an aquatic invertebrate will also extend to humans is stretching. And again I already provided you with a list of mammal studies which have found glyphosate to be relatively safe at current application amounts to humans/mammals. </p>

<p>Arguing about the effects of glyphosate on aquatic animals is a different topic all together. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715">Safety Evaluation and Risk Assessment of the Herbicide Roundup and Its Active Ingredient, Glyphosate, for Humans</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>hus, a sufficient battery of studies has been
conducted to evaluate the potential for endocrine mod-
ulation. Taken together, results from all studies dem-
onstrate that glyphosate and AMPA are not reproduc-
tive toxicants and do not perturb the endocrine system.
The U.S. EPA (1998a) reviewed these studies and also
concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that
glyphosate produces endocrine-modulating effects.
The results of subchronic and developmental toxicity
tests on POEA also showed no evidence of endocrine
modulation. In addition, the metabolism of POEA
would be expected to produce short-chain carboxylic
acids and similar derivatives, which are not considered
to be endocrine modulators. The lack of any indications
of hormonal activity in subchronic toxicity studies with
Roundup herbicide supports the conclusion that POEA
does not possess endocrine modulating activity.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some more on the general safety of glyphosate. </p>

<p>Lets assume you understand the implications of what you just said.</p>

<p>What &quot;Mother-Nature-created&quot; food do you imagine that you would be eating?</p>

<p>I would love to hear about it.</p>
