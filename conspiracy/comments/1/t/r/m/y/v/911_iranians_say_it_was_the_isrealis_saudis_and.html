<p>There is something odd when enemies agree with each other. 
No surprise to see Israel deny its own involvement though.
Either way, this needs the public&#39;s attention. </p>

<p>Can we finally agree to get over our social inhibitions and spread this like wild fire?</p>

<p>Incorrect, it&#39;s the same thing as any other day, difference is this time the MSM&#39;s &quot;unbiased coverage&quot; goes for Snowden&#39;s message instead of another politic baboon lying fest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the two agree on is the use of Saudis, and that part of the 9/11 report was redacted at Bush&#39;s behest. </p>

<p>The NY Post article is basically just a rehash of what was speculated, namely, it made the Saudis look bad and complicit, so was removed from the public report. </p>

<p>The Iranian story references the NY Post piece and claims the redacted portion actually accuses Israel. This seems like a stretch to me. The 9/11 commission was ham-strung and underfunded. Their report is the oddest thing in the history of government reports as it is written like a novelization. Maybe the commission did do some amazing feat of investigation--and had the political cajones--and linked up the Israelis in print, but where is any indication the commission did or came to any controversial conclusions (besides this)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They agree that the Saudi&#39;s were involved with logistical support and funding (100,000$) of 3 confirmed hijackers. 
They also agree that Bush blocked investigations into the Saudis.
Its known that the Bush family is intimately involved with the Al-Sauds, and Bin-Ladens. </p>

<p>Around the same time, Fox was reporting on the extensive spying Israel does on the US. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not too aware of who was on the Commission except Henry Kissinger, and its quite as plausible to consider that their investigative scope may have been restricted. Keeping in mind too that the executive branch was under &quot;conspiratorial control,&quot; and that Bush hired plenty of Zionist Israeli Citizens for his cabinet. </p>

<p>If there&#39;s smoke, there&#39;s fire. </p>

<p>At this point, you have a major historical revision in progress. 
Mainstream American media outlets have been breaking the &quot;Saudi involvement&quot; for weeks now.
Are we preparing the rhetoric for another Middle Eastern war?
Will George Bush be arrested? </p>
