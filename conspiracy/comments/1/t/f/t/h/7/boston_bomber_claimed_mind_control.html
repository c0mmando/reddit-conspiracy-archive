<p>He lived through it as a random citizen, far enough away to avoid damage, but close enough to feel the results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the leading theory is that one of the bombings was real and one was a drill and acted out with crisis actors. It is the faked bombing site which was portrayed as the really devastating one- and it is only photos of this site where we see skeptics trying to point out the bottles of fake blood and what not. The other bomb site where a bomb actually went off was much less severe but the injuries were real. So in reality this was the only place where real damage happened.</p>

<p>The end result is two different coinciding stories, which makes it easier to form an &#39;official story&#39; since there is so much variability in the eye witness accounts. The architects of the whole thing can simply pick and chose their story from the accounts as they are revealed, which is much safer than having a preplanned story which could go wrong. This also makes it very difficult for skeptics to sort out because they get caught up thinking it was either all fake or all real, when it was in fact both. Thus the skeptic community is divided and dismantled by the strawman. Very very few find the correct story, and when they do it&#39;s just another theory in the hay stack. </p>

<p>The long-term effects are not known, but two years ago a former major in the Russian foreign intelligence agency, the GRU, died in Scotland after making claims about such a weapons programme to MI6.</p>

<p>Sergei Serykh, 43, claimed he was a victim of weapons which he said were ‘many times more powerful than in the Matrix films’.</p>

<p>Mr Serykh died after falling from a Glasgow tower block with his wife and stepson in March 2010. While his death was assumed to be suicide, his family fear there was foul play.</p>

<p>The long-term effects are not known, but two years ago a former major in the Russian foreign intelligence agency, the GRU, died in Scotland after making claims about such a weapons programme to MI6.</p>

<p>Sergei Serykh, 43, claimed he was a victim of weapons which he said were ‘many times more powerful than in the Matrix films’.</p>

<p>Mr Serykh died after falling from a Glasgow tower block with his wife and stepson in March 2010. While his death was assumed to be suicide, his family fear there was foul play.</p>

<p>Last night the Ministry of Defence declined to comment.</p>
