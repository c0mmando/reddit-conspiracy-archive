       </a>
       denied entry of this question three times; here is the moderator justification and then my response as well; in case anyone cares.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked the question: "What are the known or suspected effects of electromagnetic radiation on organisms, specifically our brain function?"
      </p>
      <p>
       flagged neuroscience with the bottom caption:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The rise in technological advancements coincided with advancements in psychology, electrodynamics, and brain chemistry. Were there experiments done to measure what effect on our development, or that of the rest of the biosphere, the mass of radio and other forms of electromagnetic waves, so quickly brought up, would have?
This doesn't need to tie into the MK Ultra or secret nazi experiments, unless of course it actually does."
      </p>
      <p>
       I agreed with others in that just the mention at the end might have blown it, and seemed like I was looking for more than experimental data, so I posted again:
      </p>
      <p>
       "What are the known or suspected affects of electromagnetic radiation on brain function and development?" (flagged neuroscience again, with no other caption)
      </p>
      <p>
       When it again did not show up for 24 hours, I messaged the moderators: "I tried multiple times to post a question titled something like 'What are the known or suspected effects of electromagnetic radiation on brain function and development?'
I had a bottom caption first which I though may have been the cause, but I tried again without and it has not shown up.
Is there a reason it has not been accepted, or is it a mistake?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I got this response: "Both were removed by mods (other than myself). Presumably because there isn't a good way to answer them except to say, "There is no data, or reasonable reason to suspect, that these types of radiation affect brain development." And to leave it up would probably encourage a lot of not-so-scientific responses."
      </p>
      <p>
       I responded: "So you assume there have been no experiments done supporting any other answer to the question?
What sparked my interest was
       <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/student-science-experiment-finds-plants-wont-grow-near-wi-fi-router/5336877">
        this
       </a>
       so I find that assumption invalid. Is there a better subreddit for this, or a better way to phrase the question?
I appreciate your response."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then a different moderator told me this: "You might want to start with what the NIH as to say on the matter:
       <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cellphones">
        http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cellphones
       </a>
       We are simply unaware of any peer reviewed study that has replicated the kinds of observations that the 9th graders found."
      </p>
      <p>
       Here I was very confused because the source he used contradicted his statement. I responded: "I again do not understand how that would translate to there being no found effects.
To start with, the very beginning lists 'Studies thus far have not shown a consistent link between cell phone use and cancers...' which I translate as, there is evidence which suggests, but has not been well confirmed. I expect that for the NIH to refer to a study, or studies which contradict any assumption that there are no effects, they are peer reviewed.
The article says 'The only known biological effect of radiofrequency energy is heating.' But only a paragraph apart states 'A recent study showed that when people used a cell phone for 50 minutes, brain tissues on the same side of the head as the phoneâ€™s antenna metabolized more glucose than did tissues on the opposite side of the brain. The researchers noted that the results are preliminary, and possible health outcomes from this increase in glucose metabolism are still unknown.'"
That is contradictory, to my understanding, and would leave room for a discussion.
And the 9th graders; 'The experiment earned the girls (pictured below) top honors in a regional science competition and the interest of scientists around the world.' Is it beyond the limits of scientific discussion to bring up evidence for or against the influence of energy upon organisms? Do the moderators know of every experiment which has dealt with the matter to declare that no user of
       <a href="/r/askscience">
        /r/askscience
       </a>
       will not have an educated, scientific take on it?
It is something we deal with every day just using this computer; is it so far from being worth entering into discussion, because it might not give a perfect answer?"
      </p>
      <p>
       The last reply sent to me was: "Well, if you want to discuss the topic, you can post it to
       <a href="/r/AskScienceDiscussion">
        /r/AskScienceDiscussion
       </a>
       . Generally we don't use AskScience to help collect examples that support a particular hypothesis. You will have to do this research yourself."
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a discussion was sparked with evidence on his side contradicted by evidence I brought up seems to me to justify having a scientific discussion on the most convenient subreddit for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My last reply: "Well, when I said 'for or against' I was looking for where the evidence would lead one to stand, based on experiments done by others who began with the hypothesis that there might be an effect.
And when you say 'generally,' are you implying that some cases would fit for an altercation of the parameters (which I don't quite understand), but this isn't, when we are looking at a computer and it might be causing my brain tissues to metabolize more glucose than normal?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I did post it on
       <a href="/r/asksciencediscussion">
        /r/asksciencediscussion
       </a>
       and the one comment on it used the same NIH link and pointed out the contradictory quotes which I then reproduced to the moderator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone see a flaw in my reasoning, or does it seem like the moderators were unjustified in denying the post all or some of the three times (the last time was just the question, rephrased to qualify for biology in general rather than neuroscience)? Has anyone had similar experiences? Could this have been done because the impact the understanding of the unfortified reasoning behind the NIH's conclusion would alter consumer habits, in the way that skepticism about GMO's has? Does anyone care or is this just too long to read?

       I lurk r/conspiracy, but never comment since I'm not a conspiracy theorist; I feel that it's not my place to "argue" with what is said.  However, you seem to have put a lot of time and thought into this, and genuinely want to know what's happening.  If you do want a real explanation, just ask, I'll put one together.

       Really, the
       <a href="/r/askscience">
        /r/askscience
       </a>
       mods answered pretty much perfectly.  There is no evidence that low energy wavelengths have any effect whatsoever on the body or brain.  An experiment by ninth graders does not count.  There are a great number of variables they most likely did not account for because it was just a fun little experiment they did for class.  Also, globalresearch.ca is a conspiracy site that lies frequently, and is not trusted by anyone outside this sub.  This instance of reporting on a 9th grade science project as "earned ... the interest of scientists around the world".
      </p>
      <p>
       You also appear to misunderstand what the cancer.gov link says.  No link established, or similar language, is always used to describe a link that does not exist.  Scientifically, you can not prove the lack of effect with studies that they use.  The result is simply a repeated "no link".  Also, when you have studies of any type, there is always a chance that random variation will give you a false positive result.  If there is truly a link, most studies would show it.  In this case, it is very few fringe studies that show a link, which is why it gets ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, any
       <a href="/r/askscience">
        /r/askscience
       </a>
       post would turn into one person posting the sources of no relationship, followed by conspiracy theorists focusing on one or two studies, rather than the overall trend.  Especially when your only source in 9th graders, they have no reason to let that happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual science behind it:  This "cell phone and wifi are killing your kids"  crap is pretty damn common, which is annoying because basic physics doesn't allow it.  Both devices work well below the range of ionizing radiation, meaning that the do not break or influence chemical bonds in your body.  They can however, deposit their energy in your body as heat.  But, you are constantly exposed to heat sources.  You need them to survive.  In fact, your body (and head) temperature can varies quite a bit, and orders of magnitude more than the amount of energy wifi and cellphone waves contain.  Also, any concern about development during the modern age should be directed toward roofing, not electronics.  The sun is a huge source of the exact same types of waves used (Except at a low higher intensity and more with higher energy as well).  Spending a minute outside will expose you to much more of the same low level energy, as well as some dangerous high level stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other way ti could cause problems, is by pretending low level radiation can be ionizing.  I saw a study recently linking cell phones to brain cancer that tried to explain it as classical, rather than quantum physics.  Quantum mechanics would say that radiation below a certain energy could never free an electron, as the energy is delivered by photons of a specific energy.  This is true, and was observed long before the theory explaining it came about.  Any study claiming that physics doesn't work that way shows that they haven't done even basic research on their own interest, and should not be trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       That response wasn't organised very well, I think.  Does it explain enough to you?

       There's a lot of things that don't make me agree with censoring the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the question is too likely to lead to people discussing things which the establishment scientists disagree with, than the people who start to talk about how the CIA has their hand up our ass could be kicked out. The moderator telling me that the question is too easy to answer ("No. Because the NIH report said so.") is easily disproved, and just does not agree with integrity on a "ask science" forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here you go, and tell me if this doesn't add up to you. Because it doesn't with me either, but is an answer to the question. Also I may have mentioned this somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two quotes from the
       <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cellphones">
        NIH report
       </a>
       that was cited by the moderator:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The only known biological effect of radiofrequency is heating."
      </p>
      <p>
       Scroll down a total of one sentence:
      </p>
      <p>
       "A recent study showed that when people used a cell phone for 50 minutes, brain tissues on the same side of the head as the phoneâ€™s antenna metabolized more glucose than did tissues on the opposite side of the brain. The researchers noted that the results are preliminary, and possible health outcomes from this increase in glucose metabolism are still unknown."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I hate to be the conspiracy theorist citing scientific articles, but an increase in glucose metabolism is a biological effect. That would have been an excellent answer to my question, and actually a person on
       <a href="/r/asksciencediscussion">
        /r/asksciencediscussion
       </a>
       pointed this inconsistency out to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moving on; &gt;No link established, or similar language
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have to assume the NIH doesn't believe it to say that this is an article, among informing generally, to reassure people about the lack of a link between cell phone radiation and cancer. The fact that the language used is 'not shown a
       <em>
        consistent
       </em>
       link' leads me to believe there has been a link, and a predictable variable result can easily be overruled by consistent results otherwise, and they would not feel the need to include the specification 'consistent'. It obviously was not an absolutely repeated 'no link.' It shows what kind of a person I am that I will argue this to you and the moderators, but not dig through the sources to find the study which had contradictory results. A statistical variation just does not clear that up for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the articles reliability;
       <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2013/05/can-wifi-signals-stunt-plant-growth/">
        does ABC news count as reliable enough?
       </a>
       The source does not seem to be misconstruing anything, and I did not base an assumption on the data, I asked a question. Of course it's not something the NIH is going to change their page over, and that is the point of scientists being interested in reproducing the results. And I don't know who the neuroscience professor at Karolisnka Institute in Sweden is, but is sounds like he finished 9th grade. Accusing their age of skewing the results doesn't cover anything for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moderator saying that he does usually allow questions that are asked in order to support at particular hypothesis, is apparently not well acquainted with the scientific method. The question and hypothesis work well going before the experiment. And in this case, it was, once again, just a question.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you say &gt;basic physics doesn't allow it
      </p>
      <p>
       You must be far more acquainted with the basic physics behind the delicacy of neurochemical reactions than me. So perhaps that explains the glucose metabolism? Anyway, if I were to make a hypothesis on this subject, I would be more likely to infer that a prolonged exposure to radiation from electronics, whether from the high pitched noise emitted or whatever comes along with it, would disturb the natural development of the brain, cloud the function, or wear it out and make it work in a less efficient manner. I don't have an experiment to prove this. Seems like a lot of equipment, a lot of variables to watch out for, a lot to ask of a developing person, and a long time to do it. I thought there might be some that would assist in my curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
       People can always just attack my merit as a scientist making an inference, but I just asked a question.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of ionizing radiation, perhaps I'm not quite accustomed with. Because of the intensity and wavelength both playing in, it doesn't make sense to qualify a wavelength below the amount of ionizing (nor that complete electron turnover is the only way organisms can be effected) when microwave radiation can have so much effect as to burn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heat obviously is not the concern people have regarding this.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Spending a minute outside will expose you to much more of the same low level energy
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You underestimate the number of electronics in my house.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Solar_Spectrum.png">
        Here's what Wikipedia thinks.
       </a>
       It appears the amount of low frequency waves (in the case of this graph) negligible compared to visible light. And the sun can cause cancer, but we have evolved for about 4 billion years to be used to the sun's radiation. So I'm not as concerned as 5 billion cell phones or however many T.V's dealing with things the best defense for not worrying is either 1. completely contradictory with the sentence following, or 2. quantum theory. Yes, numbers work very well and can be applied, but you are talking about effects which are not measurable by our applied technology. No educated person would believe quantum theory has all the answers, and doesn't ever mislead us with observations. Have our brains not evolved to a point beyond our understanding of physics? I wouldn't bet my head on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last thing, and tell me whether you are convinced the question should not have been censored:
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't specify what kind of radiation. I didn't say 'cell phone' or 'radio waves.' If you blast my brain with X rays, what happens? Or gamma rays? I don't feel like I'm going over the top to say that the moderators, by censuring the questions, declared this not worth asking. That's not very virtuous as a scientist.

       I'm sorry, but you are misunderstanding basic light behavior, and completely missing the ideas of quantum mechanics.  At this point, I've presented you with everything necessary to answer your problem, you just refuse to believe it.  The only way I could see you overcoming this is by taking a few physics classes.  I'll try one last time with a few things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Starting at the end, because that's where you go way too far off.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect
       </a>
       This is the basis of the theory that does not allow light below certain energies to cause chemical reactions.  Notice:  It was first observed in 1887, and the theory explaining it first came over 10 years later.  This is not something that is barely understood, or still being looked at for possibilities.  This has been known for over a century, both in repeated experiments and in theory.  If you think this is false, one experiment showing it would win you a Nobel prize, and the last 100 years of physics work would need to be redone.  In fact, your radio/wifi/cellphone wouldn't even work is this theory were not true.  and yes, every even slightly educated person does believe this, because there is so much evidence for it, and not single repeatable experiment against it, and it's been this way since before the Ottoman empire fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Important note I just noticed:  In terms of chemical effects, the threshold from EM does not depend on intensity.  That is the entire point.
      </p>
      <p>
       For glucose metabolism, it is preliminary.  being actual scientists, they did the right thing and released the results, but no indication as to why, because they have not controlled for the possible variables.  Perhaps glucose metabolism is influenced by heat.  Perhaps that heat came directly from the phone by convection.  Perhaps having an object near your face affects brain reactions.  Perhaps hearing stimulus form only one ear affects brain activity one only one side of the brain.  All are much more plausible than the EM waves having an effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for posting the ABC link, it gives enough for me to completely label this as bullshit.  First, the kids did control for temperature and hydration.  This means the only way left is that violation of quantum mechanics.  Second, that researcher who is so interested is
       <a href="http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=21984&amp;amp;a=54583&amp;amp;l=en">

       </a>
       .  His comments on their experiment being "ingenious" made me question his intelligence, seeing as this is literally the most basic experiment possible for this field.  Turns out his career is built on trying to show EM sensitivity, which unsurprisingly, doesn't exist when the studies change to double blind.  He's a quack, who again, decides to ignore all physics related to his field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything in this comment you posted shows me that you aren't actually thinking about anything I've said.  You keep trying to make wording choice mean everything, and thinking that the overwhelming scientific consensus can be overruled by that one sentence, WHICH FUCKING AGREES WITH THAT CONSENSUS.  Any person with a shred of sense would have realized that what you are trying to say here is not making sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, there is still no reason to allow your post.  It is damn obvious you weren't talking about X-rays and gamma rays, as their effect is very well known (same as radio and micro).  It is obvious which way you wanted the discussion to go, as even now you refuse to accept any points made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, a not so kind reminder:  When it comes to science, saying "I just don't understand how that can be true" does not make you right.  It just means you're an idiot.  This is why I don't post in

       I'll try to keep it clear of opinions and do this like Aquinas style.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 1: Light above a certain wavelength cannot influence chemical reactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 2: My radio turns on when radio waves pass through it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So: My brain is definitely not affected at all by waves above a certain wavelength.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 1: Cell phone radiation only causes heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 2: A study cited by the NIH showed increased glucose metabolism after cell phone use
      </p>
      <p>
       So: Cell phone radiation only causes heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 1: "Radiofrequency exposure from cell phone use does cause heating; however, it is not sufficient to measurably increase body temperature." (NIH)
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 2: "Perhaps glucose metabolism is increased by heat." (you)
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 3: It's probably not what I don't consider likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       So: It is not worth asking in a science forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 1: You are not a conspiracy theorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 2: ABC link makes a science experiment bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So: I am just an idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 1: The experiment's variables were well controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 2: You understand completely biotic function.
      </p>
      <p>
       So: Violation of scientific theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 1: Professor of neuroscience compliments 9th grader's experiment using strong language.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 2: He also attempts to make a breakthrough against a theory accepted as fact by some people on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So: Copernicus was a quack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 1: 9th graders get award.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 2: Most basic experiment possible for the field.
      </p>
      <p>
       So: Why didn't you think of it?
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not positive what you are mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 1: A sentence referred to expressly uses language to demonstrate that a complete consensus does not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 2: A sentence contradicts one almost immediately preceding it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So: AGREES WITH THAT CONSENSUS
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 1: It's damn obvious I wasn't talking about X-rays.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 2: It makes no mention of specific forms of electromagnetic radiation in the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       So: Censor question in case someone does something not scientific.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 1: A microwave over can blow up a head.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement 2: Understanding of the complex functions of the brain are only beginning to be understood.
      </p>
      <p>
       So: There is no reason to allow a question.
      </p>
      <p>
       So: To question is to deny the photoelectric effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       So: You are a commune-fascist bastard space alien and I don't get why you lurk on conspiracy when nothing interests you that is different from what you here is a consensus.
      </p>
      <p>
       So: It's okay though,because I've talked about this way to much, so I just sent a ridiculous message to the moderators accusing them of being pop stars pretending to be the Illuminati, and I will sleep well tonight. I hope you do too.

       I think there was a long time when that was considered to be a possibility, and the evidence for the changing of minds is still available in popular books and articles.
      </p>

       And the same goes with climate-change deniers except it is a recent thing and so the conclusions made based on observations are subject to more scrutiny. But they are, in fact, censored.

       You understand that there are armies of graduate students trying to break down every conceivable scientific theory?  Coming up with an exception to a scientific theory would be one of the crowning achievements in their careers.  In fact there is quite a bit of rampant speculation that is tolerated in the sciences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever I hear some one complain about "scientific censorship" you can be sure then either never did any science in their entire life or they are a crank.  After decades of debunking pseudoscience claims, I wish there were a third option.

       It requires very expensive technology to measure changes in neurological reactions and further, in the case of measuring the effects of something like radio waves, or mild application of X rays, over a long period of time, or even over the development of a human brain, an experiment would require means very difficult for graduate students to handle.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is, I am sure, evidence to suggest there is an effect other than heat from electromagnetic radiation. In fact, the NIH report states so.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Scientific censorship" applying to experimental data is different. They just denied my question three times and have not given a good reason for it.

       I think it's a question that there are probably unheard of but reliable studies done. And the fact I could get into a discussion over it with people just regarding the source one of the mods gave me (NIH) says that is was a valid question to me, and its weird that would be censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why you would either. But I also don't understand why some questions are acceptable, but that wasn't. Its weird, you gotta understand, and the answer isn't so obvious, nor is it certain, nor is there not reliable evidence to suggest an opposing viewpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if there is like another way it could be phrased, I asked if that would be pointed out, and just got: "It's not fit for science answers, only discussion on a way less popular subreddit."

       There are hitlerally dozens of posts that we don't release, every day. Repeat questions, poor phrasing, plain idiocy - you name it, we've seen it. As I said earlier, we need to improve our feedback loop, but there's honestly nothing special about your question that caused the rejection. It's nothing personal, just the way the subreddit works. Maybe ELI5 is a better option - they don't moderate as heavily, it seems?

       It would be really cool, because the other moderators I talked too skipped over it, if there was a better way I could ask the question, on askscience that doesn't have whatever problem it is, and specifies that I am looking for studies.
      </p>
      <p>
       One comment on asksciencediscussion pointed out the contradiction in the NIH article with the glucose metabolism, and that is interesting and was a perfect answer to the question. But I doubt that is the only exception.

       Hey see if someone just said, "this question has been well addressed and more of similar is likely to cause unnecessarily speculative debate," than my reaction would have been entirely different.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the reactions the other moderators gave still weird me out and I still think they are wrong in how they justified, but I'm sure I could find about all I would expect/hope from asking my own question from those results; thanks.

       And since you've been so helpful, my natural instinct is too ask more of you. I'm not in a rush to comprehend the world or anything, but I asked another completely unrelated question (insofar as physics is) that didn't get accepted. It could just be my username or something. I'm gonna try rephrasing it before I ask, though.

       I believe any form of censorship at its base is not scientific.   I have been seeing the trend in many "scientific" circles to silence their opposition via censorship rather than by actually doing as science requires.   That requirement as I understand it is to accept all challenges and either prove or disprove them using scientific methodology.   Popular opinion has no place in science.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen this trend all over the place.   I have seen it so often and so frequently, that when I see one of these places refer to some scientific study as proving something they do not find controversial I immediately assume it could not have truly been scientific due to the fact they will silence dissenters rather than defeat such challenges using the scientific method.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was subscribed to r/science before I read your post and I read about them immediately deleting any anti-global warming/climate change discussion I unsubbed because, that place can no longer be considered science.   It is going from science, and becoming dogmatic like religion.

       You misread me a little. I think we need the opinions of our peers. I do not condone censorship. I think that people assume peer review allows them to infer certitude when it appears that the peer review process requires only a small amount of consensus and some amount of pandering to the incumbent, scientific, journalistic institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       As my beloved Rober Anton Wilson wrote, "Belief in the traditional sense, or certitude, or dogma, amounts to the grandiose delusion, "My current model" -- or grid, or map, or reality-tunnel -- "contains the whole universe and will never need to be revised." In terms of the history of science and knowledge in general, this appears absurd and arrogant to me, and I am perpetually astonished that so many people still manage to live with such a medieval attitude."

       Opinion is fine.   It is just not science.   Opinion is in the realm of the hypothesis.   It still has to be tested.   I am fine with people expressing opinions if they realize that an opinion is not scientific fact.   It still has to be tested, proven, or disproven.   It should always be possible to challenge anything but, then the burden of proof or disproof applies.   This is the scientific method.   The scientific method is not to make an unassailable theory that no one may challenge.   This is not even close to scientific.   It is much closer to religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I do agree with what your post stated that I just replied to.  I am just ranting because, I think it is outrageous that people believe something is true without testing just because, of the lips of the person it comes from.

       I share this opinion. I do not share your opinion that opinions and science are exclusive of one another. I think that opinion contradicts the afore quoted opinion. I do not distinguish between subjective and objective facts, nor do I distinguish between emotional and rational mental processes. The world and the mind appear too technically convoluted for me to make such distinctions with any certitude.

       I see no place for the emotional process in science unless what you are studying scientifically deals with emotions.   I do not believe whether I am angry, sad, happy, or mad that gravity will suddenly alter how it functions.   Now if we are talking Telekinesis and anyone proves it exists then it very well could have an emotional component.   This is pondering, and speculation.   If were then to go and say IT HAS AN EMOTIONAL component without testing it, that would be my opinion but there would be no science or proof about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are dealing with contested issues that there is no clear victor then the opinions of those who do practice relevant sciences, and even those known for rationality and use of logic might have value in leading us towards good testable processes.   Science itself and its outcomes require concrete reproducible and testable outcomes.   Opinion and emotion matter for naught at that point.    If people are not certain how to test something, then opinions/speculation can perhaps eventually lead toward some paths.   The end result of the scientific method are neither opinions or speculation.   It is very logical and straightforward.   Basically, at this time all tests reveal the following.   If someone finds something that does not fit that model then it is a big deal.   It means the model is wrong.   Being wrong does not mean it is not close, it means it needs to be revisited to see if something can explain the anomaly.   There will be speculation and opinions at this point that once again lead towards testable incidents.   If tests can then verify the modified model in such it stands up to the anomalous concept then at that point it is still the best model and what we consider to be most true at that time.   It is no longer emotional or opinion at that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those things only are used in arguments in religious contexts, or when arguing against cognitive dissonance.  With the exception being when there is no model and the opinions may lead towards a testable direction.

       I know enough about the mind that I can only pretend that observations can occur independent of emotion. I can find emotion in every conceivable experience; the emotion of curiosity drives people to investigate their environment using the scientific method just as the emotion of pride prevent people from letting go of incumbent models of the world when new data demonstrates a flaw. In the end, the experimenter invariably possesses a human physiology and as such is subject the same emotional constraints that make food taste better or worse depending on your mood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I challenge anyone to artificially experiment with your mood via ingestion of exogenous simulators of endogenous neurotransmitters and tell me that their perceptive powers remain objectively intact. Objectivity appears to me as an illusory ideal that allows us to pretend to live a shared experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       One issue I have with dogmatic scientists comes in response to their belief that "concrete, reproducible, and testable outcomes" are possible and their inference that reproducibility implies truth. Just because the sun rises every morning doesn't mean that it will do so tomorrow. Most things do not lend themselves to reproduction because, holistically speaking, they entail to many details to simulate in a laboratory experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another issue I have would respond to their belief that accreditation and peer review implies truth and any claim that hasn't been vetted through these systems has a high likelihood of fraud. I find the opposite to be possible more often than not. In my experience, individuals have more propensity towards honesty than organizations due to an unshared reputational burden.

       I agree with you partially.   Particularly I agree with the last paragraph you wrote completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       In your second to last paragraph, I believe that I agree with that as well.   It is essentially what I was getting at.   The scientific method actually requires a scientist to change their mind when presented with evidence that contradicts or does not fit within their previous beliefs.   Though the "scientific" community can be very resistant to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not say human motion does not exist.   It does.   In this you are absolutely correct.   It will also play a role in anything a human does.   However, it is not this emotion that ultimately is measured and challenged via scientific method.   Only that which is measurable, and relevant to the study can be tested for fallacy/accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human Nature (emotion) does tend to interfere with this process, but that does not mean that this is actually part of the scientific method.   In fact, it is this nature that I believe the scientific rigorously attempts to keep in check.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am no fan of "peer review" documentations as justification for something.   I am fine with something being submitted for review, but the reviewer is still subject to the same requirements as everyone else.   When they apply censorship instead they fail miserably at the task at hand.

       I agree very much, after centuries of constant breakthroughs blowing holes in previous conceptions, it seems many people have become too settled. And there being so much money in it, it would seem very easy to control the internet's face of opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe in global warming, but I am not so certain as to ignore contrary evidence. I suspect that constant viewing of light emissions and hearing the screech from electronics and power lines, as well as cell phone and radio frequency waves, have an impact on our brain that we do not yet understand. I believe it should be a priority in scientific research. The functions of our brain are fragile. The progress of the modern world is chaotic.

       Back when Earth Day was first coming out and there were some "green" shows on Television (quite some time before Global Warming as an issue) I remember watching shows with my parents that indicated electronic devices were doing harm to the human body.   I really wish I remember the name of the show.   There is so much money in these things these days it would likely result in lobbyists trying to stop it if anyone attempted to bring evidence to bear of such negative impact existing.

       I believe in global warming, I also believe in global cooling.   These things are historically proven to exist.   This includes times hotter than we have now.  This includes times much colder than now.   The cold times seem to come after some very large volcanic event, and then it gradually warms (over a long time).
      </p>
      <p>
       What has not been proven to my satisfaction is the idea of CO2 being the culprit.   I also do not see cap and trade as a solution IF it turns out to be carbon emissions.   That just shifts the blame and adds new taxes, which those with sufficient wealth/pull/power can side step.   If they get in on the new tax, they also get more wealth/pull/power.

       Now IF someone does convince me that Global Warming is occurring due to human activity then I will say I believe that.   That does not mean I will put up a barrier in my mind and refuse to hear out any dissenters.   It is vital to science that we constantly challenge everything.   If we have a sound proof then it should withstand every challenge.   If it doesn't then we got something wrong and we need to revise and try to find out what explains it all.   This does not mean using one mathematical process on one set of numbers, and another process on a different set of numbers and then putting the two together as proof.   For science to work the measurement of data must be consistent across the data sets or it is invalid and corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe the planet is warming, and it does have cooling periods interspersed in there.   However, look at how many civilizations they are finding at the bottom of the ocean...  this to me indicates we have been warming for quite some time...  the melt off from the ice age has consistently raised water levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOW IF YOU WANT THE REAL PROBLEM:  The problem is not so much carbon emissions, that is just some crazy scheme they have come up with to get more wealth/power/pull.    The problem is what it was and known to be before Al Gore and his Hockey Stick graph.   Pollution, Deforestation, etc.    These things should be addressed without requiring any carbon tax.   If they are bad, ban them.   Don't allow lobbyists to let you give people loopholes.   Cronyism is a big part of the problem.   Carbon Tax is just a tool the people already in control via Cronyism can use to get more control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, a lot of this is opinion... it is my current opinion, and I am willing to change it at any moment if decent logical/rational information is prevented to convince me.   After such a change I may again change later as new information is presented to me.

       I like your opinion, in fact I don't believe anyone leaning away from greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change has ever been so agreeable to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I surely agree upon, is that pollution, deforestation, etc. are problems that need to be addressed, and just like global warming, they are on a global scale and require a global solution. So whether or not we are causing the warming, it must be addressed, and it will a bigger step in uniting the world than the formation of the League of Nations, and then the United Nations. It will require surveillance of the world, and a worldwide executive government.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so, even with our differing opinions, we have a common thing to worry about; I worry that this global crisis will be downsized and upsized by the cronies, and will lead it to be ignored until some big event changes everyone's mind, and then the reasonable moderates today will become radicals, and we will quickly and without prudence form a government of the world. And I am sure, that in governments instituted to ensure security, instead of liberty, liberty tends to be ignored. But this time there is nowhere to run; and the cyclical fall of empires does not apply to the circumstances we find ourselves in. We could put a laser in space to silence any 'counter-revolutionaries,' and the working class suddenly does not have the power to control the military, when remote control weaponry is the new thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So things are going to have to change, and if they do it on someone else's terms, we are more at risk of being an enslaved race of workers than at any time before, and maybe any time after.

       And if you don't mind, what undersea cities have you seen? I've seen very little on one around Japan, it seems to exist, but the lack of research surrounding it discredits it too me. There isn't even many pictures. I did see, also, a city recently discovered off the coast of Egypt, once mentioned by Herodotus.

       Thank you for the good response.   I was off at work for a few days and did not see this until now.

      <p>
       As to cities.   There is one off of Cuba that was found within the last few years, and there are the ones of the shores of Spain, and I believe they have found a number in the Black Sea.  I always thought it made sense.   Man likes to build near sea level.   During the ice age it would make sense that the ocean levels were lower.   As the ice melted I would expect it to rise.   I have heard theories that a lot of the ice melted in Canada but was tied up in a fresh water lake of massive size behind some ice.   When the wall of ice holding it back finally gave way a large amount of fresh water was dumped into the worlds oceans.   This is a theory/hypothesis/speculation as I have not seen a report explaining how they prove this.   It would explain why there appear to be civilizations that are now under water.   There are also some off the coast of India.   I hadn't heard of the ones in the Japan area.

       The one in Japan was only one, so far as I heard. A friend told me she saw it one Ancient Aliens and I called bullshit immediately. The site the show gave was bullshit, talking about how its inside the 'Devil's Triangle' and 15,000yo but not bothering mentioning excavation data, archaeologist names, or even a date of discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/09/070919-sunken-city.html">
        But nevertheless.
       </a>
       There aren't a lot of pictures but the ones I've seen seem unlikely to be formed naturally in such a confined area. It could be camera angle, but then it would probably be milked more for media time, only to be debunked and cause people to lose confidence in 'hidden history' theories. I already don't have a lot of confidence so it wouldn't shatter anything for me. I don't know how anyone could have dated the rock, though either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sea levels surely change, so I agree with you that there are probably many offshore. Rivers changed course and so it took a long time to find where ancient Sumerian cities like Eridu were. Many, like Assad, have still not been found. Makes being an archaeologist sound more exciting. Or an Iraqi reformer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Black Sea, the Red Sea, the Nile River all seem like good places to look around (in the case of rivers especially, there could be meters of silt covering any sign, and so it going unnoticed this long is not improbable. But most of all, the East Mediterranean and Aegean Seas.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem interested, so I'll spill this thought I've had, which I haven't looked into much. When the sea levels were much lower, the Straight of Gibraltar must have been too. I don't know if it would have dried up,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_macaques_in_Gibraltar">
        but there are North African monkeys in Gibraltar
       </a>
       , so it seems plausible land may have reached across at some point in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, the climate of the Mediterranean may have allowed it to become much smaller, and more of an inland sea, or collection of river valleys. In this case, being that the Near East was such a perfect place for technological advancements in three continents to converge, perhaps people were better settled in the bed of the Mediterranean than anywhere else, and at some point, the sea levels rose and a quick flood flew through, forcing the inhabitants to move, or drown.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what geological evidence may support of debunk this, but it would be an interesting way to explain the prevalence of deluge myths, and the differences in stories of the one or few survivors (in an ark, or on a mountain top). Good food for thought, I'm curious what likelihood there is of lower sea levels draining the Mediterranean.

       I was actually wondering about this same thing the other day.   I was wondering how deep the straits of Gibraltar are and if they are not deep enough was there a time when the levels were low enough that the Mediterranean and the Atlantic ocean were not connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the shows the mention various ruins are usually tied to documentaries about Atlantis.   Sometimes it is in the Mediterranean, sometimes in the Bermuda triangle area, and sometimes off the Atlantic coast of Spain.   I am fine with speculation but, I'd like it backed up with scientific exploration, and continually challenged.    I instead took interest in the various ruins that are reported at different places around the world in the concept of rising ocean levels.   There absolutely can be no doubt that during the ice age the oceans would have had to have been considerably lower.   I postulated that since humans tend to like to habitate near the oceans that there are undoubtedly some older habitations that are now under water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other events can also cause things to be under the seas without rising ocean levels.  Subduction zones, and such.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I do not mention these things to make people buy into Atlantis or anything else.   For me they are interesting when considering global warming and rising sea levels.  I am not a fan of the term "climate change" as that is the infinite box that everything fits into so by using that term you are not defining a specific change and thus can NEVER be wrong.  "I didn't say global warming, I said climate change."   This is equivalent to saying "I did not say monkey, I said animal".
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway thanks for the good and civil conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: As to the monkeys in Gibraltar.   I wanted to show that I am truly open minded and like to challenge my own thoughts.   There are a number of ways that could have occurred.   I will propose two.   1) At one point there was a land bridge that no longer exists, 2) At one point enough monkeys to establish a population were moved there by humans... whether as a pet, or something else I cannot say.    I am not saying either of these are true as I have no way of knowing.   I just am demonstrating that I do like to consider alternatives and I do not latch onto one and try to ram it down everyone's throats.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 2:  I saw that Ancient Alien episode.   My wife and I enjoy watching it, though the last two seasons I have not enjoyed that much.   They are trying too hard to make it justify the world religions now.   I don't really buy into revelation, prophecy, etc.   I've seen enough people make things up that most religions just are not for me.   With that said, I believe strongly in freedom of or from religion.   I just don't see trying to make it fit every biblical story, or pick another religious story is necessary.   I was more interested in the ruins and such I had never heard of.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 3: Just for laughs... in a recent Ancient Aliens they were talking about parting the Red Sea and how aliens might have used a wind machine to do that...   All I was thinking was "umm what about the people walking there?  Don't you think enough wind to do that would kind of blow them the hell away."  :P

       To give you more support for this: take the Chumash of California, the Phoenicians of Lebanon, and the first architects of South America in Peru (cannot recall the name of the culture); they all fished for food, had abundant supplies, and so appear to have exhibited signs of social organization prior to the advent of agriculture. These are very fascinating cultures, and in their respective areas were champions of technological advancement. For the record, eventually land dwelling cultures overcame the Phoenicians and Peruvians, but they were rare cases of civilization without agriculture.
      </p>
      <p>
       So from that, I would infer that
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       there was an advanced (by prehistoric standards) civilization that has been lost to history, or became myth, they probably fished for the subsistence necessary for pursuit of artistic, architectural, and other goals peculiar to civilization. From there it's no question they probably lived by the water, which could be underseas now, or could be in the middle of a random desert where a river used to run that brought inhabitants of the area together by necessity, like the Nile.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Atlantis itself, I've read on it of course, but I know Plato's Timaeus best for it, and it seems to me 1. It was not inferred to be connected to the deluge of Deucalion and Pyrrha. 2. Plato was a great guy and all, but also an admitted liar, and it seems more like a nationalistically propagated myth to make people love the history of Athens and want them to be the best. If Solon really did receive the story from the Egyptian records, than it might be seen better in the Egyptian records, or anywhere else. I wouldn't bet everything on this, but Plato understood how misconstrued myths were and understood very well how easily people were deceived by pretty story telling. But maybe Jews from Mars settled on Atlantis and the Elder Masters of Tibet are focusing their energy to stop the other Martians from taking all of our gold. I don't really know.

       That's great. People always assume just because I argue with them that I disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the monkeys totally could have been brought, by the Phoenicians, by the Romans or farther on. I would not be surprised. If it was a land bridge of ice I think the same thing goes, that the Mediterranean would definitely have been shallower, and maybe even a collection of river valleys. I don't think the bed of the Mediterranean has been explored nearly well enough.

       Ancient Aliens was fascinating when I first saw it, then got really ridiculous. They're making to much money off of it. For the maximum amusement for the subject, and for personal opinion improvement, I would suggest
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao0ETP2yZQg">
        this
       </a>
       . I only got around to the first hour, but it's very well done. They go through the architectural feats, and show clips from Ancient Aliens and explain how much they confuse facts to give the picture they intend too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except for the things which are really just wrong, I'm glad Ancient Aliens is on the air. I just don't think the History channel is the place for it.

       I see your point. You are trying to ask a question that the "system" does not want asked. Ans a such, you are being silenced for that attempt. This is similar to the "Climate Change" dissent ban. In other words, censorship. Reddit is quickly becoming a "Mainstream Media" arm of the "system" that will not tolerate opposing views or comments. Soon even this sub will start to ban unwanted points of view. The Elite's are fighting back and taking control of the Internet so as to keep us
       <strong>
        all

       under their control. Is my comment a bit too much ? Perhaps. But if a little thought is applied to the situation, it becomes clear.

       It is an opinion worth considering. There is so much money in buying new electronics, like the new edition of General Motors in the twentieth century, that information questioning the safety of using these products regularly could have a direct impact on profits, and so would be worth insisting under the guise of keeping the subreddit 'scientific' keeping that information from becoming popular.
