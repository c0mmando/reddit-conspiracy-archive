       Let's say we give a [this] post 24 hours for the community to vote on it. After the hours have passed, if the vote threshold in support of this proposal exceeds a certain percentage [65-70% is probably reasonable] that we ban these users from the subreddit.

       These users have no intention of participating in this subreddit for any reason other than trolling. This will clean up the discussions threads quite a bit, especially if we enforce a commenting/voting restriction on new accounts. They get banned, they create a new account but the new account can't post or vote here. Currently I believe the required account age is three days; this should be extended to one month. If a user is interested in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and they just joined/created their account a month ago, they probably need to spend some time reading and getting familiar with topics and the culture of the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this proposal is accepted by the community by a show of votes, additional ban lists will follow each week (or more frequently) with an updated list of active submitters or moderators. This will go on as long as it has to and I have no problem putting in the minimal work required to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       And secondly, if moderators show inaction on these proposals after the community collectively agrees for action, we must start examining each moderator and determine whether or not they should be allowed to remain as custodians of the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's get this shit rolling and take the first step to cleaning up our community.

       I think banning pre-emptive large amounts of people is nonsense and only creates drama.

       Ignoring

       is the best way to deal with them as long there is no evidence for trolling or bad behavior from a certain user, i see no reason to ban pre emptive users.

       This really seems like the most reasonable answer. Unless they've actually trolled the sub I can't see a good reason to ban them and in the few that I checked out none of them had actually done so in the last 30 days. If we see a troll we can report them and then you guys can figure out whether he needs banned or not. You've always shown pretty good judgement in the past, and I do imagine it would create even more drama to just start banning people.

       You however did tell him to shut the fuck up, which would violate rule #3, stop this behavior.

       Not if their intent is to derail and it usually is, they just do more low level trolling by not quite breaking the rules enough to get banned, but still do their best to stop meaningful discussion.

       I would agree about pre-emptive bans for any average user, but people who are known mods or major contributors to

       You definitely just changed the subject.  Once again, the post was blatantly anti-brigading.  IT WAS WARNING USERS.  I'm not talking about what they say or what they believe.  I talking about brigading.  Prove to me that they brigade.

       Well heck, you telling me it was a private sub just informed me that it was a private sub.  While no I do not not support that (making it impossible to find evidence/proof), I enjoy some of the more ludicrous material posted there.  Not so much the stuff that links here, but the user-created stuff.  So I will stay there.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if they ever do publicly post about brigading then I retract my support, because that is stuff that could get a user shadowbanned.  I go there for the lulz, not for brigading/trolling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Serious question, why do you not make this sub private?

       You can downvote troll posts to make them go away.  You can't make a downvote brigade go away.  That is why I am interested in proof of the brigade.

       Also, since when is asking for proof "a tactic used to cause disharmony in discussion"?  It is part of discussion.  If you can provide proof, then we can further the discussion.  Right now we might as well be saying the "tooth fairy is teaming up with santa to put fluoride in our presents" since we don't need proof.

       The amount of times you have asked for "proof of claim" in this ONE thread is proof that you are using it to discredit and take away from any discussion we would have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who actually visits this sub regularly does not need proof of brigading, as I type these words I can only shake my head in sadness at the lack of words to convey this feeling. Its the same feeling that makes you want to slap someone in the face for asking "what color is that" 500 times in a row.

      <p>
       And perhaps the reason why I've asked for it so much is because NO ONE CAN PROVIDE ANY PROOF.  The burden of proof is on you if you are going to demand bans.  None of this "Known Truth" bullshit if you are asking for bans.  Either you have evidence of it happening, or it might as well not have happened.  It is that simple.

       Yeah, sorry people who come here for discussions can't provide proof that another sub is conspiring against them to systematically vote and post useless things. Kind of like this discussion right here, someone who posts in conspiratard who admittedly does not like this sub putting in effort in making sure people do not think another sub geared twords making fun of the people here has anything to do with the problem of having people come here and post useless shit to make fun of everyone.

       Your posts have nothing to do with discussion. The only function of your posts is to provide an ultimatum to stop discussion. You obviously have a vested interest in this function or you would have never started this.

       My vested interest is in fair treatment.  Please don't attack me personally in attempt to change the subject.  That is causing a disharmony in the discussion.  I only wish to see a fair trail before you condemn us all.  I believe that all people are innocent until proven guilty.  So prove that we are guilty.  And not guilty by association.  Just because I am friends with people who have committed crimes does not mean that I have committed the crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I think what we are doing is having a discussion about the topic.  So yes, me asking for proof has furthered the discussion.

       Ahh, a solid point there telling me to shut the fuck up.  I was furthering the discussion by asking for proof.  If that had been provided then we could've continued to further the discussion.  However, you chose to attack me, so I had to defend myself.  I did not make this discussion about me, you did.

       It is the main tactic used on reddit to shut down any discussion topic, when it is stated that no direct proof can be displayed there is then an opening to discredit the whole thread or topic.

       Did you really just say that demanding proof to further discussion is hostile to the topic itself? I can't even wrap my brain around that. Anybody that posts here should be able to provide evidence any time we are asked, that is the entire point of what we do. Someone asking for proof of something isn't automatically something to get hostile about, whether he posts in Conspiratard or not.

        I wasn't asking about if they were posters, that's not against Reddit's ToS. Brigading is a much more serious issue, and I would like to see some proof of this claim.
       </p>
       <p>
        You can downvote troll posts to make them go away. You can't make a downvote brigade go away. That is why I am interested in proof of the brigade.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, since when is asking for proof "a tactic used to cause disharmony in discussion"? It is part of discussion. If you can provide proof, then we can further the discussion. Right now we might as well be saying the "tooth fairy is teaming up with santa to put fluoride in our presents" since we don't need proof.

       3 posts centered around the basis that proof must be given or there can not be any more discussion, solidified by the 4th post.

       When proof is "asked" for 4 times in 3 posts it is no longer "asking" is it? Furthermore there were no attempts to salvage any direction other than proof.

       So is anyone noticing a pattern here? If you're for protecting the sub from known agitators you are downvoted. Not that all of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       would necessarily agree with that action, but they mostly wouldn't downvote someone who is only trying to protect the sub.

       are voted up and most others are currently near or below zero.  Boy am I glad the [blank] are looking out for this sub.

       I'm in, please mods, ban these trolls, a lot of these accounts strike me as JIDF at a casual glance. Anyone who unduly accuses someone of antisemitism to stifle conversation, critical of Israel should be banned. It's such an obvious subversion of the 1st rule of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . All of a sudden you go from discussing the plight of the Palestinian people, to defending your credibility as an objective interpreter of events is Israel.

       How does it logically follow that "Disagreeing with you == Zionist".

       This isn't a game of Clue where accusations follow the formula "I accuse x of y!".

       What does the following mean if it doesn't mean you suspect the people disagreeing with you are sympathetic to Zionism?

       You definitely just changed the subject.  Once again, the post was blatantly anti-brigading.  IT WAS WARNING USERS.  I'm not talking about what they say or what they believe.  I talking about brigading.  Prove to me that they brigade.
