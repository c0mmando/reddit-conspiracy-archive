        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Everywhere I go on the internet I see this happening.. anytime a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is talked about it gets that stigma attached to it and is sent to off topic.. OR it instantly devolves into a political debate because all major conspiracies seem to be politicized as well - divide and conquer... if you have the country split between dems and republicans and then politicize conspiracy theories no progress can ever get made.</p>

<p>I created a thread in the asperger syndrome section because I have it and wanted aspies (people with aspergers syndrome) advice on ways I could handle the situation I am in because as aspies we have unique challenges. But because it was dealing with a conspiracy theory they said it belonged in the conspiracy forum and was closed. This shows how conspiracy theories have been segregated from the general population... what better way to keep people in the dark...</p>

<p>I myself have made incredible discoveries and I have looked for help to get this info to the masses yet everywhere I try to get help I have been trashed and attacked. The conspiracy sites are just as bad in this way as the mainstream sites.</p>

<p>I am new to the conspiracy forum here on Reddit though so I guess i will see how it goes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may have worded that poorly... the discovery wasn&#39;t about aspergers... the discovery is world changing info about info that has been suppressed.</p>

<p>But I wanted to ask aspies because part of the problem I have getting this info out relates to my issues as a aspie because many non-aspies don&#39;t understand aspies or think we aren&#39;t intelligent because we don&#39;t express ourselves the same as non-aspies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. But <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> had started getting more and more conspiracy articles. So they removed it from the defaults and, not satisfied with that, they started doing extensive censorship of articles and source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see why that needed to be the solution though... if people don&#39;t want the threads on the board then don&#39;t respond to them. It seems to be the exact opposite of what should be done if people are segregating something because it is such a hot topic... it totally destroys the concept of freedom of speech. This is something we should be protecting not censoring ourselves.</p>

<p>It&#39;s especially dangerous because if someone wants to censor the conversation they can deem it a conspiracy theory...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have discovered solid evidence that would allow us to take the power back... I have also discovered solid evidence that should allow us to get to the bottom of what motivates these people... I have discovered what unites them together and it is all proven by solid irrefutable evidence but it requires the intelligence to decipher it. This is what worries me most. It took me a years to understand it fully.</p>

<p>How do you get the people to look deeply into the evidence though when they have been tricked into thinking it is a joke or nonsense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.. I guess that was kind of a rhetorical question. haha A bit of a rant I guess.</p>

<p>I am still in the same boat though.. I feel I have made incredible world changing discoveries and I don&#39;t have a way to get this info to the masses. I have found that if I try to do it on conspiracy sites or forums then no one else hears it and for whatever reason the conspiracy theory discussions are so divided no consensus can be reached... divide and conquer....</p>
