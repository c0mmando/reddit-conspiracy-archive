    <div class="md"><p>Man shut up with that shill post shit. This is a legitimate question. James Corbett and Sibel Edmonds have asked the same question on their recent podcasts, are they shills? Greenwald is milking this for money. He just got a huge book contract and he&#39;s using the leaks as a way to give him a platform to profit. </p>

Everyone asks stupid questions once in a while. </p>

<p>And the man deserves a massive platform. He shits on every single person that tries to debate him. You should be glad he&#39;s going to make money and get his point of view out into the world. I&#39;m going to buy several copies of his book and give it away to people. </p>

<p>fair point on the desensitization </p>

<p>all it takes is a quick google as to why it takes greenwald and company awhile to go through, literally thousands of documents</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Promising massive future releases causes real potential whistleblowers to decide to sit back and watch Snowden take all the heat. Then, when months go by and all he has to show are a couple PowerPoint slides, it&#39;s too late -- court decisions have been made, the news has run NSA stories ad-nauseum, and the public feels the debate must be over by now.</p>

<p>This strategy is like setting off an avalanche with a controlled detonation rather than waiting for it to build up to disastrous levels. I think the people responsible for these programs knew they would face an avalanche of revelations, so they sent Snowden to at least do it in a controlled, manageable fashion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its because he knows how strong their propaganda is. and he realized if he released this all at once it would have been buried by some other news story..  this way its a death by 1000 cuts and no matter what happens he always has more to leak and bring this back to the top of the cycle.. and eventually the people will have had enough and demand change.  </p>

<p>You said:  Can someone tell me why Snowden is releasing all his information so slowly, <strong>like</strong> he wants to desensitize us to it, like a god-damned double agent.</p>

<p>I posted &quot;&#39;like&#39;?&quot; directly referencing the &quot;like&quot; which you yourself used in your OP sentence.  In other words, I&#39;m saying that he actually <em>is</em> a god-damned double agent.</p>
