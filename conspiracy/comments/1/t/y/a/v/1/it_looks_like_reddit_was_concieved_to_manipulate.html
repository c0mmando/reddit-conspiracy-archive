    <div class="md"><p>It is important to understand that reddit has had stages of her history.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re talking about was occurring back in 2006 in Medford out of Spez&#39;s apartment before digg fell.</p>

<p>Pre April 2011 was the first stage and post April 2011 was the second, if we being very simplistic.</p>

<p>This latter stage is pretty ugly. Firstly, Erik Martin and Alexis run <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?q=antique+jetpack&amp;amp;mfrom=&amp;amp;mto=&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;notitle=&amp;amp;date=&amp;amp;nofrom=&amp;amp;noto=&amp;amp;count=50&amp;amp;sort=0&amp;amp;file=&amp;amp;docid=&amp;amp;relid=0#searchresult">this PR firm</a>, Alexis also seems to own <a href="http://nyrdlabs.com/about">this</a> firm.</p>

<p>I believe that their are cabals of high ranking mods who team up with various factions of administrators within reddit inc to engage in payola. I believe a few power mods figured this out and were banished from this place in a very dastardly way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No no, that whitewash was designed specifically to make sure team breezy wouldn&#39;t find out the content of that police report.</p>

<p>A lot of money was spent selling the idea that Chris Brown simply &quot;hit&quot; his girlfriend that night. In fact, the night before that Chris Brown thread was nuked from <a href="/r/wtf">/r/wtf</a>  Mr. Brown has just won a grammy. Leading some members of the aforementioned team breezy to tweet things such as &quot;Chris Brown could hit me any day&quot;. When that <a href="/r/wtf">/r/wtf</a> thread rose to the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> it was not going to be an issue, but when Atlantic Records saw that twitter bomb incoming on their revenue source of 14 year olds on twitter you can be damn sure it got wiped. </p>

<p>You have a link above wherein a mod of <a href="/r/wtf">/r/wtf</a> resigned over payola in relation to the thread. What else must be said?</p>

Who really cares about Reddit, if it is enough just to Google for anything? I mean, the same information that is on Reddit is still avaiable on internet. It&#39;s not like Reddit is the only source of information, or is a provider of their own information source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is an aggregate as opposed to an index, which means the 90/9/1 rule comes into play on reddit. The precept there says that by controlling what is allowed to be posted and voted on by the 10%, you control what the other 90% is able to consume.</p>

<p>When you think about reddits stock valuation, it becomes quite clear that the holy grail for a news aggregate is editorial moneitzation. Something I believe reddit inc (or at least factions within her ranks) have already accomplished. </p>

<p>I never said that. You&#39;re arguing against what you want to argue against, not what I&#39;m actually saying.</p>

<p>Look, I&#39;ll try one last time. It&#39;s a very simple numbers game. How many people on this site do you think go out and create primary data? Very, very few. What good is a self post if it has no primary data? Not very good.</p>

<p>Therefore the majority of posts in this sub are gong ot be linking to outside sources. 
It&#39;s as simple as that. The outside sources aren&#39;t smarter or more trustworthy, they are simply the ones doing the actual data collection. So whether or not every profile in this sub is real or fake the majority of posts are going to be to external sites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So everyone whinges about this... so here&#39;s a plan.</p>

<p>Create a new website like reddit. Sort of.</p>

<p>Except registration is even more trivial. The only token of identity is a cookie in your browser generated as unique ID the first time you look at the site.</p>

<p>And there are no mods.</p>

<p>And no subreddits, only tags.</p>

<p>No reddiquette.</p>

<p>So anybody can post any text snippet, same formatting as reddit.</p>

<p>Anybody can rate any snippet.</p>

<p>Every vote you make is a bit of information about your orientation.</p>

<p>Every vote someone else makes on the <em>same</em> text snippet is a measure of their orientation relative to you.</p>

<p>With a bit of maths, hairy, but doable, (Singular Value Decomposition and Bayesian Filtering if you are really want to know), the server can project all current ratings on every text snippet on to your orientation and predict your rating of the snippet.</p>

<p>ie. You will see <em>all</em> snippets that are rated hot in your own personal orientation.</p>

<p>No mods. No random deletes. No spam.</p>

<p>Sock puppet armies merely accelerate the crap away from you.</p>

<p>And your own personal flavour of Reddiquette.</p>

<p>Sound like fun?</p>

<p>This is a good idea. It needs to be elaborated, but basically it&#39;s excellent. This kind of site will be very successeful.</p>

<p>Cloud based servers are relatively cheap.</p>

<p>What costs are programmers and admins and feeding venture capital vultures.</p>

<p>The core of the idea is to take admins and VC&#39;s completely out of the picture.</p>

<p>I was thinking about this some more.</p>

<p>Reddit is very hierarchical. Front page / subreddits / submissions / comments / subcomments.</p>

<p>What if we erase the difference between a submission and a comment?</p>

<p>A submission is a link to something on the web.</p>

<p>A comment is something on the web.</p>

<p>What if we erase the need for a central server?</p>

<p>Everybody can have their own reddit held together by links between reddits.</p>

<p>Where do we get submissions from?</p>

<p>Same way as google does. Spiders the web.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been brewing an idea of a Spider that crawls the web and uses Bayesian spam filtering techniques to rate everything it finds according to my tastes...</p>

<p>What if anybody can have their own spider and own reddit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup.</p>

<p>Spent a pleasant day in the hills explaining the idea to my very smart wife and mentally working out some of the wrinkles.</p>

<p>The crux of the matter would be to make it very very simple.</p>

<p>Separate out the server side from the display.</p>

<p>One of the big Gotchas is as soon as these things grow you need load balancing and massive servers and a Big budget for bandwidth....</p>

<p>I could package the whole thing up as yet another Debian / Ubuntu linux package and anyone can install a server anywhere and point it at an upstream server and suck a months / a years worth of data and begin serving and sharing it.</p>

<p>Very much like a Distributed Version Control System like Git or Mercurial.</p>

<p>One of the grand simplifying ideas is to discard the difference between a submission and a comment.</p>

<p>A submission is merely a comment with a zero parent comment id.</p>

<p>A comment is simply a string of text, a time stamp, a source ip address (still internally debating that one).</p>

<p>It&#39;s id (and hence URL) is merely a secure hash across the lot.</p>

<p>And you know this how?
