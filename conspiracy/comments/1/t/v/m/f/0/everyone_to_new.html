    <div class="md"><p>Ill add to badgergeckos comment by suggesting that if a post or claim is controversial, that you fact check it yourself. One of the easiest was is literally searching the topic on google and wikipedia, as a start. Then you can get a basic understanding of said topic and formulate your own conclusions rather than adopting someones words as fact just because. </p>

<p>This is my favorite course of action when confronted with questionable claims, and it has led me to better understand many things and also has led me on a wild goose hunt, where i have no idea how many geese i will find. (I hope that was a good analogy).</p>

<p>Thats one of the purposes of this sub, to spread info and help others in their research on topics. It also important to note that many times the OP of any given post might not know if the content is true or not. Hence, discussion and debate. :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of people feel this way about news in general. And perhaps it is supposed to be that way on purpose.</p>

<p>But don&#39;t let that stop you from being a critical consumer of information. I like to think of the strategy Orson Welles gave us in Citizen Kane with regards to howin one can find out the truth about a given man (or event) in a world full of narratives and lies. That solution is to hear as many people lie to you about the story as humanly possible.</p>

<p>By doing this it is somewhat feasible to gain a critical perspective on the types of narratives which surround the dissemination of a given story.</p>

<p>Look for narratives as narratives as you read and consume and suddenly facts will start to appear in your news.</p>

<p>For a quick break down of the phenomena involved here think of being in a room with your best friend and his cell phone; if I asked you to write me a news article about your friends cellphone your story would be as close to a cogent and informed context as possible. You know the cell phone belongs to your friend and you know your friend, so you could write me a great story. When you experience the cell phone in it&#39;s proper context you are in what Theodore Adorno calls the &quot;First Degree of Simulation&quot;.</p>

<p>However, if you take a picture of your friends cellphone and bring it to one of your uncles who had never met your best friend, <em>your uncle, too, will be able to write a story about the cell phone</em>. However, as the context would be lost for him, the picture of the cell phone puts your Uncle into the &quot;Second Degree of Simulation&quot;. Wherein he is more likely to write a story about a description of the cell phone, as opposed to the context in which the phone exists. (I.E. he would write &quot;the phone was a white galaxy s4&quot;, as opposed to &quot;my friend always preferred Android to IoS, so he had a white s4.&quot;)</p>

<p>When your uncle writes a news story about an event (or person) that he experienced from a second degree of simulation he produces a piece of text. When someone entirely unrelated to you or your uncle reads that story they are in the &quot;Third degree of simulation.&quot; With this third degree of removal it is almost guaranteed that the reader will have no idea what the cell phone he is reading about actually means in context. </p>

<p>All news that you consume is from a third degree of simulation. Your job, as a critical consumer of information, is to get back to the second degree of simulation such that you can see what narratives were used in the construction of the news story you had read. </p>

<p>In essence, reading 100 different news stories about the same event (or person) is the only tool that one has available if they wish to &quot;deconstruct&quot; bias and false narratives in contemporary news media.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll find this helpful, but it is the strategy I use myself to consume news.</p>

<p>The build up of the &quot;degrees of simulation&quot; comes from Adorno&#39;s work <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">Culture Industry</a>; the deconstruction strategy comes from Welles Citizen Kane as I said (a movie that was only made, the story goes, because William Randolph Hearst denied Welles more than two drinks at a dinner party).</p>

<p>The voting system is ineffective, the majority of forums don&#39;t have voting, because it is already understood that is just a tool for trolls to disturb posters. Unfortunately this forum was concieved by some happy geek that has no clue about communication security.</p>

<p>The only solution is to ask the administration to block the downvote button.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a little more disturbing than this.

<p>And? The sub was literally just made to make fun of stupid conspiracy theories. You would be a fool to take anything posted there seriously. If you expected high quality discussion you should have went to <a href="/r/skeptic">/r/skeptic</a> or something else.</p>

<p>that conspiracy theorism is equal to severe mental illness. </p>

<p>You found one comment, which was criticized by people, and try to paint as if the whole subreddit thinks so.</p>

<p>That is not &quot;just having a laugh.&quot; </p>

<p>It is. Maybe you just take everything way too seriously?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are a massive cancer that is stuck to our sub. The cancer is there whether you look at it or not. Plus they already do all of their own promoting. I&#39;ve seen their tag in the main subs a few times.</p>

<p>So I think it&#39;s kinda like this. They really need attention. So give them a little bit here and there and make them happy. When nobody is talking about them, they start to cry and brigade the shit out of this sub until we start talking about them again. </p>

<p>They probably aren&#39;t even paid. Life is easy for them. All they have to do is read whatever material the mainstream authorities put out into the public and then apply all of those talking points to people in here. They get to feel smarter than everyone else. That&#39;s addicting. They don&#39;t realize that many of the people in here simply don&#39;t believe those talking points because many of us think major institutions are capable of deceiving the public and many of their own workers. That really is the crux of the issue, isn&#39;t it? So let them regurgitate their talking points and give them a cookie everyday, and they will go back to bed. (Read the vaccine thread in there right now &quot;I wrote a thing, comments?&quot;) They were all fed easy talking points. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fellow Conpiracy Theorists,</p>

<p>The mods cannot do it alone. If you find a troll, report their offending submission and send a message to the mods telling them why you reported the user.</p>

<p>I think it was Sunday I reported two users and messaged the mods. I received a response shortly after telling me the user(s) was banned.</p>

<p>Reporting a user/post and messaging the mods is better than creating a post to complain about nothing being done.</p>

<p>I believe we can make <a href="/r/conpiracy">/r/conpiracy</a> better, or back to the way it was before this past 9/11.</p>

<p>I have no guarantees that the new mods aren&#39;t the same people, but after being here a while I have faith in a couple of the new mods (I have sent them PM&#39;s). We should always be wary of trusting anyone but we can&#39;t be jumping at shadows. </p>

<p>We have to be active to stop the name calling etc. you have illustrated that point by your actions in the point above. Report them and things will be done. </p>
