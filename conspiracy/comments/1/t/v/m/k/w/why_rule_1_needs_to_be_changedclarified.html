        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Rule #1:  No racism of any kind.</strong></p>

<p>Obviously racism is bad, I&#39;m not calling that into question.</p>

<p>There are many isms, and phobias, that are bad yet we still need to talk about them.  Homophobia is bad, but we still need to discuss both homophobia and homosexuality.  </p>

<p>Racism, sexism, nationalism, capitalism, communism, nationalism, socialism, nihilism, anarchism.  We need to discuss these things.  They are all mental constructs that really exist in the world and whether we like it or not, people will practice them and live by them.</p>

<p>I see a big push for certain types of speech here to be &quot;moderated&quot;.</p>

<p>Certain groups would love to permanently forbid the free discussion of Zionism, others would silence any talk of masculism or feminism.</p>

<p>When did people become such cowards that they are afraid to read someone&#39;s ill informed views on race or religion or sexuality?</p>

<p>I contend that rule #1 needs to be changed to as follows,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rule #1 Slurs that defame people of any race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, social order or creed will not be tolerated and are subject to moderation and/or action against your account.  Legitimate criticism of the groups mentioned above shall be conducted with great care as to not use any slurs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rule #1 Slurs that defame people of any race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, social order or creed will not be tolerated and are subject to moderation and/or action against your account.  Discussion about all of these groups is acceptable so long as no slurs or calls to violence are used.  Accusations of racism or shaming people who are discussing these topics are not welcome here as stated in rule 10.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do we need this change?  Unfortunately the concept of hate speech is being hijacked to include any negative speech about these groups when in reality hate speech is when someone urges violence against these groups.</p>

<p>Hate speech shouldn&#39;t be tolerated, but we can&#39;t have a rule that simply says &quot;no hate speech&quot; just like the current rule that says &quot;no racism&quot; because different people have different definitions in their mind of what those overly simplistic rules mean.</p>

<p>We are currently being bogged down in a quagmire of accusations of racism this and that.  In every one of those instances minus very few, the accusations are coming from a person who is guilty of the exact same thing, directed at a different group.</p>

<p>Where is conspiratard when reddit is openly bashing Christianity?  </p>

<p>A: No where to be found, they are only concerned with Judaism.</p>

<p>Where is SRS when people are bashing &quot;heteronormative&quot; neckbeards (lol) ?</p>

<p>A: they are probably the ones doing the bashing, but they certainly are NOT defending the neck beards being persecuted.</p>

<p>Where are all the poor victimized white supremacists when people are bashing Indian males or Asian males?  </p>

<p>A: again they are probably doing the bashing and certainly not defending these other victims.</p>

<p>My point is that we have all of these groups, each of them defending their group while crying hate speech against anyone who mentions their group in a negative frame.  None of them capable of seeing the counter hate they spew forth.</p>

<p>SRS claims to be about social justice but fuck you if you aren&#39;t a member of some minority group, if that&#39;s the case then your suffering is justice and you deserve what you get.</p>

<p>White supremacists claim to be trying to preserve the white race (which everyone is attacking) but they in turn attack all these other races without a 2nd thought.</p>

<p>Conspiratard is so concerned with people talking about Jewishness that they fail to see the racism from users like dogsarepets who are openly anti white and very racist.  They are &quot;concerned&quot; we are breeding violence while they ignore their own calls to violence &quot;I wish someone would kick flytape&#39;s teeth in&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Either you are against sharing any kind of controversial opinion, or all are permitted without serious consequences unless it is a tangible call for violence. </p>

<p>Because Jews aren&#39;t some massive bee colony. Most jews probably have no idea what you are talking about, regardless of whether you are right or wrong. When you say &#39;they&#39; it&#39;s a bit generalized. Sometimes it seems you mean &#39;The Israeli Government&#39; or other times maybe &#39;Historians&#39;. If you went to Israeli you&#39;d find plenty of jews that disagree with what the government there does. </p>

<p>Wow, dude. Mind blowing. Welcome to the conversation. </p>

<p>No one ever said Jews don&#39;t participate in in persecuting others. However it&#39;s not &quot;Jews&quot; persecuting the Palestinians, but the Israeli government. There is a difference, generally speaking and when it isn&#39;t recognized is when the confusion starts. </p>

<p>Furthermore - that&#39;s now how I see it go around here. I see plenty of threads that criticize Israel and don&#39;t have what you are complaining about. </p>

<p>And yet I see plenty of threads where people say stuff like: &quot;They attempted to subvert control of Russia and were found out, this carried over to Germany including partly inspiring Hitler to come up with his game plan&quot; where it&#39;s obviously impractical that this means &quot;all Jews&quot; yet the authors can&#39;t stop themselves from using such language anyway. It&#39;s those threads that get the &quot;The Joos&quot; responses and it&#39;s for the exact reason I&#39;ve pointed out to you several times now. </p>

<p>I will repeat myself, because it seems that you didn&#39;t get my point - but they are probably keying in on a generalization you don&#39;t seem to realize that you are making. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Right - but maybe you should get to the point instead. If you made a point - no one would need to burn a candle!! </p>

<p>The idea that there is some sort of massive Jewish conspiracy is so old and tired - I think it needs no further debate. If there is a conspiracy involving Zionism, or some Jews - yeah, talk about it. But do so with words that are more recent than what you can pull from &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; because it&#39;s clear that whatever conspiracy does not involve <em>all jews</em> or even <em>most jews</em>, but rather <em>some jews</em>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at 9/11 - clearly there were some Jews involved. Zakheim, other US military dual citizens, the mossad. But so was the CIA, and most of the Bush administration (plenty of non-jews). Saudi Arabia was also involved as well - so why bother to call 9/11 a Jewish conspiracy? No one calls it a Christian conspiracy even though a number of Christians worked very hard to make sure it happened. I&#39;m not saying you said 9/11 was a Jewish conspiracy, but you don&#39;t seem to realize that you make an equivalent logically fallacious argument and that&#39;s why people respond with &quot;Jew Hater&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Holodomor proves it once again: Jews were amongst the greatest mass murderers of all time</strong></p>

<p>It all begun in 1917: &quot;Every ordinary Russian faced a Jew as his judge and as his exe-cutioner. Where ever the Russian went, he met a Jew in a superior position to him.&quot; (Sonja Margolina, &quot;Das Ende der Lügen&quot; The End of the Lies, Siedler Publishing House, Berlin 1992, page 60) </p>

<p>&quot;The Bolshevik Revolution in Russia was the work of Jewish planning and Jewish dissatisfaction. Our Plan is to have a New World Order. What worked so wonderfully in Russia is going to become Reality for the whole world.&quot; (The American Hebrew Magazine, New York, Sep. 10, 1920) </p>

<p>More than 50 Million people were murdered during this era under Jewish commissars. However, when nowadays timid Goyim try to bring these crimes, universally unique, to justice, Jews squeal &quot;this is unfair, it incites interethnic hatred.&quot; However, forcing a 90 year-old innocent man (John Demjanjuk) on a stretcher into a stooge court-room in Germany, that is perfectly all right. </p>

<p>Actually prior to WWI, Jews were assimilating very well in Germany - some might say TOO well. Indeed, the Zionists and Jews worldwide largely supported Germany during most of WWI, as Germany was fighting the Czar, and they <em>very much</em> wanted the Czar overthrown.</p>

<p>However, once the Czar was on the ropes and the Bolshevik Revolution was in motion, the Zionists made a deal with the British under the Balfour Declaration. Following this, the Zionists used all available influence to favor the British: The US came into the war, and the Jews of Russia that had previously been supporting Germany&#39;s efforts began working against Germany - all of which is meticulously documented in David Lloyd George&#39;s <a href="http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000487862">&quot;Memoirs of the Peace Conference&quot;.</a>  </p>

<p>Your statement &quot;<em>Jews kinda sorta had it coming</em>&quot; is weasely, as obviously you are using THE JEWS as a blanket statement implying ALL JEWS - which is of course bullshit. Most of the Jews that were victimized during the Holocaust were no more guilty than that three-year old girl that the IDF murdered last week. However, to say that &quot;ALL JEWS were blameless&quot; and that the backroom Zionist deals played no role in inciting animosity and mistrust toward Jews would be equally false. </p>

<p>The Germans felt betrayed by the Zionists, and they were also not blind to the workings going on in the Soviet Union, and their blaming the Zionists for the latter was not entirely unjustified.</p>

<p>Were it not for the activities of the Zionists, Hitler and the Nazi Party would likely have never come to power, and there would have been no Holocaust.</p>

<p>WRONG.</p>

<p>Lloyd George was VERY pro-Zionist and not anti-Semitic in the least. He credited the Balfour Declaration which he called &quot;a contract with Jewry&quot; as being of incalculable value to the Entente (allies) in their victory over Germany.</p>

<p>Maybe you should read more and whine less? There&#39;s a link above to Lloyd George&#39;s work - a massive four-volume  set penned by the man who was Prime Minister of Britain during WWI.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to get back to you with relevant specific quotes later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rudman argues that Lloyd George was consistently pro-German after 1923. He supported German demands for territorial concessions and recognition of its “great power” status; he paid much less attention to the security concerns of France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Belgium. The Germans welcomed him as a friend in the highest circles of British politics. In September 1936 he went to Germany to talk with the German dictator Adolf Hitler. Hitler said he was pleased to have met &quot;the man who won the war&quot;; Lloyd George was moved, and called Hitler &quot;the greatest living German&quot;.Lloyd George also visited Germany&#39;s public works programmes and was impressed. On his return to Britain he wrote an article for The Daily Expresspraising Hitler; he wrote, &quot;The Germans have definitely made up their minds never to quarrel with us again.&quot; He believed Hitler was &quot;the George Washington of Germany&quot;; that he was rearming Germany for defence and not for offensive war</p>

<p>That&#39;s from his Wikipedia page. I&#39;d call that pretty pro Hitler. Considering it came out in 1939, it fits right in his extremely pro Hitler period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give em hell Amos..You are pretty spot on with everything you are saying. The Balfour Declaration says it all...Most important part was the name at the end..Rothschild. Let&#39;s also not forget that IBM, a prominent American company was helping the Hitler Administration. Let&#39;s not forget that American Senator Prescott Bush was also helping Hitler. There are a lot of pieces left out of history..</p>

<p>Chomsky also says some pretty interesting stuff about what zionism was like pre 45..He said zionism at that time was Jewish-Arab international affairs. Chomsky talked about wanting to go to a Yitzvah(i think, its a jewish settlement camp in palestine in the pre 45 era) and learn arabic to better relations with Palestinians. He had no reason or want to attack them and according to him neither did zionism at the time. If you believe Chomsky then obviously things have changed..is it possibly different because of Rothschild dominance after the Balfour Declaration..</p>

<p>I think Racism is really at the heart of what is going on in Israel. Zionism is definitely a factor but I think racism is the biggest part. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chomsky can&#39;t be trusted on this.  We&#39;ve had some recent discussions on this topic here so maybe I&#39;ll try to dig it up . . . but the long and short of it is Chomsky sugarcoats Zionist history.</p>

<p>Most Zionists, as Chomsky claims, were bi-nationalists until 1942 at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biltmore_Conference">Biltmore Conference</a>.  Bi-nationalists didn&#39;t <a href="http://binationalism.blogspot.com/2008/10/15-bi-nationalism-ostracized-from.html">want a separate Jewish state</a> and wanted to respect the rights of Arabs.  Even though bi-nationalism was their stated goal, as a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1twyxu/ben_gurion_foresaw_palestinian_expulsion_in_1937/">current new post on this sub shows</a>, many Zionists (e.g. Ben Gurion) most likely had ulterior motives.  Many probably only professed a belief in bi-nationalism to respect the Balfour Declaration that required Jewish settlers to respect the rights of the native Arabs.  </p>

<p>So as the <a href="http://binationalism.blogspot.com/2008/10/15-bi-nationalism-ostracized-from.html">link above notes</a>, the bi-nationalists were quickly ostracized from Zionist movement around 1942 but some held to their beliefs for a while, as Chomsky evidently did.</p>

<p>But make no mistake about it . . . even this &quot;liberal&quot; Zionism still envisioned the colonization of another people&#39;s land.  Most of these people probably assumed Jews would hold the superior position in society and would hold most of the valuable land (as they had been buying up land for decades) and own most of the businesses and farms.  They also probably believed that God granted them the land and believed in their superiority as the Chosen people.  I&#39;ve never heard Chomsky renounce these beliefs re Jewish supremacy.  And Chomsky did live as a colonizer for a while and spoke highly of it and stated he almost made a permanent move.  </p>

<p>Of course Chomsky has now dropped bi-nationalism and supports a two state solution instead and agrees that the Jewish state of Israel should continue to exist (although I assume he would argue it should become more democratic and respect Arab rights more, etc.).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going off the comments above . . . it seems maybe the Soviets and Wall St. had more of a connection than Wall St. and the Germans, at least according to Solzhenitsyn (and the Germans certainly alleged this as well):</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a partial translation of the unpublished in English book by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, &quot;Two Hundered Years Together&quot; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Together-Complete-Edition-Volumes/dp/5969707023">http://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Together-Complete-Edition-Volumes/dp/5969707023</a> [one can see why this literary giant&#39;s book was not translated from this excerpt]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The 1930s were years of an intense industrialized spurt, which crushed the peasantry and altered the life of the entire country. Mere existence demanded adaptation and development of new skills. But through crippling sacrifices, and despite the many absurdities of the Soviet organizational system, the horrible epic somehow led to the creation of an industrialized power.</p>

<p>Yet the first and second five-year plans came into existence and were carried out not through the miracle of spontaneous generation, nor as a result of the simple violent round-up of large masses of laborers. It demanded many technical provisions, advanced equipment, and the collaboration of specialists experienced in this technology. <strong>All this flowed plentifully from the capitalist West, and most of all from the United States; not in the form of a gift, of course, and not in the form of generous help. The Soviet communists paid for all of this abundantly with Russia’s mineral wealth and timber, with concessions for raw materials markets, with trade areas promised to the West, and with plundered goods from the Empire of the tsars. Such deals flowed with the help and approval of international financial magnates, most of all those on Wall Street, in a persistent continuation of the first commercial ties that the Soviet communists developed on the American stock exchanges as early as during the Civil War. The new partnership was strengthened  by shiploads of tsarist gold and treasures from the Hermitage.</strong></p>

<p>But wait a second, were we not thoroughly taught by Marx that capitalists are the fierce enemies of proletarian socialism and that we should not expect help from them, but rather a destructive, bloody war? Well, it’s not that simple: despite the official diplomatic non-recognition, trade links were completely out in the open, and even written about in Izvestiya: “American merchants are interested in broadening of economic ties with the Soviet Union.”[1] American unions came out against such an expansion (defending their markets from the products of cheap and even slave Soviet labor). The “Russian-American Chamber of Commerce,” created at that time, simply did not want to hear about any political opposition to communism, or “to mix politics with business relations.”[2]</p>

<p>Anthony Sutton, a modern American scholar, researched the recently-opened diplomatic and financial archives and followed the connections of Wall Street with the Bolsheviks; he pointed to the amoral logic of this long and consistent relationship. From as early as the “Marburg” plan at the beginning of the 20th century, which was based on the vast capital of Carnegie, the idea was to strengthen the authority of international finance, through global “socialization,” “for control … and for the forced appeasement.” Sutton concluded that: “International financiers prefer to do business with central governments. The banking community least of all wants a free economy and de-centralized authority.” “Revolution and international finance do not quite contradict each other, if the result of revolution should be to establish a more centralized authority,” and, therefore, to make the markets of these countries manageable. And there was a second line of agreement: “Bolsheviks and bankers shared an essential common platform — internationalism.”[3]&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting for me to explore this because I have only known the propagandized version of fascism and national socialism . . . the cartoon versions.  There was actually a good deal of thought and variety behind these ideologies and I guess I&#39;m probably similar to most modern observers in that these ideological battles from WWI to WWII are such a mystery.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree that it&#39;s good to see Amos and others making a positive contribution.  It&#39;s really fun to see a good historical discussion free of bickering about racism.</p>

<p>Regarding Hitler and the NSDAP party . . . I once accepted Jim Condit Jr.&#39;s thesis about connections between Wall St. and the NSDAP but now I&#39;m not so sure.</p>

<p>I recently discussed this with another <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> user <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1t173c/richard_clarke_50_cia_personnel_knew_aq_entered/cecas0m?context=3">here</a> (we got off on the tangent after he mentioned James Angleton of the CIA had Nazi connections and I said I wondered if this was propaganda of some sort).  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not convinced of the Bush connections, for instance.  His firm was charged with trading with the enemy, and the German man his firm was tied to, Fritz Thyssen, did indeed donate to the NSDAP, but he fell out with the party and was actually imprisoned by Hitler through the war.  Plus, (if you read the links from the previous discussion showing the primary docs) the connection between Bush&#39;s firm was pretty tenuous.  I surmise it could have actually been a way for Wall St. firms to get their hands on German property rather than as a way to support the National Socialist cause.</p>

<p>The other connections to Wall Street seem pretty tenuous as well, as explained in this <a href="http://inconvenienthistory.com/archive/2011/volume_3/number_3/demystification_of_the_birth_of_the_nsdap.php">comprehensive piece</a>.</p>

<p>For me the big indicator Hitler and the NSDAP was opposed to Wall Street financiers is the monetary policy of Hitler after WWII begun.  He sacked the head of the central bank, Hjalmar Schacht (who may have been maintaining treasonous ties with the British central bankers and giving them information), after he warned about the economic dangers of printing debt free currency during a war economy (i.e. inflation--concerns that may have been, er, inflated), and then Hitler basically told the international financiers to shove off and appointed Walter Funk to the central bank, took away some power from the central bank, and printed his own money to finance the war and everything else that he was already financing this way (autobahn, etc.).  He used debt free currency to finance the country (which is actually a wonderful idea and what I suspect is the biggest motive for the Allies to destroy Germany).  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1onjfv/interesting_pic_from_1912/ccv2psc">Here&#39;s</a> a comment on the subject of Hitler&#39;s monetary policy that I spent a lot of time researching and writing but I think there is still a lot more to explore in this area.</p>

<p>The problem is a strain of German nationalism that periodically seeks to harm Americans for personal gain.  This ethnic group has been interned and fought against about every 50 years, from the point in about 1760 when the Cherokee fought a &quot;war with those in red coats&quot;.  Their participation in the American eugenics programs cannot be ignored, and it is not a coincidence that same epidemiological school of thought also denied the link between smoking and lung cancer.  Along with the bankster and monopolist stereotype, there is a terrible pattern of racketeering through professional fraud that deals damage to society in a manner akin to a malignant tumor.  The <em>Bush Junior</em> middle eastern military misadventures unambiguously demonstrate my point in the present.</p>

<p>Yeah, Germany and the U.S. were definitely both interested in eugenics.  Hitler claimed he was simply following the lead from the Americans and when attacked for it would cite the American use of it.</p>

<p>My understanding is that Hitler thought highly of some Americans (he was fond of Henry Ford for instance) but that he underestimated their impact on entering the war.  </p>

<p>As I said above, it doesn&#39;t surprise me that there were ties between the U.S. and Germany, both were large industrial economies and both shared a common heritage.  Germany was home to many scientists and academies and international organizations so it also doesn&#39;t surprise me some American capitalists would fund research and facilities there.</p>

<p>These weren&#39;t really Americans, they considered themselves ethnically distinct.</p>

<p>The Germans make war by deception against Americans until the Americans decide to vanquish the Germans, about twice every century.  This is an obvious pattern in history.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The only uniquely synergistic aspect is that Germans exclusively conduct business through monopolistic cartels (international organizations).  They have a short intellectual history compared to other European countries; The achievements attributed to Germans are almost always stolen or misappropriated from Latin or Greek speakers.  </p>

<p><strong>The Germans were personally offended by the concept of hygiene.</strong></p>

<p>There really is no excuse for ethnocentrism held by a group that periodically tries to destroy the United States.</p>

<p>The Justice Department attempted to prepare a list of all German aliens, counting approximately 480,000 of them, more than 4,000 of whom were imprisoned in 1917-18. The allegations included spying for Germany, or endorsing the German war effort.[53] Thousands were forced to buy war bonds to show their loyalty.[54]</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_American#World_War_I_anti-German_sentiment">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_American#World_War_I_anti-German_sentiment</a></p>

<p>Also, lots of Americans and many foreign aliens were falsely accused of &quot;spying&quot; and basic un-American activities.  Huge numbers of leftists were put in prison and targeted.  People like Eugene Debs.  Huge numbers of leftist papers were run out and America established a large propaganda campaign (the Creel Commission and the Four Minute Men, for example).  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the onset of World War I, nativist and racist prejudices were further fueled by antagonism towards German immigrants and their descendents, since Germany was now classified as a state enemy.[39] Considerable skepticism concerning the war’s aims and isolationism among U.S. residents at the outset also led to a second pro-war mobilization on the home front, as the administration attempted to foster public support through the establishment of the first governmental propaganda office (Schaffer, 1999; Nagler, 1999).[40] [41] The propaganda efforts would spiral out of control, leading to a domestic climate that Higham describes as “call[ing] forth the most strenuous nationalism and the most pervasive nativism that the United States had ever known” (cited in Nagler, 1993, p. 191). Prior to U.S. involvement in the war, many domestic German-language papers had espoused the German cause, arguing that the imperial power of Great Britain was more threatening than German action (Bergquist, 1999; see also Wittke, 1936). Even though the vast majority of German-language periodicals immediately pledged support when the U.S. entered the war, German Americans quickly became targets of harassment, business boycotts, violence, and vandalism (Bergquist, 1999; Luebke, 1990).[42][43] State Councils of Defense banned the use of German language in public places and changed German-named street signs. German books and German-language newspapers were burned in multiple cities (Rippley, 1976; see also Nagler, 1997; (Luebke, 1990).[44] In efforts to prove their loyalty to the U.S., many German citizens and businesses anglicized their names and distanced themselves from their cultural institutions and organizations (Luebke, 1990).[45]</p>

<p><strong>However, the demands of war would quickly challenge the generalized anti-immigrant sentiment in the services, as the demand for service members necessitated the broad use of the foreign-born</strong>. . . .</p>

<p>A French solder in 1917 described the heterogeneous character of American troops in Europe: &quot;You could not imagine a more extraordinary gathering than this american [sic] army, there is a little bit of everything, Greeks, Italians, Turks, Indians, Spanish, also a sizable number of boches.[47] Truthfully, <strong>almost half of the officers have German origins.</strong> This doesn’t seem to bother them… Among the Americans are sons of emigrated Frenchmen and sons of emigrated boches. I asked one son of a Frenchman if these Germans were coming willingly to fight their brothers and cousins, he squarely answered me: ‘yes!’” (cited in Ford, 2001, p. 3) </p>

<p>I strongly disagree.  Germany was not expansionist.  It entered WWI for reasons other than expanding its territory and after losing the war had territory taken away from it.  It took territory back to start WWII, and ended the Versailles Treaty, and kicked the international bankers out, but it did not want to conquer the world and certainly didn&#39;t want to conquer America.  Germany desperately sought to keep America neutral during both world wars but forces within America were very motivated to bring Germany down and convince the political leadership to do so and they used mass propaganda and false flags to convince the American people to do so.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>A German military officer is not a valid source on the morale and makeup of the american military.  He doesn&#39;t get to question who is a semi-american, as an enemy of the United States.  To most people, it appears quite stupid to cite your own ethnic group in a fallaciously mistaken context.  Here is the rest of the section you are quoting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Despite the acute perception of this officer, he was wrong on one very important point. These men were not &quot;semi-Americans,&quot; they were &quot;Americans All!&quot; </p>

<p>So it is clear from your reference that quote is incorrect.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s because Germans mostly immigrated after that.  The source covers a lot of ground from the Civil War onward.  I looked for precise numbers of ethnic backgrounds for soldiers from WWI but didn&#39;t find any (other than the 18% foreign born figure).

<blockquote>

<p>They attacked Belgium as an act of war, not because their goal was to colonize Belgium.  The cause of WWI was not that Germany coveted Belgium land.  They took it as an act of war the cause of which was more complex.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m not lying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It absorbed other countries after defeating their militaries. Are you unaware of the definition of expansionistic?</p>

<p>It did this in WWII to capture land it had lost after WWI.  It didn&#39;t harbor goals to take over the world as some have claimed.  It certainly didn&#39;t seek to attack or takeover America, which is what you originally asserted.  As Llyod George and others noted, Germany had reasonable goals yet warmongers like Churchill wanted nothing short of the destruction of Germany.  Germany wanted to remain neutral with America and actually allowed America to get quite hostile to it before war broke out.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nazis were actually spreading a lot of propaganda through hollywood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What?  This to be a fantastical claim.   Hollywood totally villified the Nazis and helped spread pro war propaganda.  Germany made its own propaganda.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The majority of Americans were having their relatives in Europe bombed, oppressed, and exterminated by the Nazis.</p>

<p>Why should they not hate Germans, still?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because hating a group of people for actions a few generations ago is bigoted and is collective punishment.  Germany has paid far more than it&#39;s fair share for the two world wars.  Germany has been made a scapegoat.</p>

<p>Anyway, most Americans did not want to go to war against Germany!  So the hatred had to be created!  Just look at Hollywood depictions of Nazis and how this has been drummed in our heads.  This has been going on since WWI!  Still is.  Look at movies like &#39;Inglorious Basterds&#39; that make us sympathize with bashing the brains in of a defenseless and innocent German POW out of pure hate.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think you got that backwards!  It was the Brits that were behaving barbarically by trying to starve the German people through their blockade (and they succeeded).   So Germany retaliated by promising to use a similar legal rationale to blockade Britain and sink any British, French or Russian vessel in British waters.  It warned neutrals of this policy but people in the U.S. insisted on violating this policy and boarded the <em>British</em> flagged Lusitania and the Germans sunk it (just like the Brits would do to any ship trying to supply Germany).  Germany wanted the U.S. to be neutral (contra your assertion), so it suspended unrestricted submarine warfare until later (which is what the Zimmerman letter was about).  </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensraum">The Nazis were specifically planning to extend German territory in Europe and eventually take over the world.</a></p>

<p>It certainly didn&#39;t seek to attack or takeover America, which is what you originally asserted. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duquesne_Spy_Ring">You are completely incorrect, there was a huge spy ring that could only be explained by Nazi aggression.</a></p>

<p>Stop lying in defense of people who were trying to kill Americans.</p>

<p>As Llyod George and others noted, Germany had reasonable goals yet warmongers like Churchill wanted nothing short of the destruction of Germany. </p>

<p>This is nonsense, Hitler repeatedly invaded countries before Churchill took power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Germany wanted to remain neutral with America and actually allowed America to get quite hostile to it before war broke out.</p>

<p>Germany was exterminating its own citizens.  Hostility was certainly merited.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because hating a group of people for actions a few generations ago is bigoted and is collective punishment. </p>

<p>If you want to exonerate the worst criminals of history then I will count you as being loyal to them.  That merits ire.</p>

<p>Germany has paid far more than it&#39;s fair share for the two world wars.</p>

<p>They are still hiding stolen treasure from Nazi persecution.</p>

<p>Nice generalization.  Unlike other generalizations that are valid (that Germany created a racist culture--like America and much of the World at that time), this is not a valid generalization.

They are singled out more so than any other nation from WWII for blame.  </p>

<p>And Germans did resist being blamed for WWI because they didn&#39;t deserve to be blamed and to have crushing economic sanctions leveled against them for generations.  Most Germans welcomed Hilter&#39;s unilateral rejection of the Versailles treaty and his conquest of formerly German lands because they did indeed view the Versailles &quot;Dictat&quot; as uniquely unfair (and it indeed contained unprecedented terms of harsh punishment).</p>

<p>German soldier was captured by Nazi hunters mostly Jewish Americans, not accused of partaking in any crimes, but Jewish guy takes bat and crushes German POW&#39;s head.  The movie attempts to make one sympathize with the war criminals and like 99% of Hollywood movies depicting WWII it depicts Germans as evil people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Germans were fighting an expansionist war, so they deserved it.</p>

<p>Ha!  <strong>So you agree with collective punishment of a people by using war crimes!  Nice.</strong>  Fits in nicely with OP&#39;s post because Israel does the same thing to Palestinians.  All of Europe was at war and you justify the starvation of the entire civilian population of a country as a tool of war.</p>

<p>And btw, the British have a history of using this tactic.  They did so against the Irish, against the Chinese, against Indians, and of course during WWI they also did so against the Persions, slaughtering millions of Persians and creating a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWc8-P29wIc">Persian &#39;Holocaust&#39;</a> even greater than the Jewish Holocaust of WWII.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They don&#39;t have the ethical higher ground to do that, they were killing people for land.</p>

<p>You once again misstate the cause of WWI to blame solely the Germans and to imply the main cause was German desire of conquest.  This is blatantly false as even most mainstream historians would agree.  You are peddling blatant propaganda.  And btw, this is the propaganda imposed on Germans after the Allies won WWII and stayed behind to change laws and society to impose this false version of history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a common enemy for obvious reasons. It is an aggressive power with racist ideology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s no more aggressive than Britain or France.  It also had a similar racist ideology as America and most of the world at the time.  The German hatred against Jews was unjust, but Germany was indeed a victim after WWI and there was definitely an overrepresentation of Jewish leaders in the forces trying to destroy Germany.  The Germans were no more ethical for labeling all Jews enemies than the Americans were for labeling Japanese Americans enemies, but they had slight more reason for doing so because so many Jewish groups and Jewish leaders were actively trying to destroy Germany.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Killing American citizens in the process...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  But Germany warned Americans not to board British ships headed for British waters.  They even took out newspaper advertisement in New York warning them.   The Germans didn&#39;t want to kill Americans and wanted America to remain neutral.  Britain and many American leaders (like Wall St. people) wanted to entice America into war and didn&#39;t mind a a few dead Americans to get them into war.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point is that they were violating maritime trade in defense of a militaristic landgrab</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s questionable that they were violating international law.  The Brits were doing the same thing . . . they declared waters around Germany a war zone and would sink any ship that did not go to shore and have it&#39;s goods meant for Germany confiscated.  They were starving the people of Germany and hundreds of thousands died this  way (which was part of the reason Hitler wanted Germany to be more self sufficient during the next war).  The Germans didn&#39;t have the manpower to search every ship so they just sunk any ship flying the enemy countries&#39; flags in retaliation for similar British policies.  </p>

<p>I would argue that economic sanctions to starve a whole country is a war crime and many thought so at the time.  Retaliating with similar tactics is <em>less of a war crime</em> because it involves self defense.  <strong>It&#39;s the British that introduced this tactic of total war but propagandist have turned this around to blame the Germans!</strong>  The same would later happen in regard to targeting civilian populations using air power.  </p>

<p>Not at this time, in this war.</p>

<p>That is not a warning, it is a threat.</p>

<p>Then they should not have been threatening the general public.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Britain and many American leaders (like Wall St. people) wanted to entice America into war and didn&#39;t mind a a few dead Americans to get them into war.</p>

<p>The Germans were the ones killing Americans.  You can&#39;t blame the British for that, because the Germans were attacking other countries prior to British involvement.  The British were containing an aggressive power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s questionable that they were violating international law</p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Brits were doing the same thing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a response to aggression.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they declared waters around Germany a war zone and would sink any ship that did not go to shore and have it&#39;s goods meant for Germany confiscated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Germany should not have been invading other countries, if they wanted to buy food on the international market.  You can&#39;t be a jerk and expect everyone else to not take sides.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They were starving the people of Germany and hundreds of thousands died this way (which was part of the reason Hitler wanted Germany to be more self sufficient during the next war). </p>

<p>The Germans were killing other people for land.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t let fuel reach a war machine like that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Germans didn&#39;t have the manpower to search every ship so they just sunk any ship flying the enemy countries&#39; flags in retaliation for similar British policies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The British were letting some cargo through, by comparison.
That means that the Germans had a more restrictive blockade policy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would argue that economic sanctions to starve a whole country is a war crime and many thought so at the time. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not when that country is starving the people they conquer.  Turnabout is fair play.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Retaliating with similar tactics is less of a war crime because it involves self defense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It isn&#39;t in this case because Germany was invasive.</p>

<p><strong>They could have had the blockade lifted if they had retreated.</strong></p>

<p>They kept fighting, so they have no right to complain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s the British that introduced this tactic of total war but propagandist have turned this around to blame the Germans!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone already knew the Germans were at fault.</p>

<p>The same would later happen in regard to targeting civilian populations using air power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Germans were firing rockets on civilians and eventually were bombed to bits in response.  They deserved it, those rockets were built on slave labor.</p>

<p>You have to remember that Wall street had a hand in creating the OSS in the very beginning.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of intentional confusion so who knows what the real truth is . . . </p>

<p>I do remember that the OSS/CIA are Wall St. creations.  In fact Dulles was a lawyer doing those deals Bush was involved in with Fritz Thyssen.  But like I said, of course there are going to be <em>some</em> connections between these two large economies (and Americans were largely German immigrants), and since Thyssen ended up on the wrong side of Hitler and ended up in jail (maybe because of these connections to Wall St. and the fact he tried to move his money outside Germany), leads me to suspect this whole charging Bush and gang with trading with the enemy business could have been a clever way for Wall St. to capture Thyssen&#39;s fortune (especially after he was in jail and the assets were in the U.S. anyway and he didn&#39;t have much of a chance to fight back).  </p>

<p>The main reason I currently doubt Hitler was a pawn of the Rothschilds and was indeed their biggest threat is his use of debt free money was a huge blow to the Rothschilds (and all international bankers) and set a terrible example for the rest of the world (indeed, people in Britain, Canada, and the U.S. were demanding such a solution--see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_credit">Social Credit</a> movement and the U.S. Congress proposed such solutions in the early 1930s).  International bankers had controlled Germany&#39;s economy after WWI (and if you read Schacht&#39;s book he blames the foreign bankers for Weimar inflation, in addition to the harsh requirements of the Versailles Dictat).</p>

<p>It&#39;s just hard for me to imagine that a Rothschild pawn would engage in this activity of using debt free currency for almost a decade and then successfully run a massive war economy on it.  Also, it&#39;s hard for me to imagine that Hitler didn&#39;t want to win the war . . . I recommend &#39;Hitler&#39;s War&#39; for a good read about WWII.  Hitler seemed determined and indeed came very close to winning the war. </p>

<p>But like you said maybe he was an unwitting pawn.</p>

I have no good argument for hitler using debt free war time money..that to me definitely seems off. However, how do we know that Red shield didn&#39;t know this would happen? I think we all can agree that the red shields definitely know how to play chess and extremely well.

<p>The following is from his memoirs – David Lloyd George, Memoirs of the Peace Conference, Volume II, New Haven, Yale University Press 1939; (ch. XXIII).  Bolded emphasis is mine. </p>

<p>QUOTE:</p>

<p>{p.725}</p>

<p><strong>The support of the Zionists for the cause of the Entente would mean a great deal as a war measure</strong>. <em>Quite naturally Jewish sympathies were to a great extent anti-Russian, and therefore in favour of the Central Powers</em>. No ally of Russia, in fact, could escape sharing that immediate and inevitable penalty for the long and savage Russian persecution of the Jewish race. In addition to this, <em>the German General Staff, with their wide outlook on possibilities, urged, early in 1916, the advantages of promising Jewish restoration to Palestine under an arrangement</em> </p>

<p>{p. 726} </p>

<p><em>to be made between Zionists and Turkey, backed by a German guarantee</em>. The practical difficulties were considerable; the subject was perhaps dangerous to German relations with Turkey; and the German Government acted cautiously. But the scheme was by no means rejected or even shelved, and at any moment the Allies might have been forestalled in offering this supreme bid. <strong>In fact in September, 1917, the German Government were making very serious efforts to capture the Zionist Movement</strong>.</p>

<p>Another most cogent reason for the adoption by the Allies of the policy of the declaration lay in the state of Russia herself. <strong>Russian Jews had been secretly active on behalf of the Central Powers from the first; they had become the chief agents of German pacifist propaganda in Russia; by 1917 they had done much in preparing for that general disintegration of Russian society, later recognised as the Revolution</strong>. It was believed that if Great Britain declared for the fulfilment of Zionist aspirations in Palestine under her own pledge, <em>one effect would be to bring Russian Jewry to the cause of the Entente.</em></p>

<p>It was believed, also, that such a declaration would have a potent influence upon world Jewry outside Russia, and <em>secure for the Entente the aid of Jewish financial interests. In America, their aid in this respect would have a special value when the Allies had almost exhausted the gold and marketable securities available for American purchases</em>. </p>

<p><strong>Such were the chief considerations which, in 1917, impelled the British Government towards making a contract with Jewry</strong>.</p>

<p>[…] </p>

<p>{p. 737} </p>

<p><em>The Zionist leaders gave us a definite promise that, if the Allies committed themselves to giving facilities for the establishment of a National Home for the Jews in Palestine, they would do their best to rally to the Allied cause Jewish sentiment and support throughout the world</em>. They kept their word in the letter and the spirit, and the only question that remains now is whether we mean to honour ours. Immediately the declaration was agreed to, millions of leaflets were circulated in every town and area through - out the world where there were known to be Jewish communities. They were dropped from the air in German and Austrian towns, and they were scattered throughout Russia and Poland. I could point out substantial and in one case decisive advantages derived from this propaganda amongst the Jews. <em>In Russia the Bolsheviks baffled all the efforts of the Germans to benefit by the harvests of the Ukraine and the Don, and hundreds of thousands of German and Austrian troops had to be maintained to the end of the War on Russian soil, whilst the Germans were short of men to replace casualties on the Western front. I do not suggest that this was due entirely, or even mainly, to Jewish activities</em>. But we have good reason to believe that Jewish propaganda in Russia had a great deal to do with the difficulties created for the Germans in Southern Russia after the peace of Brest-Litovsk<em>. *</em>The Germans themselves know that to be the case, and the Jews in Germany are suffering to-day for the fidelity with which their brethren in Russia and in America discharged their obligations under the Zionist pledge to the Allies**.</p>

<p>Through Sir Mark Sykes and Colonel Lawrence we informed the Arab leaders, King Hussein and his son, Feisal, of our proposals. We could not get in touch with the Palestinian Arabs as they were fighting against us. </p>

<p>{p. 738} </p>

<p><strong>There is no better proof of the value of the Balfour Declaration as a military move than the fact that Germany entered into negotiations with Turkey in an endeavour to provide an alternative scheme which would appeal to Zionists</strong>. A German-Jewish Society, the V.J.O.D.,* was formed, and in January, 1918, Talaat, the Grand Vizier, at the instigation of the Germans, gave vague promises of legislation by means of which &quot;all justifiable wishes of the Jews in Palestine would be able to find their fulfilment.&quot;</p>

<p>END QUOTE</p>

<p>These issues were far more complicated and dripping with intrigue than may appear at first blush. </p>

<p>Bumper-sticker history doesn&#39;t cut it. As you can see from Lloyd George&#39;s account of the matter, the Zionists effectively threw the war in the favor of the Allies. </p>

<p>Lloyd George saw this, and plainly stated that the Germans saw it as well, with the repercussions being felt by Germany&#39;s Jews. </p>

<p>To pretend that the actions of the Zionists (and related parties) did not influence and fuel the mutual mistrust and animosity between Germany and &quot;the Jews&quot; would be disingenuous - and a really bad idea.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s what we&#39;re supposed to be pretending, right?</p>

<p>It describes George&#39;s political calculations in offering Palestine.  It also notes the timing of the Balfour Declaration with the Bolshevik takeover of Russia.  The documentary hints that George miscalculated because the Bolsheviks weren&#39;t interested in Palestine and issued a statement not supporting resolving the Jewish question by establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine but I wonder if things were a bit more complicated (or conspiratorial, if you will).</p>

<p>It&#39;s also interesting to note the efforts of William Bullitt who was a secret envoy to the Soviet Union at the time.  </p>

<p><a href="http://history.state.gov/milestones/1914-1920/bullitt-mission">http://history.state.gov/milestones/1914-1920/bullitt-mission</a></p>

<p>This is the same guy who wrote for the New York Times and lampooned Henry Ford&#39;s attempt to forge a peaceful end to World War One (calling them &quot;lunatics&quot;) and to keep the U.S. out of the war: </p>

<p><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60711FA3B5B17738DDDA80B94D9405B868DF1D3">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60711FA3B5B17738DDDA80B94D9405B868DF1D3</a></p>

<p>Bullitt (who later goes on secret missions) describes the efforts of a young feminist, Rosika Schwimmer, to sabotage the peace ship.  Ms. Schimmer will also go onto play a role in postwar Hungary and do secret work for the government (the Creel Committee).  She later becomes involved in establishing a New World Order in addition to her feminist and spy work.  Interesting character.</p>

<p>Anyway, there was a lot of intrigue to how the U.S. got into WWI.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Protocols is a fabricated document purporting to be factual. It was originally produced in Russia between 1897 and 1903, possibly by Pyotr Ivanovich Rachkovsky, head of the Paris office of the Russian Secret Police, and unknown others.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>The Protocols uses the false document technique, which invents and inserts documents that appear to be factual. The reader, however, will know of the fictional origin of the work. The Protocols is one of the best-known and most-discussed examples of literary forgery, with analysis and proof of its fraudulent origin going as far back as 1921. </p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Elements of the Protocols were plagiarized from Joly&#39;s fictional Dialogue in Hell, a thinly veiled attack on the political ambitions of Napoleon III, who, represented by the non-Jewish character Machiavelli, plots to rule the world. Joly, a monarchist and legitimist, was imprisoned in France for 15 months as a direct result of his book&#39;s publication. Ironically, scholars have noted that Dialogue in Hell was itself a plagiarism, at least in part, of a novel by Eugene Sue, Les Mystères du Peuple (1849–56).</p>

<p>Identifiable phrases from Joly constitute 4% of the first half of the first edition, and 12% of the second half; later editions, including most translations, have longer quotes from Joly.</p>

<p>Philip Graves brought this plagiarism to light in a series of articles in The Times in 1921, the first published evidence that the Protocols was not an authentic document. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Goedsche was a postal clerk and a spy for the Prussian Secret Police. He had been forced to leave the postal work due to his part in forging evidence in the prosecution against the Democratic leader Benedict Waldeck in 1849.&quot; Following his dismissal, Goedsche began a career as a conservative columnist, and wrote literary fiction under the pen name Sir John Retcliffe. His 1868 novel Biarritz (To Sedan) contains a chapter called &quot;The Jewish Cemetery in Prague and the Council of Representatives of the Twelve Tribes of Israel.&quot; In it, Goedsche (who was unaware that only two of the original twelve Biblical &quot;tribes&quot; remained) depicts a clandestine nocturnal meeting of members of a mysterious rabbinical cabal that is planning a diabolical &quot;Jewish conspiracy.&quot; At midnight, the Devil appears to contribute his opinions and insight. The chapter closely resembles a scene in Alexandre Dumas, père&#39;s Giuseppe Balsamo (1848), in which Joseph Balsamo a.k.a Alessandro Cagliostro and company plot the Affair of the Diamond Necklace. By 1871, this fictional story was being recounted in France as serious history.</p>

<p>In 1872 a Russian translation of &quot;The Jewish Cemetery in Prague&quot; appeared in St. Petersburg as a separate pamphlet of purported non-fiction. François Bournand, in his Les Juifs et nos Contemporains (1896), reproduced the soliloquy at the end of the chapter, in which the character Levit expresses as factual the wish that Jews be &quot;kings of the world in 100 years&quot; —crediting a &quot;Chief Rabbi John Readcliff.&quot; Perpetuation of the myth of the authenticity of Goedsche&#39;s story, in particular the &quot;Rabbi&#39;s speech&quot;, facilitated later accounts of the equally mythical authenticity of the Protocols. Like the Protocols, many asserted that the fictional &quot;rabbi&#39;s speech&quot; had a ring of authenticity, regardless of its origin: &quot;This speech was published in our time, eighteen years ago,&quot; read an 1898 report in La Croix, &quot;and all the events occurring before our eyes were anticipated in it with truly frightening accuracy.&quot;</p>

<p>Fictional events in Joly&#39;s Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu, which appeared four years before Biarritz, may well have been the inspiration for Goedsche&#39;s fictional midnight meeting, and details of the outcome of the supposed plot. Goedsche&#39;s chapter may have been an outright plagiarism of Joly, Dumas père, or both.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1920–21, the history of the concepts found in the Protocols was traced back to the works of Goedsche and Jacques Crétineau-Joly by Lucien Wolf (an English Jewish journalist), and published in London in August 1921. But a dramatic exposé occurred in the series of articles in The Times by its Constantinople reporter, Philip Graves, who discovered the plagiarism from the work of Maurice Joly.</p>

<p>According to writer Peter Grose, Allen Dulles, who was in Constantinople developing relationships in post-Ottoman political structures, discovered &#39;the source&#39; of the documentation ultimately provided to The Times. Grose writes that The Times extended a loan to the source, a Russian émigré who refused to be identified, with the understanding the loan would not be repaid. Colin Holmes, a lecturer in economic history of Sheffield University, identified the émigré as Michael Raslovleff, a self-identified antisemite, who gave the information to Graves so as not to &quot;give a weapon of any kind to the Jews, whose friend I have never been.&quot;</p>

<p>In the first article of Graves&#39; series, titled &quot;A Literary Forgery&quot;, the editors of The Times wrote, &quot;our Constantinople Correspondent presents for the first time conclusive proof that the document is in the main a clumsy plagiarism. He has forwarded us a copy of the French book from which the plagiarism is made.&quot; In the same year, an entire book documenting the hoax was published in the US by Herman Bernstein. Despite this widespread and extensive debunking, the Protocols continued to be regarded as important factual evidence by antisemites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unquestionable.  Discussing fact is labeled racist speach, and it is nothing of the sort.  This is simply a pathetic and clear attempt to limit the open discussion of topics certain groups and people would do almost anything to halt.  </p>

<p>This is an extremely suspect reaction of utter fear and cowardice towards the open discussion and uncovering truth.  Truth should always be held above all else. They fear open and honest discussion.  This is even more reason for it to occur.  This should never be tolerated.  Discussions should never be limited or artificially restricted.  The country I live in and cherish is built upon truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not familiar with that member in particular, but I do not consider neonazis to be a group that &quot;mildly discusses their issues concerning groups of people they have qualms with.&quot; If they did, what&#39;s the harm in that? Again, I&#39;m not familiar but just going with what I would assume and I apologize if I am mistake on their repertoire.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to say, &quot;I dislike how this group does XYZ,&quot; versus, &quot;we need to exterminate said group.&quot; Again, speech that goes with the former is, in my opinion, part of free speech. The latter is clearly hate-mongering and should not be tolerated.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care <em>which</em> group comes on here as long as they abide by these rules and I think flytape&#39;s version is more conducive to discussion than the current. The point is, a civilized discussion <em>or</em> complaint should be tolerated if it is not calling for violence towards a group or simply defaming them (slurs).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m much more concerned about censorship than racism.  I honestly haven&#39;t seen much racism in this sub, IDK, maybe it gets removed promptly when it occurs?  </p>

<p>We are subject to such extreme propaganda and brutal thought control from our fascist overlords and their minions in the media that having some place to have honest discussions is hugely valuable. </p>

<p>In particular, the media loves Jews and there is a constant ongoing PR campaign to whitewash the crimes of Israel.  For example, I notice how <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com+%22the+jewish+people%22&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a">the NY Times likes to refer to &quot;the Jewish people.&quot;</a>  But you don&#39;t hear anything about &quot;the Muslim people,&quot; or &quot;the Irish people.&quot;  No, it&#39;s just &quot;the Muslims,&quot; or &quot;the Irish.&quot; So, by extension, why isn&#39;t it simply &quot;the Jews?&quot;  </p>

<p>Because of this constant PR campaign to paint Jews in the best possible light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The important thing is that in this subreddit we permit discussions about racial issues, about religions, about feminism and male rights, about Zionism, about Israel, about the Holocaust, and not only permit discussions on these controversial issues, but also criticisms of these and similar &quot;sacred cows&quot;. If we can&#39;t criticize, how can we have an actual discussion or debate? It would be impossible.</p>

<p>This is a matter of importance to me because my main focus in this subreddit is taboo topics -- things that some people would wish us all to be forbidden to talk about. Consequently my posts sail pretty close to the wind at times. I&#39;m aware of that, but I refuse to allow myself to be self-censored by political correctness.</p>

<p>I try not to insult other  redditors, and I try to refrain from any hateful comments about race, religion, sexuality, and so on. However, because my posts are in forbidden zones, many Redditors assume they are hateful, even when they are not. They assume that any critical comment of taboo topics must be hateful. This shows a lack of mental clarity on their part, but it is quite common.</p>

<p>It is vital that we continue our criticism of Israel and Zionism. We are among a very few places on Reddit where such criticism is openly and freely tolerated.</p>

<p>I also believe it is vital that we tolerate race realism in this sub. People have been trained not to even think about race, but to ignore race is to ignore reality. The recent posts about the &quot;knock-out game&quot;, which is otherwise known as the &quot;polar bear game&quot;  is a good example of why race realism is necessary in order to achieve a true understanding of what is happening. Almost all victims of this &quot;game&quot; have been white, Jewish, or Asian (but mostly white), and almost all attackers have been black. This &quot;game&quot; is  racially motivated hatred. We can&#39;t discuss it without talking about race.</p>

<p>Anyway, what we need in this sub is civility toward each other, but we can&#39;t afford to make any sacred cows that are taboo to talk about -- not here. This sub is designed to talk about the things the general public won&#39;t discuss. We need to have the courage to critically examine topics that are politically incorrect, and that includes Israel, Zionism, Jewish control of the media, black violent crime, immigration, homosexuality, abortion, feminism, and so on.</p>

<p>Maybe a redditor used just one word incorrectly? Or they misunderstand the difference between zionism and judaism (extremely common)? Or maybe they make simple assumptions on complex implications of anothers intentions or meanings, and instead of requesting for further clarification, they grab onto that emotional train amd wont let go for fear of having to admit they were wrong or just misunderstood what was meant.</p>

<p>If we all assume the other is honest and trying to be respectful (some users are from other countries and may not speak english as well as us &#39;mericans), then a lot of these issues can be resolved peacefully , efficiently, and respectfully.</p>

<p>When this fails, then the intentions of apparantly abuseful statements and belligerent remarks become unveiled, and makes the mods&#39; job a bit easier :-)</p>

<p>This only would work if we all actively take part in it on an individual level.</p>

<p>I personally believe the problem is not the definition of &quot;hate speech&quot; or &quot;racism&quot; or &quot;[add prefix here]-ism&quot;, because deep down inside, i think, we all know what is meant. The issue, i believe, is on the individual level of each redditor. It just happens to be on a massive scale.</p>

<p>Many times people <em>intentionally</em> misread and/or misrepresent what was said in the hopes of maligning those that they disagree with - effectively using false accusations as a hammer to silence the opposition.</p>

<p><strong>Disabling the hiding of comments in your Prefs</strong> - upper right hand corner, to the left of your username. I believe the field within your site Preferences (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/prefs/">http://www.reddit.com/prefs/</a>) is populated by default with a value that force hides anything with a certain downvote count, say -4.
Delete both values and their downvotes become meaningless.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a difference between distasteful speech and disruptive speech though.  </p>

<p>Distasteful speech can be voted down and ignored--so to me this is rule 1  (racism).</p>

<p>Disruptive speech, including attacking and libeling users or this sub, should be moderated by removal and bans--so this is rules 2, 3, 4, 9 and 10.</p>

<p>Stylistic rules I think can be moderated by voting down rather than moderator action--rules 5, 7, 8, 11 (Caps lock, Facebook links, memes, sensational/misleading headlines).  Maybe mods can insert clearly defined mod text into misleading headlines.  Not sure of the purpose of no Facebook links though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually that response you got was misleading. The np stops your votes from counting. So you click a link that says .np and cast votes, then go about your business. Those don&#39;t count. You would see that if you refreshed the page. </p>

<p>However, the trolls across the bridge have discussed this and know how to easily bypass it. You simply delete the np and type in w w w then hit enter. It refreshes the page with the url that allows voting. It&#39;s just a minor inconvenience and nothing else. It definitely doesn&#39;t stop vote brigades.  In fact, just yesterday I saw a thread with a .np url. I followed the link to check out the voting. Kept refreshing the page and every few minutes I saw <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> power users coming into the discussion (It was in SRD). One was Impissed, another was Yserbius (mod for r/Israel) and there was a few others who claimed they didn&#39;t find that thread by following the link at r/conspiratard. It&#39;s just a massive coincidence that they all happened to be just randomly browsing Reddit and happened to all congregate in that thread right after the link was posted in r/conspiratard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i do not think we need to change rule #1 and here is why:</p>

<p>criticism of zoinism is not racism, as much as they would like it to be and the majority of zionists love to hide behind judaism, criticism of judaism is also not racism. judaism is a faith, a doctrine, not a race.</p>

<p>criticism of jews for owning the media and banking/finance or milking* the holocaust (hoax/exaggeration or not) is not racism it is criticism at most and fundamentally and factually the truth at a minimum.</p>

<p>*milking: playing the worldwide universal victim for <del>6</del>3.4million of your clan/religion/race/syndicate dying or being murdered in a war does not really measure up against the Russian losses, or even the German losses. sorry, it just doesn&#39;t, that is fact.</p>

<p>the number one squeaky wheel on the &quot;racism&quot; claim in this sub are jews/zionists and that claim is just bogus, end of story.</p>

<p>there is no racism in this sub, against jews or blacks or anyone else there is only truth.</p>

<p>if you are afraid of, or won&#39;t face the truth then you are in the wrong place.</p>

<p>This is 100% untrue and why racism is so common on this sub. Racism is more than inciting violence or using slurs. </p>

<p>Racism is spreading and defending stereotypes. Racism is any form of prejudicial treatment. Racism is when you suggest that any racial group has any sort of generalized quality.</p>

<p>By your standard of racism it would be perfectly acceptable to say &quot;Group X has below average intelligence&quot;, &quot;Group Y has a primitive culture&quot;, or that &quot;Group Z controls the media&quot;.</p>

<p>Trying to re-define racism is exactly why so many people think that this sub is racist. You shouldn&#39;t need to clarify what racism is. No other sub has this problem because they are vigilant and intolerant to racism.  That this post has so many upvotes is all the ammo that any opponent of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> needs.</p>

If you&#39;re so certain of the conspirators that spin these webs, why not use their names. Palming something off as Jewish/Indian/Christian suggests that all people of said creed/race/nationality are in uniform to your suggestion, some &quot;agenda&quot;. These are blanket terms that favour the idea that perhaps you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. An entire race is not conspiring.

<p>Well, most of the Christianity bashing doesn&#39;t have to do with conspiracies, and since <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> is dedicated to bashing conspiracies there really isn&#39;t any need to take note of it.</p>

<p>The big issue I see is that racism doesn&#39;t necessarily have to do with violence. You can say something that marginalizes people like &quot;black people are x&quot; or &quot;asians do y&quot; without necessarily being hateful.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the fact people tend to mistake single belief groups as representative of a bigger group of people (see, Zionists and Jews).</p>

<p>Sure if people who share upbringings do have certain things in common, which is why we have things like &quot;black&quot; or &quot;hispanic&quot; culture. But it is racist to assume a person must have an aspect due to the colour of their skin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think their is a serious vs ill troll type humor difference to me in the manner of how what may be called racism is presented. </p>

<p>If someone wants to rationally in context to a topic, express[edit:]ed in their own hand [including slurs] in depth how great characters such as santa, satan, KKK, hitler, neo/old nazis, or new/old black panthers are, I can often easily respect that a person spends earnest energy in their free expression, even if I personally find some or all of the things they expressed to be racist in my mind. If their racist ideological words make sense then it may spark others to become part of such a hate mindset, but IMO not easily to intelligent educated thinkers, &amp; often roots of their reasons for hatred are exposed often letting those opposed to dissect &amp; see the glimpses of reasons for what others label hate.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, short racial slur troll comments made to quickly spark hate &amp; chaos in a discussion forum are often more ill IMO &amp; I RES tag people that do so accordingly to indicate their ways.</p>

<p>I do think on rare occasion possibly mods should remove some people that are not ever contributing in non troll ways, but I think removing racist comments is ignorant. Remove the person then leave their name &amp; words to mark as a tombstone their ignorance forever.</p>

<p>I think speaking ill of lizards or aliens is often hateful &amp; sometimes borders on racism, but I dig learning what others think &amp; see. I like to sift fantasy from reality. I do not need to be sheltered from others earnest words, whether I agree or disagree with them.</p>

<p>I have witnessed few hard core violence inciting haters on reddit. Most of the irritating haters are like trolls &amp; mosquitoes. I trollingly pester warpigs of the ill machine &amp; I know no individual that does not rub some others in ill fashion. Religious violence is common in history, but I do not seek to ban books that drive ill violent interpretations. </p>

<p>I think sparking or inciting violence is more ill than racism. IMO <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tt5wx/cops_show_up_claiming_suicide_attempt_physically/ceb8ke1"><strong>this persons post</strong></a> borders on inciting others to act in violent manner &amp; I found it ill that it is the top comment.</p>

<p>Note: I find the words chosen as slurs often expose important details, such as how subliminal programming seeds slur users mindsets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They can be.  And it won&#39;t be difficult.  However, there may be times when a statement might SOUND racist, but is actually not a negative statement of a race in general.</p>

<p>For example: &quot;My store has had a lot of bad experiences with Mexicans.  Kids running around and making a mess, being loud, and sometimes breaking things.  Teenagers and adults trying to steal things or switch price tags.  And don&#39;t get me started on the bathrooms.  Are ALL Mexicans like this?  No.  Just the ones that store has been unfortunate enough to serve.&quot;</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: I do not work in a store (I&#39;m actually unemployed as of this writing).  I have no problem with Mexicans at all.  I go to church with quite a few of them (am not one myself), and all the ones I&#39;ve known are good people.  The above statement is an example and is not meant to be taken as anything that actually happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you figure that expanding the types of regulated speech from simply racism to include sex, ethnicity, religious affiliation, nationality, social order and creed will broaden speech? Your argument is backwards. It will have the opposite affect.</p>

<p>Also, your rule will not stop people from being &quot;bombarded with accusations&quot;. It will still happen regardless of what rules you implement, and our responses will be the exact same - &quot;no, it isn&#39;t&quot;.</p>

<p>I do agree that our speech should not be limited, which is why I oppose this. For instance, if I want to say that I think all catholics are crazy, that&#39;s quite different from saying I think all blacks are crazy, but your rule treats them alike.</p>

<p>Rule #1 Slurs that defame people of any race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, social order or creed will not be tolerated and are subject to moderation and/or action against your account. Discussion about all of these groups is acceptable so long as no slurs or calls to violence are used.

    <div class="md"><p>I simply do not feel it is something that needs to be tinkered with or made explicit. As far as I can tell, such comments as you are driving at are not a big deal.</p>

<p>The nod to rule 10 is telling insomuch as it draws attention to the fact that the comments in question are indeed personal attacks. It seems what you are trying to adjudicate is where the line is drawn between attack and critique. I&#39;m reminded of the judicial line between user and dealer - &quot;over this amount is a felony&quot;. The designation, to be just, must be subjective. For instance, in a post about Israel a guy replies &quot;this is racist&quot; where another replies &quot;you are a racist&quot;. Disregarding for the moment whether either of the two replies are true or false, it is going to be up to the reader to decide whether either of these is a personal attack or a genuine critique of the post. In our forum here, it is always going to be up to the moderator to decide this question.</p>

<p>Eh, I&#39;m rambling and don&#39;t feel like cleaning up my thoughts about it any better so I&#39;ll just say that <em>it isn&#39;t that there is something inherently wrong in your rule, but that I think rules are the wrong way to go about achieving what you want to achieve</em>.</p>

<p>Its general definition means the national movement for the return of the Jewish people to their homeland and the resumption of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel.</p>

<p>The founder of the modern zionist movement is theodor herzl. Id recommed some research on him, as you will come to find that he was an atheist and he publicly stated so.</p>

<p>Also, this next link is to a site authored by a Jew, and he thoroughly explains the difference between zionism and judaism. I highly recommend you read it in its entirety as it is very informative and helpful for you to understand the fallacy of your claim.</p>

The wikipedia article about him defines him as a Jewish Atheist, meaning he is descended from Jews (using this term in regards to race) but he was an atheist (meaning he did not believe in a god, and was not religiously affiliated with Judaism). </p>

<p>This is a perfect example of why this topic is so controversial. If you havent done so, i will recommend a second time to visit that link i provided you, writeen by a Jewish person who is not Zionist. He explains thoroughly the difference between a jew and a zionist. It would really improve your understanding of this topic (assuming improvement in quality of knowledge is something you seek.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understand me. I am aware that not all jews are zionists. The point is that the rest of the world is willing to think and talk in a certain way. If the jews don&#39;t like it, they must deal with that. We certainly don&#39;t need jews to teach to the entire world what to think and what to say. They already tried it with religion. And we didn&#39;t liked that. We are already angry. But they still continue with their delusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youre right, i didnt understand you. Its hard with you sometimes, to figure out what you are saying. For instance, you literally said zionists are jews, so its not a great leap to get to my assumptions of your implications. I hope you understand the reason for my misunderstanding, as i felt you werent extremely clear until now. Again, another honest misunderstanding i hope.</p>

<p>I do agree with your assertion that a great deal of the population use the terms interchangeably, and that is one of the main causes of such controversy surrounding this topic, as well as other similar topics and their related controversies.</p>

<p>As for the rest of your comment, im not sure where you are going with that, so ill just say im glad we finally found some common ground and identified a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Btw, i dont mean to pry or to be rude, but of what nationality are you? I have a suspicion that you may be french (that was not intended as an insult, i just recall you used a french word in lieu of an english word a few days ago). You dont have to answer that question if you dont want to. I was just curious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see. There does seem to be a bit of a difference when referencing &quot;Mafia&quot; proper, as in the Sicilian Mafia or aka Italian Mafia. Basically, colloquially speaking, mafia can either mean the Italian Mafia, based from Sicily, or it could refer to the various other mafias from other countries that are run in similar fashion and purpose. </p>

<p>This would seem to highlight the importance of clarity when speaking about such topics, as it is easily misunderstood due to the fact that different people use different definitions for the same term, depending on context. </p>

<p>This would explain how i misunderstood your use of the term Mafia as an ambiguous one, rather than the more specific term regarding only the Italian Mafia as you might have intended. </p>

<p>Honest misunderstanding.</p>

<p>It is silly to think that anybody who refers for example to Zionists as simply jews, or Mafia as italians is a racist.

Everybody knwos that Zionists are jews, and Mafia are italians.</p>

<p>This is completely false. You do not have to be a Jew to be a Zionist, neither do you have to be Italian to be a part of a Mafia. Zionism is not race specific and a mafia is a collective term to describe someone who is part of an organised crime racket.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going off the comments above . . . it seems maybe the Soviets and Wall St. had more of a connection than Wall St. and the Germans, at least according to Solzhenitsyn (and the Germans certainly alleged this as well):</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a partial translation of the unpublished in English book by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, &quot;Two Hundered Years Together&quot; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Together-Complete-Edition-Volumes/dp/5969707023">http://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Together-Complete-Edition-Volumes/dp/5969707023</a> [one can see why this literary giant&#39;s book was not translated from this excerpt]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The 1930s were years of an intense industrialized spurt, which crushed the peasantry and altered the life of the entire country. Mere existence demanded adaptation and development of new skills. But through crippling sacrifices, and despite the many absurdities of the Soviet organizational system, the horrible epic somehow led to the creation of an industrialized power.</p>

<p>Yet the first and second five-year plans came into existence and were carried out not through the miracle of spontaneous generation, nor as a result of the simple violent round-up of large masses of laborers. It demanded many technical provisions, advanced equipment, and the collaboration of specialists experienced in this technology. <strong>All this flowed plentifully from the capitalist West, and most of all from the United States; not in the form of a gift, of course, and not in the form of generous help. The Soviet communists paid for all of this abundantly with Russia’s mineral wealth and timber, with concessions for raw materials markets, with trade areas promised to the West, and with plundered goods from the Empire of the tsars. Such deals flowed with the help and approval of international financial magnates, most of all those on Wall Street, in a persistent continuation of the first commercial ties that the Soviet communists developed on the American stock exchanges as early as during the Civil War. The new partnership was strengthened  by shiploads of tsarist gold and treasures from the Hermitage.</strong></p>

<p>But wait a second, were we not thoroughly taught by Marx that capitalists are the fierce enemies of proletarian socialism and that we should not expect help from them, but rather a destructive, bloody war? Well, it’s not that simple: despite the official diplomatic non-recognition, trade links were completely out in the open, and even written about in Izvestiya: “American merchants are interested in broadening of economic ties with the Soviet Union.”[1] American unions came out against such an expansion (defending their markets from the products of cheap and even slave Soviet labor). The “Russian-American Chamber of Commerce,” created at that time, simply did not want to hear about any political opposition to communism, or “to mix politics with business relations.”[2]</p>

<p>Anthony Sutton, a modern American scholar, researched the recently-opened diplomatic and financial archives and followed the connections of Wall Street with the Bolsheviks; he pointed to the amoral logic of this long and consistent relationship. From as early as the “Marburg” plan at the beginning of the 20th century, which was based on the vast capital of Carnegie, the idea was to strengthen the authority of international finance, through global “socialization,” “for control … and for the forced appeasement.” Sutton concluded that: “International financiers prefer to do business with central governments. The banking community least of all wants a free economy and de-centralized authority.” “Revolution and international finance do not quite contradict each other, if the result of revolution should be to establish a more centralized authority,” and, therefore, to make the markets of these countries manageable. And there was a second line of agreement: “Bolsheviks and bankers shared an essential common platform — internationalism.”[3]&quot;</p>

<p>The german american population was interned because they were spying for their homeland during that time. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>German aliens, not Americans of German descent, were mostly targeted for internment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Justice Department attempted to prepare a list of all German aliens, counting approximately 480,000 of them, more than 4,000 of whom were imprisoned in 1917-18. The allegations included spying for Germany, or endorsing the German war effort.[53] Thousands were forced to buy war bonds to show their loyalty.[54]</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_American#World_War_I_anti-German_sentiment">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_American#World_War_I_anti-German_sentiment</a></p>

<p>Also, lots of Americans and many foreign aliens were falsely accused of &quot;spying&quot; and basic un-American activities.  Huge numbers of leftists were put in prison and targeted.  People like Eugene Debs.  Huge numbers of leftist papers were run out and America established a large propaganda campaign (the Creel Commission and the Four Minute Men, for example).  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the onset of World War I, nativist and racist prejudices were further fueled by antagonism towards German immigrants and their descendents, since Germany was now classified as a state enemy.[39] Considerable skepticism concerning the war’s aims and isolationism among U.S. residents at the outset also led to a second pro-war mobilization on the home front, as the administration attempted to foster public support through the establishment of the first governmental propaganda office (Schaffer, 1999; Nagler, 1999).[40] [41] The propaganda efforts would spiral out of control, leading to a domestic climate that Higham describes as “call[ing] forth the most strenuous nationalism and the most pervasive nativism that the United States had ever known” (cited in Nagler, 1993, p. 191). Prior to U.S. involvement in the war, many domestic German-language papers had espoused the German cause, arguing that the imperial power of Great Britain was more threatening than German action (Bergquist, 1999; see also Wittke, 1936). Even though the vast majority of German-language periodicals immediately pledged support when the U.S. entered the war, German Americans quickly became targets of harassment, business boycotts, violence, and vandalism (Bergquist, 1999; Luebke, 1990).[42][43] State Councils of Defense banned the use of German language in public places and changed German-named street signs. German books and German-language newspapers were burned in multiple cities (Rippley, 1976; see also Nagler, 1997; (Luebke, 1990).[44] In efforts to prove their loyalty to the U.S., many German citizens and businesses anglicized their names and distanced themselves from their cultural institutions and organizations (Luebke, 1990).[45]</p>

<p><strong>However, the demands of war would quickly challenge the generalized anti-immigrant sentiment in the services, as the demand for service members necessitated the broad use of the foreign-born</strong>. . . .</p>

<p>A French solder in 1917 described the heterogeneous character of American troops in Europe: &quot;You could not imagine a more extraordinary gathering than this american [sic] army, there is a little bit of everything, Greeks, Italians, Turks, Indians, Spanish, also a sizable number of boches.[47] Truthfully, <strong>almost half of the officers have German origins.</strong> This doesn’t seem to bother them… Among the Americans are sons of emigrated Frenchmen and sons of emigrated boches. I asked one son of a Frenchman if these Germans were coming willingly to fight their brothers and cousins, he squarely answered me: ‘yes!’” (cited in Ford, 2001, p. 3) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the First World War, the U.S. government drafted into military service nearly half a million immigrants of forty-six different nationalities, creating <strong>an army with over 18 percent of its soldiers born in foreign countries</strong>. In addition, thousands of second-generation &quot;immigrants&quot; also served. </p>

<p>During World War I, a German officer [had] noted with some complexity the ethnic diversity of the American Army: &quot;Only a few of the troops are of pure American origin: *<em>the majority are of German, Dutch and Italian parentage.</em> But these semi-Americans...fully feel themselves to be true-born sons of their [adopted] country.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, American racism toward those with German ancestry was not because of the Zimmerman incident, nor does that justify it.  The Zimmerman letter was mischaracterized and used as propaganda.  <strong>The Germans stated they wanted the U.S. to remain neutral</strong> and only offered terms to Mexico if the U.S. did not stay neutral.  t was a conditional offer.</p>

<p>And who knows if there this whole intercepted letter was actually an act of betrayal by Zimmerman, as <a href="http://lovkap.blogspot.com/2012/04/truth-about-zimmerman-telegram-how-usa.html">some allege</a> </p>

<p>Also, the U.S. was only neutral in name and there were many forces pushing for war against Germany before the Zimmerman letter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Germany was a repeatedly invasive power in both conflicts. That statement is ludicrous because Germany has a record of conquering other countries during the world wars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I strongly disagree.  Germany was not expansionist.  It entered WWI for reasons other than expanding its territory and after losing the war had territory taken away from it.  It took territory back to start WWII, and ended the Versailles Treaty, and kicked the international bankers out, but it did not want to conquer the world and certainly didn&#39;t want to conquer America.  Germany desperately sought to keep America neutral during both world wars but forces within America were very motivated to bring Germany down and convince the political leadership to do so and they used mass propaganda and false flags to convince the American people to do so.</p>
