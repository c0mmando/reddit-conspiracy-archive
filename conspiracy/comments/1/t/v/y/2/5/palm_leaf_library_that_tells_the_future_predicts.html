       Ok guys, I know we all had some drama over these Christmas days so I want to bring it back to the roots.  Crazy source of information, but interesting as all hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       My wife's mum is a painter and true artist.  Meaning: she goes by feeling and considers most things to be ordained by a larger order which isn't confined in a temporal or logical sense.  You could say hippy, but she isn't.  She's just "touched" as we say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, she ended up going to India just to look around.  She had an exhibit somewhere and travelled south just to look at India and see what was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ended up in the south of the country and met a man who told her he had a way to predict the future.  It was a place that was an ancient library, with all the manuscripts written on palm leaves.  According to this man, anyone can go to the place and have his or her future told by the leaves.  They have the future of everyone.  Not everyone, just the people who will go there and ask.  So if you go there, they will have for you.  If you don't then they won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the big news at the time was a prediction that had come true, which was that a massive crime would happen on 9-11-2001, involving two flying chariots on the east coast of the US, and it would change everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       My wife's mum thought this was amazing, so she asked also about the future of the US, because at the time I was there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing she got was this: civil war in 2014.  Bloody.  Brought on, I think, by financial collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am only putting it down here for fun, that's all I heard, and I have no sources really besides
       <a href="http://www.gaiaheartworkz.com/gaiaheartworkzusauk/downloads/what-the-revelation-of-the-palmleaves-tells-us.pdf">
        this
       </a>
       which is some guy writing about the same place, I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's more of an interesting anecdote.  But if shit goes down this year, and you want answers, you will know that you once read you could get your future at a palm leaf library in southern India.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck hopefully 2014 is peaceful for everyone!

       So I read that PDF document containing the prediction about 9
       <em>
        11 and it is dead on.  The question I have is, how can we verify that it was truly written before 9
       </em>

       We will see if this comes true! I mean, we are due for another "fiscal showdown" this february where our "leaders" will pretend to argue and stand firm until we have another government shutdown that may or may not be worse that the previous one.

       We all want and don't want the war for similar reasons. It's the unfortunate reality that we are in. I'm sure our founding fathers felt similarly in the 1770s.

       I'm assuming this library is some kind of otherworldly thing, and that the palm leaves are not pulped and pressed; as intact palm leaves would be such a terrible choice of media in this one. You could call it just by looking around though. Financial collapse is plainly imminent; interest rates
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       rise soon, but that means a precipitous economic nosedive that will knock a lot of people (but no corporations) off the teat; and the nascent police state is just spoiling for a fight.

       Divination or not, I'd be surprised if this isn't the year we finally hit the skids. Honestly, I'm still surprised we made it through 2013 without entering another
       <del>
        war
       </del>
       conflict with Iran/Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're already taking on water, it's a matter of how long before we capsize. The writing has been on the walls for years now, it's just a matter of time and preparation (on both sides of the field).
