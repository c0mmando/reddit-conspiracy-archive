       Conspiratard is obviously and blatantly trolling this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently on the front page of Conpsiratard is a link to a submission on this sub from earlier today dealing with Zionist racism:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tsz2l/zionist_support_of_multiculturalism_exists/">
        http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tsz2l/zionist_support_of_multiculturalism_exists/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tsz2l/zionist_support_of_multiculturalism_exists/">
        post in question
       </a>
       you will see conspiratard trolls have totally taken over the thread and derailed it.  They have turned a post about Zionist racism and turned it into racism
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       Zionists.  They have derailed the discussion by repeatedly attacking the legitimate conspiracy users as "racist" and stalking and ganging up on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have used multiple sockpuppet accounts and [have been exposed](
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tsz2l/zionist_support_of_multiculturalism_exists/cebj1s9">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tsz2l/zionist_support_of_multiculturalism_exists/cebj1s9
       </a>
       in this very thread for it.  I have requested the mods take action against these users but no action has been taken.  There have been repeated rule violations: conspiratard trolls are calling users mentally ill, wishing death upon them, calling users racists, and mocking the entire sub.  Most of these people are avid
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       users and are obviously only here to troll and again there is a troll bridge right on the front page of cospiratard.  The voting is heavily lopsided and it's obvious the conspiratard trolls are heavily vote brigading the post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately nothing appears to have changed with the recent mod changes as none of these obvious trolls have been banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty obvious the powers that run this site and this sub want this current state of affairs where all discussions about Zionism devolve into fighting with trolls.  It's incredibly frustrating to say the least.

       There isn't much mods can do about vote brigading.

       The admins are the only people with the tools to deal with that short of taking a sub private as some conservative political subs have.

       It is starting to appear that the mods want the sub infested with trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at the comments in the thread . . . one conspiratard poster wished death on the users here and claims the whole sub is mentally ill and racist.  He calls conspiracy theorists retarded and says he refuses to give people here any respect.  Even though he's an obvious troll that intends to troll he is allowed to stay and express his "opinion" while legitimate users here were banned for expressing a similar opinion about solidwhetstone (who was actually encouraging this troll infestation).

       are Jewish and feel that they have a dog in this fight. Depending on how you look at it, they do. I really don't blame them for coming over here to debate/argue/troll or whatever because they are certain that they have a good reason for doing it. I'm not saying it's right, but rather the inevitable result of broaching the topic.

       If men's rights subscribers trolled feminist subs in this manner they might have a similar dog in that fight but no self respecting sub should allow itself to be trolled in this manner.

       i wouldnt say "prohibiting", because that implies that they have authority to do so.

       i prefer the term "inhibiting", because thats what they're actually doing. they upvote and downvote posts in order to control which posts make the front page, and that lets them bury stories that they want buried, while creating and upvoting "loony" posts that repel newcomers from the sub.

       The rules simply do not apply to conspiratard and SRS and we have to live with that. Sure, we should point it out at every opportunity, but we're not going to change it. We have to work around it, especially in this case where it's more than just griefers with an agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you ban someone, they'll be back with another account. Over and over and over. It's useless and accomplishes nothing more than making this sub look heavy handed.

       you start out by saying that we should simply let them stifle our ability to express our opinions. you defend the trolls. and then you claim that it is futile to try and stop them. and then you call me "nuts" for suggesting something that would actually work.

      <p>
       i mean, are you even trying to hide the fact that you're one of them? because if you are, you're doing a shitty job. if you were a real life double agent you'd be discovered on your first day.

       pretending they dont exist will only help them systemically subvert our sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       and "drama" is the name of the game. we make as much as possible in their sub while minimising the drama that occurs in ours. they're already attacking us, they cant do anything more than they're already doing. there is no threat of retalliation because they're already doing everything they can. and most importantly, bringing the fight to them will be fun.

       Seriously though, is there any substantive difference between a shill and an opinionated redditor?

       the only absolute difference is that shills get paid. there are alot of characteristics which differentiate a "paid shill" from an "opinionated asshole who wants to suppress the speech of others", but those differences tend to be context-sensitive, there are plenty of resources on the web for anyone who wants to know how to spot a shill.

       But in this case it does.  Most of the people responding were actual conspiratard posters.  Many of them were caught on this thread using sockpuppets.  The voting totals were totally against normal voting patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
       See the stickied post right now.  Most legitimate users here don't agree with the cries of racism that are being hugely upvoted in that thread.

       You "people" are being intentionally obtuse by pretending conspiratard doesn't troll this place.

       It's not like someone can force you to think something by making a dumb post. Truth is truth regardless of spin, have a decent read over at

       it's seriously, regardless of topic, clearly one of the most idiotic subs on reddit. Their attempts to be funny or mock entirely pathetic. I don't even care if they're right, wrong, trolling, w/e they aren't doing a good job at whatever it is they think they're doing. Most of the content is them drawing triangles on pictures, as if this somehow makes everything on this subreddit untrue. The people there are of clearly low IQ's, they aren't funny, and they get this pointed out to them by people who have gotten there via /random on a regular basis. The sub is a total joke.
