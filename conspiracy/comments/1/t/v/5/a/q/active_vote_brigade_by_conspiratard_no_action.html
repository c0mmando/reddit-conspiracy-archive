        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">18</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-12-28 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Grandest_Inquisitor.html">Grandest_Inquisitor</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Conspiratard is obviously and blatantly trolling this sub.</p>

<p>Currently on the front page of Conpsiratard is a link to a submission on this sub from earlier today dealing with Zionist racism:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tsz2l/zionist_support_of_multiculturalism_exists/">http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tsz2l/zionist_support_of_multiculturalism_exists/</a> </p>

<p>If you look at the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tsz2l/zionist_support_of_multiculturalism_exists/">post in question</a> you will see conspiratard trolls have totally taken over the thread and derailed it.  They have turned a post about Zionist racism and turned it into racism <em>against</em> Zionists.  They have derailed the discussion by repeatedly attacking the legitimate conspiracy users as &quot;racist&quot; and stalking and ganging up on them.  </p>

<p>They have used multiple sockpuppet accounts and [have been exposed](<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tsz2l/zionist_support_of_multiculturalism_exists/cebj1s9">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tsz2l/zionist_support_of_multiculturalism_exists/cebj1s9</a> in this very thread for it.  I have requested the mods take action against these users but no action has been taken.  There have been repeated rule violations: conspiratard trolls are calling users mentally ill, wishing death upon them, calling users racists, and mocking the entire sub.  Most of these people are avid <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> users and are obviously only here to troll and again there is a troll bridge right on the front page of cospiratard.  The voting is heavily lopsided and it&#39;s obvious the conspiratard trolls are heavily vote brigading the post.</p>

<p>Unfortunately nothing appears to have changed with the recent mod changes as none of these obvious trolls have been banned.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious the powers that run this site and this sub want this current state of affairs where all discussions about Zionism devolve into fighting with trolls.  It&#39;s incredibly frustrating to say the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is starting to appear that the mods want the sub infested with trolls. </p>

<p>Just look at the comments in the thread . . . one conspiratard poster wished death on the users here and claims the whole sub is mentally ill and racist.  He calls conspiracy theorists retarded and says he refuses to give people here any respect.  Even though he&#39;s an obvious troll that intends to troll he is allowed to stay and express his &quot;opinion&quot; while legitimate users here were banned for expressing a similar opinion about solidwhetstone (who was actually encouraging this troll infestation).</p>

<p>i prefer the term &quot;inhibiting&quot;, because thats what they&#39;re actually doing. they upvote and downvote posts in order to control which posts make the front page, and that lets them bury stories that they want buried, while creating and upvoting &quot;loony&quot; posts that repel newcomers from the sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>pretending they dont exist will only help them systemically subvert our sub.</p>

<p>and &quot;drama&quot; is the name of the game. we make as much as possible in their sub while minimising the drama that occurs in ours. they&#39;re already attacking us, they cant do anything more than they&#39;re already doing. there is no threat of retalliation because they&#39;re already doing everything they can. and most importantly, bringing the fight to them will be fun. </p>

<p>as for my previous points, this was taken from the <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> rules section: </p>

<p>Obviously they don&#39;t mean that. They just say it for appearances.</p>

<p>Seriously though, is there any substantive difference between a shill and an opinionated redditor?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the only absolute difference is that shills get paid. there are alot of characteristics which differentiate a &quot;paid shill&quot; from an &quot;opinionated asshole who wants to suppress the speech of others&quot;, but those differences tend to be context-sensitive, there are plenty of resources on the web for anyone who wants to know how to spot a shill.</p>

<p>most <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> users arent shills, they&#39;re just assholes who&#39;ve been co-opted by even bigger assholes, into attacking <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

Their attempts to be funny or mock entirely pathetic. I don&#39;t even care if they&#39;re right, wrong, trolling, w/e they aren&#39;t doing a good job at whatever it is they think they&#39;re doing. Most of the content is them drawing triangles on pictures, as if this somehow makes everything on this subreddit untrue. The people there are of clearly low IQ&#39;s, they aren&#39;t funny, and they get this pointed out to them by people who have gotten there via /random on a regular basis. The sub is a total joke.</p>
