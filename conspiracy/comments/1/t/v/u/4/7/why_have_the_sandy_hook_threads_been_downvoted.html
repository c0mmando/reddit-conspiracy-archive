       A lot of people think Sandy Hook is a false flag. There seem to be a lot of unanswered questions that cause people to doubt the official story and it's not just, this story. This doubt and distrust of our government did not occur in a vacuum. What ever the truth is, the message I take from all this controversy is that people are fearing and distrusting their government in larger and larger numbers. I'm sorry but I don't think all this will end well. I hope I am wrong.

       Imagine what the forefathers of our country would thing. We are under a MUCH more oppressive and controlling government that the average working man has absolutely no real say in. They had a revolution the first time that happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to sound crazy here but does anyone think that there needs to be a 2nd American revolution?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems we are beyond just trying to vote the best people into office because there are too few people that actually want to help our country. We need a system of government that is truly accountable to the people, and for the people. Not the other way around. It is OUR America.

       I'm not so sure that it is our America anymore and the more I learn the more I think that it never was. The difference now is the internet. They can't get away with stuff, like they used to. That is why Cispa and all that keep coming back, time and again.

       Then it needs to be! Putting the government aside, we are a country of good people. There are lots of problem areas and the media has done a lot of damage too, but we are a nation of good people.

       Everyone here might want to look into buying and learning how to use a gun. It's your constitutional right and the government obviously has them but so will anyone who will want to take your food / shelter if shit hits the fan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Target shooting is also really a fun sport. It's our constitutional duty to keep up an armed militia and protect our country from oppressive governments, including our own.

       I second this notion, even if it's just to protect your family. Doesn't have to be due to an impending collapse either, crime happens. Don't let yourself be a statistic.

       No kidding about the family thing either. That's a really good point. Even if you absolutely hate the thought of shooting someone, nothing would make someone breaking into your house shit their pants faster than the sound of a shotgun loading in the dark.

       One sound will, the sound of it going off within 20 feet. :)
      </p>

       Happens a lot at the shooting range, people coming to their lane... loading up... getting their target ready to go down range --
       <strong>
        BOOM
       </strong>
       . The guy in the lane next to them just shot his 12ga.... they poop a little bit.

       Yeah, the first time you hear a gun go off is amazing. It's way louder than the movies make it seem, even with really good ear protection. You can
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       it when they go off.

       There's always a new apocalypse or utopia on the horizon. The truth is its unlikely that there will be a drastic change any time soon, but change is real and it can happen so we should be ready.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal belief is that we won't start seeing major changes in governance until sometime between 2050-2100 when the ecological consequences of our actions really make our current course completely untenable, but it could easily happen sooner given the correct political circumstances.

       This is totally true, not only for America but to show the world it can be done, to inspire change that starts with the people and reaches the top. Those people, like you and me, need to be held accountable for their actions.
My only fear you could say, is that people don't do enough now to educate others and brake free of this system that has enslaved people into a routine of work and consumption followed by the "I work hard so I party hard attitude" "because I deserve it"... This mindset is poison for the public, everyone wants to fill their emptiness with materialistic things that they think will make them happy, for which they need to continue working at a job they hate, then instead of getting involved in their country's affairs, they watch a bunch of overpaid guys on skates beating the crap out of each other and they think that makes them patriotic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, in 5-10 years the skies will be filled with drones that could potentially eliminate a threat by only using their cellphone or much less. Robotics is getting really close to a humanoid robot, tptb won't even need brainwashed military personnel to carry out their dirty work, aside from their biological weapons, which I'm sure were created... Who knows, we could all already be infected, it's as easy as the common cold that gets passed around (think the game plague inc.), there's nothing to say we're not all infected with a dormant virus that could be triggered in many different ways (biological factors/electromagnetic waves) since the 40s/50s there has been a race for technological advancement, most of what they were working on then still hasn't been released, wonder what new things science has discovered that we have no fucking clue about. I know I went a little tinfoil mad hatter with this.... But it's not that far fetched.. And time... Were running out of it.

       This isn't a task for one person, or even a hundred. People need to join together to get something like that accomplished. Hopefully it could be solved by non violent protests and we could have a peaceful transition of power.

       Let's do the math:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         There's 205,000 subscribed to this worldwide subreddit.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         there's about 200 countries in the world
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         there are about ~1000 from each country on average
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         America has 50 United States.
        </p>
       </li>

       Therefore, there are around 20 of you in each state available for this revolution.

       Down vote him all you want but he's right. If you've been looking around more than a couple years you know that people have been "on the verge of revolution" for a long time now, and nothing happens, and nothing will happen until the government makes our daily lives unliveable. I want change just as much as the rest of you but this argument has been going on much longer than you think with no consequences. Now with the NSA development and Snowden you would think a spark would have ignited. Nope. Not yet.

       I don't know which ones he's mentioning but the ones I know of are 1) no bodies shown anywhere at anytime 2) no emergency personnel ever look rushed at any point or time 3) a lot of the parents of kids who were killed are actors.

       I forgot a few but one of the biggest problems with this whole hoax is that all of the videos showing evidence are pulled down or "debunked" by somebody putting up a video and talking about how they are wrong without actually disproving the inconsistencies.

       Another point that is odd about Sandy Hook - the school is demolished in apparent secrecy, one of the 'parents' interviewed is seen joking/laughing with other people immediately prior to the emotional interview of the loss of their child  (IIRC)

       But no one ever explains
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       the government would bother doing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       People keep saying gun control.  But there is never any gun control.  There isn't even a serious attempt at gun control.  Each year there are more guns in private hands in the US than the previous year.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't trust the government at all.  There are numerous things that they say that are impossible to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most recent big one is the Bin Laden assassination - where there are no witnesses, no photos, no corroborating evidence at all, and the first story they released was completely different from the final one.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you can certainly understand why the government would want to claim that they got Bin Laden - particularly if they in fact knew he was already dead (which would explain why we'd seen nothing from him in many years).
      </p>
      <p>
       But killing a bunch of kids?  Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's another point, and that's "the number of psychopaths involved".  I have no doubt that there are a lot of people at the top who are out and out psychos and have no idea of good and evil - BUT the majority of the people working in law enforcement
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       that they are doing the right thing "to protect the country".
      </p>
      <p>
       If Sandy Hook was a false flag, that means that literally thousands of people are in on it.  I'm sorry, I just don't believe that there are that many psychopaths all working together so efficiently.  People like kids - you're not going to be able to convince the average police officer, "Oh, we need to brutally murder all these children so we can use this to get gun control in."
      </p>
      <p>
       Massacres happen all the time, in countries all over the world.  This is another one.

       It just breaks my heart when people fall down the "I don't think it could be this way so it's not" slope. This is the strangest time to date in human history.

       And what if they weren't all psychopaths? What if all the people that were in on Sandy Hook were threatened? What if they all believed in the cause that they were told they were working for? What if they all believe this is some experiment to the highest degree and importance? I can keep going.

       I dont think any kids were killed at sandy hook..I think it was all theater. There wasnt a single injured survivor that came to the hospital that day. So we are to believe that Lanza killed 17 kids (forget the number) but didnt injure or graze a single survivor...  He must have been really good at Call of Duty.

       That "thousands of people" argument is such a wild exaggeration that it discredits itself. Also, by following the logic that thousands of people couldn't conspire, you admit that you think the holocaust never happened? (Oh but that's different)

       So you're saying in the hours following the massacre a reporter, in her rush to bring facts to the air, somehow got information wrong? Good god no, How is that possible? Definitely a first. If that's not a conspiracy I don't know what is.

      <p>
       so, lets say harvard journalism professor andrea mccarren made an honest mistake by saying the shooters mom was the kindergarten teacher. how exactly did that "mistake" happen?

       Well they are kids and their bodies weren't evan close to being fully developed. I'm sure a bullet would cause more damage to elementary schoolers than they would to a fully grown adult.  someone should look up statistics for the speed in which a pre-pubescent human would bleed out compared to a heathy adult.

       simple probability, somebody shooting x number of people in five minutes with the clock counting down, noise and smoke and screams and sirens arriving, no way they are going to be able to cleanly kill everybody they shoot at, they will miss and wound some.
      </p>
      <p>
       the sheer claimed fact of 26 dead and 2 wounded is proof of the BS. then the cops do the traiging, leave the bodies in the school for 36 hours, no attempt to get them to hospital. the cops don't have the legal authority to pronounce people dead or alive, only doctors have that right.

       Not .223, honestly. Sometimes it takes 5-6 rounds to take a grown Afghan down... AND I personally know of a SEAL who muzzle thumped a guy and it went INTO guy's skull. So.... unhealthy or unoptimized bodies sometimes take quite a few .223 rounds to take down too. Other mass shootings often have small children get wounded and survive.

       try googling 'bauman brothers' and look at the very silly picture one CT newspaper ran with. two people have redeye in the photo one doesn't.

      <p>
       letsrollforums had an arguing match with various people who claim to be buddies with some of the main actors at Boston, letsroll got sent or found a new photo of 'jeff' and his younger brother laughing/posing for the camera, 'jeff' looks the same age as the triple bauman brother photos does from ten years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       the guy with no legs at Boston was the veteran Vogt, 'jeff' is the post event 'jeff', lost both legs in a violent bomb blast and ten days later cavorting around at sports events waving flags , BS.

       There is a VERY strong contingent of people online that do NOT want the truth about this blackest of 'black ops' coming out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same group that refuses to even consider that 9/11 was nothing but ritual occult sacrifice by Israel and certain non-Jewish members of our own government.

       The Sandy Hook story falls apart in SO very many places...it almost makes me be ashamed to be American that so many of my own countrymen cannot or simply WILL NOT see it for what it is...a well-planned yet mistakenly executed operation to further the agenda of the anti-second amendment 'movement' that is currently taking place against American citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost EVERY infantryman, when confronted with simply the details of the story and the timeline can figure this out for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please read about the 'Port Arthur Massacre' for further details. I mean...Sandy Hook wasn't even an original story!

       Yeah, I agree that there was some outrageous stuff but personally, I am able to pick decent arguments [which still hold true] from ridiculous ones. If you want to get to the truth, you will encounter crap. What you can't do, is dismiss all for a bad statement. It is the sign of a bad investigator.

       I don't completely disagree, but seeing as we are just folks conversing on the Internet, if I see someone making profoundly crazy statements, I don't have the time to search through their shit to find the pearls. If I was a true investigator, perhaps, but they too get inundated with crazy bullshit and as such then a blind eye to any truth that might be buried therein. Which way it is up to us as responsible individuals to source our arguments well, with as impeccable a source/s as we can get. I work in an industry prone to wild claims from fanciful imaginations turning into "fact". To keep from dying because of that, I must do my homework in many different fields to keep shutting down the bullshit. We need to do the same so we can identify the real insidious shit that some assholes are perpetrating on us from the "Lizardmen run the White House!"

       Imagine the effect of 300+ million Americans have when they're all in the same mindset of grief, fear, and anger and what that does to reality in a way. Our minds apparently have an affect on the universe around us and or extra-dimensional entities sucking up these emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       So essentially they staged a huge tragic accident to get everyone thinking about the same emotion and offering these emotions to something outside our world for greater power / luck in this world.I don't know for sure however, but I wouldn't call it a mass sacrifice of humans if only 3000 or so died.

       So are we still on the Obama's-gonna-take-our-gunz thing? Or have we moved on to it-was-a-mind-control-experiment(maybe to take our guns later)? Hopefully the latter as it's just a tad less insulting to the victims  - but either way, get a grip folks.

       Hey there!  Are you a CT resident? I am.  Did you have to go and provide a thumb print for your legally purchased rifles yesterday and an affidavit for your standard capacity magazines or chance going to jail come next Wednesday? I did. By the way, all of my rifles were purchased legally after I went through a very rigorous process of getting my CCW (including fingerprinting).
      </p>
      <p>
       The line in Middletown was out the door for hours and hours (as it has been for weeks).  These measures will never prevent a mass shooting. Why? Because criminals don't care about gun laws, or any law for that matter. There is significantly more gun control in CT today than there was before Sandy Hook and it's getting worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they tried passing the gun laws last year, they had one of the largest turnouts ever to oppose it. And it was defeated as it was every year prior. Sandy Hook happens and they almost instantly pass the law (complete with legislators failing to read the bill).

       They've changed laws in some liberal states that already had comparatively strong laws to begin with. In contrast, many of the gun states loosened their regulations. So I guess they are just disarming these liberal northeastern states?

       Your initial links don't prove your thesis that mass shootings don't impact gun control in America- that has soundly been proven factually incorrect. Like your assertion that Watergate was solved by the government. Like your assertion that the motives for mind control projects would be easy to discern. Like all of your ever-changing premises. You said that mass shootings here, in America, haven't prompted gun control legislation. They have. No personal attacks, you're just wrong.

       Why not discuss the issue. I gave you more examples about gun control legislation enacted after the Aurora shooting, federal gun control legislation enacted due to the Virginia Tech Massacre, and CT passing the strictest gun control legislation in the country after Sandy Hook. Why don't you address the issue instead of saying I'm right about something I didn't say?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         In fact, if the gun debate is reignited after another massacre claimed 12 victims Monday at the Navy Yard in Southeast Washington, it will take place in a country with fewer restrictions on firearms than were in place a year ago.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Gun-control advocates had hoped to pass new legislation in states where Democrats control the legislature and governor’s office. But
        <strong>
         only a handful of blue states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland and New York — advanced substantive laws.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But gun-rights advocates have pushed new laws in about half the states to relax restrictions on concealed-carry laws. Legislators in Kansas and Missouri passed laws that would nullify federal gun legislation, although Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) vetoed his state’s version. And in Illinois, the only state that didn’t allow residents to carry concealed weapons, legislators overrode Gov. Pat Quinn’s (D) veto of a new concealed-carry law.
       </p>
       <p>
        A new Alaska law prohibits state and municipal agencies from implementing laws that would infringe on the Second Amendment and exempts some firearms from federal regulation. Several Arkansas laws expanded concealed-carry rules for liquor stores and churches (North Dakota concealed-carry permit holders may now also possess a gun in church). In Missouri, Nixon signed a bill to allow state employees to keep firearms in their vehicles on state property. Mississippi enacted a law that would extend concealed-carry permits to people ages 18 to 21.
       </p>
       <p>
        And several states — including Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia — passed laws that loosen restrictions on guns carried by school safety officials, steps similar to those advocated by National Rifle Association officials after the shooting in Newtown.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the local level, more than three dozen county and city governments have revised bans on guns in certain public places at the behest of the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun-rights organization based in Washington state.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year, the city of Oak Harbor, Wash., overturned a ban on guns in city parks. Carroll County, Md., overturned a ban on carrying a firearm at county landfills. Other jurisdictions have backed off gun bans in public places that don’t conform to preexisting state rules.
       </p>
       <p>
        “In the last several years, we’ve had a lot of state legislatures take a position that we think is pretty bright, that firearms legislation belongs in the hands of state legislatures so that you have uniform firearms laws from one end of the state to the other,” said
        <strong>
         Dave Workman, a senior editor of TheGunMag.com and communications director at the Second Amendment Foundation.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>

       One man's opinions don't equal reality. Your premise was that mass shootings don't prompt gun control laws. I showed you they prompted three countries to ban guns. Then you changed your premise to mass shootings don't prompt gun control laws in this country. I proved that to be incorrect- showing you federal legislation passed after Virginia Tech, laws passed as a reaction to Sandy Hook, and laws passed as a reaction to Aurora.
      </p>
      <p>
       Below you can read how, one month after Sandy Hook, the White House and State legislatures forged ahead with an agenda to- wait for it- strengthen gun control laws and penalties.

      <p>
       Your premise that mass shootings don't prompt gun control laws is false.

       I dunno, a senior editor of TheGunMag.com and communications director at the Second Amendment Foundation seems like pretty strong credentials for such an assertion to me. But really, what matters is the paragraphs above that quote which you probably didn't even read.

       My original premise was exactly as follows(see original post):
      </p>
      <p>
       Mass shootings in general do little to affect gun control policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is backed up by an extensive look at shootings in general across this country. We're not in Australia or Finland, so excuse me if the mind control shootings for gun control worked there(to preempt the totalitarian police states those nations have become) - they largely don't here.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is further supported by the fact that there was more
       <em>
        reduction
       </em>
       of gun control in the country as a whole in the year after Sandy Hook - the worst mass shooting in recent memory - than tightening of regulations.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And they failed on the federal level(which is kind of a shame given how widely the particular measure - background checks - was supported). A handful of strongly liberal states with already strict gun control tightened their own - are you surprised by this? I guess they didn't do enough mind controlled mass shootings in the rest of the country(maybe the other shootings mentioned in the above article, like the Ft Hood shooting after which no gun control legislation was even entertained in the state congress, were not mind control mass shootings).
      </p>
      <p>
       One has to wonder why, though, if they are capable of remote mind control that they don't simply have all gun owners in the country turn their guns in or shoot themselves. Or why they didn't make the shootings much worse? Surely that is within the realm of possibility and their own capabilities if they are capable and willing of staging mass shootings with mind control assailants in the first place(seems to be a foregone conclusion for some people).
      </p>
      <p>
       Never,
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       could we consider that, statistically speaking, mass shootings
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       happen in a country such as ours with a significantly large population and the highest gun ownership per capita(well, except for Yemen). No, it's the government using mind control to encourage us to give up our guns, because if there's one thing they're afraid of when they sick the military on us to kick off the totalitarian police state, it's pockets of armed civilians.

      <p>
       Was that a staged mind control shooting as well? Just curious. It appears to be more of a grab bag of gun regulation and repeal, just so you know:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After 23-year-old Virginia Tech student Seung Hui Cho killed 32 students and faculty members at the university in April 2007, then-Gov. Tim Kaine assigned a blue-ribbon task force to examine gun policies in the state. The task force made
        <strong>
         dozens of recommendations
        </strong>
        that, among other things, suggested that the state intensify background checks for gun purchasers, and ban firearm possession on college campuses.
        <strong>
         None of the recommendations became law.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         The most significant change in Virginia
        </strong>
        came two weeks after the shooting when Kaine signed an executive order requiring the names of all people involuntarily committed to mental health facilities to be provided to a federal database called the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. Licensed gun dealers are supposed to check the database before they sell anyone a gun.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         President George W. Bush subsequently signed federal legislation requiring all states to submit their mental health records to NICS, but to gain the support of the NRA, Congress agreed to two concessions. It made changes to the way the government defined who was "mentally defective," excluding people, for example, who had been "fully released or discharged" from mandatory treatment. The law also gave mentally ill people an avenue for restoring their gun rights if they could prove to a court that they had been rehabilitated. After the law passed, the NRA pushed state lawmakers to limit roadblocks for people applying to regain their rights.
        </strong>
        [this is the federal 'gun control' you're talking about]
       </p>
       <p>
        Virginia is particularly open to restoring peoples' gun rights.
        <strong>
         A 2011 New York Times investigation found that the restoration process in the state allowed some people to regain access to guns simply by writing a letter to the state. Others were permitted to carry guns just weeks or months after being hospitalized for psychiatric treatment.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         This past year the Virginia state legislature repealed a law that had barred people from buying more than one handgun per month
        </strong>
        — a law put in place because so many guns purchased in Virginia were later used in crimes committed in states with more restrictions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature also has made several changes to its gun permitting process.
        <strong>
         In March, the state eliminated municipalities' ability to require fingerprints as part of a concealed weapon permit application. The state used to require gun owners to undergo training with a certified instructor in order to get permits, but in 2009 it adopted a law allowing people to take an hour-long online test instead.
        </strong>
        Since Virginia adopted the law, the number of concealed handgun permits the state has issued increased dramatically and many of the permits were issued to people who live in other states where Virginia permits are accepted.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         In 2010, Virginia became one of five states to allow permit holders to carry concealed and loaded weapons into bars and restaurants.

       The issue is not black and white, though overall there seems to be less gun control today in VA than before the shooting. Let me know when horrendous mass shootings start increasing in frequency, and maybe I'll consider that the government is behind it - using mind control - to encourage the public to cry for more gun control. You're not making a strong case that this is what's happening. Good job poking some small semantic holes in my argument, though.

       Except any resource-rich state actor could, and they do.

The same goes for China and their own people's communications, vis-a-vis their "participation"(read: their own massive intranet) in the Internet-at-large.

       If the government had mind control techniques in the 60s and were planning to use them against its own citizens decades later - noone would have had bonafide proof of such things and it certainly would never have made its way on the Internet
       <em>

       - Church committee and the media or otherwise. Any attempt to discuss

        any

       sensitive subject at all would simply not occur on the Internet(unencrypted, anyways). We're talking about something that is simply of such magnitude for them
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to take similar measures. Please do some reading on how the Internet came to be. Do some reading on how it works. Watch that TED talk. I am not describing "those existing webpages have disappeared".
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally speaking, if the government was planning this grand scheme of rounding the populace up in camps(or whatever evil you think), we wouldn't be having this sort of discussion because
       <em>
        we'd already be in the camps
       </em>

God knows how many other discussions about and plotting against this supposed totalitarian nightmare that's ever-always-around-the-corner. This, to me, speaks to a lack of such a plot. When we're talking about an organization as powerful as the government, if you're actually
       <em>
        on

       to something as immense in scope and illegality as what you're suggesting, wouldn't you expect boots kicking in your door? But no, they wouldn't - it's easier to write it off as crazy talk, correct? Sure. But then we must arrive at the conclusion that either
       <em>
        you're right, and you've figured it all out
       </em>

       The government did have mind control techniques in the 60s. They were planning to use them against their own citizens. They did, in fact, use them against their own citizens. They were caught using them against their citizens, and this was brought to light in the 70s.

       The internet was a DARPA creation. That doesn't mean that DARPA has control over everything that is written on its creation. Likewise, TOR is a navy project, that doesn't mean that the Navy has access to all information exchanged on the network. They created it so that people all over the globe could use it for encrypted communications- it had to be done this way to ensure that their desired use of it could occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       TOR, was in fact, created for open-source intelligence gathering by the government.

       And, yes, NSA spying is pervasive. Is it not? If that were so undesirable for the (omniscient?) government to have spoken about, why don't they just censor it. DARPA creating the internet doesn't equal DARPA censoring whatever it wishes on the internet.

       DARPA could censor what's on the internet. As I've said before, it would prompt US citizens to demand answers if, suddenly, all information on mind control was
       <em>
        deleted from the internet

       . So, no that wouldn't be prudent at all.

       Let's first establish that not only can they do it

       but it's beyond censorship or shilling. This is
       <em>

       certainty. You have no idea what you're talking about here when it comes to the feasibility of such a thing. Your entire argument here also rests on the notion that there was undesirable speech in the first place and that it would be 'crushed' after the fact.

      <p>
       Secondly,
       <em>
        because

       the government created the Internet, they could have engineered it such that nobody could discuss or conglomerate theories and evidence of such a

       if it were even

      <p>
       Why didn't they? How are we having this conversation now? Let me guess, to write it off as crazy talk? At this point, if we are assuming that is the case, there are two options - you're right, you've figured it all out and no-one is listening, or the

       more likely scenario that

       Your premise, seems to be, that we must not be talking about a valid conspiracy because, otherwise, the government would censor it.

       Maybe they control the dissemination of sensitive information the best that they can, without blatantly censoring things. I think that information was never meant to be on the Army's website, but, due to human error, it was for a brief time.

       Alright, I guess you're right. They're using mind control agents to stage mass shootings so the populace gives up their guns. This is because the armed populace is the only thing keeping them in check, and mass shootings always directly(or even a majority of the time) lead to gun control. Seems legit.

       I haven't ignored any of your questions, but whenever you find yourself contradicted you put words in my mouth, start ranting about a totalitarian state/stockpiling arms, and, yes, dodge/ignore questions that prove your arguments lacking and inconsistent.

       You've ignored numerous questions and dodged perfectly valid points I make. You haven't stood up a solid case of your own, just poked semantic holes in my phrasing by treating it absolutely. You pretend that words are being put in your mouth, when the only reason this debate has carried on this far is because what I said is at least on some level what you believe.

        One has to wonder why, though, if they are capable of remote mind control that they don't simply have all gun owners in the country turn their guns in or shoot themselves. Or why they didn't make the shootings much worse? Surely that is within the realm of possibility and their own capabilities if they are capable and willing of staging mass shootings with mind control assailants in the first place(seems to be a foregone conclusion for some people).
       </p>
       <p>
        Never, ever could we consider that, statistically speaking, mass shootings will happen in a country such as ours with a significantly large population and the highest gun ownership per capita(well, except for Yemen). No, it's the government using mind control to encourage us to give up our guns, because if there's one thing they're afraid of when they sick the military on us to kick off the totalitarian police state, it's pockets of armed civilians.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Are you copying and pasting your responses? You're wrong about Yemen.
      </p>
      <p>
       This time the push for federal gun control laws after a mass shooting was unsuccessful. It was, however, successful in the past- after a mass shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's been a response for gun control legislation after every mass shooting. It's a guaranteed response from the public after a mass shooting. It doesn't always succeed in getting new gun control laws passed, but it often does- it did in Aurora, it did in Sandy Hook, it did on a national level after Virginia Tech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, it is, indisputably, true that mass shootings affect gun control policies in America.
      </p>

       EDIT- notice, also, I have reams of supporting articles from reputable news sources, and you have one from propublica.

       Lol...no. Colorado is a liberal state with already strict gun control? They tightened theirs
       <strong>
        in response to the mass shooting.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The one article you keep citing discusses the year since Sandy Hook and gives a man's
       <strong>
        undocumented opinion
       </strong>
       about the change in gun control laws
       <strong>
        in that year.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the impact mass shootings have had in years prior, such as the last federal gun control legislation that was passed
       <strong>
        due to a mass shooting?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you positing that gun control has become more and more lax in the past fifty years? Of course it hasn't. Gun control is being restricted more and more, and legislation is demanded after mass shootings.

       Just because that school had cctv does not mean that any or all of them happened to be recording at that time,or that they even could record.My wife works in a local high school that is filled with cctv cameras.she said there are over 150 of them through out the school.they do not have 150 separate monitors and recorders,one for each cam.

       Um, you brought up the port arthur massacre as an example of increase gun control after a mass shooting. They now have very strict gun laws as a result. Do they live in a police state now though? No. Do they have dramatically less gun violence? Yes.

       Mass shootings largely do not change gun control laws in

       The truth about Australian gun control being a success is largely exaggerated and inflated. Gun-related violence was already on the decline, just as it has been here in America too since 1993.

       This is strictly about law-abiding citizens having their right to bear arms infringed. Yes, I know the 2A doesn't exist in Australia, but the point is that when this is deprived, crime thrives. This is occurring in Sydney for the same reasons it occurs in Chicago -- gangbangers. No laws in the world are going to disarm those thugs, but the people become defenseless.

       There is no data that proves gun control works, but there's a lot of data that proves it does not work (Clinton-era ban to name just one).

       You're not an Australian, I can see, because you wouldn't be spouting all this BS about Australia if you were.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have some ridiculous idea that Sydneyers were walking around with handguns until the ban, and then suddenly they're all defenseless and being preyed upon by criminals.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        This is completely wrong.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Australia has always had gun control - there's no second amendment there (I live in NYC now).  In the cities, gun ownership has always been rare, and carrying has always been extremely rare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, there isn't any sort of crime wave going on in Sydney.  Sydney is a safe city - there are rough neighborhoods, sure, but nothing like in, say, DC or LA.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please
       <em>
        stop

       I was not saying that Australia is a bad place, nor Sydney. My point was just that the gun control push after the Port Arthur massacre was not nearly as effective as everyone from outside Australia tries to make it seem. Gun violence continues to be a problem, and Sydney seems to be a hotspot compared to the rest of the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nearly every time gun control gets brought up, Australia is mentioned as if it's the shining star of the world and great example of what gun control can accomplish. Simply put, the results were not that dramatic at all and it was already on the decline. Not to mention suicides were also factored into gun-violence, which skewed the stats.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is very simple and Thomas Jefferson put it best:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Laws that forbid the carrying of arms . . . disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes . . . Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.”

       Right, because there is no one in high positions of power continuously working on that. And yes, in New York and California they are slowly chipping away at "gun rights". Just because it doesn't happen in one fell swoop, doesn't mean those aren't the intentions of those "in power".

       So in response to your question about what it achieves? I agree that gun control would be a failure as the goal, because it was as of yet ineffective. But where it was effective was in the level of fear it gave people... They LOCKED DOWN boston after the marathon bombing in order to find an UNARMED teen, and while doing so stripped people of guns and drugs in UNLAWFUL search and seizure. This, in my opinion, is a direct result of the increased fears of young men with guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I noticed that with every school shooting, mall shooting, public shootings in general, that we're seeing heavily armed police forces more and more prominently. So I don't think the agenda is simply to take guns from people, I think it's to make it so people feel comfortable letting their police force become an army.

       I'm with you there to an extent. I'm firmly against the militarization of police. However I personally disagree as to why it's happening. I don't see the bad things that happen such as Sandy Hook as faked to that end. Regular people do bad things, even on that scale. I think there are multiple reasons for police becoming more militarized, part of which has to do with public perception of the danger to their person. But I don't think Sandy Hook contributed as much to that, as, say, the Boston bombing you mention. In fact it had quite the opposite effect for a lot of people, who think see this as a further reason to always be armed.

       I don't disagree, but why do you think there's been so much confusion and concealment in this case? I've entertained the idea that it's as they say and I still can't understand why I haven't seen a shot of Adam Lanza like I did the two guys in the Boston Marathon bombings. Although I have wondered if maybe the police shot and killed him, and in the process possibly injured or killed a few of the victims. No conspiracy really, just incredible misconduct that involves children and therefore must be kept quiet? I hate not having enough facts to build a concrete understanding of what happened. Anyway, let me know what you think, it's always interesting to hear why someone thinks there's no conspiracy and I'm interested.

       Well, where is the bar set for confusion in a case? Given that law and that the CT AG took special steps to safeguard the privacy of the families, I don't think there's really any concealment with the case going on. The news media
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       gets things wrong with tragedies like this. There is no time to prepare, and it's kind of disgusting but they
       <em>
        are

       As far as why there are images of the Boston bombers, I think that probably had something to do with it being a public event and the ensuing manhunt. I guess, in brief, my qualms here are with the conspiracy theories people are proposing and the sense of entitlement they have to photographic or video evidence. The only reason there are people asking "where are the images" is because people are convinced that their guns are going to be taken away and they want proof that something this terrible could occur. There's only a handful of new gun laws - almost all in pretty liberal states with harsh gun control already - since the shooting that actually ban(and confiscate) certain types of guns. Conversely almost twice the number of changes to the laws actually were loosening the regulations. Noone asked "where is the evidence" and cooked up these awful theories when a man shot dead 67 people, mostly teenagers, on an island in Norway - because they weren't concerned it would be used as political fuel to impact their "right" to own guns.

       Turns out the Port Arthur Massacre in Australia looks like a false flag hoax, designed with the intent of gun confiscation. This obviously pre-dates Obama and shows that the gun grabbing agenda spans many administrations and extends beyond just America.

       I like the part where Obama brought in kids and used them as stage props for his photo op as Obama informed me that these poor kids deserve a vote on my constitutional rights. I was especially moved by Obama's fake tears. This is the same playbook they used in Port Arthur Australia, but not with the same results, yet.

       To hit New England and CT in particular is interesting because it's deemed to be one of the safest places to live. It's a wealthy state(the gap in the income of its residents is one of the largest however) and it unites New England and NYC(tristate area). I know after the shooting happened that it shook New England to the core, because we all saw CT as so safe and it failed in that regard. That means it could happen to anyone, even us. So if it was a false flag, the bombing that followed months later that caused a lockdown would make the choice of CT masterful. Because now we know that terror gives the police unbridled control.

       Please CT is far from being considered "safe" or even the picture of "safe" here in New England. CT is considered as the 2nd cousin who no one hears from and is suspected to be in the mob. Only reason it even is considered "safe" by the media is because of all the rich folk that life there from NY.

       There was recently a fake shooting incident in Des Moines Iowa where the lone gunman "outgunned" the 100 police that showed up to the scene. (Yeah right)

       Also, the fake victim/ false witness who was allegedly shot said that he saw the shooter out pointing his gun, but just "assumed" the guy was shooting blanks, because that would be a rational assumption under the circumstances?

       Such lack of imagery makes me suspicious. No surveillance footage of Lanza simply holding a gun on school grounds, that I have seen. The lack of such an image leads me to see the warpigs &amp; politicians as untrustworthy @ best.

       Gore is part of forensics &amp; often leads to closure with perceived factual certainties. I comprehend blacking out the faces of victims, but why is such protective care afforded to the killer few seem to have any care for. It does not add up to me.

       Why is it we got to see the Columbine killers bodies, lumped together on the ground where they died? We saw THEM. Just type "columbine killers" into google and boom, right there in google image. What makes this different? Why in the hell can't we see Adam Lanza? Seriously I do not understand this. There is no reason to show the columbine killers then and not adam lanza now.

       The public's right to know information should outweigh families concern over death photos being released. Redacted information is never, ever a good thing.  We as people arent looking for protection, we are looking to keep them honest. It is our right to keep them honest, but they have formed these walls to stop us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see absolutely no evidence that anyone is dead from the photos they showed us. NO EVIDENCE.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see no evidence that someone killed other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I see are pictures of rooms in a house, exterior pictures of a school with some bullet holes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fuck does that prove? Show us at least that this is real. That people WERE killed, that the person accused IS dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me its scary that what they showed can be considered enough. It happened over a year ago and this is all we get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, even with all the Kennedy bullshit at least we got an autopsy photo of his head. We got autopsy photos of the guy who killed him. But we dont get one fucking picture of Adam Lanza? Thats some bullshit.

       They don't want the public to pour any brain power into this farce.  So they release the "crime scene" photos, then quickly bury/downvote them.  It is all designed to make people go, "Gross, why would anyone wanna see pictures of dead kids.  ewww.  Go put your tinfoil hat on sicko...".  Meanwhile no one is asking the most important question of all.

       Roughly 2/3rds of the changes to gun regulations after sandy hook were loosening regulations... but yeah, heaven forbid in some liberal northeastern states you have to register firearms. False flag induced totalitarianism, and the Internet conspiracy community has it figured out.

       Why blame the internet conspiracy community when history has shown time after time, registration precedes confiscation?

       Do you believe any criminal will ever voluntarily show up register his firearm? And if not, why bother innocent citizens with it?

       If a mass murder was committed, the police would round up all the legally registered downers to interview while the illegal gun owner who never bothered got away.  Does that sound like a solution to you?

       I guess they are just trying to disarm the populace then, because the current armed populace is the only thing stopping the police state, martial law, concentration camps, barcodes, slave labor, etc, that they are so obviously starving for.

       I'll give an answer, but it's worthless because I'm pretty sure the military could handle ragtag groups of civilians if that was the goal. Despite our losses, they don't seem to be having much trouble in Afghanistan - the populace of which not only has experience fighting an invading organized military but is better armed and has even more inhospitable terrain to their advantage. We've utterly dominated the country and decimated the insurgency. It's barely a fraction of what it was shortly after the invasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is yes. Of course it would be! My question is,
       <em>
        do you foresee that coming?
       </em>
       Then stock up on guns and ammo to your hearts content. Personally I don't see the government as frothing at the bit to enact martial law and round everyone up in camps. Instead I see agencies overstepping their bounds by attempting to do the
       <em>
        impossible
       </em>
       mission we as citizens have demanded of them - 'ending' 'terrorism'.

       Okay, it sounded like you were implying that 20 children were killed so that the government can justify taking everyone's guns so that they're powerless to stop martial law and barcodes and concentration camps and whatever other evil shit. My mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to be clear, I'm not for many of the proposed gun control regulations. There are a few that are worth looking into IMO, but things like magazine limits and limiting certain types of weapons(mostly based on what they look like) are flawed. Most of the country has a long history of safe use of firearms. I think what you are saying is entirely fair, though personally I don't mind an additional layer of paperwork if it saves lives(which remains to be seen conclusively).

       With the
       <em>
        massive
       </em>
       kneejerk reaction to 9/11, I'd say so. Do you remember what it was like afterwards? Whether or not you believe
       <em>
        that

       event was staged, the majority of the populace was just peachy with the increased security in the years following it. I think there is a silver lining to the cloud, however:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The NSA revelations have sparked a strong national dialogue on government overreach in the name of preventing "terrorism". This has also reginited interest in whether or not the methods of preventing "terrorism" are actually fueling the fire more than snuffing it out.

         <em>
          rejects

         kneejerk reactionary legislation. See the states that did not change or actually loosened their gun regulations(the majority of the country).

       It seems you think spying on citizens will somehow protect us against mote terrorism.... what if we stopped attacking other countries without provocation? Do you think THAT might work to slow terrorism better than say the NSA recording every call you or I make?

       To address your other question, if 9/11
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       staged, which certainly the vast majority of the country and the military thinks it was not, then why
       <em>
        wouldn't
       </em>
       snooping be one of the facets of preventing it from occurring again? It just logically follows, doesn't matter if we approve of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, do I think NSA spying is good? No, it has undermined international confidence in our mutual respect(though it should be noted that every developed country spies on every other one and that's why it wasn't such a shocker to most other developed nations' governments). It has hurt our technology industry already, but we've only seen the tip of the iceberg there.

       I'm always skeptical of someone when they say "the majority of the country" since polls are conducted by biased news sources so what the majority of us thought is unknown. But even with the most sophisticated snooping, all it would bring is advance warning that an attack was going to occur... and we had that with9-11...advance warning that an attack was imminent and we STILL sent planes out of the country for "practice drills"
      </p>

       We are are a republic... a nation of laws. Show me where the bankers who rigged LIBOR and other rates were arrested and imprisoned, like some pot dealers, instead of fined a minimum of money for their crimes. We are not a nation of laws any longer.... and a snooping government is just the next step... it is not about protection,it is about control.

       IIRC, the LIBOR investigations aren't even over. It's something that will take years. There is also that new, bigger price fixing scandal that just came up. I agree that we will not see appreciable accountability for these crimes(at least, compared to the money they made from them). However, I don't subscribe to the belief that "we're poor because they're rich".

       Vastly different circumstances and from what I understand the majority of people who died did so as a result of the fire...? Violent crime overall was on downward trend since before then, anyways. I say Sandy Hook is the worst given that 20 children were mowed down in their Kindergarden classroom, whether or not you believe that actually happened the fact remains that we have
       <em>
        less

       gun control in this country a year later.

       They don't want anyone to harass the families, given what most of the families went through when people started grasping at straws, connecting imaginary dots, and arrived at the conclusion that they are all fake crisis actors. People did some really sick things to the victims' families because they truly believed they're not real.

       From what I've read from the documents there is more than enough information to debunk most of the Sandy Hook conspiracy theories though, so that probably explains why we're hearing nothing from the usual sources.

       Okay so why haven't we seen one picture of Adam inside the school? Why were there at least 4 different gun reports all different? Why did he do it? Who is Christopher Rodia? Who was the guy caught on camera running into the woods? Why did no one that didn't get shot see him? Was he some kind of master marksman? Why did we only see one small group of kids coming out of the buildings? Where was all the chaos? Why did Robbie Parker or whatever his name is laugh and smile before giving a speech about his daughters death on the same fucking day? How did he get in the school? Why did they report that his mother was a school teacher when she wasn't? Why were first responders told not to go in? I could go on and on and I'm sure you will "debunk" some of that but I have never seen every one of those things explained or debunked with any kind of factual information.

       The man running into the woods was a father trying to get his child. There are numerous articles stating this. I can't answer why Mr. Parker was laughing. Maybe someone told a joke? Maybe he's an asshole? Either way a laugh is nowhere near evidence of a cover up and the fact that it is brought up so much shows how pathetic the theories about Sandy Hook are.

       A man who was given a citation in Greenwich for a parking violation when the massacre began. Again, this is what I mean by "evidence of nothing." Someone heard his licence plate being read on Greenwich PD's police scanner while Newtown was happening, therefore he's part of a conspiracy. The frequency his name was mentioned on wasn't even the Newtown Police's frequency, it was Greenwich's. RadioReference and other websites that operate SDRs group multiple police department's frequencies together. That report came in from GREENWICH's police frequency, NOT Newtown's.

       Grief. Shock. This is where the "crisis actor" shit falls apart. People who have zero understanding of psychology and the grief process go into these videos with a flawed understanding of human behavior in times like this.

       News media rushing to be the first to break the news, as has been mentioned several times. The problem with using inconsistencies in media reporting as evidence of a conspiracy is that you assume everything the media says is 100% factual in the first place. Guess what, they're a business, and they frequently report incorrect information during crisis situations in the rush to be the first ones to report it.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's probably because you reject the logical factual information you're given, and most of the points you mentioned are flawed, incorrect, or fabricated. You're so hellbent on truly believing Newtown was a conspiracy that you're incapable of thinking about anything for yourself, you let these alternative news blogs shove misinformation down your throat and don't even question it.

       Are you really rejecting objective facts that challenge your world views? Over half of those are objective FACTS that have been PROVEN. The rest is just common sense (ie "why didn't we see lots of kids leave the building??? because they were already outside duh")

       That doesn't explain why there were NEVER ANY PICTURES OF THEM COMING OUT only that ONE picture of a TINY group of kids. Just because they were hiding at one point in time does not make it impossible for them to walk out of the door and for a news reporter to take a picture of it.

       Sorry but the "father trying to get his child" explanation is ridiculous.  Also, why would he say "I didn't do it" unless he knew what "it" was that he was denying doing?

      <p>
       Also, Harvard Journalism professor Andrea McCarren should have known better than to tell her tall tale about Sally Cox and the shooters mom being teacher at Sandy Hook.

       If the man running into the woods was, in fact, a father of a student, he was a little bitch. I wouldn't be running away, I'd be running towards the school. But him bring a bitch doesn't prove anything towards a conspiracy.

       It is used to make the public think that the alleged gunman has a link to the school.  Such passionate responses are NEVER seen when there is no association what so ever to the school, students, or teachers.  The event is clearly fiction.  This is the reason why no solid evidence has or will be released.

       Well, i'm a highly-paid shill, but the report that she was a teacher came from her neighbors. It only reveals how little they knew of her because she was simply a part-time volunteer. There was a ton of inaccurate info that cane from neighbors and Lanza's classmates because they could be contacted immediately by reporters. The truth is the Lanzas were intensely private, which no one seems to dispute. So the reporters talked to people who didn't know them at all and ran with it.
The thing is all this early bad reports are paraded around here as evidence of...what, I don't know, the "real" story leaking out? Meanwhile, I can come in here and say I met a victim or I see people I know or know of in here recounting their personal knowledge of this tragedy and you oafs think we're being paid to take your abuse.

       Why haven't we seen one picture of Adam Lanza in or anywhere NEAR Sandy Hook? That's all i'm asking for. Show me him inside the school or outside of the door holding an assault rifle and I will shut the fuck up about the entire thing. But you know what? We will never see those photos even though they supposedly had just spent thousands of dollars upgrading their security system. Wonder why that is.

       If you've seen the photos, it's pretty clear that he shot his way through the door. I live 20 minutes from Newtown and my Dad's secretary had to take time off last year because her sister was a teacher there and made the first 911 call. It happened. The kids were 7 and younger. They tried to hide in bathrooms. Some ran. Most cried and huddled. They were BABIES. Remember, they aren't trained to react in situations like that.

       What does that have to do with what I posted? I never said anything about how the kids acted inside the building I just said that we never saw but ONE pictures of about 12 kids being led out in a group. Why is that? Why weren't parents allowed to see their children's bodies? They were just shown pictures of their faces.  Why were first responders told not to go inside? Where were all the ambulances and chaos?

Why did we only see one small group of kids coming out of the buildings? Where was all the chaos? Why did Robbie Parker or whatever his name is laugh and smile before giving a speech about his daughters death on the same fucking day? How did he get in the school? Why did they report that his mother was a school teacher when she wasn't? Why were first responders told not to go in? I could go on and on and I'm sure you will "debunk" some of that but I have never seen every one of those things explained or debunked with any kind of factual information.

       Of course parents saw the bodies of the children. They didn't let the parents run into the school to hold the bloodied bodies in their arms, of course.  They removed the bodies from the scenes and immediately had them examined so that they could be given to the parents for funerals. Considering that several of those funerals were extremely high profile affairs (receiving national news coverage), you have to be pretty ignorant of what transpired since the shooting to claim parents never saw the bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why we don't post bodies of dead children on the internet, it's done, when possible, to protect their families from having people use those photos in unsavory ways.  Considering there is zero public value to releasing such photos, withholding them when possible makes sense to me.  In any case, if there were thousands of people (fire fighters, police officers, FBI agents, ATF agents, emt responders, emergency room staff, medical examiner staff, school employees, teachers, children, their parents, extended families, etc.) all faking this event, I doubt it would have been hard to just fake photos  and release them.  In the shadow of such a huge and complicated conspiracy, it seems the photos, released by the same officials you are accusing of playing a role within the conspiracy, should not prove anything to you at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: if you do not know who Chris Rhodia is, then that just shows that you don't care at all about the hard evidence.  The emergency responder audio where he is mentioned has been publicly available for over a year.  Why haven't you listened to it?

       There is no value in truth and transparency? 26 and 2 was the kill to injury ratio. One of those injured was from a ricochet and the other is unidentified as is the nature of their wounding. For all intents an purposes... this event looks like it was done by a trained and conditioned individual. The wound pattern on the kids bodies could clear that up.

       You really think it is hard to kill children with a gun? The lanzas were gun enthusiasts with plenty of practice shooting the guns. Little kids arent going to fight back, and will most likely just freeze and cry if you point a gun at them.

       There is zero value to redundant information, yes.  What new information do you believe to exist in the photo of bullet-ridden corpses?  It's not like there is any controversy among the medical professionals who examined them as to their cause of death.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the kill-to-injury ratio, what the hell is that?  Some metric you made up just now?  What's its significance?  Do you think it matters that he was targeting six-year olds at close range?
      </p>
      <p>
       Turning to a statistic that is more relevant to the question of how well-trained Lanza was, do you know how many shots Lanza fired to accumulate that number of casualties, the majority of which, let's not forget, were defenseless children shot at very close range?  (Hint: the answer is in the summary report as well as the full one.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: for posterity's sake, I'll just note that Lanza fired 156 shots.  Not a very efficient killer of small children at close range after all.

       Considering Ive seen manourished and inbred Iraqi kids get blown the fuck up and keep on living... I think it kinda doesnt matter. And what about the 6 adults? he went 6 and 2 on adults and one of those 2 he was hit by ricochet so he REALLY went 6 and 1 on adults....

       156/26=6
6 rounds per kill is about what I was doing in Iraq... as a trained airborne infantryman in close quarters. We also have to subtract for the 6 rounds fired to breech, the ones fired seemingly randomly into cars in the parking lot, and the suicide round. Ill bet it was more like 4 rounds per kill of the ones the shooter actually aimed for.

       And you're right, it is absurd to think that seeing a approx. 6-9 yr old survive being inside the kill radius of an IED made out of 2 155 ARTILLERY SHELLS was equivalent.... cause it's plying the super bowl while Lanza's act is tuggin' it's tiny pud under the bleachers of the local high school in off season.

       The few kids who ran survived. You haven't even read the summary report if you think he was shooting kids who were running.  They were cowering together in groups and under desks when he shot them multiple times at close range.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that he had to be some sort of professional soldier to accomplish this attack is mind blowingly absurd.  There is no parallel to professional soldiers fighting militant, weapon-wielding adults in locations well-known to those adults.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that analogy is what you are going to hang your hat on to accuse thousands of people of being conspirators in an ineffective government plot to enact marginally more restrictive gun control regulations (note that we failed to even return to the AWB that was in place under Clinton), then there is probably nothing I can tell you that will make you see the absurdity of what you are saying.

       You probably dont have a clear understanding of what a trained and untrained shooter are capable of. Again, COMPARE IT TO OTHERS. Anders had over an HOUR to rampage on an isolated island and still killed less than he injuredand those kids didn't fight back. Cho WENT BACK to classrooms he had already slaughtered in, continued rampaging and STILL killed less than he injured in TWICE the time that Lanza did his work. Lanza, in 5 minutes, HITS EVERYONE HE SHOOTS AT KILLING ALL BUT ONE OF THE PEOPLE HE ACTUALLY TRIED TO KILL INCLUDING MANY LARGE HEALTHY ADULTS IN A LOCATION WELL KNOWN TO THOSE ADULTS.

       And, again, only one or those incidents involved shooting 156 rounds with a semi automatic weapon at shocked six-year olds at close range in closed-off spaces.  Yes, it was not like the others.

       Edit: btw, since you--a professional soldier--could, according to your own anecdote, achieve the same hit ratio when fighting trained adult militants in their native land, you have made a far stronger case than I that lanza's attack, in its context, was not carried out by a professional.

       Lol, you are grasping at straws.  There is zero comparison between shooting children from six feet away and engaging in gun fights with armed militants in the battleground where those militants operate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lanza's attack was differents because he planned it to be different. He studied all the other attacks you mention (and others) and made improvements to ensure maximum fatalities.  The biggest of those improvements was he decided to target six year olds in their school rooms.  None of the other shooters you mentioned did that.  And, after firing 156 rounds of semiautomatic fire into groups of those six year olds, his plan proved successful.

       Yake away "6 yr olds" and Cho did JUST that.... and also went BACK to rooms and kept killing folk, AND had twice as long as Lanza to rampage AND was using a superior round to kill people with in CQB environments(9mm Hollow point vs. .223 FMJ) AND injured more than he killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       156 rounds is about right at 6 rounds per target for me. I would keep pulling the trigger til they stopped moving, which takes a few .223 FMJ rounds to do.

      <p>
       Re Cho, yes, adults are far harder to kill than children.  Not just because adults had more attuned self preservation skills and instincts, but because their bodies can survive far more trauma.  Cho still managed to kill more people than Lanza, despite targeting adults and using far less powerful weapons, due to the amount of time he had to revisit rooms.

       And Cho killed 32 adults. Lanza, using a far more powerful weapon, killed only 6. Wtf is your point?  Now you are admitting that the childrens' deaths are not evidence of Lanza's professional bona fides, but claim only his adult kills were?  Your reasoning has now evolved into something completely different from what it was when you started.  You are making this up as you go.

       And you still haven't answered my question.

      <p>
       Edit: for the sake of clarity let's go through those 6 deaths and 2 injuries of adults.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Lanza first shot into the school, four adults in a meeting room near the door came out into the hallway.  Lanza shot 16-17 rounds at them from about 12-15 feet away, killing two and injuring two.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other four adults killed were trapped in the classrooms with the children he targeted. At least two of them died actively trying to shield the children from bullets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which of these kills do you think proves Lanza was a professional, exactly?

       Lol, ok, it would take you 6 shots per six-year old?  I knew the armed forces were hurting in recruitment, but I didn't realize how bad it had gotten.  (And you do realize this claim, again based on your own anecdote, is you claiming it would be just as difficult to shoot trapped six year olds from a few feet away as it was for you to shoot armed adult militants in various areas of Iraq. You are the most disingenuous person I have ever had the displeasure of arguing with on here.)
      </p>
      <p>
       As to how I know where he fired the shots from, it's because, unlike you apparently, I actually read the investigation report which notes, in excruciating detail, where they found the bodies and the casings.  If you read that report, by the way, you'd know the the sandy hook elementary school video system was only a live feed system. It didn't record anything.  But keep on showing your ignorance on that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to whether Cho's 9mm was more deadly because of the bullets he used, if you truly spent any time with guns, you would know the muzzle velocity and bullet size of the rifle make it far more damaging.  Are you joking with this this shit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, you ignored the question about which of those adult kills proves he had to be a professional. Which one was it and why?

       HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH its a .22 cal vs a .30 cal. Also, kenetic energy transference is a big deal. If you can get the bullet to stop INSIDE a person then you transfer all the energy of the bullet into them... THIS IS WHAT HOLLOW POINTS DO. .223 FMJ is gonna be ripping through, leaving ice pick sized holes and not transferring much energy where as 9mm Hollow Point will be like shoving nickles into a persons chest at slightly above the speed of sound and then dumping ALL that energy in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       You obviously don't know much about guns and it's cut that you think you do. I've actually done this, kiddo... I was an infantryman in the 82nd airborne and then a private military contractor. I have IN REAL LIFE, see what BOTH .223(actually it's more powerful cousin 5.56x45mm NATO) and 147gr 9x19mm Hydra Shok do to a REAL HUMAN BODY.... 9mm is the better round for CQB.

       Re the weapons, yes, hollow points can transfer more energy.  But, again, you are ignoring the context: the targets for the attack were six year olds bundled tightly in groups and shot at close range.  Having just one "ice pick" thick hole torn through a body is much more likely to kill a six year old than it would be an adult.  Your anecdotes from your time in Iraq are not medical observations.  It is well known that a gunshot wound to a child is far more likely to be fatal than a gunshot would to an adult.  There is no comparing the two as you have so ineptly tried over and over.  (
       <a href="http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/8301">
        http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/8301
       </a>
       )  For Lanza's purposes, having the rounds stop in the first child struck would have been counter productive.  He was shooting into a group of children, mostly huddled together.  The rifle shots could have easily gone through multiple children, inflicting far more damage than a hollow point and ensuring the "high kill" number you find so puzzling. (Or are you just talking about the adults again, because you keep changing it every other post?)  In any case, I already explained the death of the adults and you had nothing to say about it.  In general, more powerful gun = much more damage in the context of Sandy Hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Returning to the "insanely high" kill rate--you cannot even begin to articulate a reason why, given the events outlined in the report, only a professional could have achieved it.  But, ah, you recognize that, don't you?  So now you are just trying to casually dismiss the report (which it is still glaringly obvious you have not read--so what are you basing your "professional" opinion on, again?) for lack of pictures.  If you read at the level of a 1st grader and need pictures to help you, then I feel sorry for you.  But, if you actually read the report, you'd realize that there are many pictures in it.  And where the pictures are redacted according to CT state law, they include extremely detailed descriptions of their contents.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the report is the joint work of multiple law enforcement agencies and was created with the testimony of over a hundred witnesses and dozens of experts.  There will never be a more definitive and thorough account of what happened in that school.  If it contradicts some other report (which you have not even cited), then that other report is wrong.  And, another by the way, the report includes ALL of the various police reports made in connection with the incident, from the moment it happened until the investigation was completed.  There are hundreds of them.  Go ahead and find your coveted contradiction in any of that and you'll actually have something more than your ignorance and lack of critical thinking to support your theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what does it matter?  You haven't even read the summary report.  You are just a broken record repeating a baseless (and ever-changing) theory that only someone with professional training could have achieve the number of fatalities that Lanza did.  And all you have to do in order to make it sound good in your head, apparently, is close your eyes and ignore the facts of what actually happened.  You still don't even seem to see the absurdity of claiming that it is just as hard to kill trapped six-year olds at close distance as to kill adult militants in a war zone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Six shots per kid, right, hawk eye?  Please tell me you are no longer wasting my tax dollars in the military.

       No, because there is no other event where an untrained individual has had an even similar kill/injury ratio.  Never.  Not one aingle time in history has this been seen.

Anders had over an hour on that island to rampage, was on steroids and ephedrine, and had cultivated a aggressive mentality and worked out and trained to a level Lanza didnt even touch.... and he STILL killed less than he injured.

        Because a "trained and conditioned individual" is going to shoot in some very specific way? What way would that be?

       Grouping size is a great indication of training level. Shit aint rocket surgery.

       At least they provided the redacted information chart with coded reasons as to why certain information was redacted.  There are still plenty of pictures that are not redacted. 
- My Personal "Smoking Gun" - 
5 bullet holes in and around the exterior wall/window of the special education room. Up-close photos of the area show that at least one of the shots appears to originate from outside the school. 
I'm still digging through the info, but it seems there may have been an exchange of gunfire before the gunman died. - I'm saying COVER-UP.

       I live 20 minutes from Newtown and my dad's secretary, Christine, has a sister that worked there AND made the first 911 call. She isn't an actor. Sandy Hook isn't some fucking conspiracy, it's a sick tragedy. A mentally deranged young man who was obsessed with school shootings to the point where he made Excel spreadsheets shot a bunch of 5-year-olds dead. If the government wants to take your guns away they will, they don't need to stage a shooting at an elementary school to make it happen.

       Its funny how many people jump out of the woodwork with such lies and pleas for emotion, yet offer no evidence.  They act as though the truth should not be released or discussed.  Truth is all that matters in a time like this.  Your attempt at limiting the discovery of truth is highly suspect.

       LOL so was Columbine a false flag, too? Why don't they stage a mall-shooting or hostage situation like in Kenya's Westgate mall then, if it's all to "take away your guns". The United States is one of the largest arms suppliers in the world. Doubt they're going to stop making or selling them anytime soon. Educate yourself.

       Funny that you bring up Columbine...That event was over 14 years ago. BEFORE anyone had smart phones. BEFORE HD cameras were prominent..and yet we have more hard evidence of that event than of shootings in the past couple of years. (Sandy Hook and the Aurora Theater shootings specifically) Regarding Columbine, we have VIDEO FOOTAGE of the shooters. We also have 911 calls with guns firing and glass breaking in the background with legitimately frightened sounding people. We know literally everything of that event. Now..Regarding the more recent shootings: There are NO videos of the shooters or pictures showing that the shooter was in fact who the media says it was in the act. The 911 calls from both events are clearly actors and do not sound legitimately frightened at all...Now don't you think if you saw a group of people get murdered right in front of you that you would be panicking? Isn't it strange that in an age of HD surveillance and smart phones we have LESS hard evidence of these events than of Columbine?

       Actually they attempted that in an Oregon mall last year. It was thwarted by a citizen with a gun. That's why it is not heard about, not media worthy.

       Nothing which is "officially" released will shed any light on what actually happened at Sandy Hook.
      </p>

       But Sandy Hook threads will always attract shills and "skeptics" to reassure you that the official/media narrative is all true, even when it is self-contradictory, and that anybody who doubts it is deranged.

       Subjects are brought up all the time in passing.  You pick up a Sandy Hook cover whole waiting in life and mutter to your partner how the entire thing is a sham.  The person on front of you agrees and orders further evidence to this fact.

       I'm sorry for your lost but when it comes to Sandy hook related shit on here people seem to go off the deep end for some reason. Hell someone on here even thinks that the town it's self is fake because they visited one day and couldn't find a lot of people.

       I don't have any theories on Sandy Hook. I do, however, know that it is and always has been a real town. I live about 10 miles away and work just a few miles down rt. 34 from it.
That said, I now know my plinking rifle is now an assault rifle and I have to register all my "extended" mags with the state.

       I suppose part of this is due to our absurd cultural norms in regards to sexual and violent content.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go to England and read the news there, they routinely post a variety of gore, such as photos of accident scenes, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure it's conspiracy, although I would like this practice stopped. The idea that the media needs to protect us from anything or that they can even do so, is a complete farce.

       Such passionate shootings are never towards people that the shooter has no association with.  Real life doesn't function in this manner.  What we're seeing is fiction.  Created drama.  Evedice could prove otherwise, yet they refuse to release or present it. The evidence is clear.

       You obviously don't understand the methods of propaganda and gradualism.  Its not about one event causing drastic changes its about one event to point back to constantly and say hey look at this crazy kid with the gun, give us more power and it won't happen any more.  This was the 9/11 for this generation's small children.  They scared children on a mass scale by slaughtering 20 of them publicly.  When today's third graders are 18 and up voters, that will be a moment seared into their consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Come on man, LEARN HOW IT WORKS.  Its about gradualism, changing society by scarring the young.  Read up on Bolshevism, or Fabianism.  They had to get the kids brainwashed in order to bring about changes that would be much easier to foment with a willing population.

       Vastly different circumstances and from what I understand the majority of people who died did so as a result of the fire...? Violent crime overall was on downward trend since before then, anyways. I say Sandy Hook is the worst given that 20 children were mowed down in their Kindergarden classroom, whether or not you believe that actually happened the fact remains that we have
       <em>
        less

      <p>
       I'm with you there to an extent. I'm firmly against the militarization of police. However I personally disagree as to why it's happening. I don't see the bad things that happen such as Sandy Hook as faked to that end. Regular people do bad things, even on that scale. I think there are multiple reasons for police becoming more militarized, part of which has to do with public perception of the danger to their person. But I don't think Sandy Hook contributed as much to that, as, say, the Boston bombing you mention. In fact it had quite the opposite effect for a lot of people, who think see this as a further reason to always be armed.

       It is funny, though, that after gun control was increased following such shootings that it was not followed by martial-law-police-state-totalitarianism in those countries which are arguably more of a nanny-state in every respect than the US.

       No, because there is no other event where an untrained individual has had an even similar kill/injury ratio.  Never.  Not one aingle time in history has this been seen.  This tells us that the event is highly abnormal, and as such, suspect.  It must be investigated fully.  We are seeing nothing of the sort.

       I'm not sure where you got all your information but I'm against gun registration simply because it just adds one more layer of paperwork and does nothing to solve the problem.

       And when did citizens demand of them to "end terrorism"? We asked for NDAA, the Patriot Act, the ineffective and costly TSA and all the rest?

       You've been reading too much propaganda.

       Okay dude, you've seen through the government's plot. Good job. Staged mass shootings perpetrated by mind control agents. To take our guns. Because they are afraid of us with guns. Congrats, your cookie is in the mail.

       You've ignored numerous questions and dodged perfectly valid points I make. You haven't stood up a solid case of your own, just poked semantic holes in my phrasing by treating it absolutely. You pretend that words are being put in your mouth, when the only reason this debate has carried on this far is because what I said is at least on some level what you believe.
