       As you might know, there are a lot of downvoting going on here in r/conspiracy for good threads. As I was able to find out, the downvoting is happening on r/conspiracy as almost everywhere else on Reddit. They are just simple trolls with too much time on their hands. Trolls click on downvote button simple because they can. They are doing this for sick amusement they get from annoying real posters.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is only one solution to stop this bullshit, obviously by disabling the voting system. Or at least allowing only upvoting, but still disabling downvoting. This way people would be still able to show what are the most liked threads, but the trolls would be not capable to downvote good threads anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trolls are also downvoting interesting threads on r/conspiracy because they feel pleasure from pretending to be serious shills and scaring some children posting here. Trolls feel important this way. Real shills do not downvote threads, they are payed only because are intelligent enough to make plausible counter arguments that really can put the OP in troubles in front of everybody. Trolls in r/conspiracy are just guillible losers, the are unable to post initelligent counter arguments because of lack of information and ability to debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the adminidstration doesn't care about improving the safety of the regular users of Reddit and will refuse to help r/conspiracy posters by disbling the downvoting by anyone willing to do so, the only option you have is to stop bitchin about the simple trolls and calling them shills. Without you calling them shills, the trolls will calm down, because will stop feeling important in their own imaginary world.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you see someone on r/conspiracy inciting other posters to call the trolls as shills, or acting against trolls without contacting the administration, it is not a serious poster, but just another troll. Avoid them, because they are stupid too, and not interested in making real improvements here, in order to make this place more safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. I would really appreaciate if you could post any constructive thoughts about what I just said, in order to show the moderators that you care about this too. They don't really care if you are just upvoting.

       I find this a good question. I still upvote comments or posts that are wrong, so long as they were presented honestly and with respect. We are all here to learn and to help eachother learn, and it is inevitable that at some point each of us will get something wrong, or misunderstand something. That doesnt deserve a downvote in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I downvote solely on the behavior of a redditor, or their lack of tact or willingness to constructively provide criticism. When someone is wrong, we should be able to, as a community, correct them and provide efficient explanations as to why they are wrong.

       If a disagreement insues thereafter, well, then play by the rukes of engagement in regards to debate.

       Well, there is always the possibility that you yourself are the wrong one, but think you're right. When the other thinks the same, things can get contentious. Not to mention, there isn't always a right and wrong, and almost always various levels of nuance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm saying is, the "what if someone is wrong," and your subsequent response, frames things from an odd, and perhaps confusing, perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps losing the down vote button will prevent these very problems, and I'm starting to become comfortable with that. This whole issue I think will become moot.

       Good point sir. I was hoping to address this point when i said, "if a disagreement insues thereafter...rules of engagement of debate"
      </p>
      <p>
       It is certainly possible that i may be the wrong one in a given argument, and thus the need for openminded and respectful debate arises so that a consensus can be made and some common ground can be agreed upon. It most definately works both ways, and i did not mean to imply that i am infallable.

       Thanks for pointing that out.

       I posted a rational idea. And you straight up attacked me. Now, are you going to respond to my idea? What if you know someone posted something that was completely wrong? You can't downvote it now. It'll only receive upvotes.

       No offense, but this sub seems like it has gone from a questioning and reasoning society to a bunch of whiney little bitches that discuss nothing other than mods, shills and the conspitatorial blue arrow. I know sometimes its hard to think outside the box, but maybe, just maybe reddit isn't the best place to come for information for "our kind."  Trolls, shills, who cares? I'm not saying give up on seeking the truth, just look somewhere else.

       I certainly liked how you differentiated between a troll and a "real" shill. I especially kiked how you pointed out that by calling said trolls shills, we encourage their behavior.

       I recall not too long ago the downvote button here in r/conspiracy was temporarily deactivated or hidden for awhile, but then it reappeared. Not sure why or whether it worked.

       It obviously worked. Trolls cannot screw the threads without downvoting, they are stupid, they can't have intelligent counter arguments. If it reappered, it is obvious that somebody helped the trolls to sabotage this place.

       Normal users cannot lose their time in puerile votings all day. They have a life first of all, and are busy in reading posts / replaying to posts and posting their own posts when they are here. Only trolls with too much time on their hands can spend all day in downvoting threads, they are never busy otherwise.  Voting is just an invention of some obviously retarded nerd. How old are you?

       We simply need the downvote button to go away. You don't really need to downvote [negative], if you can upvote [positive]. It is just basic math that any software programmer knows. Zero would become relative, [neutral] if nobody is upvoted from zero, or [negative] in case someone would upvote any other competitor. This way nobody's thread can be buried by trolls. Only appreciated, or indifferent.

       Yeah, it looks like the only solution possible. The way this site was concieved shows that the creator was unaware about trolls. This way he made the mistake to put a more simple logic for voting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Facebook for example started right away only with the Like button, which shows that the creator was aware about trolls and about secutity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is the fact that the majority of forums don't even have any voting, which makes them very reliable against trolls.

       We need more people that want this sub to constantly improve as a place for like-minded people to discuss ideas and theories. We can't allow people to muck around in the name of 'lelz', we just want a place to discuss conspiracies, god forbid we have a decent fucking discussion. I don't post often, but I'm on here everyday learning about new ways of looking at matters. I don't agree with some conspiracies, and that's ok. I don't downvote threads that I disagree with, I downvote the ones that have no place in here. The option of downvoting needs to be removed entirely as it's clearly a tool for abuse.

       It cannot be useful. You need just to click on [subscribe] button, in order to be subscribed. It is obvious the trolls are subscribed to the place they are trolling to see new threads to troll.

       I see your point. I wonder why they did something that is not useful at all. Even if it is possible to disable downvoting for real. I can't believe they are this stupid, it looks to me they are just fucking with people.

       I think that's exactly what they are doing.   I think removing the down vote button on a post would be a good idea, maybe leave the downvote on comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are that stupid, just mindlessly downvoting.  If the downvote button went away, so would they.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe allow a downvote only after someone has commented..   There's a lot of adjustments that could be made to thwart the tards.

       Zuckerberg refuses to have a 'Dislike' button on Facebook precisely because it is an invitation to trolls and pranksters. Get rid of it here and the same problems will disappear. Lose the downvote button.

       I am sorry mate, but they are implementing it already. But yes, it is true, originally Facebook was without it. Things were concieved smoothly there. Probably because the guys who were responsable for the software were good at math.

       Why not just have a ranking type of system for the users.
If the user has been active for awhile (say 6 months or longer) and is approved by the mods or secret list of users, they can downvote posts and threads.  This should force people to communicate and allow the mods and or secret accounts to approve of them based off behavior.  Otherwise they can't downvote or even upvote till they're approved.

       I already know that nothing based on downvoting will work against trolls here. They have a lot of time and they are smart. They will do whatever is requested in order to obtain the right do downvote users. You are forgetting the simple fact that the voting system here is secret. We will never understand who are the users who are burying good threads here, unless they can show who voted and how.

       I posted a rational idea. And you straight up attacked me. Now, are you going to respond to my idea? What if you know someone posted something that was completely wrong? You can't downvote it now. It'll only receive upvotes.
