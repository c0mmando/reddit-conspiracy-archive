        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As you might know, there are a lot of downvoting going on here in r/conspiracy for good threads. As I was able to find out, the downvoting is happening on r/conspiracy as almost everywhere else on Reddit. They are just simple trolls with too much time on their hands. Trolls click on downvote button simple because they can. They are doing this for sick amusement they get from annoying real posters.</p>

<p>There is only one solution to stop this bullshit, obviously by disabling the voting system. Or at least allowing only upvoting, but still disabling downvoting. This way people would be still able to show what are the most liked threads, but the trolls would be not capable to downvote good threads anymore.</p>

<p>Trolls are also downvoting interesting threads on r/conspiracy because they feel pleasure from pretending to be serious shills and scaring some children posting here. Trolls feel important this way. Real shills do not downvote threads, they are payed only because are intelligent enough to make plausible counter arguments that really can put the OP in troubles in front of everybody. Trolls in r/conspiracy are just guillible losers, the are unable to post initelligent counter arguments because of lack of information and ability to debate.</p>

<p>If the adminidstration doesn&#39;t care about improving the safety of the regular users of Reddit and will refuse to help r/conspiracy posters by disbling the downvoting by anyone willing to do so, the only option you have is to stop bitchin about the simple trolls and calling them shills. Without you calling them shills, the trolls will calm down, because will stop feeling important in their own imaginary world.</p>

<p>If you see someone on r/conspiracy inciting other posters to call the trolls as shills, or acting against trolls without contacting the administration, it is not a serious poster, but just another troll. Avoid them, because they are stupid too, and not interested in making real improvements here, in order to make this place more safe.</p>

<p>P.S. I would really appreaciate if you could post any constructive thoughts about what I just said, in order to show the moderators that you care about this too. They don&#39;t really care if you are just upvoting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find this a good question. I still upvote comments or posts that are wrong, so long as they were presented honestly and with respect. We are all here to learn and to help eachother learn, and it is inevitable that at some point each of us will get something wrong, or misunderstand something. That doesnt deserve a downvote in my opinion.</p>

<p>I downvote solely on the behavior of a redditor, or their lack of tact or willingness to constructively provide criticism. When someone is wrong, we should be able to, as a community, correct them and provide efficient explanations as to why they are wrong. </p>

<p>If a disagreement insues thereafter, well, then play by the rukes of engagement in regards to debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there is always the possibility that you yourself are the wrong one, but think you&#39;re right. When the other thinks the same, things can get contentious. Not to mention, there isn&#39;t always a right and wrong, and almost always various levels of nuance.</p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m saying is, the &quot;what if someone is wrong,&quot; and your subsequent response, frames things from an odd, and perhaps confusing, perspective. </p>

<p>Perhaps losing the down vote button will prevent these very problems, and I&#39;m starting to become comfortable with that. This whole issue I think will become moot. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Good point sir. I was hoping to address this point when i said, &quot;if a disagreement insues thereafter...rules of engagement of debate&quot;</p>

<p>It is certainly possible that i may be the wrong one in a given argument, and thus the need for openminded and respectful debate arises so that a consensus can be made and some common ground can be agreed upon. It most definately works both ways, and i did not mean to imply that i am infallable. </p>

<p>Thanks for pointing that out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it looks like the only solution possible. The way this site was concieved shows that the creator was unaware about trolls. This way he made the mistake to put a more simple logic for voting.</p>

<p>Facebook for example started right away only with the Like button, which shows that the creator was aware about trolls and about secutity. </p>

<p>Then there is the fact that the majority of forums don&#39;t even have any voting, which makes them very reliable against trolls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point. I wonder why they did something that is not useful at all. Even if it is possible to disable downvoting for real. I can&#39;t believe they are this stupid, it looks to me they are just fucking with people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s exactly what they are doing.   I think removing the down vote button on a post would be a good idea, maybe leave the downvote on comments.   </p>

<p>They are that stupid, just mindlessly downvoting.  If the downvote button went away, so would they.</p>

<p>Maybe allow a downvote only after someone has commented..   There&#39;s a lot of adjustments that could be made to thwart the tards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are just overthinking it. We simply need the downvote button to go away. You don&#39;t really need to downvote (negative), if you can upvote (positive). It is just basic math that any software programmer knows. Zero would become relative, neutral if nobody is upvoted from zero, to negative in case someone would upvote any other competitor. This way nobody&#39;s thread can be screwed. Only appreciated, or indifferent.</p>

<p>Thanks for constructive post anyway, mate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not just have a ranking type of system for the users.
If the user has been active for awhile (say 6 months or longer) and is approved by the mods or secret list of users, they can downvote posts and threads.  This should force people to communicate and allow the mods and or secret accounts to approve of them based off behavior.  Otherwise they can&#39;t downvote or even upvote till they&#39;re approved.</p>
