       Seriously. The majority of these school shootings are people that look like...well...YOU.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know who you are. You are a socially awkward over emotional white kid. You have minimal real friends. Girls aren't really into you. You were probably coddled too much by your mother and hate your dad. "SCREW YOU DAD AND YOU TOO MOM I HATE YOU" is something you have probably yelled at your parents, while they are confused, unable to understand you. No one understands you. YOU.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are the one that goes out and does the majority of these nutso school shootings. My question is, why are you such a bitch? Why can't you man the fuck up, suck it up and find a way to live life? Why do you have to rob other people of life? Why be a real life troll? Got damn attention whore.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you won't even be able to revel in the attention, because you will be dead. And no one will care about you, even then. Just go fucking play video games or something. Troll spawn points in Battlefield 4 or Ghosts. But stop killing students, okay you emo, whiny white boy?

       That's it poke the so called monster. Perhaps you jever experianced ridicule in school. These kids are human beings just like everyone else here is a idea rather then pointing a finger listen to kids what they have to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kids today are not the same as when you and I grew up. They want to express there feelings and let emotions out. They are tought this thru many different ways that you can't control. Dont be so harsh and try to be a little more understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do have kids teach them to take up for the little guy. Dont teach them to be a dick like you that way when the next shooting happens yours won't be the first to catch a bullet.

       Listen to what these crybaby little white boys have to say? What? The REST of the country has problems, gets picked on, bullied, but THEY don't run off and shoot little helpless babies heads off.

       Seriously this is the real problem people like you. I hope for your sake that if you do have kids they don't end up with a toe tag. I found a way to let lose of my agression cause I had parents that cared.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went to the military and got my anger out of me. You on the other hand dictate from your keyboard. You watch the news and eat the shit they feed you. I myself was not fucked with in school nearly as much as others but I was tought to help others not point a finger.
      </p>
      <p>
       You be your way and act as you are it works for you but someday you will become a parent and then you will prolly have a girl that will rebel from you and end up in a bad situation. Or a boy that will succumb to peer pressure and end up in a bad situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Parent hood is difficult there is no manual that tells you how to be one. But I am certian that the way I was brought up getting 1980s beatings wasn't the way. I don't do that to my kid. I do however pose different situations to him and ask what he would do. Perhaps you should blame the parents that have kids and focus on there career rather then their obligation.

       I am gonna take a stab at this and guess you wanting to direct anger at a specific demographic because it is easier to target. You prolly delt with a few in the past and see them as weaker then you. Prolly easy to bully and control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a tip sir don't be what you hate. Control is what we all want and guess what none of us ever have it. Accept that and have fun with life. Trust me it takes way to much time from your life to hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the name calling is getting old. Be civil I am not name calling nor am I being a dick to you. I am calm and would actually like to have a dialogue with you. I would really like to understand why you feel this way. No I am not a shrink nor will I pretend to be one.

       Hell yes I stand by my parents taking care of kids to prevent black on black crime. As for 9-11 we will never know what really happened. You are angry I see that how is that working out for you. Is it gaininy traction in this sub as fast as you thought it would? Oh I know you don't care right? You don't care cause this is the right way to be right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a news flash fellow redditor people don't want anger. They want to be understood kinda like you do. A lot like kids do. You wanna bitch bout babies dying and getting killed then go join a pro life group. I have not heard of an emo going in and killing babies. The fact that you don't know the differance between a 1st grader and a baby shows me you haven't been around kids much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes it is wrong to murder children. Guess what world sucks. We all get sucked in. Here is the way you win.... you ready.... you die. If you wanna get mad about babies dying then focus on the homeless rate of children in your local city. You can make a differance there. But I am betting you won't cause you wanna bitch about something cause you know what is godly right and damnnation wrong huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your post will be buried in the bowls of this sub in the next 8 hrs as people read your rant and they will dissmiss you as a nut. Because you are unwilling to provide a logical solution to a real problem. You wanna name call people and flaunt your ignorance to the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you enjoy the next 7 hrs of fame as people dissagree with you and you call them sissys and spineless pieces of shit. I wish you the best poor poor person and hope you don't ever have kids that end up like the ones you talk about.

       This thread is exclusively about YOU. I have shined the spotlight on YOU, you emo, white males that cry and whine about every fucking thing on the planet and then turn around and kill our babies, our defeneless youth, all because you can't get a date, or because your mommy didnt feed you when you were three years old. Well fuck you, you weak piece of shit. I am here to tell you that what you are doing is WRONG. You are a low down piece of crap, you arent strong, you arent worthy of anything in life. Stop BEING weak, stop running into a school with a gun in an attempt to show strength, and go fucking get help and if that doesnt work just kill yourself. STOP LOOKING FOR ATTENTION. Stop fucking lashing out by killing people. This is an emo, white male problem that must end.

       I really want to know how you can make so many false assumptions on my life with so little information. I will help you out ok. First off I am 34 yo have a wonderful wife great kid that is 4yo. 8 chickens 2 ferrets and live in the middle of amish country pa. I served in the us navy for 7 years. Had a pretty shitty childhood my mother was not the best lets say and my dad took care of me and raised me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never not once had the urge to kill people. I did how ever have a gun pulled on me in 5th grade by a black male actually. On a school bus. Never really had to deal with a mass shooting myself. Now I inspect arial equipment for many diff companies. So I actually save lifes make a differance in the world. What do you do? Betting you hate your job. Your life sucks and have problems finding and keeping relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
       You sir are by far at more risk being what you are ranting about. Look in the mirror and see what you are hating it is yourself.

       LOL YOU WANT ME TO UNDERSTAND A BABY KILLER??
      </p>
      <p>
       How did you feel about the terrorists who killed people on 911? Do you empathize with them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you empathize with black people who steal cars from white people?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, you don't. But you empathize with emo white male baby killers because YOU are an emo white male.
      </p>
      <p>
       My thread is performing EXACTLY how I thought it would. There are a lot of sick, mentally depraved over emotional, screw up little shits that post here. A bunch of Adam Lanzas. Hypocritical whiny pieces of shit. Go slit your wrists and stop killing people!!

       Ah i didnt notice you were focusing on SCHOOL shootings only. I guess the fact i was gonna bring up (that in the past 30 yrs, almost 70 mass shootings occured, and about 40 where white shooters) would be irrelevant then. Okay so nevermind, continue your rant.

      <p>
       No? How about the first sentence: "The majority of these school shootings are people that look like...well...YOU."

       Or the first sentence of 2nd paragraph: "You are the one that goes out and does the majority of these nutso school shootings"

       When he was 6-9, and choosing his "script"

       these two songs were popular:

       Evanescence: Bring me back to life

       Linkin Park: In the End
I've tried so hard / And got so far / But in the end / It doesn't even matter / I had to fall / To lose it all / But.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a boy, he would have chosen
       <em>
        In The End
       </em>
       , which is more consistent with his script decision age: 7 or 8.  Release year 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is in 2-4 years, we can expect a bunch of weird behaviors by girls programmed by the Evanescence song and due to the cross-over on vocals there will be some boys involved in the Evanescence programming.

       Man you should really REALLY look up the definition of racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Racism is generally defined as actions, practices, or beliefs that consider the human species to be divided into races with shared traits, abilities, or qualities, such as personality, intellect, morality, or other cultural behavioral characteristics."
      </p>
      <p>
       You hit the "cultural behavioral characteristics" nail on the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Some definitions would have it that any assumption that a person's behavior would be influenced by their racial categorization is racist, regardless of whether the action is intentionally harmful or pejorative. Other definitions only include consciously malignant forms of discrimination.[4] Among the questions about how to define racism are the question of whether to include forms of discrimination that are unintentional, such as making assumptions about preferences or abilities of others based on racial stereotypes, whether to include symbolic or institutionalized forms of discrimination such as the circulation of ethnic stereotypes through the media, and whether to include the socio-political dynamics of social stratification that sometimes have a racial component. Some definitions of racism also include discriminatory behaviors and beliefs based on cultural, national, ethnic, caste, or religious stereotypes"
      </p>
      <p>
       oh btw.  here is the UN's official definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       the term "racial discrimination" shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life
      </p>
      <p>
       But no you're right, your distiniction and preference based on race and or colour doesn't fall into the category of rascism.   /sarcasm

       Ignorance is bliss.

       Fact?  Please, I would love for you to supply any solidification or sources on the "fact" that you claim here.  So far I have seen no evidence to back up your statements, just harassment, hostility, and hate speech.

       So nothing to back up your claim to "fact"?  I'm surprised you view my simple discourse as whining.  Seeing as I have done no such thing,  I mean I can gladly point you towards the definition of whining as well, seems you needs a bit of a refresher.  I came across another post of yours earlier and came across this thread in your comment history.  I didn't come here to whine, simply to explain and perhaps shed some light on how you yourself show traits related to racism, the very same traits of which you discuss and shun constantly throughout your comment history.  Anyways, as you have clearly shown in this thread and throughout your discussions you clearly are unable to see past your own nose.

       hahahah show me where angry black males go into schools and intentionally shoot kids. That is something that is pretty exclusive to emo white males.

      <p>
       Angry black males will shoot someone from a rival gang, or because they want to steal your car. Emo white males will shoot you because they hate their mother.

       but my question is: which denomination is worse for the population? At least these emo fucks kill themselves/ seldom get away to recommit the crime.... whereas black spend decades murdering, robbing, and raping. And are you really saying no black person ever went insane and killed people?

       Look, you got mad at referred to blacks as "niggers". You obviously have an agenda here, while amusing, has no place in this thread.

       You could have easily gone after specific blacks, but you used the label "nigger." You have a problem.

       Additionally, this thread is not about what you deem "what is worse for the population".

       This thread is about emo white males killing helpless people, and how they need to stop doing that.

       Ill say WTF I want when I want.... thank for the tip though.... your claim that whites kill unarmed people implies that no other race does... which is false. Nigger is a certain type of black that everyone knows and hates.... even other blacks. The fact you don't know the difference is astounding. according to this study, blacks are 20% more likely to develop mental illness than whites.

       No it isn't on me.... I served 4 years in the army in the signal corps pulling retrans every night in eastern baghdad. I served my country with what I thought was honor at the time. 2005-2006. What have you done with your life? Other than smoking a lil weed, I have NEVER committed a crime... nor wished unjust pain on another. Like you stated that shit is seriously weak, and I agree..... but there is more at play here than emo white nerds as your racist ass put it. These shootings all have more at play then what the media puts out there. Your emotional response to it shows how weak minded you are.

       this is really too easy.... for accounting for such a small percentage of the overall pop, blacks commit WAAAAY more than their fair share of murders and shootings.

       hahahah show me where angry black males go into schools and intentionally shoot kids. That is something that is pretty exclusive to emo white males.
      </p>
      <p>
       Angry black males will shoot someone from a rival gang, or because they want to steal your car. Emo white males will shoot you because they hate their mother.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both suck, but Emo white males are the worst.

       Look, you got mad at referred to blacks as "niggers". You obviously have an agenda here, while amusing, has no place in this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could have easily gone after specific blacks, but you used the label "nigger." You have a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, this thread is not about what you deem "what is worse for the population".
      </p>
      <p>
       This thread is about emo white males killing helpless people, and how they need to stop doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to go make a thread about "niggers killing niggers", go do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this thread is mine.
