       I am working on a project and am looking for some examples of the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       A. How U.S. citizens have been subjected to martial law, however limited it was.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Hawaii after the attacks on Pearl Harbor.
       </li>
       <li>
        Boston after the bombing.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       B. I am also interesting in learning about the build up to something like this happening: as in the laws being passed by congress, and signed into law by the president which take away our liberty in the name of public safety.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "NDAA", granting indefinite detention of U.S. citizens without trial.
       </li>
       <li>
        The "National Defense Resources Preparedness Executive Order", allowing the government to confiscate citizens' property without due process.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       C. And as i was writing this i realized there is another component, Government Agencies that have been given too much power.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The National Surveillance Agency, for example.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I want to thank you in advance for your help compiling some of this information. I also want to add i am not really looking for opinions on these matters, just factual information if that is possible.

       As someone who went through Katrina I can say that family and friends of mine were absolutely terrified of the NOPD. Corrupt as shit and we saw many,many rights being violated including mine. I can say if that is what we have to look forward to we should all be very afraid.

       Another government agency with too much power is the Department of Homeland Security. As well as local police in every city. 1.6 billion hollow-tip rounds seems a bit excessive for a country of 320 million, neh?
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd have to check out the legitimacy of this one, but the supposed test being administered in certain military circles of our country which proposes a terrifying hypothetical case: the government enacts strict gun control laws, and the military is deployed to aid local police in confiscating these unlawful guns from the public. However, some resist - if it comes to it, are you willing to fire on your fellow citizens?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really not such a big step for government though. There's always been an iron fist in the velvet glove. Martial law is only the shedding of the velvet glove.

       The supposed test applied to generals has been debunked.  However, I do think you're right to focus on the militarization of police departments.    It isn't that we're sliding into martial law, but that as a nation we've come to view military response as appropriate.  The disproportionate scale of response, both in terms of actual threat and history, makes the petit-bourgeois feel secure.  "Those guys charging around in urban areas in camouflage and assault rifles keep my suburban McMansion safe from the filthy poors!"

       Thank you for bringing this up actually, bc I was recently reading about how local/ city police stations have been receiving more and more military weaponry (bc they can get it cheaply when our military gets new equipment). Seems like a good use of funds, until we reach a point where every cop is walking around with an AR15....

       Easy the TSA.  The TSA is the single largest program set in place right now to desensitize and condition the people to passively accept Martial Law.  If you want to know what Martial Law feels like then go to an airport, there's not one instance where you don't fall under some type of government control and if you step out of line then you'll feel it as you have no longer have any constitutional rights.
      </p>

       Eroding your freedoms isn't an overnight process its going to take time.  Eventually you're going to see more and more domestic checkpoints throughout the country,

       exigent circumstance: in the American law of criminal procedure, allows law enforcement to enter a structure without a search warrant, or if they have a "knock and announce" warrant, without knocking and waiting for refusal under certain circumstances. It must be a situation where people are in imminent danger, evidence faces imminent destruction, or a suspect will escape.
      </p>

       This is often abused by cops who claim to have gotten a 9/11 call claiming someone was screaming, using drugs(and they can smell it), etc. The victims have little recourse as Pd's have a lot of protection from complaints.
