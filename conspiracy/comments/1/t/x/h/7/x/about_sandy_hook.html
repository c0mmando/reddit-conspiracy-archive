        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">43</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-12-29 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/goofylilwayne.html">goofylilwayne</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sandy Hook is honestly throwing me through a loop. I&#39;m not sure of what actually happened but I am quite sure that whoever controlled the spin of Sandy Hook wanted there to be a lot of controversy. </p>

<p>To me this is looking very much like the Hegelian dialectic in full effect. People tend to fall into two mainstream categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Sandy Hook happened the way the media said it did. 20 children are dead because of a mentally deranged Adam Lanza. Another lone nut killer.</p></li>
<li><p>Sandy Hook didn&#39;t happen. They were all actors. No kids died. Government false flag. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>And now they are fighting each other. either verbally on the internet or the shaming that happened because of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/15/gene-rosen-sandy-hook-conspiracy-theory_n_2481912.html">Gene Rosen being harassed by &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39;</a>. </p>

<p>Here are a few things I can have relative confidence over:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>what the media did with this event was to frame a situation for the american people and to have them fight each other</p></li>
<li><p>Every person in America is being coerced and attacked through media psychologically. There is no open discussion in the media. There is no press anymore. It is all controlled.</p></li>
<li><p>The media intentionally wanted there to be this amount of indecision from people who don&#39;t just accept the status quo. I say this because I have not had enough proof <em>in either direction</em> to say for sure what happened. </p></li>
<li><p>This was orchestrated in a lot of respects, not necessarily the ways one would think. </p></li>
<li><p>The powers that be are frightened by the truth movement. Ridicule has been particularly effective in the past and I feel that they are having the majority(official story) shame the minority(unofficial theories). Talking about dead kids is not something most people want to do. I feel that they are only buying time at this point. They know the house of cards is coming down.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The possible motive for a false flag?</strong></p>

<p>People keep talking about &#39;gun control&#39; as the reason for this false flag and I think that is false. There are a ridiculous amount of guns in America ( <a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/transparency.jpeg">as of 2012 there were 88.8 guns per 100 people in america</a>) and if I were a betting man I would wager that a good handful of those Americans with guns would not do so peacefully. It would be a fucking bloodbath.</p>

<p>So what is the motive behind Sandy Hook? My guess would be another distraction and to further divide the American people. And I would have a strong inkling that the NSA and other intelligence agencies are monitoring our posts and the dialogue over Sandy Hook just to see who would call bullshit and who wouldn&#39;t. A litmus test maybe for the more radical conspiracy theorists. At any rate I love you all. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vazBxk_avxc">Here&#39;s some music I find particularly beautiful</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what it is.  Its about gradualism.  This was the 9/11 of this generations&#39; elementary school age children.  Now in 10-15 years they will try to ban guns again and they will have an entire generation of kids who were scarred from this Sandy Hook nonsense willing to vote away rights to keep them safe.  The Fabians of the late 19th/early 20th century were big proponents of gradualism.  Get the young on board and wait.  That is why all of this &quot;green&quot; stuff is being pushed now and &quot;SCIENCE!&quot;, its all thanks to Captain Planet, and Bill Nye the Science Guy!  Kids 10-20 years ago were inculcated with propaganda about radical environmentalism and how science is the new religion.  Fast forward to today and take a look around.</p>

<li><p>You are wrong about the chronology, here. The major environmental legislation was passed in the early 1970s. What is happening now is rather minor. Earth Day was created in 1970. The EPA was created in 1970, as well as the Clean Air Act of 1970. The Clean Water Act was in 1972, the Endangered Species Act in 1973.</p></li>
<li><p>Are you saying that some group of people killed or pretended to kill 20 children and six adults in order to pass legislation decades from now? Really?? Which was it by the way, are they dead or was it all a hoax? Who did this and what is their motivation?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><ol>
<li><p>I never said anything about the chronology.  I said 20 years ago there was a big green push aimed at the kids, I remember it because I was a kid.  All of that other stuff was just making the way for the environmentalists of the late 80s early 90s who then pushed it to the kids.  Its called generational oscillation.  Similar to how music trends work, people who were teenagers in the 70s, listen to that music their whole life, then have kids and their kids get into that type of music too, they become musicians and incorporate that style into their music.  Right now we are in an early 70s style folk phase as well as a disco dance phase because the people making the music in their late 20s-early 30s grew up listening with their parents, to music from that era.  Same deal with environmentalism, the kids of the parents who were part of the first wave of environmentalists were kids in the early 90s when the green push was revived right around the Rio Earth Summit of 92, those kids are now college aged and older and pushing the <em>new</em> green movement as well as going along with their kids being propagandized.  Don&#39;t you understand GRADUALISM.  I&#39;d suggest reading up on how all of that works.  </p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m saying that the event is being utilized to traumatize the children of today so that they will be more apt to vote for &quot;change&quot; when they are of voting age.  Its called gradualism, its a real thing, politicians and political groups have been utilizing it for a long long long long time.  Grow a brain.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. When the authorities and the media redact and misreport events, it is impossible for ordinary people to know what the truth is.</p>

<p>The only thing we can say is that is the actions and attitudes of everybody involved with the Sandy Hook event (law enforcement, media, relatives) are incongruent. Nothing adds up when you drill into the narrative. So I would say that whilst the official story is a tissue of lies, we cannot know for certain what actually happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget too, the government would love to eventually say, &quot;we&#39;ll this guy takes prescription drug x or went to a psychologist for 2 years back in 2005. Clearly he/she can&#39;t have a gun. Let&#39;s make it illegal.&quot; The no agenda show calls it &quot;the war on crazy,&quot; and when you look at the phony baloney LAX shooting, this guy was crazy and talked about the federal reserve and New World Order! We need to be paranoid of people who talk about stuff like that because, &quot;you never know.&quot; Maybe they shouldn&#39;t be considered for jobs or allowed to own guns. The people who pull off false flags are nothing if not methodical and patient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Sandy Hook happened, but I can&#39;t come up with good reasons that evidence isn&#39;t published. I understand that our culture takes violence and explodes it across the media, but it is frustrating when our governments do things like withhold the evidence of bin Laden&#39;s death. Like why can&#39;t they just restore our faith in them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the president is championing it as a giant success from a war that&#39;s been characterized as a giant crapshoot, yes, they should publicize it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We dumped him in the ocean so no one could visit his grave.</p>

<p>No pictures of the body</p>

<p>Lots of scrutiny over 9/11, his relationship with the CIA since the 80&#39;s</p>

<p>Apparently hunted or tracked for ten years</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you that surprised people think some evidence would be nice.  </p>

<p>Even if they came out and said, &quot;Hey we can&#39;t show you the pictures because we vaporized him and there is no body&quot; or &quot;Jimbo here drew a dick on his face after we shot him so we can&#39;t really publicize the photos&quot;</p>

<p>I guess that&#39;s the respect we give to our worst supervillains, I guess pictures of dead hitler haven&#39;t been publicized either, because I feel like I would have seen that if they did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be alot of things however looking at it skeptically of course, as I do not proclaim to know what occured I will say that what followed was nothing short of force feed propaganda. </p>

<p>With that said it seems that if he were a patsy that had been controlled, like in the film &quot;the killing room&quot;, which may also explain his &quot;falling off the earth&quot;, the point would be to utlize this to help build up the lone wolf preying upon the people since every other &quot;terrorist&quot; act is controlled by the fbi and people are beginning to see through the illusion.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s scope is bigger than &quot;gun control&quot; as that is just a piece of the end game. The complete indoctrination and implementation of the police state is the current objective. 
With james holmes and the other lone wolves including the boston patsies the level of fear has been maintained with the bogeyman usama bin laden. </p>

<p>They have chipped every right guaranteed by the constitution away. With free speech zones, the NSA - we know they have been listening in aot longer though, see echelon / promis- our right and our  ability to fight for our liberty has to be reduced. These rights are inalienable despite what the illegal laws say but if people give them up readily for safeties illusion then shit even better. Why a prision grid is being put into place is a whole other novel...</p>

<p>I dont know if sandy hook was real or a psy op it doesn&#39;t matter as it has served its function either by being real and the opportunity was used to its fullest potential or it was a psy op - meaning lanza was real and people died, he was just being controlled- </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I am in the process. Some of the things I see are a bit of a stretch BUT THOSE PARENTS THOUGH. I was laughing because it&#39;s not even good acting. Then I felt ashamed of laughing. Seriously, Robbie Walker really looks like he&#39;s phoning it in. My fiancee thinks that it actually happened but that the parents are &quot;a symptom of our media-diseased society. They are more concerned with what they are portraying than their real emotions&quot;. Either way it&#39;s sending me bad signals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say that. If there&#39;s disruptive doubt, what&#39;s the point in hiding the evidence that was initially hidden in an attempt to prevent disruption? Talking about Sandy Hook. </p>

<p>I am really passionate about the bin Laden thing though. In that case, what&#39;s the point in not publicizing the evidence?</p>
