       There is no conspiracy here, unless you count the army of trolls from Anonymous flooding the forum.

       A lot of people are turned off when they come here and the only thing they hear are middle east politics. Isn't there a subreddit for that?

       A lot of conspiracies are based on events tied to the middle east and so a lot of us here have an interest on what is occurring over there. If the mods feel that it shouldn't be here or that most of the users don't want it here then they will deal with it. Part of looking at conspiracies is keeping up with current events, especially events in the middle-east.

       The front page of this subreddit is a discussion about rule number one. Would you post this kind of reply to that question? No. Because it is intended to shut down debate.

       I'm not going to argue with you about it, like I told you if enough people agree with you or the mods feel the same as you then I'm sure it will be dealt with. What I said wasn't intended to shut down debate because all I said was that you just opened a door for the debate. Do you think that rules should be changed because you want it or because the community wants it? Chill for a minute and see what everyone else think.

       Because it's not a conspiracy, it's politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just going off the top of my head, but in my view, a topic suitable to the realm of conspiracies should have particular characteristics or deal with particular topics:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        esoteric knowledge
       </li>
       <li>
        a supernatural force
       </li>
       <li>
        a government or corporate cover-up
       </li>
       <li>
        extraterrestrials
       </li>
       <li>
        cryptozoology
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       People are confusing things like influence peddling and sectarian spats as a conspiracy.

       influence peddling is certainly conspiratorial in nature, especially if it's not talked about. I think the upvote/downvote system will determine what should and shouldn't be posted here.

        'The Family' aka The Fellowship

       Posting a long list lot of things that make sense, and then putting ridiculous crap in the middle, doesn't make your specific topics legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tax Protesting?  That's not something that belongs here. Neither does the middle east. The PROBLEM is that these dumb topics have taken over, and there are almost NO interesting content anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to tax protest, go to the teabagger subreddit.

       Great post...great information.. Talk to Peter Schiff's dad about tax protesting and see what he thinks..it is definitely legitimate and belongs in this sub-reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is people who have no idea what's going on in the world and think that r/conspiracy is just about aliens, dumbs, and esoteric knowledge. Sorry there's a lot more to the real world than that buddy.

       The zionists are working behind the scenes (esoteric knowledge) to do the biddings of satan (a supernatural force) to establish a conflict between arab nations and israel in a secret manner  funded by the banking cabal (a government/corporate cover-up) in order to depopulate the planet for the arrival of the annunaki (extraterrestrials) so that they can continue on their genetic manipulation studies and experiments to find a suitable mixture of DNAs to create the optimum slave species (cryptozoology).

       What about the conspiracy that says that WW III will be over exactly that conflict and it was planned out even before WW I?
      </p>
      <p>
       If true then all the anti Zionist and anti Arab sentiment is nothing but propaganda for a divide-and-conquer strategy, and some sized chunk of

       It seems reasonable to me that for every time the issue is posted her, saying something along the lines of how pitting one group against another group is pretty much always destructive and you are probably being manipulated if you believe one.  But as long as the message of division gets repeated, it shouldn't be too hard to give a shout out to the opposite.

       But as long as there are some people who keep throwing it out there, isn't it better to just keep shooting it down.  Yeah it gets tedious maybe, but I tend to think the repetitive march toward dividing people isn't going to stop.  It seems better to keep meeting it with pushback that is in everybody's face to the same extent that the divisiveness is in our faces.
