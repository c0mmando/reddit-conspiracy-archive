<p>The front page of this subreddit is a discussion about rule number one. Would you post this kind of reply to that question? No. Because it is intended to shut down debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s not a conspiracy, it&#39;s politics. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just going off the top of my head, but in my view, a topic suitable to the realm of conspiracies should have particular characteristics or deal with particular topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>esoteric knowledge</li>
<li>a supernatural force</li>
<li>a government or corporate cover-up</li>
<li>extraterrestrials</li>
<li>cryptozoology</li>
</ul>

<p>People are confusing things like influence peddling and sectarian spats as a conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the conspiracy that says that WW III will be over exactly that conflict and it was planned out even before WW I?</p>

<p>If true then all the anti Zionist and anti Arab sentiment is nothing but propaganda for a divide-and-conquer strategy, and some sized chunk of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> actually swallowed it.</p>

<p>It seems reasonable to me that for every time the issue is posted her, saying something along the lines of how pitting one group against another group is pretty much always destructive and you are probably being manipulated if you believe one.  But as long as the message of division gets repeated, it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to give a shout out to the opposite.  </p>

<p>But as long as there are some people who keep throwing it out there, isn&#39;t it better to just keep shooting it down.  Yeah it gets tedious maybe, but I tend to think the repetitive march toward dividing people isn&#39;t going to stop.  It seems better to keep meeting it with pushback that is in everybody&#39;s face to the same extent that the divisiveness is in our faces.</p>

<p>(not just with Zionism/Arab, but also Rep/Dem, Black/White, or whatever.)</p>

<p>The front page of this subreddit is a discussion about rule number one. Would you post this kind of reply to that question? No. Because it is intended to shut down debate.</p>

<p>Not only that but you are seriously trying to stereotype r/conspiracy in with the usual reptilian overlord believers. This sub is about 9/11, its about tax protesting, its about aliens, cover-ups, satanic blood cults, zionism, intelligence agencies, false flags, pedophilia cults, illuminati, secret orders and societies, alternative views of history, future technology, hidden technology, one world government, politics, the fed, currency wars, vaccines, pandemics, spying, human programming and mind control...Please stop trying to turn r/conspiracy into something its not... </p>

<p>This place above all else is where we get to talk about the hard hitting subjects..All of them</p>
