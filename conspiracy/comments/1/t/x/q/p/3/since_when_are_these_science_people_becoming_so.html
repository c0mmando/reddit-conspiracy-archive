<p>I have lurked on Reddit for a few years before having made this account, but I never expected people on this website to be so blindly hateful merely because I disagree with them. I was expecting quite the opposite, and I&#39;m sure Aaron Swartz didn&#39;t have this in mind when he made the site.</p>

<p>This is a dangerous trend for the future, if such anger becomes the norm, we may have our very ways of life endangered. It&#39;s scary how many more violent and pushy people there are than everyone else. One thing I&#39;m starting to realize lately is that opinions are like assholes, everyone has one, and they all smell like shit.</p>

Dedicated years of his life to educating himself in human anatomy and how best to preserve life. He is of the opinion that vaccines are pretty awesome. I trust him more than Jenny McCarthy. I&#39;m not certain that outing another persons opinion is a conspiracy. Shall you make a post about me now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I participated in one of these trials, it was intense to experience the affects and communicate the changes. As an adult I&#39;m equipped to do this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22895958">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22895958</a></p>

<p>As a parent, I went through all the vaccinations with my children, as informed as I could possibly be. Having an immune suppressed spouse, the Neurologist, family doctor and pediatrician all factored into the equation. </p>

<p>We had an traumatic reaction in one instance and there&#39;s no more frightening thing than seeing a child very sick and helpless when we had been so careful. </p>

<p>She was 24 months old and they were telling us all sorts of scary procedures and muttering Spinal Meningitis, Rye Syndrome, Encephalitis...</p>

<p>This was a mere 7 hours after her inoculation and I repeated this to the ER physicians. They wanted to do a spinal tap. She was burning up. I was loosing my mind. </p>

<p>An older, quiet nurse was there and she came in with a bunch of ice bags and started packing our little girl down and asked the doctor if she could do a blood draw for labs. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve no idea what was in her head or her heart but to this day I swear she saved my little girl from death, brain damage and crippling effects. 
She massaged my daughters feet very gently, very slowly, working up the ankles, her little legs and when she got to the upper left thigh area (injection site,) she cupped her hand over it and very slowly, gently rubbed over her stomach, in a clockwise motion, just slightly palpitating as she went around. My daughters little tiny bowels let go. </p>

<p>We cleaned her up and the nurse started wrapping her up head to toe in this amazing cocoon. After ten minutes she started to rouse and I started to unwind her. She was calm but aware and nursed quietly.</p>

<p>I have no science to back this up but my daughter is alive, well on her way in the field of medicine. </p>

<p>Chemistry and Neurology.</p>

<p>Science and medicine practiced in a lab, is life under a microscope and noble, but it isn&#39;t life or death. </p>

<p>Introducing a live vaccine into our family environment, with careful practiced protocols was astounding.</p>

<p>Quarantine. Rather nefarious and ugly. </p>

<p>You cannot continue to tout vaccination pell mell when we know that over prescribing antibiotics is deleterious. </p>

<p>Rock your degree!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about the science behind vaccines because it&#39;s not my fight, not my problem. I believe in a natural approach. The only thing your goals and my own have in common are that we&#39;re tired of people with opposing views pushing their beliefs on us.</p>

<p>Whatever they put in vaccines is not my problem cause I&#39;m not stupid enough to use them, or let anyone in my family use them, but if I can find some legitimate proof just to shut the other side up and leave me alone, I will certainly use that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then i get offended when you insult the work of decades of people who have spent the time to learn.</p>

<p>People turn into &#39;rabid fucking animals&#39; because the cult worship of &#39;vaccine experts&#39; is actually leading to a resurgance in mumps, measles, polio (<a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/333/7573/823.1">http://www.bmj.com/content/333/7573/823.1</a>) etc. diseases that shouldn&#39;t still exist in the west, because we&#39;ve developed vaccines.</p>

<p>Interesting that you say cult - if what you do isn&#39;t cult worship, then surely you can provide me with some evidence (not a news clipping, actual reputable evidence) to support your claim, because if you don&#39;t have any, then how are you any better than cult worship?</p>

<p>Why? You realize that &quot;natural&quot; is just a meaningless trait that has nothing to do with safety or health, right? Strychnine is natural. So is arsenic. </p>

<p>Letting your broken bones heal improperly set, weak, and crooked is natural. Setting them properly and getting a cast is not.</p>

<p>Disinfecting and stitching up serious wounds is unnatural. </p>

<p>Also, if you aren&#39;t even familiar enough with vaccines to know that (unless there is some very rare exception) they&#39;re not injected intravenously, you probably shouldn&#39;t be making sweeping statements about them. </p>

<p>You&#39;d think someone who has decided they know more about immunology than the scientific and medical community would at least have a grasp on the difference between an intravenous and intramuscular injection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, in this context &quot;believe&quot; and &quot;know&quot; are pretty much the same thing</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>this is very true. i trust the scientists, but i have a strong distrust of the people who run pharmaceutical companies. which kinda sucks, because if i want a high paying job with the degree i am getting, ill probably have to work for a pharmaceutical company.</p>

<p>as for the allegations of toxic fillers and preservatives, vaccines sometimes require preservatives in order to prevent the breakdown of the active components neccesary to make the vaccine work. </p>

<p>the &quot;toxic fillers&quot; as people call them, are often compounds which contain things like mercury. but containing mercury does not imply that they are toxic. take table salt for example, sodium is a volatile explosive metal which burns underwater. chlorine is a toxic gas which was used in WW1 in the trenches. but when you combine them, you get something that is essential for life, and is one of the most common food additives in the world, sodium chloride, better known as table salt.</p>

<p>be wary of any claims of &quot;toxic fillers&quot;. if you find any such articles and are unsure of them, feel free to contact me. i&#39;d like to look into these claims myself.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>this is more of a general thing, because diet and excercise reduces the likelihood of catching virtually all diseases, but diet and excercise wont make you immune. vaccinating everyone in order to eradicate a disease is easy, but getting everyone to diet and excercise is near impossible. if we cant even manage to eradicate non-contagious diseases related to lack of excercise and poor diet, like obesity and heart disease, then we dont have much chance of using it to eradicate contagious diseases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I trust the few scientists whose work I have read in which I could both grasp the content vocabulary and find no claims to certainty. Perhaps unsurprisingly, no immunologist and little medical literature at all falls into this category. </p>

<p>I understand that preservatives extend the shelf-life of many vaccines; that many factors affect toxicity; that what amounts to a toxic dose varies between individuals; that molecular structure usually precedes elemental composition  in determining a substance&#39;s volatility (except perhaps in radioactive cases? <em>I have now wandered into the realm of my ignorance; let&#39;s back up</em>)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know much about modern vaccines but I do suspect a lot about the people who lobby for, sell, and administer them. I also know a fair deal about diet and excercise, herbal remedies, and the body&#39;s natural defense mechanisms. </p>

<p>Which is why I am going to correct you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>diet and excercise reduces the likelihood of catching virtually all diseases,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aye, they do. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but diet and excercise wont make you immune.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ahem. Let&#39;s back up to that first claim... &quot;diet and exercise reduces the likelihood of catching all diseases.&quot;</p>

<p>No. <em>Isolation and disinfectants</em> reduce the likelihood of catching all diseases. Diet and excercise ensure that you&#39;re body has all the energy, nutrients, and resources to maintain a healthy, fully functioning immune system; an immune system capable of catching, studying, and producing antbodies to vanquish any and all diseases that a healthy person might encounter while eating foods in a social environment that they bicycled to. </p>

<p>Isolation and disinfectants, or rather the consequent avoidance of all diseases, put a body in a precarious position should it ever be introduced to a disease laden environment. Basically Bubble Boy should have died when he came out the bubble because he had no antibodies and the common cold is everywhere.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>vaccinating everyone in order to eradicate a disease is easy, but getting everyone to diet and excercise is near impossible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Egads! I&#39;m done talking to you. No I&#39;m not. Let&#39;s just throw in the rest of your quote...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if we cant even manage to eradicate non-contagious diseases related to lack of excercise and poor diet, like obesity and heart disease, then we dont have much chance of using it to eradicate contagious diseases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK. Reflect on the information I just shared about how the immune system works (which is actually how vaccines work, btw) and rethink what you&#39;ve claimed.</p>

<p>Mk, now... Vaccinations inject weakened or dead viruses into the bloodstream so that healthy immune systems can produce antibodies to lessen the likelihood of severe symptoms upon a later, stronger, inadvertent exposure to the virus. </p>

<p>I think vaccines can be demonized because of their overadministration. Injecting a weakened or dead virus into a person with a weakened immune system could produce severe symptoms. </p>

<p>Vaccinating everyone effectively would only seem possible if we had worlwide accessible healthcare. Diet and excercise can be done by everyone and really is only a problem in Westernized countries with their high-calorie industrial monoculture agricultural products with thier nutrient imbalances. Aboriginal tribes that haven&#39;t been fucked over into slaves and refugees have remakably diverse diets and overwhelmingly muscular builds.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to back up now to the thing you mentioned about your distrust of the pharmaceutical companies. You do know that they fund a majority of both the public and private studies, as well as the predominant universities, and they own the predominant laboratories. They are lining the pockets of many scientists, not just that though. In a culture such as ours, going against the consensus can and will cost you your job, your life, and your family. </p>

<p>If you are getting a science degree, might I beg you to find work in a field related to growing food in a polyculture setting? Permaculture needs more scientists to garner the trust of that dogmatically scientific, liberal public that is oh-so-skeptical of anything that hasn&#39;t been published, peer-reviewed, publicly scrutinized, redesigned, republished, buried in soft peat for several years and sent to Dagohba to study the force with a small frog.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, where is the peer-reviewed tested proof of the cure?<br/>
The reason people trust scientists in their field of knowledge is because they have dedicated their lives to what ever calling they are working on. Educating themselves for decades to further the knowledge of mankind. 
But also because scientists have to get their work peer-reviewed scrutinized and tested by people who WANT to find a flaw in the paper. Not because they want to ruin it, but because they love it and want to find the truth.<br/>
To quote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9">Henri Poincaré</a>:<br/>
“The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful. If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living.”  </p>

<p>Regarding the &quot;profound lack of education and knowledge&quot;, what do you mean by that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all: Peer-reviews are usually anonymous or independent of the author. So they have nothing to loose now have they?  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scientist">Scientist:</a> &quot;A person who is trained in a science and whose job involves doing scientific research or solving scientific problems&quot;<br/>
I am not invoking that they have to be university bound or anything. Just that usually that is where you find them, because it is where it is at.  </p>

<p>Is science a religion? What is your justification for this? Are you currently working in the field of science? Have you worked in the field seen how much work is put into it? Science is build upon verifiable evidence and reasoning. EVERY aspect of any scientific field is up for testing, and is so tested many many times before they can even be qualified or even considered for the masses.  </p>

<p>Where is your evidence for science being about money? What about the countless upon countless of people trying to unravel the true nature of nature? Like Richard Feynman, who only sought exactly this. I know little about medical scientist but I am certain that there are people like Feynman in medicine as well. Dedicated hardworking people.  </p>

<p>Why is science contradictory? Because that is how it works.<br/>
You have a standing theory of how the universe works build upon the evidence one can gather from nature. Fast forward some years, someone will inevitably have either collected more data with faster/better equipment, or with a broader range of data or found a new way correlating the data from earlier.<br/>
See Albert Einstein, he came out with a HIGHLY controversial theory contradicting everything known about time and light. But the theory he put forth predicted things never seen before, so they tested it out. New data comes in some years later confirming this, but is takes years of contradiction and testing and verification to put it in motion. Today, what was profound and earth shattering in the world of physics is taught to first year physics students, Special Relativity, but we were not indoctrinated with it, we actually measured time dilation and length contraction. Comparing the data with various theories. This is how science works. One tests and verifies the data and everyone can participate. If they so wish. It is not a religion. It only shows a lack of understanding of how the world of science works.  </p>

<p>I think the reason people get upset is because they get frustrated with people, like Richard Feynman puts it:<br/>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaO69CF5mbY">&quot;See, I have the advantage of having found out how hard it is to get to really know something, how careful you have to be about checking the experiments, how easy it is to make mistakes and fool yourself. I know what it means to know something and therefore, I see how they get their information and I can&#39;t believe that they know it.&quot;</a></p>

<p>I mean in this post we&#39;re talking about <em>why</em> people are getting mad about vaccine deniers!? And you just want to say vaccines are good (I&#39;m not denying anything), which is off topic in this case.</p>

<p>Penn &amp; Teller has a great analogy at the start of this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLcOz4EKrxg">episode</a>.<br/>
But then again, they are on the wrong side of it, right?  </p>

<p>Abortion is a choice a woman can take, and it is up to her alone to choose whether or not she wises it or not. She is not endangering anyone, there is no scientific evidence of the unborn being harmed because it have no sensory organs or ways to perceive the world, these will develop yes, but they are not present at abortion.<br/>
What there is scientific evidence for is that unvaccinated groups tend to endanger themselves and people around them who otherwise could not get the vaccination in the first place, like leukemia patients or very young babies. So yeah, there is that...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am neither against or for abortion, I think it is a free choice that a woman can choose for her self, what I, you, or society thinks has NOTHING to do with HER freewill to choose. So your point stands unproven. I simply accept the right to exercise free choice.  </p>

<p>Now, moving on. I cannot see the reason to read about Kermit Gosnell. Moving on.  </p>

<p>A quick search around shows that it might have been contamination. But I do not have time for this right now, might look into it later this evening. But the analogy that Penn &amp; Teller uses still is in affect in this case, if it was a contamination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you viewed the link I had sent you, one of the chief virologists in the world admitted to have knowingly distributed the Leukemia causing virus via Polio vaccine. </p>

<p>As for Kermit Gosnell, you were saying how abortion involves disposal of the &#39;fetus&#39; before the cognitive functions are working.Well, Kermit Gosnell was doing late term abortions which resulted in women dying, &#39;live abortions&#39; (meaning the baby fucking came out screaming with an arm, and/or leg, and/or half a fucking torso missing.)</p>

<p>You talk about how humane this is, and how it&#39;s a womans choice, but there&#39;s no difference if you kill an unborn baby or a born one. Murder is still murder. Ending a human life, or what is in the process of becoming one is the same damn thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just a narrative that&#39;s being pushed. Vaccines are big money. Most of what you see online isn&#39;t literally shills, but people who are fed talking points on skeptic blogs and other websites. That is where the bulk of the &quot;shilling&quot; occurs. They feel like they are literally saving lives by talking down to you, and they also get to feel smarter than you, so this get&#39;s addicting. It&#39;s free shilling done by unwitting victims who get high by talking shit online. The high is their payment. </p>

<p>But the guy who made this thread...<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1tuqcq/i_wrote_a_thing_comments/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1tuqcq/i_wrote_a_thing_comments/</a> might actually be a shill. Notice how he can spread his talking points easily and how easily other people adopt them for copy/pasting. Random people just take the narrative and spread it on Facebook and wherever else so people think they are the &quot;smart friend.&quot; Really, they&#39;re just useful idiots.  </p>

<p>Another narrative that&#39;s being pushed through is conspiracy theorist = paranoid schizophrenic. They want to have a blanket label for us to stop dissent and keep the next generation of teenagers from adopting the current awakening that the now 20-35 years olds have had. Little Jimmy, you might need to go to the hospital for talking like that. You sound like a paranoid schizophrenic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A person should have the ability to respectfully decline the offer to be vaccinated. Everyone (my opinion, but I won&#39;t force anyone into anything) should get a few of the major vaccines (by their own choice, or parents choice) spread throughout their childhood, but definitely not forced on them when they are newborns under the threat of a nurse calling CPS on the parents. That tyrannical behavior makes people trust you even less. (yes this does happen.)</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to use an argument from authority and I will respectfully decline adopting it as legitimate. I don&#39;t trust governments, corporations, or the scientists who work for them. Period. I know how easy it is to skew data. Anyone who has taken a few statistics classes knows this. Sorry.

<p>when i want advice on vaccines, ill ask an immunologist.</p>

<p>you have every right to refuse vaccinations. i just want to point out how dumb it is to risk your life and health based on the dumbshit claims of a washed up actor who cant accept that its her own body&#39;s fault that her son is autistic.

<p>A total of 743,360 vials are included in the recall, but <strong>only about 10</strong> may contain the shards, Merck estimated, which are small enough to go through a needle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So they recalled three quarters of a million doses to protect 10 people. It seems like your attempt to label vaccines / their manufacturers as dangerous backfired.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes!  Its the &quot;skeptic&quot; sites that are the shills.  The &quot;skeptic&quot; community goes to a site called &quot;skeptic(something or other).com&quot; and then believes it without question because hey it says &quot;SKEPTIC&quot; in the title so they must be legit.  Its like going to Honest Al&#39;s Used Cars and saying well he couldn&#39;t rip me off it says honest right there in the title!  There is a large amount of people who think they are smart and think they are intellectual but are actually just buying into Sciencism, a belief structure built around Science and its expert(priest) class.   This is all a product of late 90s early 2000s Bill Nye style children&#39;s programming that got all of the kids on board then who are adults now.  </p>

<p>A good way to predict what is coming in the future is to watch children&#39;s programming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, and that was a hilarious analogy. Show me a skeptic site that&#39;s shitting on HSBC bank, or James Clapper, or Obama&#39;s continuous lying, etc. In the private sector we should see skepticism of every major corporation that keeps selling dangerous products that they first claimed are safe. Vioxx, Contaminated haemophilia blood products, etc.  Those aren&#39;t real skeptic sites. They are skeptical of a select few things that they are told to be skeptical about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember how the police once behaved before they started wearing black and started driving the black death mobiles?  I&#39;d like to propose the science people start wearing black lab jackets.   I think it would be more appropriate at this point.  By the way the police are now always right regardless of the facts or the law now just like the white jackets.  They are right because they say they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shame about that. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve experienced much of it. I came across a few of those black suits while I was still in the US, but I left years ago.</p>

<p>Things aren&#39;t the same on the outside. Sure, the riot cops exist in all countries, but out here most police (a title they&#39;ve genuinely earned) won&#39;t beat your head in or shoot you for looking at them wrong, at least where I live.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you&#39;ve never heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_Gosnell">Kermit Gosnell</a>, but thanks for proving my initial point that people who support 1 usually support both.</p>

<p>Btw, speaking of Leukemia, perhaps you&#39;ve heard of Merk Pharmaceuticals? I suppose you&#39;re completely aware that one of their <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=327_1195303011">leading scientists, and one of the most world renowned vaccine engineers, admitted putting a Leukemia causing virus into the polio vaccine.</a></p>

<p>But that&#39;s not evidence or anything, right?</p>
