       Our lives, our civilization, was built on on great, open, abundant lands and our plentiful, fresh waterways. We could go anywhere, be resourseful, live off the land and flourish. Now, if you try to live off our "abundant" and "plentiful" lands and waterways, you'll probably get cancer, be fined, or arrested. The things that once made this country great, now makes us full of fear, pain, or misery. We've poisoned the wells, salted the earth, and choked the air for our children, for what? Money? Power? No, arrogance. If I can't have it, tame it, control it, then, I will destroy it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our complacency, our laziness, our arrogance, our aggretion of all other inhabitants of our world, this will be our end. What made us great? We were the little guys trying to make ourselves heard, to be equal to the oligarchs. To not be tread upon, like ants in the dirt. We've lost our way. By letting others speak for us, we lose our voice. The people we choose to make us be heard, stop listening. What do men with power want? More power.
I don't mean to use a line out of a movie, but it explaines it perfectly. Most of us want to co-exist with one another, to see each other as brothers and sisters of the same world. Others see white, black, yellow, brown, gay, straight, crippled, or athletic. Catholic, Muslim, Bapstist, Witness, Budhist, Jewish. How about human? Or, Earthling? This is our downfall. There is always something that makes everyone else different from ourselves. When there is difference, there is a chance that you can seize that opportunity to feel superior for one reason another. You can save more money, spell better, have more, get more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Competition doesn't make us stronger or better. It divides us as a whole. As intelligent as we are, a hive of bees, a colony of ants, and even, a flock of buzzards, have a better chance of making this world a better place than humans do. Maybe our intelligence is what makes us so stupid and shallow.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you need to highlight my spelling or grammatical errors, then you are missing the message. Point, jeer, mock. Who cares? It is our competitive nature that is making us, our children and every other lifeform on earth, LOSE. When you see someone fail, help them succeed, to finish, to show them that winning doesn't mean they have to be the best, but be we, and not me.

       Rebel against what? Martyr for whom? You can't save this cesspool, but you can save yourself (and those you care for).  You have complete and total control over exactly one thing, and that thing will betray you if you don't tend to it.  (I'm not singling you out, this is for whoever reads)

       Who said rebel? Who said be a martyr? If you're so short sighted to think this is just about my life, then you'd be wrong. Yes, my life is the one that comes first in my life, but does that mean my life is the only one I consider? Perhaps I should only care about my kin?

       Sigh. You miss the point entirely. It's not about being happy. It's about thriving. You think this is about individualistic wants but it is beyond that. Look at r/conspiracy. What is everyone really saying? "We're all going to research and wait until everything REALLY hits the fan, then we'll be ready to act in earnest" How silly. And you're doing something similar. These details.. the laws, the police, the drama on tv, all of it pales in comparison to the
       <em>
        context
       </em>
       everyone is working around on this subreddit. And that context is this:
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       people will die if we do not act
       <em>
        right now
       </em>
       however we can. That does not only include 'normal' people (perhaps like you and I) that includes doctorates, astronauts, professors, soldiers, etc ALL stepping up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: In some ways "happiness" (and the subsequent search for amenities) has what has led us to this hedonistic apathetic destruction of ourselves and nature. We needn't only focus on such.

       One in the same, no? I've simply trained myself (over time) to not allow anyone or anything to interfere with my moral compass.

       If you're never able to accept the world for what it is you'll never be in a position to do anything about it. Please don't mistake my cavalier attitude of "me first" to mean I don't care about society, I do, and this is my way of managing my consciousness so that I may be in a position to help others.

       So... you're assuming something about me. That's all. We certainly don't disagree but I'll say this: when one is living happiness is not a necessary part of the equation to thrive. Sometimes you have to be fucked up on the inside too. Also my wife said this: if
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       is effecting your moral compass, how are you growing?

       We're totally on the same wave-length. I don't care about politics or what horror supposedly awaits us by our overlords. I'm focused on what you talked about: making myself and everything around me as best I can. And pushing others do the same. None of us have been absent. We've all been here watching this shit go down. As soon as we realize we're not alone and that we have a lot of work to do for all the right reasons.. then we'll get right.

       I like the way you think.
The enemy is strong because the enemy is connected. We are weak because we are isolated. If we communicated and cooperated, even those few of us who see the world for what it really is, we could alter it. 
The Buddha once walked the bountiful lands of India preaching peace and unity. Now there are no bountiful lands, and Buddhas are vagrants.

       I agree with you. The American continent was a chance to do something new and better. We squandered the resources and have built one of the most egregious political/economic systems yet devised, in under 250 years. It shows humanity is not capable of rational, sustainable, or equitable stewardship and will most probably extinguish itself and most of the other life on the planet. I do agree with the other posters as well. We have little hope when we examine the large scale history of humanity, but it is possible on a smaller scale.

       Why hold humanity responsible for the misdeeds of a (financial, economic, educational and medial) system that has quite obviously been hijacked by a small, devious minority a long time ago? A system that has demanded endless consumption, offered vapid distractions in lieu of information, trash for role models, fake politicians for leaders and complete egocentrism for culture is the principal cause of this mess -- why do you think the effin eye is

       of the pyramid? Yes, Americans let it come this far, through political negligence, intellectual incuriosity and a misguided faith in congenital superiority (plus insidious multi pronged manipulation), but Americans are not all of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The coming demise of the system is a giant chance to finally turn things around for good, and all you wanna do is sit there and legitimize the end of all mankind? Grow a pair and get a fucking grip!

       I know, instead of competing, lets all just give in and let the world be 100% controlled by the elites, ooops too late.  I think its the lack of competition and the lack of people realizing what team they are really on...

       You're exactly what this person is talking about. Rather than hear what they're saying you'd rather denounce it. Think about this: what is vague about togetherness? About life and freedom? We will make this planet our tomb if we continue to act like you do.
