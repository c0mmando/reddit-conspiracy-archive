       the usa got boston as a 'war on terror' refresher, the uk got this to motivate the troops, who were getting noisy about the 'war for opium' and to steer the narrative towards black african muslims, the new front in the 'war on usary haters &amp; resources'.

       I know in the US that Boston Marathon bombing didn't drum up any support for the war.  It did serve as a quick demonstration of how willing people are to allow martial law though.  I'm not in the UK so I dunno how this beheading was received over there and I don't wanna speak out of school as far as that goes.  I do see your point though and you could be right.

       not so much to drum up support for the war, as to ramp up the fear level again, to keep the pressure on as it were. so people wont question the funding, the checkpoints, the martial law, the switch to an african front etc

       Yeah that does make sense.  I'm still leaning towards this being an actual beheading but you do make some good points so I could be wrong.  To be honest with you this story was such a minor blip on the radar that I never even questioned it until now.

       But nothing came of it.  Nobody did anything.  It was talked about for a few days and then it went away and nothing really happened.  If people are going to run the risk of staging an event they're gonna make sure it yields results.

       I guess that isn't out of the realm of possibility but there are so many stories that papers/news-media can run with that faking something like this is a long way to go just to get a headline.  The unfortunate thing is that people have to ask these sorts of questions because media sucks so much that ya really can't trust what's being reported.

       Those are all pretty good reasons to create a distraction.  That being said, something "important" happens every day so that isn't enough evidence of "fuckery" being afoot for me.  I'm not ruling it out totally but I'm leaning towards this incident being legit.

       It is a piece of the pie.  A small event in the course if many planned events.  All with the very visible goal of destroying you.  Piece by piece.  By dividing all populations, and ensuring infighting so we do not band together to fight the real enemy of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts and evidence surrounding the event does prove that it wad staged.  Just as 7/7 was.  Do not fall victim to the lies pushed on you.  Actively call out their lies.  Hold then accountable for their crimes.  Be the nan you would look up to.

       The goal is to divide and conquer.  And they are doing a pretty good job, as we can see clearly today.  We must first identify these criminal attempts, call them out, and do everything to show that we are not that easy to control (and subsequently destroy). Love above all else.  Then directing every ounce of energy at the actual people that seek to destroy us.  Not the puppets they use to distract and control.

       I upvoted you to try and balance it out. I mean this is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       . I've never understood that about this sub, the idea of it is to discuss theories, we should upvote new threads with new ideas so that the garner more exposure, especially to those in the community who don't frequent the 'new' section. This would also show the outside community that we do have rational discussions here. They'd click on a thread like this and be thinking, "lets see what this circle jerk of bullshit is?" And then they'd open the thread and be confronted with a rational breakdown of why op is, or is not, a moron. The enjoyment of the sub is the discussion. Even if we don't agree with a title,or op's theory, we should upvote stuff like this because its something new and fun to discuss.

       I dunno, it seemed pretty authentic on the news when it was going down live. I know that doesn't count as anything more than anecdotal but they were broadcasting when the cops turned up and fucked them up, and showing the scene before and it certainly didn't look staged. The lack of people freaking out is pretty natural, most people had no idea wtf was going on, I'd be more suspect if people were giving a fuck about whats going on around them in London.

       yeah, they waited around to get picked up.. meanwhile they did a bizarre interview... then they ran at police. then they begged the police not to shoot them.   if these guys weren't on the most crazy drug I've never heard of, then they were fake.   fake as anything I've ever seen faked.

       It looked pretty real to me, shambolic, confused and in a mire of mostly people walking past not giving a fuck. An absolute different situation to the 'panic' stuff that implies a staged event. Just a pair of nutters did a murder, eh...

       That said, who knows who compelled them to do that, I would not be afraid of betting that some inside hand told them it was a good idea.

       But it wasn't fake, some innocent bloke died. and he was actually all stabbed up to fuck and run over, that bit certainly wasn't theatrics.

       you chop a guys head off you don't stand around giving interviews to bystanders making clichéd canned statements while you wait for the armed response unit to arrive.... then run at armed police with a knife and somehow live, they must be the worst shots in england. plus one of the "killers" background is or was almost certainly mi5, he was rescued by the sas in somalia for fuck sake.

       I do know the 'interview' is oddly edited, fuck knows why though, never considered it a conspiracy, I assume matey just said something unpalatable to TV news, which may be a conspiracy in of itself, but doesn't mean the thing was staged.

       yep thats when he says on the transcript something like 'this is all your fault ALL your wars in other countries' it was edited out, but not because of a conspiracy or not because this shit was staged, but because they are scared of telling the truth which mr stabby twat was saying,which he is kinda right about. Despite being a murdering fuck cunt who deserves to be in jail. But the public cant hear their legitamite reasons for their atrocities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not justifying them, just context. I still think they are fucking cunts, but yeah they edit out their main point because otherwise it'd serve as a good platform and there'd be copycat shit. (well, there wouldn't because nobody really wants to do that sht) but whatever.
