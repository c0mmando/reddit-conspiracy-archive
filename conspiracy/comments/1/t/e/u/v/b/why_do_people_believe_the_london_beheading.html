    <div class="md"><p>I know in the US that Boston Marathon bombing didn&#39;t drum up any support for the war.  It did serve as a quick demonstration of how willing people are to allow martial law though.  I&#39;m not in the UK so I dunno how this beheading was received over there and I don&#39;t wanna speak out of school as far as that goes.  I do see your point though and you could be right.</p>

I&#39;ve never understood that about this sub, the idea of it is to discuss theories, we should upvote new threads with new ideas so that the garner more exposure, especially to those in the community who don&#39;t frequent the &#39;new&#39; section. This would also show the outside community that we do have rational discussions here. They&#39;d click on a thread like this and be thinking, &quot;lets see what this circle jerk of bullshit is?&quot; And then they&#39;d open the thread and be confronted with a rational breakdown of why op is, or is not, a moron. The enjoyment of the sub is the discussion. Even if we don&#39;t agree with a title,or op&#39;s theory, we should upvote stuff like this because its something new and fun to discuss. </p>

<p>yeah, they waited around to get picked up.. meanwhile they did a bizarre interview... then they ran at police. then they begged the police not to shoot them.   if these guys weren&#39;t on the most crazy drug I&#39;ve never heard of, then they were fake.   fake as anything I&#39;ve ever seen faked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, the woman in the interview.. it was cut out on most news broadcasts, but made the original video.  </p>

<p>she walks right onto the set with her shopping, oblivious to the bizarre and gory scene to her left, and the bloody weapon wielding murderer doing a youtube interview on her right.    walks right past him... there&#39;s a bunch of people up the street, why didn&#39;t they stop her? poor woman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dudes were only threatening blokes who came up to them, a lass from cornwall (my neck of the woods) came and asked wtf? and they said some shit to her.</p>

<p>It&#39;s mental, but I cannot see how it was &#39;staged&#39;....like, facilitated by intelligence services enablers, sure, but actors? nope. Real people and a real dead body.</p>

<p>I was referring to the lady with the shopping, she just walks by briefly, you don&#39;t see in on the TV versions, they did a slick edit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cheers, yeah. My blood is 25% Doom Bar :D</p>

<p>I do know the &#39;interview&#39; is oddly edited, fuck knows why though, never considered it a conspiracy, I assume matey just said something unpalatable to TV news, which may be a conspiracy in of itself, but doesn&#39;t mean the thing was staged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yep thats when he says on the transcript something like &#39;this is all your fault ALL your wars in other countries&#39; it was edited out, but not because of a conspiracy or not because this shit was staged, but because they are scared of telling the truth which mr stabby twat was saying,which he is kinda right about. Despite being a murdering fuck cunt who deserves to be in jail. But the public cant hear their legitamite reasons for their atrocities.</p>

<p>Not justifying them, just context. I still think they are fucking cunts, but yeah they edit out their main point because otherwise it&#39;d serve as a good platform and there&#39;d be copycat shit. (well, there wouldn&#39;t because nobody really wants to do that sht) but whatever.</p>
