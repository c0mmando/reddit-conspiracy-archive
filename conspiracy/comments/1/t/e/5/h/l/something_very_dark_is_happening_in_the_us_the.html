Bombs going off all the time destabilizing the country and keeping it down(meanwhile no one knows who is causin the bombs... Is it the Sunni, the Shia the Kurds? lol it&#39;s probably us...  Meanwhile we got the president on our payroll and control of the natural resources.</p>

<p>We got some nice divisions here in the US, when the bombs start going off whose really going to be doing it?</p>

<p>strict adherence to non-violence, with broad international and non-partisan support.</p>

<p>did you look at the picture i linked? they never did actually occupy wall street itself. and they certainly didn&#39;t openly disobey police to maintain that occupation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>it all came to a halt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where do you think we all went? we&#39;re still here, still working. occupy isn&#39;t over, the economy still sucks and is getting worse. we&#39;re growing. the only question is when and how the next wave will break.</p>

<p>i advocate for a general strike, with real occupations of government and industry properties. massive civil disobedience. cross those police lines, refuse to disperse. refuse to submit to arrest. resist resist resist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  Not necessarily.  Doesn&#39;t work that clean, cut, and dry.  That&#39;s like saying &quot;if they actually are wolves, don&#39;t they already control the sheep?&quot;</p>

<p>The wolves can definitely fuck up the sheep, but it&#39;s only so long as the throng of sheep don&#39;t wake up and realize that they outnumber the wolves a thousand to one and <em>act</em> on it.  If they did, the wolves would be fucked...and the wolves in this case (in the form of TPTB) <em>know</em> this.  They know it&#39;s a balance that they must keep - often time through subtle and not so subtle manipulation - to keep the masses in check and confused and scared and on edge.  TPTB work hard at remaining in power, and they&#39;re in power not because they&#39;re soooo god almighty powerful that they have NOOOO chance of being overtaken by a 99% that&#39;s awake and aware and enlightened.  A 99% that is awake and aware and enlightened WOULD indeed do well against TPTB.  That&#39;s why TPTB work so hard and effectively at keeping the masses dumb and blind.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not as clean, cut, and dry as you think it is.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>First of all, I personally am not in that &quot;inner circle&quot; so I, like so many others, derive my knowledge and information about them from public records and personal investigation.  As such, I don&#39;t purport to know all that much that is all that different than some other critical thinkers and investigators out there.  I know enough to know that they are powerful enough to, among many other things, get away with raping and murdering people young and old alike.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you frequent conspiracy sites other than <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?  <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> doesn&#39;t focus solely on this subreddit, though of course they devote most of their attention here.</p>

<p>I mean, some people <em>do</em> post some Looney Tunes stuff on the internet.  For example, the other day I ran across some guy&#39;s personal site that said black people weren&#39;t actually human.  Like literally not people and that they were a plot to...I forget, do Bad Things to humanity.  That sort of stuff deserves ridicule, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Failed prediction after failed prediction after failed prediction, America should have been under martial law in 1994 or...wait...1997?  2003? Wait! Novermber 27th, 2012!  No?  And why didn&#39;t the world end last year?  Or on the 16th of <em>this</em> month?  Etc, etc.  I enjoy reading conspiracy theories myself, but there&#39;s <em>lot</em> of it that&#39;s pretty ridiculous, and <em>proven</em> to have been ridiculous/inaccurate because it didn&#39;t happen.  Tends not to inspire much confidence.  </p>

<p>Things <em>aren&#39;t</em> great, but they&#39;re <em>never</em> as bad (or get as bad) as <em>some</em> people 100% assure that they are or will be.  I&#39;m still alive, not in a FEMA camp and I ate a nice meal earlier.  According to some people, I should be living, for example, in the midst of Thunderdome-style post-apocalyptic mayhem (I stole that).  You know what I mean?  Maybe some day soon I won&#39;t have anything to eat, <em>maybe</em> there will be martial law, maybe various other terrible things will happen.  But anyone who tells me, in detail, what <em>will</em> happen or what the government <em>is</em> doing and <em>exactly</em> why, unless they give me a reason to trust what they have to say, is met with skepticism on my part.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>  The problem is that some conspiracy theorists jump from theorizing to speaking with absolute authority.  They&#39;re often proven wrong and that makes people doubt what other CTs say.  The Boy Who Cried Wolf is a well-known parable for a reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s why social democracy has been successful--socialism is an economic, not political term such as communism or democracy.  Capitalism is also an economic term.  In order to, as you said, sustain itself, capitalism has made it look like democracy and capitalism are the only natural partners, and have fooled a lot of people.  But democracy and socialism are at least as natural together as democracy and capitalism.  The problem is capitalism has taken our democracy from us and should be done away with.</p>

<p>Think about that the first corporations which came into being subjected entire continents! They are but another tool the of the rich and power, those that consider themselves rightful heirs of kings (not literally of course) And think how the first &quot;state&quot; was merely a &quot;corporation&quot; of armed men.</p>

<p>The government is really fucked up and is often subverted. But without it for example, the air would literally be smog and all the rivers would be horribly polluted. In fact the quality of our air and waters used to be way worse... it was only the horrible government that started to enforce air quality standards and prosecute the dumping of toxic waste into rivers. </p>

<p>Like gov is fucked up for sure... but I can&#39;t see how anyone would want to live in a state where the corps hold all the power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My wife had to travel about a month ago for her job. I drove her to the airport to drop her off, we live in a small town in NW Arkansas. I see and hear about all this stuff but never actually witness it due to where I live we&#39;ve practically been untouched by all of this. </p>

<p>So I walk her in to say farewell and that I love her. I was able to walk with her all the way to the security checkpoint in the airport. For the first time I saw the huge security scanner that scans your whole body.. I was instantly disgusted. I&#39;ve flown out of this tiny airport before and they never had this. Once they scanned my wife, which I told her to refuse, they were patting her down. They literally were touching her legs, which she was wearing the tights, and her thighs then up the her breasts. I yelled out, &quot;criminals&quot;. This shit is so wrong I could not help it.</p>

<p>But, what do ya do?? People just bend over and spread their butt checks and take it. Saying things like, &quot;Well if you don&#39;t go through or let them pat you down you can&#39;t fly.&quot; Sorry, I&#39;d be the one to refuse and quote my constitutional rights. I never signed anything to give them the right to molest me.  </p>

You cant refuse - you cant even get out of line once your in it without facing punishment, fines, and a possible cavity searth.  I am all for saying hell no, but there is no way to avoid a violent clash if you do. We as a collective have to decide at what point enough is enough, and let the chips fall where they may, hang the risks.  That or live in subjugation, and deal with it.  Sadly I think for the most part the latter is what were going to be looking at.  For all this talk about revolution, I have yet to see anyone actually DO much of anything. So many opportunities, so many chances, so many people standing on the sidelines watching, taking pics to post to reddit, but ulitmately remaining uninvolved. Most Americans think revolution is someone elses job, and so, here is where we find ourselves.  Flouridation works. </p>

<p>However if a cop is using a K-9 as an excuse to cavity search you without warrant you can definitely refuse.  Maybe they will take you to jail but you will force them to get a warrant, which seems unlikely in any of the above cases.</p>

I can&#39;t simply state that I am a human being with self respect and I don&#39;t want anyone to touch my penis or stick things in my ass. The reason this wasn&#39;t specifically mentioned in the constitution (although we do have search/seizure protections that apparently are being ignored) is because it is obvious that the government shouldn&#39;t be allowed to molest citizens under the guise of boogeymen or any other reason. You don&#39;t have to mention that in order for people to think it is wrong. But, I think they got us to accept it in other ways, like &quot;hernia checking&quot; so that we just think this is normal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to understand the link between these cases and the apparent agenda of &quot;the state&quot;. Where is the direct link? Do you all believe government agencies like the TSA all the way down to the police power force of the states are telling their employees to do this?</p>

<p>I guess where this falls apart is in the evidence. through only five examples are given, it spans two government agencies (TSA and border services) and at least one state(TX and I dunno about the David Eckert case). The oversight and communication required for the execution of such a varied operation is massive.</p>

<p>Further, I gotta say(on a kinda unrelated note to all that) that I don&#39;t believe government officials, between administration to rank-and-file members, would keep quiet about explicit directives like this.</p>

<p>I think /r/ conspiracy is full of shit sometimes. This is a fucking scary title followed by a bunch of unsubstantiated shit that draws conclusions only for people who already want to believe something this fucked up is happening on purpose.</p>

No, you will be a typical whiny and imposing American passing the blame for these things off to anyone but yourself because you refuse to acknowledge your part and complicity in the systems doing these things.

If you can&#39;t see what they are doing, then you will never understand the world you live in, you will just be a sad angry man your whole life, and probably do some very destructive things.

    <div class="md"><p>Legitimate problems or complaints, Indian diplomats and american citizens being internally invasively searched for insane reasons. Problems exist in the system exist, don&#39;t hesitate to point them out, but don&#39;t blow irrelevant things out of proportion to sell legitimate compaints. Don&#39;t be like my state congress representative, who came to my door with no understanding of the most basic local issues and problems. Her campaign advisor, or handler, pretty much point blank asked me if I voted for Obama, and having never voted, I lied and said yes. He immediately gave me a bullshit liberal pep talk, disengaged recognizing how stupid they looked, and moved on. Know what she ran and was elected on? Neighorhood postcards with kids in the park, pitching INSANE increases in sex offenders laws and regulations, and ridiculous expansions of qualifications to normalize things like listing people pissing in the park at 3 am. </p>

<p>People like they play on primal human instincts, and are in the end clueless puppets waiting to be tugged on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. It would be a policy issue. Some crazy asshole or two way at the top of the pyramid is doing this deliberately for some unknown reason (I&#39;m pretty sure I know what it is, but that can be talked about later).

    <div class="md"><p>No.  Not necessarily.  Doesn&#39;t work that clean, cut, and dry.  That&#39;s like saying &quot;if they actually are wolves, don&#39;t they already control the sheep?&quot;</p>

<p>The wolves can definitely fuck up the sheep, but it&#39;s only so long as the throng of sheep don&#39;t wake up and realize that they outnumber the wolves a thousand to one and <em>act</em> on it.  If they did, the wolves would be fucked...and the wolves in this case (in the form of TPTB) <em>know</em> this.  They know it&#39;s a balance that they must keep - often time through subtle and not so subtle manipulation - to keep the masses in check and confused and scared and on edge.  TPTB work hard at remaining in power, and they&#39;re in power not because they&#39;re soooo god almighty powerful that they have NOOOO chance of being overtaken by a 99% that&#39;s awake and aware and enlightened.  A 99% that is awake and aware and enlightened WOULD indeed do well against TPTB.  That&#39;s why TPTB work so hard and effectively at keeping the masses dumb and blind.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not as clean, cut, and dry as you think it is.</p>
