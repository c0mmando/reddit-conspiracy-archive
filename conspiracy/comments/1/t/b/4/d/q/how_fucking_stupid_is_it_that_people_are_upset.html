I had a thought about how cruel a joke on humanity it would be if this was the spark that started a revolution. It really is Idiocracy out there. I try and remain optimistic about the future but seeing this shit makes me wonder if we even deserve to make it.</p>

People pay $1000 or more for a ticket to watch the superbowl final game but whines to pay $10 or less for a book or something cultural, people pay hundreds of millions of dollars to stupid actors and football/basket/baseball/put-your-sport-here-players and researchers that are trying to discover some new thing and push the human knowledge forward struggle to get much less money for their researches.

    <div class="md"><p>Well... last year the Obama administration put a filmmaker in jail because he made a film that offended people.  So it&#39;s not really &quot;just a dumb reality show.&quot;  It&#39;s a culture test... are we as a culture ready to start doing this stuff, pillorying people for having a politically incorrect opinion?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think the Obama administration is watching this whole Duck Dynasty thing with eagle eyes, to determine if we the people are ready to be rolled up and stuffed into sacks yet?</p>

<p>Cuz if we are... if we are ready to start burning witches... every single person who has any kind of weirdo conspiracy opinion better shut up, hunker down, and get used to not speaking his or her mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it kinda goes hand in hand, you see.  If an organization will start to punish people for speech, then don&#39;t you think that organization will do other things?  </p>

<p>It all cascades... if you&#39;re willing to take people&#39;s money, then you&#39;re willing to lie to them.  If you&#39;re willing to lie to them, then you&#39;re willing to punish them for no crime.  If you&#39;re willing to punish people for no crime, you&#39;re willing to jail people for no crime.  If you&#39;re willing to jail people for now crime, you&#39;re willing to break out the concentration camps.</p>

<p>People seem dumb, but they can &quot;feel&quot; what&#39;s happening.  They just need something they can relate to.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s not really that people are getting fired up about dumb stuff, it&#39;s just that this is something they can relate to, and feel it.  It touches their lives.  Conspiracy types are the same, just we have a wider touch-net.</p>

<p>Now, understand that the goal of this idiot is to act like a story they don&#39;t care about, is practically a signal of end times.</p>

<p>Now, understand that he is a brave budding functionary, home schooled, maybe went to some xtian university to <em>learn</em> the &#39;evils&#39; of modern life and people, despite having never left his employer’s cubicle for more than a few moments to replace his M&amp;M rations ... this manchild has hopes and dreams for a better career., maybe even a cubicle closer to to the vending machines.</p>

<p>What does he do with the software and personas granted to him by his employers you ask? This never shaved kiddie stalks clumsily from sub to sub- seeking out posts that seem to be gaining the attention that the fairer sex would never grant him due to his awkwardness, the Iron Man posters on his bedroom wall, and his latent homo-erotic Gman desires, and the dream of a hot-hatchback on credit.</p>

<p>Sometimes I do believe all of the entertainment industry, looking at you too sports, solely exists to distract the masses. Just imagine the normal low-information voter who goes out to the polling booths. This persons knowledge of the candidates only consists of what they&#39;ve heard or seen through the entertainment outlet... Scary once you set back and analyze it. The American voters are the ones who we should be scared of. </p>

We are being pulled further and further apart and the more separated we become, the easier it is to manipulate and control us.  So much energy being wasted on these irrelevant distractions means less energy being focused on major impacting issues, bills and laws being indiscreetly passed, corporate and financial corruption being overlooked and downplayed.  I am personally fed up with, &quot;Tea Party this and Republican that...oh, look what those Democrats did, the Liberal Media is at it again.&quot;  I don&#39;t know how we can achieve it, but NOTHING will ever change if the American people can&#39;t come together as a united front against the government machine.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t watch the show, but I am aware that it is hugely popular, and every store has one or more prominent displays of Duck Dynasty t-shirts, mugs, etc.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t care less about the show, A&amp;E, bible-thumping, gay-bashing, or claims that he &#39;equated homosexuality with terrorism&#39;.</p>

<p>However, I am a huge fan of the first ammendment, freedom, capitalism, etc.  I actually think that these events HELP raise the discussion of FREEDOM into  the mainstream.  Think of all the conversation right now about how he has the right to say what he believes; how the gays have the right to bitch about it; how A&amp;E has the right to fire them; and how they have the right to take their billion dollar business empire elsewhere.</p>

<p>When people talk about freedom, its a good thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because it is easier to be upset about little things and you don&#39;t get called a conspiracy nutter for having an opinion on a reality show. I think people know that a show on TV doesn&#39;t really effect their lives, therefore; it is easier to get riled up about it. Once something real happens, like with government, they turn a blind eye because it is like sensory overload and they can&#39;t handle real reality.</p>

<p>B) Isn&#39;t there something worthwhile to post rather than just a complaint about how crappy things are?  At least show us something cool or important or that at least tells me something.  There&#39;s already plenty of whinging going on about how crappy things are on Reddit and elsewhere.</p>

<p>On one hand: Tell that to the hundreds of millions who have died violently for the sake of defining and preserving our freedoms. They fought in both public forums and literal battlefields so that everyone could enjoy the freedoms that every human deserves.</p>

<p>On the other hand: Our infantile, uninformed, bickering, childish population is too ignorant to understand what they have because they have never really seen firsthand the product of a society that lacks essential freedoms. So maybe it&#39;s not that they don&#39;t deserve it, it&#39;s that they don&#39;t know what&#39;s been created for them over the last +/-250 years until their sorry asses have lost it because of their collective ignorance.</p>
