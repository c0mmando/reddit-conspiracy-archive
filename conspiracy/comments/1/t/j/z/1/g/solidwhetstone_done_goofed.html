        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The solidwhetstone debacle changed my opinion on this.  I think he should step down.  I supported him highly with the redesign, but going to conspiratard for advice was wrong and shows he misunderstands the community. Why?  </p>

<p>1) Conspiracies are an interest.  It&#39;s a genre of thought.  The internet is for free communication and reddit is set up to organize around interests or genres of thought.  </p>

<p>2) It doesn&#39;t matter why I am interested in conspiracies.  It isn&#39;t a &#39;hate group.&#39;  People come to this way of thinking for a lot of reasons.  Many are from people&#39;s own experiences where they&#39;ve witnessed bullshit and gone down the road of not trusting official stories.  Often these are the most interesting people.   </p>

<p>3) This is why conspiracy has grown from around 40k when I stared using it to 204k today.  </p>

<p>4) In this time a lot of criticism popped up surrounding this forum.  </p>

<p>5) Often that criticism has been proven wrong. (See: Snowden docs)  </p>

<p>6) The criticism hasn&#39;t stopped.  If anything it got worse even after many &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; were proven right.  </p>

<p>7) The powers that be do actually set out encourage and reinforce  derision and mockery of those that question them.  </p>

<p>8) This derision and mockery is therefore political with political aims other than the quest for truth.  </p>

<p>9) The point of this sub is not to accomplish a set of political aims but rather to search for truth.  </p>

<p>10) People in conspiratard understand none of this and are actually among the dumbest, least interesting people on reddit.  Their sub only exists because of what bad asses exist in this one, who say interesting shit that I like to read.  Going to them for advice is like the owner of a steak shop going to McDonalds to ask how to cook meat.   Of course they say &quot;serve shitty hamburgers.&quot;  Of course they do.  And we, the constituents of the steak place, don&#39;t want an owner with shitty taste.</p>

<p>Solidwhetstone fucked up, not because he &#39;betrayed&quot; anyone, but because he doesn&#39;t understand why people like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  He has bad taste.  Please can we have a mod that loves free speech for its own sake and understands that history with a hint of crazy or social commentary with a hint of crazy is all that we can stomach in a world filled with Barbie-doll TV presenters spouting bullshit at us 24/7.  </p>

<p>The only ones crazy in this world are the ones that think they are sane.</p>

A mod tried to make overarching changes without consulting the subscribers, he and his coterie were booted unceremoniously. Scads of socks came into the sub clamoring for reinstatement. And so, those abusive mods were reinstated. </p>

<p>This sub is under siege from controlled opposition. This will always be the case. This sub also DOESN&#39;T NEED MODERATION besides spam removal. But that will never happen either. Just stay vigilant and be sure to downvote/report. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course you&#39;re right. I can understand why people think were crazy in this sub, most people just can&#39;t handle the cognitive dissonance that 911 causes.

<p>But for one of the mods here to go to another sub to ask how to &quot;make it better&quot;? What the fuck is that? And he also unbanned a bunch of people. Im banned from posting here and this is my sub and I consider it my community. And I&#39;ve never been given an explanation as to why I can&#39;t post anymore. So one of the mods from my community went over to an openly hostile community and unbanned them, but im here fucking banned in my own community. Its such a fucking fraud.</p>

<p>Yep.  That&#39;s been my experience.  I&#39;ve seen good contributors like Amos_Quitos and Max something or rather, get banned recently for shit they should not have been banned for (false allegations of &quot;racism&quot;), and these trolls get to post here unmolested.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yah fuck him.  He should quit if he sees it as a problem. I dont&#39; get what he&#39;s getting out of it.  I think he&#39;s some youngish guy who found himself mod of a sub with 200K people and decided to make it appropriate so that he could leverage it for career gain or to pad his CV somehow.  I think that&#39;s the problem with most mods on reddit, especially once reddit got recognized by the mainstream.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s anyway why I think he&#39;s concerned with making us presentable.  Which will ruin the content and make the sub boring.</p>

<p>Do you honestly believe that shit? &quot;Padding&quot; your resume/CV with information about a forum you moderated? Might be padding if you&#39;re a complete loser with nothing else and no previous work experience to put on your resume.</p>

<p>Seems like such a silly concept to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, but some people sincerely believe they are trying to help. I honestly don&#39;t see reaching out to another subreddit, even conspiratard, as bad. I mean, he didn&#39;t make them mods here, or anything overly silly. He simply asked a group critical of this subreddit what they would seriously change if given the option. Doesn&#39;t mean he was going to do everything they said, and thus far it&#39;s important to note he&#39;s done nothing. But straight up criticism, from the people who would be the harshest, does have some value in it. Take all of it seriously? <em>Hell no</em>. But be fair enough to realize recurring themes and take an open-minded look at them? To me that&#39;s a good thing.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m obviously in the minority opinion here, and I mostly just lurk this sub. It doesn&#39;t really matter which direction this issue goes, but I would consider this whole mess a gross over-reaction by the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subscribers. I mean, people aren&#39;t mad because he made any changes, <em>they are mad because he even talked to them</em>. It&#39;s silly and childish.</p>

<p>It looks bad and is hard to read.  That outweighs any other factor such as, &quot;making bad and hard-to-read layouts is difficult and time-consuming labor.&quot;</p>

<p>Objective example: If a thread is collapsed, it &quot;out-dents.&quot;  If you&#39;ve studied UX and computer-human interfaces, that isn&#39;t a matter that can be chalked up to taste, that&#39;s incompetent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So from a professional standpoint, I stuck up to him</p>

<p>I suggest you ditch the freemason/union mind-set, and instead read up on things like UX eye-tracking studies, P250 brain wave measuring, and objective, quantitative measures of good interfaces.  </p>

<p>Even if you only read studies on fonts and reading comprehension, you can recognize an incompetent CHI design such as that which Solidwhetstone presented.  The font choice alone was incompetent.</p>

<p>But I see Solidwhetstone is from Chicago, and I am from Seattle.  So the standards of competence at UX are different.</p>

<p>It is a lot worse than that.  Some of the people who attack <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are criminals or in their pay.  This is not a social event and an intelligent person does not seek out the approval or company of criminals.</p>

<p>There is something obvious they have in common: Solidwhetstone has decided that he needs to change the appeal of this subreddit.  He apparently wants it to appeal more to the type of person who would not likely agree with many conspiracy theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say it&#39;s more like the MPAA going to piratebay to ask for advice on how it could change its practices in order to reduce the need for piracy. Pirates have helped the gaming industry understand how some practices intended to curb piracy actually curb sales and promote piracy. As a result we are now seeing workable sales models that remove the incentive to pirate. Likewise with this sub - by asking the ones who criticize us the most how we could better improve so they have less to criticize, we might learn a thing or two.</p>

<p>Because there <em>was</em> some useful advice given by a few users. Namely - the accusation of &#39;shill&#39; is too often used like the Godwin&#39;s Law of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. It&#39;s used to derail and discredit without requiring any kind of burden of proof and is often used indiscriminately on anyone who doesn&#39;t apply to the particular groupthink at hand. If we consider this accusation to be a personal attack and moderate it accordingly, it might cut down on a lot of derailment. The call for better evidence is difficult to actually adhere to, considering that the things we are dealing with, if true, have been subject to a systematic campaign of evidence removal and suppression. It means that even insiders are going to have a hard time providing the kind of evidence that regular society demands, without getting themselves killed. </p>

The fact you do not understand this is just one more reason to go. Have some dignity and admit this subreddit overwhelmingly wants you out. Show some humility please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t think it&#39;s an issue this subreddit is looked down on? It&#39;d be benefical for society as whole to have the threads on this subreddit be about real or even remotely credible conspiracies. There are real conspiracies out there, and they are drowned out by all the unsourced blogspam and debunked pseudoscience.</p>

<p>It might be just an intrest to you, but this stuff is actually of importance and real world consequence. Currently it&#39;s impossible to tell if single true, fact-backed conspiracy was getting supressed on this subreddit, and even if it wasn&#39;t, no one outside this subreddit would care. I&#39;d be dismissed based on the general post quality.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> being a conspiracy to drown out true conspiracies by managing the visibility, both by having them downvoted and discrediting the communuty with circlejerking, racism and threats is more likely to be true than most content here.</p>

<p>People will always look down on fringe ideas, which is the biggest reason for this subreddit existing.

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re going to make a post on such a serious topic, could you at least form coherent thoughts?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracies are an interest. It&#39;s a genre of thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, conspiracies are not some hobby. &quot;Conspiracy hypothesizing&quot; is, however. A &quot;genre of thought&quot; related to conspiracies might be &quot;curiosity&quot; or &quot;paranoia&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It isn&#39;t a &#39;hate group.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On paper, no. Racism against Jews is extremely prevalent (look at the latest posts about a Fed appointee). As soon as someone with an Israeli or Jewish background shows up in the spotlight, it&#39;s open season on them. I&#39;ve yet to see &quot;Christian judge presiding over altar boy rape case!&quot; or something along those lines.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is why conspiracy has grown from around 40k when I stared using it to 204k today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite &lt;1% actually being active at any one time, and far fewer even commenting. R/conspiracy is one of the least active sites I&#39;ve ever seen with over 150k subscribers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Often that criticism has been proven wrong. (See: Snowden docs)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&lt;1% of the time something coming true that was &quot;predicted&quot; isn&#39;t &quot;often&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If anything it got worse even after many &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; were proven right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Many&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The powers that be do actually set out encourage and reinforce derision and mockery of those that question them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perfect example: This post and the dozens of downvotes awaiting me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This derision and mockery is therefore political with political aims other than the quest for truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, you know, acting in a human way to those spouting unsubstantiated claims whilst they insult others for not thinking in the exact manner they do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point of this sub is not to accomplish a set of political aims but rather to search for truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then what&#39;s your problem with solidwhetstone? Looks like his intentions line up perfectly with that statement. And if this sub really cared about the truth (it doesn&#39;t, because this subreddit is r/conspiracy and that means EVERYTHING has to be a conspiracy, or else it doesn&#39;t fit in the sub), a LOT of links on the frontpage of this sub should be taken down after a reader points out how wrong a point or video or blog post is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People in conspiratard understand none of this and are actually among the dumbest, least interesting people on reddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So much for &quot;not a &#39;hate group&#39;&quot;. Way to take the high road!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their sub only exists because of what bad asses exist in this one, who say interesting shit that I like to read.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So just making things up that are proven false after 10 seconds of Google makes someone a bad ass? Has life devolved to this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only ones crazy in this world are the ones that think they are sane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So self-awareness is non-existent? Or a bad thing? Or...?</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t get why this solidwhetstone has everyone&#39;s panties in a bundle. Did anyone even read the threads? All that came of it was &quot;Hey, solidwhetstone! Enforce the rules that already exist!&quot; How is that unreasonable? Reddit isn&#39;t some right that&#39;s owned and bestowed to us. It&#39;s a private website whose content is determined by the readers. If you think the mods suck, just go to the websites that hosted the original information; they haven&#39;t gone anywhere. Want to stay here and discuss things? Sort by &quot;new&quot; and disable your negative karma cutoff for reading comments. There needs to be less attempts to discredit people because of Internet points and more addressing of the content of their comments.</p>

<p>Now for downvotes and insults from <a href="/u/thefuckingtoe">/u/thefuckingtoe</a> and <a href="/u/LeadHelmetsBlockEMF">/u/LeadHelmetsBlockEMF</a></p>

<p>Then this place is simply not for you genius. Your values do not adhere to the spirit of this subreddit, so I suggest you respect the way things are done here, or go back to whatever shithole you feel comfortable in.

<p>Just look through a few of the soldwhetstone threads. You will see people calling for a ban of anyone who subscribes to a subreddit they don&#39;t like. It&#39;s right there in the comments. Easy to see.</p>

<p>The ban is to stop trolls who add no value.  Trolls whose only intent is to mock and disrupt.</p>

<p>Someone genuinely interested in discussing conspiracy theories would not partake in the juvenile trolling at that place.</p>

<p>Of course I would have a process where conspiratard trolls could prove their good faith and get unbanned.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get the &quot;internet warrior&quot; stuff. Is that supposed to be some sort of attack? I find the subreddit mildly amusing. I also find some good info. I also see straight up crazy.

<p>But no need to start attacking me because I say I post some factual data and get downvoted/attacked. Some people in this subreddit are VERY married to their delusions. Newtown didn&#39;t exist, for example. If you think I&#39;m going to accept &quot;truth is subjective&quot; regarding the existence of the actual town of Newtown, I (again) feel sorry for you.</p>

<p>My assumption was correct.  A poster concern trolling this sub and calling us &quot;you guys&quot; and making false claims is <em>actually a conspiratard troll.</em>  Gee, chalk one up for a conspiracy theorist&#39;s intuition and good sense.  </p>

<p>I correctly identified you based on your behavior.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people in this subreddit are VERY married to their delusions. Newtown didn&#39;t exist . . . </p>

<p>I think you intentionally misstate the theory.  Most people who suspect a hoax don&#39;t think the town didn&#39;t exist.  And some people suspect the school was not in active service, not that the town didn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Anyway, hoax theories in general and the Sandy Hook hoax in particular are valid theories so if this is your example of &quot;delusion&quot; than you are no truth teller as you claim.</p>

<p>So I can only surmise that the &quot;factual&quot; data you posted falls short of being &quot;factual,&quot; but you didn&#39;t actually link to your example.</p>

<p>So please show us the example of how you got mocked for posting &quot;factual&quot; data . . . my conspiracy theory spidey senses tell me you&#39;re bullshitting and I want to go 2 for 2.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an observation about your motivation posting here.  It&#39;s a criticism because you appear to be exhibiting the same behavior the conspiratard people (a sub you frequent) makes fun of people here for--fancying themselves as spreading the truth to the &quot;sheeple.&quot;  </p>

<p>Again, I see your confirmation bias rules your judgement. You pick and choose from my comments to feed your need. I&#39;m sorry your judgement is so clouded.</p>

<p>As I said before: This subreddit is an alamgam. Some bizarre, some funny, some interesting, some thougtful. It is up to me to sift through. YOU however, seem to feel the need to defend everything posted here. Internet Warrior indeed.</p>

<p>I feel no such need. I am my own man.</p>

<p>There&#39;s absolutely <em>nothing</em> political about derision and mockery for those who post completely unsourced data, or upvote news items actually taken from satirical websites. </p>

<p>I was, however, particularly amused by your comparing this reddit to a steak shop. It&#39;s more like a street taco stand run by a vagrant with sinus problems. McDonalds may not be perfect, but can still offer a lesson in basic food preparation hygiene.</p>

I have never made a single decision about this subreddit without first getting the sign off from the mod team.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re asking me if I should resign because I posted a discussion thread on another subreddit- well I find that a bit confusing. Would you also want to ban a moderator of <a href="/r/libertarian">/r/libertarian</a> for posting in <a href="/r/conservative">/r/conservative</a>?
