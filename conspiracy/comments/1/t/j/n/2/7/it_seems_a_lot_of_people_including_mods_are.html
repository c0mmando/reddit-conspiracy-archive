        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am a long time frequenter and contributor of this subreddit, had a different account previously. I have been through the numerous scandals, including the attacks, the dilution, and misinformation, so here&#39;s my take on it. </p>

<p>This subreddit has always been a quagmire. A place to sift through the most outlandish ideas until you reach your own grains of gold. This place <strong>IS NOT</strong> a political tool to change anything. We have all kinds of different people with varying political adherents that come together for <strong>ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY, unfiltered content</strong>. That&#39;s it, end of story, case closed. It&#39;s for people who are fed up with labels and prejudice.</p>

<p>Moderators like <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a> may have good intentions by saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve decided to stay on as a mod because I believe in the idea that places like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> should exist to call out what governments are doing behind their citizens backs.</p>

<p>The community has a really bad reputation all over reddit, so I&#39;m here to try to change that. It might come through better sidebar rules, or just better thought leadership. I&#39;m not sure yet what the solution will be, but that&#39;s why I&#39;m there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes him completely unqualified to moderate this subreddit. Most of us don&#39;t give a flying fuck about what other subreddits think of this place. Because we all know that regardless of criticism against <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, sooner or later a good story ends up on the front page anyway, since there&#39;s always something for everyone. </p>

<p>The whole essence of this place is how political opposites like socialists and libertarians can gather for one purpose: truth-seeking without stigma. If you as a moderator try to force your political agenda through (like <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a>), you pretty much ruin the fabric of this subreddit. A politically defined, radical website is easily controlled by authorities. Losing this place means we must turn towards something like 4chan, but there we have to sift through the disgusting racism before anything else.</p>

<p>Call us &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; all you want, but don&#39;t ruin the only outlet that doesn&#39;t revolve around the status quo. </p>

<p>Which makes for a very poor mod. Ever since this sub began, I&#39;ve never asked for a mod to step down. Now I have personally asked solidwhetstone to step down <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tix3s/wtf_why_is_solidwhetstone_talking_to/ce8wkjm?context=3">in another thread</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our glorious mod <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a> said to our friends in r/conspiritard:</p>

<p>Well it&#39;s very damning and man I&#39;m not sure what to do. I don&#39;t have enough time with my day job to spend reading through all of the comments on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>[1] . With community guidelines and subreddit design alone I have been pretty tied up. Let me take a look at bringing in the guys at <a href="/r/chicago">/r/chicago</a>[2] who setup automod for racism over there. They did a killer job and we get notified of racist content all the time. I truly haven&#39;t seen the racism you&#39;re talking about- but I only have time to dig into the comments on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>[3] once every few days. It&#39;s really not been the highest priority for me lately.
Let me talk to my other guys and see if any of them can help us out in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>[4] and clean up the racism. Thanks for bringing it up!</p>

Other than than that, anything which induces discussion should be fairgame.  Is it up to the community to discern what should be given attention?  Yes, I think that is the point like this.  Mods should maybe have a roll to fill when that process is disrupted by trolls bent on disruption of that information.</p>

<p>Mods should monitor blog spam and threats of violence.  As far as the neoconservative agenda of subs like conspiratard and nolibs, there are people from those subs who DO add to the discussion here.  There are also trolls who are here to detract from discussion and influence the flow of information.  </p>

<p>As far as the types of speech that should not be acceptable, I think threat of violence should be the only thing banned.  &quot;Hate speech&quot; should be protected as it offers a point for discussion.  I think we need to be careful when racism is being upvoted as that might be indicative of trolling or an unwelcome element.  But as it stands I see more racism in the default subs that I do here.  If a very few members here want to blame the Jews for this or that, this sub should certainly be a safe haven for those discussions.  But more than anything, the neoconservatives want to associate  &quot;conspiracy&quot; with &quot;jew hating&quot; so we need to be aware that this will be ammunition in their propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had this sub on my front page since I&#39;ve started but its getting out of hand with some ridiculous posts.  I&#39;m all for exposing truth but some of the shit posted is so wrong that its becoming a nuisance.  Do people fact check this shit being posted on obsolete blogs or what? It really hurts the cause and it blows sifting through the garbage.  </p>

<p>I stopped clicking on shit that contains beforeitsnews and other sites like that.  Is that a sponsor of this sub or on auto feed? I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve read anying credible on that site... ever.  There&#39;s a few other sites like that being posted on this sub daily that are credibility killers.   </p>

<p>Before being allowed to post shit on this sub people should be forced to learn discernment and learn what the fuck disinfo and misinformation is.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the beauty of this place!</p>

<p>Anyone insane enough to browse <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> knows how to filter out the truth from the bullshit. And that responsibility lies with <strong>YOU</strong>. Otherwise, many of the true articles that you have enjoyed wont ever reach your attention. All news outlets are biased one way or the other, that&#39;s an inevitability. By removing the filters, you are your own news-director. </p>

<p>Me personally, the alien stuff gives me a good laugh, but I don&#39;t judge by downvoting, because I expect everyone else to not downvote the stuff I want to read. I also recognize the pitfalls of the dis- and misinformation you mentioned, which is why I can enjoy this place. The same dis- and misinfo exists in newspapers, but there it&#39;s taken for granted. </p>

<p>but its also promoted by well paid professionals hiding behind the curtain, we had a person giving a UFO and alien abduction story yesterday or so, surprise surprise there was a program on SyFy early this morning almost word for word, had the misfortune to wake up with that crap on the TV.</p>

<p>methinks they know people fall asleep watching TV, so wild alien abduction/UFO shows get placed on TV at times when people might be half asleep or be waking up to them, subliminal programming during sleep etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly, when people make posts like this it just makes it really obvious that you haven&#39;t been reading <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> very long. i&#39;ve only lurked here a couple years, and up until a little over a year ago, the content here was about <em>actual conspiracies and cover-ups</em>. we&#39;re talking aliens, ancient civilizations, crazy sci-fi shit, etc. </p>

<p>there was other political and economic content too, but it wasn&#39;t the rehashed blog-spam nonsense that this subreddit is today. yeah, okay, i&#39;m well aware that governments and the oligarchy are corrupt. i don&#39;t need to read 19/20 links on the front page about this.</p>

<p>obviously you can separate the obvious BS from the real content. so why are you even complaining about it? just downvote it - that&#39;s what the feature is for. these kinds of whine posts are just so dumb and so pointless. &quot;it really hurts the cause&quot;. huh? what cause would that be? i wasn&#39;t aware that this subreddit was united behind a &quot;cause&quot; other than the free flow and sharing of information. if so, that would sound awfully like a....conspiracy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a person has to be an observer, AND be able to sift the gold from the crap.</p>

<p>the SyFy channel and all the other junk cable channels are chock full of UFO, Bigfoot and ancient alien garbage.</p>

<p>that sort of stuff is design to be a distraction from real issues, ie corruption, theft, war, brutality, hoaxes, and all the wondrous stuff that politicians and criminals foist on the public.</p>

<p>use your eyes, use your ears, use your brain, use judgement.</p>

<p>remember events that fall under the &#39;conspiracy&#39; title often are very complex and multifaceted, narratives that the average MSM suits/anchor cannot follow, they tend to be hired for their looks not their brains.</p>

<p>they make mistakes, they tell stories that are full of holes and counter truths, they tend to blow their own official stories out of the water long before the CT crowd takes a look.</p>
