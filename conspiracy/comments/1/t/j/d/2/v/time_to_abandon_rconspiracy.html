       Guys, it seems that I cant read a single thread anymore without the second comment being someone trying to derail the conversation for no reason or spouting a bunch of ill-researched or MSM-fed bs to quickly try to discredit the authenticity of the information provided by the people posting. And now with solidwhetstone actually asking r/conspiriTARD for advice on how to "improve" this sub, i really have to ask, is this place dead?
      </p>
      <p>
       People can sometimes post poorly researched articles and say some extreme stuff on r/conspiracy, but hey welcome to the internet. Not like it doesn't happen on other subs. And even when it does there aren't many subs I can think of devoted purely to discrediting the other and stifling open discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its too hard to get information out through this sub when its constantly being censored and attacked blatantly. We have one of the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mods now working with people whose favorite troll sub has the offensive name 'conspiritard' yet they are the ones pointing fingers calling us rude, racist and what not. It's the biggest joke I have ever seen and these people are hypocrites and liars. Worst of all the mods are practically encouraging it now. If you need any proof that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is infiltrated then look no further. Why would we request help from people who come here and downright insult people rather than provide real constructive criticism?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now some may take this the wrong way and even call me a shill for wanting people to stop using this place, but I only say it because the corruption on not only this sub but Reddit overall is pretty blatant. Its a shame but I'm concerned that we need to find a new place, with new just moderators to help discuss current events and get the word out to people who will actually listen.

       Don't forget the ubiquitous "Where's the conspiracy?" comment. That one really irks me.

      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has evolved into something much bigger than a place to bandy about various conspiracy theories.

      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       has become my number one news source, and I'm sure I'm not alone. Obviously there is some danger in this, but as long as you keep a level head, this place is
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       informative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the comments that attempt to derail are informative, for they often are indicators that whatever is being discussed is important enough to attempt to derail in the first place.

      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       will continue to flourish, but as its popularity grows, so will the attacks on our integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's definitely time to support some of the smaller subs. There will always be a time and place for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , and there will always be drama here, but it really can't hurt to spread out a bit.

       From what I can see he's a pretty thoughtful guy who didn't realise how reactionary and kneejerky you guys can be. Seriously, you're like a herd of cats, which is why you'll never accomplish your goals. You spend too much time undermining each other, and not seeing other people's perspectives.

       He went over and talk to the people over there

       The trouble is you treat this like there's some sort of "race" between the two subreddits. The thing is there's no race. There's not even a game going on.

       Dude, there's no goal.  You have no idea how I see anyone else's perspective, or even who I am.  You've brought your own ideas to this discussion.  I'd much rather be in a herd of cats than a herd of anything else.  I have no political aspirations or even opinions.  I've lived through a revolution, seen twice the rise of fascism, and most of my friends have grown in or around war.  I have no reason to fight for anything except free speech and open internet which I think MIGHT have the possibility of dragging mankind out of the mediocre haze of bullshit in which he currently finds himself.

       But thank you for your casual condescension.  It's why I choose to avoid people like you in my actual life.

       Virtually everything mentioned on that sub recently about
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is connected to the silly arguments people are having here about mods, and that's because he went
       <em>
        there
       </em>
       to talk to those people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you look, that's a minority of the posts.
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       just isn't that important to
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       . It's mainly looking at the silliest conspirational beliefs on the internet as a whole. If this subreddit wasn't on the same website as them, you'd likely never get a look-in.

       Ignore Antique Jetpack and let them turn the free flow of information into PR dollars, or work within their system to stop them. I've made my choice and I see by your ad hominems that you have yet to arrive at the point where the decision is even within your reach.

       I agree, this sub has become a source for news that you can't find most other places. It is also highly entertaining. I like to think that my posts contribute both to the useful information here and to the entertainment value of the sub. This place is lively intellectually.

       Of course they take the quote completely out of context. I didn't say this sub is my
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       news source, it's just my favorite because of how dynamic and interactive it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Following "conspiracies" (both real
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       imagined/fabricated) is a good way to keep abreast of
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       being discussed in the world. Frequenting
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       for news and information by no means you have to believe everything you read here, in fact the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to be careful and keep a level head, as I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I also just wanted to say that it's a pleasure speaking with you Mr. Brzezinski, but you're a huge dick for what you did to Mika.

       See? That's why I say we either start over fresh as a private sub, or move to r/conspiracyv2 which is a private sub, or change this sub to a private sub. That would be the end of r/conspiratard and their downvote brigading. Obviously the Reddit admins do fuck all about subs votebrigading subs like r/conspiratard or r/SRS so we have to help ourselves

       I would agree but that he's done a piss poor job defending his actions.  He's talked to the conspiritards like humans as you said, but all his responses to his own users have been condescending and insulting.

       I think a lot of it comes from text having no tone, so when someone who may disagree with you reads your comment, they may "hear" it in their head in whatever tone they bring to the table. Then they respond work with what they think is a reasonable, perhaps snide remark, which you "hear" in your head with its own tone, further exacerbating the situation.

       The problem is that this place has so many eyes. We're under attack because we have so many readers. By splintering we hand over victory to those forces who want this sub stopped at all costs.

      <p>
       Something has to be done. It is most likely adding a few mods who can dish out bans to trolls/brigaders more often.

       Nobody wants this sub stopped at all costs. This sub has only 205k subscribers, not all of which conform to the subs theme. This sub is not a threat to anybody, especially when it frequently pushes people away with the abrasive attitude of it's general population. Get over yourself.

       Right, so the mods here weren't ordered to prevent reporting on meta reddit censorship?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty clear reddit inc has vested conflicts of interest with Antique Jetpack and NYRD labs (amoung others), and I think
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is one of the last "big" subs left without a compromised mod team. So perhaps you may want to get over your naive and irrelevant opinion?

       You're right, of course. How could I have ever thought I had enough clout to opine with the powerhouses that that work from the shadows of r/conspiracy? Truely, I have little choice but to sit in wonder as r/conspiracy changes the world and eliminates shills.

       If I were to venture a guess in earnest as to why
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       poses a threat to reddit inc it would most certainly be the reporting on meta censorship within reddit inc that occurs on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I have no problem with shills existing. What I don't like is when a news aggregate purports to hold the free flow of information in high esteem (as you know, one of her founders died in furtherance of that cause), while some of her board members and admins simultaneously run PR firms to manipulate the public image of companies, record labels, and others in the public eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, this sub will certainly continue to expose PR firms on reddit. And I'm honored to be a part of it. I'm sure that behind the veneer of your snarky sarcasm you're able to comprehend what's going on.

You'll understand if I stand over there to avoid whatever shrapnel might find me were I standing too close when r/conspiracy is stopped? Really though, keep up the good work, I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have r/conspiracy championing for truth and justice.

       How about you do something to help then instead of talking like we should abandon this sub? You are a mod here and you can help straighten this out. We are starting to gather real numbers and with that comes more trolls and more problems, this is to be expected. Don't encourage this community to fracture now, that will just push us to the fringes again.

       Please don't leave yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it has been said by many people that we want a new discussion place, but unless there is a place to go, don't leave just yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am working on crafting a site similar to Reddit/Dig, but it is hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       The good thing about Reddit = voting
      </p>
      <p>
       "group think" will push popular ideas to the top, and unpopular ideas down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once we all agree on something, it is easy to make that idea visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing I like is how everyone can be somewhat anonymous. This allows everyone to freely speak their mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bad?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone can have 1000's of accounts, assign them to bots, and manipulate the votes. This way, a single person can control the ideas of the group.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Private" subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing posted on Reddit is "private". No one is completely anonymous, so there is no such thing as complete privacy. If you want to have a private discussion, it can be done face-to-face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shadow-Bans and banning in general. If everyone truly had a single vote per comment, there would be no need to ban. If a comment is filled with hate-speech, and the group doesn't like it, the idea/comment will never see the light of day. (no reason to ban) If the group liked it, then I also don't see a reason to ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, control of information == bad
      </p>
      <p>
       Private Messages are also bad. They do nothing to help discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have made a better post in the past, but it was buried, and no one responded.
      </p>
      <p>
       What am I building?
      </p>
      <p>
       A stripped down version of Reddit, with extra features.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feature 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Per subReddit questionnaire - Even though I believe that everyone has the right to speak up and be heard, some peoples opinion carry more weight than others. For example, I don't care about Obama's opinion on internet privacy. He is a politician, not a network administrator or even a psychologist.
      </p>
      <p>
       How will a questionnaire help?
      </p>
      <p>
       I start a "sub" about running, and create a question. Everyone who answers my question correctly will have +1 added to their vote "weight" in that sub. This leads to the following: people who answer a lot of questions correctly are known to be more knowledgeable about discussions in the sub, and therefore their opinion carries more weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who "actively" participates in the sub will also gain more vote-weight.
This means that people who know nothing about running can still display an interest in running. And as the system learns about their interest, it will grant more vote-weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feature 2.
No more cross posts. Instead, threads can be submitted to multiple hubs at the same time. This will lead to much better discussions.
For example: I can post a thread about a shoe, to both
       <a href="/r/fashion">
        /r/fashion
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/running">
        /r/running
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I still need to think about how the vote-weight will work in this scenario, since I don't want power-users to spam smaller subs with their content.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feature 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sub-subreddits. Instead of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/911truth">
        /r/911truth
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/collapse">
        /r/collapse
       </a>
       , I like to structure as
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="/r/conspiracy/911/">
         /r/conspiracy/911/
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="/r/conspiracy/sandy-hook/">
         /r/conspiracy/sandy-hook/
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="/r/conspiracy/agenda21/">
         /r/conspiracy/agenda21/
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       But not just that: Since I envision "subReddits" basically as "tags", the posts should be sort-able.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/canada/conspiracy/toronto/mayorFord">

       <a href="/r/conspiracy/canada/toronto/mayorFord">
        /r/conspiracy/canada/toronto/mayorFord
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said earlier, I find design to be difficult, but I am working on it.
My threaded posts are working, and the "tags/hubs" are partially working.

       I think its a very fine line between derailing a thread and asking for clarification.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that pisses me off is occasionally (Not all the time mostly its great here) I will get downvoted for asking for more details or providing some contradictory information.

       I think the reason the biggest problem with the sub comes from people posting lunacy and then downvoting people who present valid opposing points of view with sources. I often try to provide reasonable opinions and factual evidence to either support or debunk claims made and ask for clarification. Instead of presenting well researched and sane replies I will get an automatic "SHILL!" or downvotes with no comments. The problem with the sub comes from allowing the discussion to be moved from reasonable discussion of theories to echo chambers for wild speculation. If people were acting reasonable or at least presenting credible evidence to back up their claims there would be a lot less ire and no attraction for people to laugh and say everything here is stupid/insane.

       There is also a very vocal minority of subscribers that inject their racism, sexism and/or homophobia regularly which draws a fair bit of ire from society at large. It's one thing to call out the blatant disregard of human rights by the Israeli government, but quite another to claim that "The Jooos are all hook-nosed crooks and murderers destroying society".

       I was wondering if it is possible to create a new subreddit about conspiracy, probably named like TrustNoOne, or TheTruthIsOutThere, or even TheyAreAmongUs, where it must be possible to discuss seriously any kind of serious conspiracies that were exposed, or informations about new serious conspiracy theories that are on the way of being exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rules must be very simple, it will be prohibited to make denigratory comments and annoying other serious posters about the OP topic, unless somebody is able to demonstrate with scientifical evidences that the theory is implausible / impossible to be progressed into exposition. And of course all the Conspiracy theories posted must be plausible according to logic, and physically possible to exist. The users of this new subreddit must all have basic knowledge, in order  to discuss serious topics, or being humble and read other better informed posts, and wiling to ask if unaware about certain topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we still will be able to use r/conspiracy as the main resource by using it as the main source for new links about information of any kind related to suspicious facts, conspiracies and conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agree / disagree? Any other constructive thoughts to add? I just don't want this thread to become another place for mindless bitching about how life is unfair.

       This is cool, I like it. But it is an obvious inside reference only for those who managed to see the movie. My point was that my names are still a reference to the tv show, but they are more selfexplanatory for unaware people. And there is a real problem here, someone might want to use this as a subreddit to discuss the movie. Maybe TheyLiveAmongUs?

       BTW - Personally I usually refer to The Thing.

       I am not thinking to convince anyone here. It is just a matter of being aware that it is possible to create a perfect subforum for discussing conspiracies. The only thing possible is to create the subreddit, and invite everybody who has the required intellectual capacity to post there.

       Isn't skepticism what brought us all here in the first place?  We can't be skeptics while simultaneously believing everything that gets posted here.  For any given post, the first thing I want to see after the OP is the other side of the argument.

       I come here for the articles. I purposely ignore the comment section, unless I have something to say, like today. And when it's been said, I leave it alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't expect to have any sort of reasonable discussion in a public setting. The conversations where I get the most accomplished are all done in private, and thousands of times more productive than expending my energy bickering with a faceless redditor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd even go so far as to say that we shouldn't read the comment section. I remember one day seeing an article, clicking the comments first, and the top comment ended up dissuading me from reading the piece. And I caught myself, realizing that I had allowed someone else's opinion on something influence my own. I don't feel I should give that power to people anymore, so I don't.

       Trolls, shills, paid lackeys, none of those bother me much. If we want to get to the bottom of something, we're able to.

       It's not just r/conspiracy that attract trolls. The thing I have noticed is that everyone is an expert on reddit at times. Down vote all you want but look around and tell me I'm wrong with a straight face. The truth is there are those whose lives are so empty that they will do everything to muddy the waters when conspiracies are discussed in earnest. "Conspiracy Theorist" has become the go-to nomenclature for anyone who may question the official story on anything. The reason behind that is because making it synonymous with "nut" "kook" or the "people with the aluminum foil hats" (though I have yet to understand what the hangup about headgear is about) becomes an easy way of starting the process of discrediting someone by looping them all in with those who clearly do have problems either mentally or socially, people who have made unsubstantiated claims or those with persecution complexes. The problems that exist here won't really be fixed with iron-fisted responses like those in the recent subreddit on climate change. I'm more of a reader of reddit than I am a poster largely because of people like the trolls and self-proclaimed "experts". I will be honest, I don't propose to know how to fix it. My advice would be to just read what is posted and if you have an issue with it then discuss it like a mature and rational adult. Then again that is a pretty tall order for some.

       It's not just r/conspiracy that attract trolls. The thing I have noticed is that everyone is an expert on reddit at times. Down vote all you want but look around and tell me I'm wrong with a straight face. The truth is there are those whose lives are so empty that they will do everything to muddy the waters when conspiracies are discussed in earnest. "Conspiracy Theorist" has become the go-to nomenclature for anyone who may question the official story on anything. The reason behind that is because making it synonymous with "nut" "kook" or the "people with the aluminum foil hats" (though I have yet to understand what the hangup about headgear is about) becomes an easy way of starting the process of discrediting someone by looping them all in with those who clearly do have problems either mentally or socially, people who have made unsubstantiated claims or those with persecution complexes. The problems that exist here won't really be fixed with iron-fisted responses like those in the recent subreddit on climate change. I'm more of a reader of reddit than I am a poster largely because of people like the trolls and self-proclaimed "experts". I will be honest, I don't propose to know how to fix it. My advice would be to just read what is posted and if you have an issue with it then discuss it like a mature and rational adult. Then again that is a pretty tall order for some.

       There will never be a place where that won't happen.  Look at what's happening in the world right now.  Will it get worse?  Probably.

       Realize the vast majority of the troublemakers are paid agents.  Do you really think if we move to a new place they'll disappear?  Their job is to follow the truthsayers and do everything in their power to stop us.

       I think it's a better idea to educate others on how to recognize their techniques and not fall into their traps.  And to keep speaking the truth and educating and informing the new and the curious.  It's a long hard road when one first discovers this stuff.   The enemy has become more sophisticated (hehe some of them) and we need experienced and knowledgable people around to help others learn to recognize them.

       I like the good people here, and I've been here long enough to know who to trust and I don't want the community diluted.

       Let's stick together and do word battle with the scum because there will always be scum.  Be strong, learn the ways of the enemy.  The answer is not to run away.

       I love how this place is a "thinking ground" where free thought and debate are touted as good things, and then you turn around and see somebody thats upset about the state of the sub because people disagree with the OP. Then all you have to look forward to are people calling others shills and complaining that the echo chamber needs calibration.

      <p>
       You talk as if this sub is (or was) a private gathering of minds for the distribution of truth, when really its just a public forum that some use post things that can be critiqued by others.

       This is part of why this sub has the reputation it does. Part of why it garners the attention of trolls is because you dismiss people with a wave of the hand and an utterance (or louder) of the word 'shill'.

       If more of you engaged in discussion with those that disagreed rather than balking and crying shill, your sub would be better. This is why you can't have nice things.

       So only shills communicate with obviously circle jerk comments and nobody else does, therefore an obviously circle jerk comment is posted by a shill?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is silly. And the word is thrown around so frequently (and often not on circle jerk comments) that shills seem to make up a significant fraction of the posters here. The word is used so often that it has become synonymous with "I don't like that you disagree or have made a valid arguement so I'm going to dismiss you and tell everyone that I have discovered that you are a paid advocate of my antithesis."

       I would agree but that he's done a piss poor job defending his actions.  He's talked to the conspiritards like humans as you said, but all his responses to his own users have been condescending and insulting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe if he'd been up front about his actions with the sub instead of sneaking around and changing layouts without notice this wouldn't have blown up.
