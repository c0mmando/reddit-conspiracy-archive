        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Guys, it seems that I cant read a single thread anymore without the second comment being someone trying to derail the conversation for no reason or spouting a bunch of ill-researched or MSM-fed bs to quickly try to discredit the authenticity of the information provided by the people posting. And now with solidwhetstone actually asking r/conspiriTARD for advice on how to &quot;improve&quot; this sub, i really have to ask, is this place dead?</p>

<p>People can sometimes post poorly researched articles and say some extreme stuff on r/conspiracy, but hey welcome to the internet. Not like it doesn&#39;t happen on other subs. And even when it does there aren&#39;t many subs I can think of devoted purely to discrediting the other and stifling open discussion. </p>

<p>Its too hard to get information out through this sub when its constantly being censored and attacked blatantly. We have one of the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods now working with people whose favorite troll sub has the offensive name &#39;conspiritard&#39; yet they are the ones pointing fingers calling us rude, racist and what not. It&#39;s the biggest joke I have ever seen and these people are hypocrites and liars. Worst of all the mods are practically encouraging it now. If you need any proof that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is infiltrated then look no further. Why would we request help from people who come here and downright insult people rather than provide real constructive criticism?</p>

<p>Now some may take this the wrong way and even call me a shill for wanting people to stop using this place, but I only say it because the corruption on not only this sub but Reddit overall is pretty blatant. Its a shame but I&#39;m concerned that we need to find a new place, with new just moderators to help discuss current events and get the word out to people who will actually listen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget the ubiquitous &quot;Where&#39;s the conspiracy?&quot; comment. That one really irks me.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has evolved into something much bigger than a place to bandy about various conspiracy theories. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has become my number one news source, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not alone. Obviously there is some danger in this, but as long as you keep a level head, this place is <em>extremely</em> informative.</p>

<p>Even the comments that attempt to derail are informative, for they often are indicators that whatever is being discussed is important enough to attempt to derail in the first place.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will continue to flourish, but as its popularity grows, so will the attacks on our integrity. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s definitely time to support some of the smaller subs. There will always be a time and place for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and there will always be drama here, but it really can&#39;t hurt to spread out a bit. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is like a homing beacon for trolls and shills. Check out <a href="/r/altnewz">/r/altnewz</a>, <a href="/r/conspiracyfact">/r/conspiracyfact</a> and <a href="/r/globalresearch">/r/globalresearch</a> just to name a few. Other suggestions?</p>

Seriously, you&#39;re like a herd of cats, which is why you&#39;ll never accomplish your goals. You spend too much time undermining each other, and not seeing other people&#39;s perspectives.</p>

I&#39;d much rather be in a herd of cats than a herd of anything else.  I have no political aspirations or even opinions.  I&#39;ve lived through a revolution, seen twice the rise of fascism, and most of my friends have grown in or around war.  I have no reason to fight for anything except free speech and open internet which I think MIGHT have the possibility of dragging mankind out of the mediocre haze of bullshit in which he currently finds himself.  </p>

<p>But if you look, that&#39;s a minority of the posts. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> just isn&#39;t that important to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. It&#39;s mainly looking at the silliest conspirational beliefs on the internet as a whole. If this subreddit wasn&#39;t on the same website as them, you&#39;d likely never get a look-in.</p>

<p>Following &quot;conspiracies&quot; (both real <em>and</em> imagined/fabricated) is a good way to keep abreast of <em>everything</em> being discussed in the world. Frequenting <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for news and information by no means you have to believe everything you read here, in fact the opposite.</p>

<p>You have to be careful and keep a level head, as I said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, so the mods here weren&#39;t ordered to prevent reporting on meta reddit censorship?</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear reddit inc has vested conflicts of interest with Antique Jetpack and NYRD labs (amoung others), and I think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is one of the last &quot;big&quot; subs left without a compromised mod team.

    <div class="md"><p>If I were to venture a guess in earnest as to why <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> poses a threat to reddit inc it would most certainly be the reporting on meta censorship within reddit inc that occurs on this sub. </p>

<p>Personally I have no problem with shills existing. What I don&#39;t like is when a news aggregate purports to hold the free flow of information in high esteem (as you know, one of her founders died in furtherance of that cause), while some of her board members and admins simultaneously run PR firms to manipulate the public image of companies, record labels, and others in the public eye. </p>

<p>So yes, this sub will certainly continue to expose PR firms on reddit. And I&#39;m honored to be a part of it. I&#39;m sure that behind the veneer of your snarky sarcasm you&#39;re able to comprehend what&#39;s going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please don&#39;t leave yet.</p>

<p>I know it has been said by many people that we want a new discussion place, but unless there is a place to go, don&#39;t leave just yet. </p>

<p>I am working on crafting a site similar to Reddit/Dig, but it is hard.</p>

<p>The good thing about Reddit = voting</p>

<p>&quot;group think&quot; will push popular ideas to the top, and unpopular ideas down.</p>

<p>Once we all agree on something, it is easy to make that idea visible.</p>

<p>Another thing I like is how everyone can be somewhat anonymous. This allows everyone to freely speak their mind. </p>

<p>The bad?</p>

<p>Everyone can have 1000&#39;s of accounts, assign them to bots, and manipulate the votes. This way, a single person can control the ideas of the group.</p>

<p>&quot;Private&quot; subs. </p>

<p>Nothing posted on Reddit is &quot;private&quot;. No one is completely anonymous, so there is no such thing as complete privacy. If you want to have a private discussion, it can be done face-to-face.</p>

<p>Shadow-Bans and banning in general. If everyone truly had a single vote per comment, there would be no need to ban. If a comment is filled with hate-speech, and the group doesn&#39;t like it, the idea/comment will never see the light of day. (no reason to ban) If the group liked it, then I also don&#39;t see a reason to ban.</p>

<p>So, control of information == bad</p>

<p>Private Messages are also bad. They do nothing to help discussions. </p>

<p>I have made a better post in the past, but it was buried, and no one responded.</p>

<p>What am I building?</p>

<p>A stripped down version of Reddit, with extra features.</p>

<p>Feature 1.</p>

<p>Per subReddit questionnaire - Even though I believe that everyone has the right to speak up and be heard, some peoples opinion carry more weight than others. For example, I don&#39;t care about Obama&#39;s opinion on internet privacy. He is a politician, not a network administrator or even a psychologist. </p>

<p>How will a questionnaire help?</p>

<p>I start a &quot;sub&quot; about running, and create a question. Everyone who answers my question correctly will have +1 added to their vote &quot;weight&quot; in that sub. This leads to the following: people who answer a lot of questions correctly are known to be more knowledgeable about discussions in the sub, and therefore their opinion carries more weight.</p>

<p>Anyone who &quot;actively&quot; participates in the sub will also gain more vote-weight.
This means that people who know nothing about running can still display an interest in running. And as the system learns about their interest, it will grant more vote-weight.</p>

<p>Feature 2.
No more cross posts. Instead, threads can be submitted to multiple hubs at the same time. This will lead to much better discussions.
For example: I can post a thread about a shoe, to both <a href="/r/fashion">/r/fashion</a> and <a href="/r/running">/r/running</a></p>

<p>I still need to think about how the vote-weight will work in this scenario, since I don&#39;t want power-users to spam smaller subs with their content. </p>

<p>Feature 3.</p>

<p>Sub-subreddits. Instead of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> , <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a>, <a href="/r/collapse">/r/collapse</a>, I like to structure as</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/r/conspiracy/911/">/r/conspiracy/911/</a></li>
<li><a href="/r/conspiracy/sandy-hook/">/r/conspiracy/sandy-hook/</a></li>
<li><a href="/r/conspiracy/agenda21/">/r/conspiracy/agenda21/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But not just that: Since I envision &quot;subReddits&quot; basically as &quot;tags&quot;, the posts should be sort-able.</p>

<p><a href="/r/canada/conspiracy/toronto/mayorFord">/r/canada/conspiracy/toronto/mayorFord</a>  === <a href="/r/conspiracy/canada/toronto/mayorFord">/r/conspiracy/canada/toronto/mayorFord</a> </p>

<p>Like I said earlier, I find design to be difficult, but I am working on it.
My threaded posts are working, and the &quot;tags/hubs&quot; are partially working.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reason the biggest problem with the sub comes from people posting lunacy and then downvoting people who present valid opposing points of view with sources. I often try to provide reasonable opinions and factual evidence to either support or debunk claims made and ask for clarification. Instead of presenting well researched and sane replies I will get an automatic &quot;SHILL!&quot; or downvotes with no comments. The problem with the sub comes from allowing the discussion to be moved from reasonable discussion of theories to echo chambers for wild speculation. If people were acting reasonable or at least presenting credible evidence to back up their claims there would be a lot less ire and no attraction for people to laugh and say everything here is stupid/insane.</p>

<p>There is also a very vocal minority of subscribers that inject their racism, sexism and/or homophobia regularly which draws a fair bit of ire from society at large. It&#39;s one thing to call out the blatant disregard of human rights by the Israeli government, but quite another to claim that &quot;The Jooos are all hook-nosed crooks and murderers destroying society&quot;.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was wondering if it is possible to create a new subreddit about conspiracy, probably named like TrustNoOne, or TheTruthIsOutThere, or even TheyAreAmongUs, where it must be possible to discuss seriously any kind of serious conspiracies that were exposed, or informations about new serious conspiracy theories that are on the way of being exposed.</p>

<p>The rules must be very simple, it will be prohibited to make denigratory comments and annoying other serious posters about the OP topic, unless somebody is able to demonstrate with scientifical evidences that the theory is implausible / impossible to be progressed into exposition. And of course all the Conspiracy theories posted must be plausible according to logic, and physically possible to exist. The users of this new subreddit must all have basic knowledge, in order  to discuss serious topics, or being humble and read other better informed posts, and wiling to ask if unaware about certain topics.</p>

<p>I think we still will be able to use r/conspiracy as the main resource by using it as the main source for new links about information of any kind related to suspicious facts, conspiracies and conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Agree / disagree? Any other constructive thoughts to add? I just don&#39;t want this thread to become another place for mindless bitching about how life is unfair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just r/conspiracy that attract trolls. The thing I have noticed is that everyone is an expert on reddit at times. Down vote all you want but look around and tell me I&#39;m wrong with a straight face. The truth is there are those whose lives are so empty that they will do everything to muddy the waters when conspiracies are discussed in earnest. &quot;Conspiracy Theorist&quot; has become the go-to nomenclature for anyone who may question the official story on anything. The reason behind that is because making it synonymous with &quot;nut&quot; &quot;kook&quot; or the &quot;people with the aluminum foil hats&quot; (though I have yet to understand what the hangup about headgear is about) becomes an easy way of starting the process of discrediting someone by looping them all in with those who clearly do have problems either mentally or socially, people who have made unsubstantiated claims or those with persecution complexes. The problems that exist here won&#39;t really be fixed with iron-fisted responses like those in the recent subreddit on climate change. I&#39;m more of a reader of reddit than I am a poster largely because of people like the trolls and self-proclaimed &quot;experts&quot;. I will be honest, I don&#39;t propose to know how to fix it. My advice would be to just read what is posted and if you have an issue with it then discuss it like a mature and rational adult. Then again that is a pretty tall order for some.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just r/conspiracy that attract trolls. The thing I have noticed is that everyone is an expert on reddit at times. Down vote all you want but look around and tell me I&#39;m wrong with a straight face. The truth is there are those whose lives are so empty that they will do everything to muddy the waters when conspiracies are discussed in earnest. &quot;Conspiracy Theorist&quot; has become the go-to nomenclature for anyone who may question the official story on anything. The reason behind that is because making it synonymous with &quot;nut&quot; &quot;kook&quot; or the &quot;people with the aluminum foil hats&quot; (though I have yet to understand what the hangup about headgear is about) becomes an easy way of starting the process of discrediting someone by looping them all in with those who clearly do have problems either mentally or socially, people who have made unsubstantiated claims or those with persecution complexes. The problems that exist here won&#39;t really be fixed with iron-fisted responses like those in the recent subreddit on climate change. I&#39;m more of a reader of reddit than I am a poster largely because of people like the trolls and self-proclaimed &quot;experts&quot;. I will be honest, I don&#39;t propose to know how to fix it. My advice would be to just read what is posted and if you have an issue with it then discuss it like a mature and rational adult. Then again that is a pretty tall order for some.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There will never be a place where that won&#39;t happen.  Look at what&#39;s happening in the world right now.  Will it get worse?  Probably.  </p>

<p>Realize the vast majority of the troublemakers are paid agents.  Do you really think if we move to a new place they&#39;ll disappear?  Their job is to follow the truthsayers and do everything in their power to stop us.  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a better idea to educate others on how to recognize their techniques and not fall into their traps.  And to keep speaking the truth and educating and informing the new and the curious.  It&#39;s a long hard road when one first discovers this stuff.   The enemy has become more sophisticated (hehe some of them) and we need experienced and knowledgable people around to help others learn to recognize them.</p>

<p>I like the good people here, and I&#39;ve been here long enough to know who to trust and I don&#39;t want the community diluted.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s stick together and do word battle with the scum because there will always be scum.  Be strong, learn the ways of the enemy.  The answer is not to run away.</p>

<h2>It was bad enough when the topics would be littered by r/conspiratard posters trashing threads.  </h2>

<h2>It was bad enough when topics were being started by sockpuppet accounts</h2>

<h2>It&#39;s bad enough now that a fucking moderator is asking a sub that is dedicated to trashing this forum how to improve it.</h2>

<h2>The funny part is the sheer amount of &quot;people&quot; on r/tard complaining about RACISM.  There is very little racism in this sub, and a crapload of talk about Israel.  Talking about the crimes in Israel isn&#39;t racism to anyone but a person that is offended that their perceived &quot;Homeland&quot; is somehow being slandered, and is indoctrinated to defend Israel at all costs.</h2>

<h2>I have served in the US military and for years I defended the flag when I should not have.  It was because I was indoctrinated to defend something that I did not understand.  Not would I be protected because of it, thankfully.</h2>

<h2>I&#39;m reaching out to anyone of the Jewish faith that defends Israel in that respect.  You aren&#39;t Israel.  Many of you have never been there, nor have you witnessed what goes on there.</h2>

<h2>You don&#39;t have to defend every action of a nation that will not protect you.  If you aren&#39;t Ashkenazi, you aren&#39;t protected.  You are just an expendable soldier, like I was for the American government.  </h2>

<h2>Meat for the grinder.  But maybe you will get lucky and they will let you wear an armband.</h2>

    <div class="md"><p>So only shills communicate with obviously circle jerk comments and nobody else does, therefore an obviously circle jerk comment is posted by a shill?</p>

<p>This is silly. And the word is thrown around so frequently (and often not on circle jerk comments) that shills seem to make up a significant fraction of the posters here. The word is used so often that it has become synonymous with &quot;I don&#39;t like that you disagree or have made a valid arguement so I&#39;m going to dismiss you and tell everyone that I have discovered that you are a paid advocate of my antithesis.&quot;</p>
