    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">4</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/King-Hell.html">King-Hell</a> 2013-12-23</p>
    <div class="md"><p>My cut&#39;n&#39;paste stock answer: (cue stock c&amp;p ad hom &quot;King-Hell is a shill!&quot; attack)</p>

<p>First of all, I don&#39;t simply write off every conspiracy theory as the work of paranoid nutters. Many conspiracy theories turn out to be true, like the CIA&#39;s guns-for-cocaine Black Ops in South America.. I don&#39;t accept the official line on 9/11 and I believe the probability is that WTC7 was brought down by a preplanned controlled demolition.</p>

<p>But I just don&#39;t buy into chemtrails. People say they&#39;ve only been happening in the last 20 years but I remember them from my childhood, and there are plenty of pictures on the Internet of <a href="http://depletedcranium.com/the-realities-of-contrails/">World War II bombers</a> turning the sky white with persistent contrails over France and Germany. Back in 1944 these contrails were a serious problem for strategic air command. They pointed like huge arrows in the sky at the incoming bombers.</p>

<p>In the past 30 years there has been an explosion in budget passenger and freight air traffic with 7  to 12 percent year-on increases. Where once there might have been one or two contrails there are now dozens which merge to cover the whole sky in a persistent artificial cloud. This may be a very bad thing. The reduction in sunlight reaching the ground is having an effect on plants and is messing with the weather. If you understand anything about chaos theory you will realise that even the slightest tinkering with the weather can lead to devastating and unpredictable results. </p>

<p>There is a simple scientific explanation for the trails you see criss-crossing the skies. They are plumes of ice which are left when a jetliner burns fuel in a cold wet atmosphere. A large 20 mile long contrail may contain several thousand tons of ice and there isn&#39;t a plane ever built that could carry that amount of any substance to that height in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon. When it burns in air the carbon part combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO<sup>2)</sup> and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (Dihydrogen Monoxide, H<sup>2</sup> O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is already saturated with water vapour then these crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through a process called deposition and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. </p>

<p>Water is an amazing substance with some unique properties which defy logic. It is important to realise that water does not freeze at zero centigrade. It will freeze at any temperature from zero degrees down to minus 48 (zero degrees is defined as the point where pure frozen water melts, not freezes). Suspended in air at sub-zero temperatures it can co-exist as vapour, liquid, and solid simultaneously. Liquid water droplets, ice crystals, and invisible water vapour (cold steam) are found together in clouds where the temperature is minus 40 (centigrade or Fahrenheit; it&#39;s the temperature where they both agree). Even clear air will contain a lot of sub-zero water vapour. It&#39;s not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.</p>

<p>What nobody in the chemtrails camp seems able to do is to explain why and how they are happening. Just that &quot;they are&quot; and that it should be &quot;obvious&quot; to anybody who looks up in the sky (And if you don&#39;t see what they are seeing you are &#39;sheeple&#39; that needs to &#39;wake up&#39;, or you are stupid, or you are a government shill). If it&#39;s being done for rainmaking then &quot;they&quot; picked a peculiar time and place to do it earlier this year. After the wettest winter on record in Southern England, why would anybody want to make more rain when the rivers and reservoirs were already bursting their banks? If it&#39;s for some form of nefarious mind or population control then &quot;they&quot; are doing it to themselves and their families as much as to us. Where is the logic in that? Could it be a benign program to combat global warming? Probably not because that kind of seeding needs to take place in the stratosphere, way above the height that almost all commercial airliners fly at. In the tropics, airliners cannot even reach the stratosphere. The theory that it is used in conjunction with HAARP to create tornadoes and earthquakes is intriguing, but again there is no solid evidence – just speculation.</p>

<p>&#39;How?&#39; also goes unanswered. If commercial jetliners are being loaded up with toxic chemicals to spray behind them as they fly then it involves a conspiracy of hundreds of thousands of  people worldwide who own, fly, refuel, maintain, and design aeroplanes. With all those people and all this time do you think that not one person would stand up and blow the whistle? How many tons of chemicals would it take to create a 20 mile long trail across the sky? Where is it stored on the aircraft, and how is it dispersed? How is it replenished? Who pays for it? Who decides what days are going to be &#39;Spray Days&#39;? Are the pilots in on the plot, or is the spraying done automatically or controlled remotely? How do crews account for the weight discrepancy when takeoff weight is such an issue that easyJet are disciplining pilots who land with more than 100 kilos of fuel above their emergency minimum? And possibly the most basic question: Why not just do the spraying at night when nobody can see it? </p>

<p>If you are a government wanting to deliver a chemical agent to the population there are far easier and more precise ways of doing it; the Syrians just weld a calor gas cylinder to the front of a rocket and fill it with Sarin. If you are pumping chemicals into the jet stream at 30,000 feet over Europe, which country, approximately, do you think they will come down to earth in?</p>

<p>And who are the &quot;they&quot; that are doing it? The illuminati? The lizard people? Reverse vampires? The questions go on and on and never lead to any answers – just more questions.</p>

<p>All of these conspiracy theories could be true, but there&#39;s actually no evidence to support any of them. What evidence is offered can often be traced in a big circle straight back to where it originated in the mind of a another conspiracy theorist, quoted and repeated until it takes on a life of its own. No matter how many times they get debunked, some myths just refused to die, such as the <a href="http://metabunk.org/threads/debunked-chemtrail-plane-interior-ballast-barrels.661/">&#39;secret photos&#39;</a>  of chemical tanks on board aircraft. Just because there&#39;s 100, or 1000 people claiming the same thing doesn&#39;t make it the truth.</p>

<p>Nobody is doubting that <a href="http://englishrussia.com/2013/05/13/moving-clouds-away/">geo-engineering</a> is taking place for local weather control. It&#39;s been going on since the Vietnam War and the Chinese used it used during the Beijing Olympics to target rain on the capital to help clear the smog. But it was done with specially modified aircraft, rockets and artillery, not commercial airliners flying at 39,000 feet in clear blue skies. There are numerous patents for different uses and methods of geoengineering, but no evidence for most of these ideas being taken beyond a proof of concept. Recent research into using a reflective heat shield to combat global warming, for instance, suggests that it may actually make things worse.</p>

<p>Chemtrail campaigners claim that raised levels of aluminium and barium are evidence for artificial spraying, but these are chemicals naturally found in the environment and their raised levels can be explained by mining and <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nKulgztuzL8C&amp;amp;pg=PA408&amp;amp;lpg=PA408&amp;amp;dq=barium+in+atmosphere+explained+by+fossil+fuels&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=QRZQafAhXq&amp;amp;sig=f1_YmX9r_sJap1jvBvdLlMjrM84&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=Cq1kUvrFIYPA0QWftYGwBA&amp;amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=barium%20in%20atmosphere%20explained%20by%20fossil%20fuels&amp;amp;f=false">fossil fuel burning</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were difficult to come by, and I never did find figures for the decade 2000 to 2010. But I found various figures for the decades 1980 to 2000 and that&#39;s where the 7 to 13 percent figure came from. There have been no oil crises since then so it&#39;s reasonable to assume similar growth. If you can find more accurate figures which check out I&#39;ll be happy to change my presentation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck it. I can&#39;t take the pressure any more so I&#39;m going to fess up. Yes, I am a shill. There, I&#39;ve said it now. I&#39;m starting to feel better already. I am a secret agent working for a shady British government department inside the Met Office. You know the Met Office? We make the weather forecasts. &quot;Make up the weather forecasts&quot;, more like! We do several versions, and they are quite different. The real one only goes to the government and the military. A modified one goes to commercial airlines and shipping, and then a pack of lies goes out to the general public. My job is to sow disinformation in case anybody gets to see two of the maps and realises they are different. So I&#39;m just here to disagree with anything you say about anything going on in the sky just in case it&#39;s true. I&#39;ve no idea what that white stuff coming out of the back of aeroplanes is; it might as well be cocaine for all I know, or care. Our department is jokingly referred to as MI5 3/4. Actually, chemtrails are part of a disinformation campaign to take the focus off geo-engineering by trivialising it. That&#39;s why we like chemtrail believers to use the words &#39;chemtrail&#39; and &#39;geo-engineering&#39; interchangeably, as if they are the same thing. So the sheep out there  conflate the very real issue of geo-engineering with the bullshit surrounding chemtrails and their alleged doomsday uses. As a result, geo-engineering gets rubbished as just another woowoo fantasy for the tinfoil hat brigade. What better way of diverting public attention than by pointing to the occasional chemical free contrails coming off commercial airliners and saying &quot;that&#39;s geo-engineering&quot;, while the real dirty work is done by squadrons of specially modified military aircraft on Thursdays. Didn&#39;t you notice that the spray days were always Thursdays? It was staring you right in the face and you never saw it. Actually, it may be on a different day where you are. Check. Which brings us back to the weather forecasts: don&#39;t believe the weather forecast. Especially on Thursdays. The public forecast is always wrong on Thursdays. There is <a href="http://www.theweatherspace.com/chemtrail-forecast-systems/">one place</a> that seems able to get hold of the real forecast and they use it to predict where the government will be chemtrailing everybody. Best of luck, and keep spraying the vinegar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume they maintain the capacity to spray chemicals from aircraft. It&#39;s not complicated to do. However, their capacity to do so does not prove anything. </p>

<p>The question that I posed is directly relevant to disproving an essential element of this conspiracy theory. Specifically, the chem-trail conspiracy theory posits that the trails can not occur naturally, so if it is proven they can, then the theory falls apart. They believe that most or all of the condensation trails are artificial.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the question that you pose, no matter the answer, is irrelevant to the underlying question. It is irrelevant because issue is not whether the military does or does not &#39;spray chemicals&#39; of their aircraft, the issue whether the condensation trails that you see crossing the sky are natural, or a vast secret operation of spraying.</p>

<p>The fact is you can identify the commercial planes leaving the trails. You can buy a ticket and ride the plane leaving the trails. They are a natural phenomenon of water condensation.</p>

<p>The first time I noticed the persistent trails, they were being sprayed in a perfectly square grid pattern by military KC-135s and my first thought was they were performing a one-time military exercise. It looked vastly different than any contrail behavior I had seen up until that point. When I looked through all my personal photos and videos from the past, I was unable to find one image of a persistent contrail. Now when I try to identify many of these spray planes with software, they do not show up at all: military aircraft are exempt from this. </p>

<p>Now is your turn to link to Mick West&#39;s disinformation websites: contrailscience.com and metabunk.org and show reddit his pictures of old military aircraft deliberately spraying substances out of their planes for visual radar cover and other reasons. I&#39;m still lost on the entire point of his websites because we know they have been spraying chems out of their planes for as long as human aviation and all he does is prove it with his pictures, but says otherwise with his words. Oh well, such is the logic of a high school graduate. You can feel free to make him your personal hero of science, but to me he is a joke and possibly being compensated for his efforts. </p>

<p>Encyclopedia? <strong>Anyone</strong> can edit wiki (ya, kinda a major dif between the two),</p>

<p>no, i don&#39;t consider wiki the begin all and end all source of info. </p>

<p>The url&#39;s speak for themselves</p>

<p>/contrail  and /theory?  why not /con and /chemtrail ?  </p>

<p>Its easy to see the bias, one only needs to open his eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course Wikipedia is an invalid source. This was never in question. I was only saying that linking to a Wikipedia article is not a bad thing. If you are interested in the information you can follow the citations and determine the information&#39;s validity from there. It is a simple way to hand somebody some information without hunting an ass-load of sources. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what source you are given, you still have to determine its validity. The alternative is linking you 10-30 sources that you&#39;ll have to crawl through anyway. You obviously don&#39;t want to do that, so and aggregate seems a savory alternative. </p>

<p>Your comments are possibly written by a 5 year old/shill/troll. Does that mean I should just dismiss you offhand?</p>
