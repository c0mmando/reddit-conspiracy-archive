       Conspirologists Often Get Killed By Conspirators:
      </p>
      <p>
       Joe Vialls is the man who exposed the common use of Micro Nukes by the establishment along with many other very detailed reports. Killed by establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Phil Shneider was beaten, finger chopped off and strangled in his appartment after around the 9th attempt on his life. Phil exposed underground bases, ufos, space created materials, aliens, prison trains and depopulation plans. This guy knew way too much and was one of the biggest threats to the above top secret agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       William Cooper, another legendary truth exposer killed by the establishment at his home. William exposed the mysterys religion, Ufos, underground bases, freemasonry, project lucifer, JFK william greer shooting and much more. A true truthsayer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sherman Skolnick was a 50th veteran in truthsaying everything from naming names, busting court judges (the judge buster), JESUITS/Vatican and much much more. Sherman's death remains a mystery but it seems he may have been killed as he was one of G.W Bush's public enemy number 1's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fritz Springmeier, high level exposer of the inner core of the Conspiracy and it's invisible bars itself. Very high level de-programmer of mind control victims and once again a big exposer. Fitted up on phony robbery charges by the establishment and his devious wife. Was teaching inmates at the prison he was held within. Still alive now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chris Story has been killed execution style on July 14th while walking the street in London. This was the result of his last posting on July 10th which was removed after the 14th. Therein are his murderers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspirologists Often Get Killed By Conspirators. The proof of huge conspiracy existence...
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that conspirators get afraid and try to kill the truth sayer.

       Being in prison over the years tho, no way to know if he's the same.  Its a fact military testing is done on prisoners.

       I think that googling their names will be useful for those who are still somewhat unaware what real conspirologists do, and that they were able to expose real conspiracies.

       I don't know why are you saying this is bullshit. There is already technology avaiable to create a lot of artificial natural disasters. There is a lot of information avaiable on internet for unaware people.

       I am sorry, but it looks like you have your own meanings for the words you are using. It is your own "reality", which is a belief by definition. Exactly like any religion is. Not even any casual scientist is able to know of the existence of something he wasn't involved with directly. I would suggest you to deal with this fact. You can ask any scientist about this anytime.

       Maybe aliens created the tsunami? It's the same level of plausibility as it being man-made. Does that mean I, as a scientist, should entertain that thought? Nope! Why? Because NOBODY observed it, and it's something that would not have slipped by unobserved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not satisfied with me using "reality" over "belief"? Then you shouldn't have tried to back up some retard saying humans caused the 2004 tsunami. The fact is, the cause was OBSERVED. Not by me; I don't live on the bottom of the ocean. But we have proof it wasn't man-made. Hence "reality".

       Let me get this straight. You think the probability that (a) there is intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, AND that (b) this intelligent life has the ability to travel to across the universe to our planet, and that (c) they have done this in order to interfere with Earth's tectonic plates
       <strong>
        is equivalent to
       </strong>
       the probability that human beings might try to cause a tsunami (when there is documented evidence that humans have tried to do precisely this)?

       I never said aliens were real or that they caused the tsunami. How did anyone interpret my statement as my belief? Even if you thought it was something I believed, wouldn't you read more than one comment and realize it's sarcasm? How dense can you be?
      </p>
      <p>
       And the tsunami bomb thing is irrelevant to the 2004 tsunami, as a well-documented earthquake caused that one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, do the math. How many atomic bombs would it take to cause it? Give up? About 23,000

       Don't bring up IDIOTIC strawmen arguments involving aliens. You just make yourself look fucking ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that humans have been trying for at least 60 years, if not longer, to artificially create tsunamis. If you think that they are working with the same technology now then you are a moron.

       You don't have to directly release the energy of the tsunami.  Indirectly releasing that energy by triggering a huge earthquake is all that is needed;  Find a fault line with stresses that are sufficient to cause a tsunami and force that fault line to slip.

       And what technology are you talking about? Energy to create a tsunami that size is beyond our capabilities. It's just physics.
