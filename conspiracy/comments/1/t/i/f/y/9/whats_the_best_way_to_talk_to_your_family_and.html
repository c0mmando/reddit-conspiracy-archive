       That's actually a good advice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The downside of that advice to conspiracy theorists, is that they then tend to realize that there's
       <em>
        no fact which supports their conspiracy theory
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       therefore please look for real credible and provable evidence which supports your conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       You either find that there's none and then return to real world, or actually exposed a real conspiracy.

      <p>
       It's a Win-Win.

       First of all; don't insist that you know the truth about everything. It's arrogant and narrow minded to think that you are the only person who knows the real truth. We are supposed to have open minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second: if somebody doesn't want to talk about Chemtrails (example) then don't push it. I don't agree with the chemtrails theory (example), and if you try to push it on me, I'll be even more disinclined to listen. This is a common reaction. Expect that something you really believe in may not seem logical to someone else whether or not it is actually true.

       Scientific papers, if there are none maybe you should be questioning your belief in the "theory".
       <br/>
       In other words if the infomation isn't convincing maybe you shouldn't be presenting it.

       If you have

        real evidence
       </strong>
       which backed your theories then perhaps they wouldn't.

       The burden of proof is on you as the conspiracy theorist, therefore it's your fault if you don't have any evidence and people look as if you're nuts.

       You never say the words conspiracy or theory. You only state the facts. If it makes sense to the other person before they connect it with conspiracy theories, you've got a fighting chance at educating them on the facts.

       Also don't buy into every theory that comes out. Use critical thinking and actually look at evidence and facts.

       If you buy into every wacky story that comes out - you're falling into the same trap as believing everything in the MSM. There is a lot of noise compared to actual signal in the world.

       Wait until someone asks you about something to tell them about it- unsolicited advice is less welcome than that which is sought after.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just be honest, and try to learn up on things like logical fallacies so you don't misrepresent the ideas that you think are worth disseminating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, try to think about how you have ever received new information that has shifted your perspective on a given topic... how did that unfold for you?  I don't like an "us and them" mentality, we're more alike than we are different, just be respectful and treat others how you would like to be treated.

       Most people simply get their information from authority sources, frex: why do you believe a particular scientific claim? well usually it is because someone on the media said so. Most people dont read the original papers because they are deliberately pay-walled and inaccessible to non-academics. If you have not read the papers (and I have read quite a few) you would not be aware that what the media says and what the data suggests are in most cases completely unrelated. Ever see the news say 'X cures cancer!' well usually the article will say there is a slight statistical trend between two obscure genes that are distantly tangentally related to cancer but the media (who are not trained in technical disciplines) will just misunderstand a press release and run with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have found that as most people dont properly understand what they are talking about you can guide the discussions that way. Say they are talking about global warming. You can ask them what they think they know about temperature increases or sea ice and what the data actually shows is contrary to what public beliefs on these things are. You need to be highly informed and that is the best way to go about these things- sadly most people will never question what they told by so called 'authoritative sources'.

       I went through a stage like this too. The fact is that most people don't enjoy talking about terrible things, regardless of their truth value. Imagine telling people there are starving children in africa all the time, no-one would want to talk to you...
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm saying, whether true or false, don't talk about that stuff unless the person on the recieving end actually appreciates it. It's just upsetting for most people

       Nearly all of his posts had 0 or less points. His posts are outlandish and nuts even for Conspiracy standards - a subreddit devoted to investigating the abnormal possibilities of reality. And these posts were all collected from one page. There's a serious problem here, and it pains me to know that somebody is so deluded that they won't ever be able to comprehend how the world functions. Taking offense to suggestions by accusing people of "gaslighting" or whatever only stumps any progress this person might make towards a better understanding of life and a healthier mentality.

       Just look up in the sky.  If the trail a plane leaves dissipates in minutes it is not a chemtrail.  If it takes hours then it is.

       One thing that seems to work (although not always now) is vinegar.  I keep well stocked of it and spray around my house if I see chemtrails lingering.

       Try throwing two pinches of salt followed by a pinch of sugar exactly 8 seconds later and I promise you that the trail will, sometimes, dissipate. You can also try heaving kittens towards the sky, it also works... sometimes, much as any imaginable endeavor.

       What I'm trying to say, basically, is that your brand of logic is flawed.

       So wait, if they want the "chemicals" from the chem trails to dissipate into the atmosphere so people breath them in why would they still stick around for hours? Wouldn't they design it to disperse more easily? If it just hangs in the air for hours it doesn't seem that effective.

       You CAN. This is how you do it, using psychological tactics. You don't give them the "answers"- you have them question things in their own mind, by using leading comments and questions. For instance: "Gosh, uncle Joe- ever hear Netanyahu's comment about how 911 was 'good for Israel'?" or, my favorite: "Whatever happened to those 60 Israeli spies they flew back to Israel the day after 9/11, along with the "dancing Israelis" who recorded the towers?" or: "Gee whiz, our local city council people sure are acting
       <em>
        strangely
       </em>
       lately. Do you think they went through any specialized training? I've been hearing some talk about that Infragard, or "Common Purpose". What's all that about, granma? Ever hear of it? Oh well, no matter! ha, back to my baking..." then all you have to do is wait while those bugs in their ears start itching.
