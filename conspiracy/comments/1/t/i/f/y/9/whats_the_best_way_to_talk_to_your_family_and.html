    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually a good advice.</p>

<p>The downside of that advice to conspiracy theorists, is that they then tend to realize that there&#39;s <em>no fact which supports their conspiracy theory</em>.</p>

<p>therefore please look for real credible and provable evidence which supports your conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>You either find that there&#39;s none and then return to real world, or actually exposed a real conspiracy.</p>

I don&#39;t agree with the chemtrails theory (example), and if you try to push it on me, I&#39;ll be even more disinclined to listen. This is a common reaction.

<p>Just be honest, and try to learn up on things like logical fallacies so you don&#39;t misrepresent the ideas that you think are worth disseminating.</p>

<p>Also, try to think about how you have ever received new information that has shifted your perspective on a given topic... how did that unfold for you?  I don&#39;t like an &quot;us and them&quot; mentality, we&#39;re more alike than we are different, just be respectful and treat others how you would like to be treated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people simply get their information from authority sources, frex: why do you believe a particular scientific claim? well usually it is because someone on the media said so. Most people dont read the original papers because they are deliberately pay-walled and inaccessible to non-academics. If you have not read the papers (and I have read quite a few) you would not be aware that what the media says and what the data suggests are in most cases completely unrelated. Ever see the news say &#39;X cures cancer!&#39; well usually the article will say there is a slight statistical trend between two obscure genes that are distantly tangentally related to cancer but the media (who are not trained in technical disciplines) will just misunderstand a press release and run with it.</p>

<p>I have found that as most people dont properly understand what they are talking about you can guide the discussions that way. Say they are talking about global warming. You can ask them what they think they know about temperature increases or sea ice and what the data actually shows is contrary to what public beliefs on these things are. You need to be highly informed and that is the best way to go about these things- sadly most people will never question what they told by so called &#39;authoritative sources&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went through a stage like this too. The fact is that most people don&#39;t enjoy talking about terrible things, regardless of their truth value. Imagine telling people there are starving children in africa all the time, no-one would want to talk to you...    </p>

<p>So I&#39;m saying, whether true or false, don&#39;t talk about that stuff unless the person on the recieving end actually appreciates it. It&#39;s just upsetting for most people</p>

<ul>
<li><p>HIV being used as a depopulation strategy by NWO</p></li>
<li><p>Sandy Hook actors</p></li>
<li><p>Obamacare microchipping</p></li>

<li><p>NWO false flag attacks</p></li>
<li><p>GMOs being used to mutate people</p></li>
<li><p>Zionists using Feminism to &quot;destabilise society&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Reno Hospital shooting a False Flag (apparently every shooting is a false flag attack)</p></li>
<li><p>Believes in eradicating the US dollar and taking up bitcoins</p></li>
<li><p>Snowden leaks revealing Zionist UFO contact and time travel technology</p></li>
<li><p>Insurance companies spying on everybody (made a comparison to Big Brother)</p></li>
<li><p>And this one is the kicker; Jews are superior beings from another planet</p></li>

<p>Nearly all of his posts had 0 or less points. His posts are outlandish and nuts even for Conspiracy standards - a subreddit devoted to investigating the abnormal possibilities of reality. And these posts were all collected from one page. There&#39;s a serious problem here, and it pains me to know that somebody is so deluded that they won&#39;t ever be able to comprehend how the world functions. Taking offense to suggestions by accusing people of &quot;gaslighting&quot; or whatever only stumps any progress this person might make towards a better understanding of life and a healthier mentality.</p>

<p>So wait, if they want the &quot;chemicals&quot; from the chem trails to dissipate into the atmosphere so people breath them in why would they still stick around for hours? Wouldn&#39;t they design it to disperse more easily? If it just hangs in the air for hours it doesn&#39;t seem that effective.</p>
