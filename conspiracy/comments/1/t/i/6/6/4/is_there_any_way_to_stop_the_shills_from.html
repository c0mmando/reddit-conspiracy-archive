    <div class="md"><p>Roaches can eat anything.</p>

<p>Any attention is attention. Banning them is attention. They thrive on attention. Banning them gives them exactly what they want. This very post gives them what they want; attention. Remember that the only thing they wish to do is feed off this sub. Without r/conspiracy they have little to do. When we give them attention they have something to do. They revel in attention and wish for nothing more than to get into a heated debate with someone so they can prove how superior, intellectual and reasoned they are. But this is only possible if you give them attention. </p>

<p>Ban them and they get to say, &quot;Look how I was banned by those callous and horrible conspiracy theorists! They&#39;re silly and they banned me! I will now go back with twice the vigor and show them what-for!&quot; And then they&#39;ll come back and show off, for the other conspiratards, their pious and righteous bigotry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They currently aren&#39;t banned but they pretend like they are so we might as well actually ban them.</p>

<p>Also, banning them would cut down on their trolling and allow better conversations here.  It&#39;s like trying to eat dinner with a bunch of cockroaches running around.  It&#39;s better for the diners to try and eradicate the pest rather than just ignoring it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care what they talk about over at their shitty little juvenile troll place.  Let them link to posts here and claim censorship and jerk each others little peckers off.  It&#39;s worth it to get rid of as many of these pests here as possible.</p>

<p>What other site on the internet allows itself get trolled like this?  This can&#39;t be an accident.  I also find it suspicious that there are many voices here saying, &quot;don&#39;t worry about it, just pretend there isn&#39;t a cockroach infestation here and try to eat dinner.&quot;</p>

<p>If I had a site dedicated to Jewish issues and a bunch of anti semites set up a website dedicated to making fun of the Jewish site and constantly linked to and trolled it (e.g. posting comments like, &quot;you Jews are idiots, everyone is laughing at you&quot;) don&#39;t you think it would be smart to ban the trolls?  It turns every post into a name calling fight.  It derails conversations so people constantly bicker over the same basic assumptions (&quot;Judaism is a false religion&quot;, &quot;no it isn&#39;t, what are you doing on a site about Judaism if you hate it so much&quot;).</p>

<p>If you want to ban them that&#39;s fine. Good luck. I think they&#39;ll come back.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s pretty clear too when you click on the obnoxious comments that add no value and see most of them cross post at conspiratard.  They don&#39;t even deny they do it.  </p>

<p>They openly admit their goal is to troll this sub yet the mods evidently refuse to ban them for this behavior.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The downvote brigading  is shameful. It&#39;s meant to keep some posts and subjects hidden, but we are a free open forum, a thinking ground, or we are controlling and censored. I&#39;m on the side of openness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not openness when you allow a group of trolls to anonymously spike information the organic community wants to see.</p>

<p>What website allows itself to be trolled like this?  This is internet etiquette 101 yet a bunch of people are arguing we have to allow these hostile trolls to control this sub.</p>
