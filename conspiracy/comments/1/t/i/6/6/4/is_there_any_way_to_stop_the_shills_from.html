       Roaches can eat anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any attention is attention. Banning them is attention. They thrive on attention. Banning them gives them exactly what they want. This very post gives them what they want; attention. Remember that the only thing they wish to do is feed off this sub. Without r/conspiracy they have little to do. When we give them attention they have something to do. They revel in attention and wish for nothing more than to get into a heated debate with someone so they can prove how superior, intellectual and reasoned they are. But this is only possible if you give them attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ban them and they get to say, "Look how I was banned by those callous and horrible conspiracy theorists! They're silly and they banned me! I will now go back with twice the vigor and show them what-for!" And then they'll come back and show off, for the other conspiratards, their pious and righteous bigotry.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're like the Westboro Church, but dedicated not to gay people so much as . .  us in r/conspiracy.

       They currently aren't banned but they pretend like they are so we might as well actually ban them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, banning them would cut down on their trolling and allow better conversations here.  It's like trying to eat dinner with a bunch of cockroaches running around.  It's better for the diners to try and eradicate the pest rather than just ignoring it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care what they talk about over at their shitty little juvenile troll place.  Let them link to posts here and claim censorship and jerk each others little peckers off.  It's worth it to get rid of as many of these pests here as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       What other site on the internet allows itself get trolled like this?  This can't be an accident.  I also find it suspicious that there are many voices here saying, "don't worry about it, just pretend there isn't a cockroach infestation here and try to eat dinner."

       Banning them would not cut down on their trolling. They would generate new accounts. This would give them attention and it would give them something to do. They would feel righteous indignation at having been banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of them might be paid shill for private corporations or maybe government agencies. I don't really know and I don't really care. They behave like savages and I will treat them as such; they will be ignored.

       What they want is the current situation.  You're arguing for allowing a troll infestation . . . something no self-respecting website would ever allow.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had a site dedicated to Jewish issues and a bunch of anti semites set up a website dedicated to making fun of the Jewish site and constantly linked to and trolled it (e.g. posting comments like, "you Jews are idiots, everyone is laughing at you") don't you think it would be smart to ban the trolls?  It turns every post into a name calling fight.  It derails conversations so people constantly bicker over the same basic assumptions ("Judaism is a false religion", "no it isn't, what are you doing on a site about Judaism if you hate it so much").

       They will find ways around banning.

      <p>
       If you want to ban them that's fine. Good luck. I think they'll come back. If you think they'll leave due to being banned then you have more faith in the 'banning' process than I do. Trolls like to troll and I doubt they'll allow a 'ban' to stop them. But like I say; good luck with it.

       Why is Reddit incapable of banning IPs?  I used to be able to get rid of such people on crummy fps servers 10 years ago when they acted up, why is Reddit so weak in this regard?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I like attention too.  I can drain a troll's life force while practicing my argumentation incessantly.  Someone who is only motivated by agitating people won't like you calmly cutting their non-existent argument apart over and over again, especially if you actually enjoy it.  If they descend into profanities and name-calling, you know you're really hurting them and you should feel good.

       So what you're saying is people shouldn't be able to post conspiracy theories on a site about conspiracy theories because you conspiratard trolls demand to be able to "ridicule" people here.

       Again, you're admitting you and your cockroach friends are trolls.

       Like a true conspiratard, you can't do basic logic.  You're free to post your trolling "input" on your own crappy sub (but frankly if I were running reddit I would not allow a subreddit's whose whole purpose is to troll another subreddit).  Or create your own website dedicated to your conspiratard cause (being a freedom fighter/truth seeker/internet vigilante dedicated to exposing false conspiracy theories).

       They're bullies.  Just like in school if you ignore them they will see they're not getting the reaction they want out of you and get bored. If you keep taking about how effective they are and how you're going to get them back, that's when they know what they're doing is working.
