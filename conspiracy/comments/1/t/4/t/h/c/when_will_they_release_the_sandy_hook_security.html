<p>Jesus, relax bud. Generally people don&#39;t question religious beliefs because they entail a supernatural being who can not be proved or disproved, so even a debate is futile. Spraying vinegar on your kids would be a form of prevention/medicine, and therefore I think its more then fair to question is effectiveness.</p>

<p>And yet we <em>can</em> empirically test the effect vinegar sprayed into the air has on chem trails. We can scientifically prove and disprove a great many of things. Especially when the things we&#39;re discussing, chem trails and vinegar, are material things that could easily be subjected to experiments.</p>

<p>And everything to do with you equating spraying vinegar on someone as a preventive measure (which can be empirically proved or disproved) with the abstract concept of a supernatural being (which can not). One can be scientifically proven or dis-proven. One can not. So claiming that they are both off limits for debate based upon the impossibility of empirically testing it is demonstrably false.

<p>True, you simply implied that belief in vinegar dissipating chem-trails was akin to belief in a religion.

Law enforcement messed up that day &amp; probably got a group of kids killed. It&#39;s the same reason they demolished the building - Ballistics evidence pointed to a &quot;Non-reported&quot; interaction with the shooter.
There is plenty of information in the 48 pages they released. It&#39;s a good starting point if your curious about the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m leaning that way, yes.  At one point during the event, the shooter fires 5 shots from within the classroom out into the parking lot - 3 of which hit vehicles parked there.  The report also states that the shooter&#39;s first &amp; only use of the glock 20 occurred in the classroom where he committed suicide. However, in the same report ballistics recovers a separate 10mm shell near the dead principal (*the entrance to the school, down the hall from where he died). They found 200+ rounds of unused ammo on the shooters body - indicating a larger plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of that stuff I can sort of shrug off.  The &quot;performances&quot; I see as being more of grieving parents who were probably prescribed Xanax to relax them and trying to spin the death of their kids in some sort of way to comfort themselves.  If it was actually actors I think there would have been some tears intentionally flowing so as not to raise any flags.  All medical examiners are basically ghouls to begin with.  They really don&#39;t have social skills because they are around dead bodies all the time so if you throw a camera in front of one (particularly one who isn&#39;t really in the public eye ever) you are going to get some weird statements/actions.  The idea that Lanza couldn&#39;t carry the guns/ammo and kill that many people I say that we know that he didn&#39;t have the gun that was taken from his trunk and when your targets are cowering, unarmed children who are huddled up in fear you can easily rack up a bunch of kills.  I can even understand with the sensitive nature of this particular shooting why there would be no release of pictures/footage of the shooting/victims.  It&#39;s the other suspects that I can&#39;t reconcile.  </p>

<p>sick.. even worse than exploiting the kids right after by interviewing them, drugging the parents?  at the very least the media behaved abhorrently.    it&#39;s very odd because all the interviews are like that, and even with Xanax, you can still emote honestly.   I don&#39;t agree, but sure it&#39;s possible.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I hate to speculate like that.  we don&#39;t know what happened except for the medical examiner&#39;s confusing statements.  the parents didn&#39;t even see their kids bodies (well Posner said she did,but it was closed casket too.. also she didn&#39;t observe jewish mourning tradition very religiously at all. - of course she&#39;s a &#39;convert&#39;)</p>

<p>I disagree with the speculation anyway - a pile of kids would mean that the ones at the back would have some shielding, and might survive.  We didn&#39;t even see ANY efforts to save kids that were shot.. all dead on scene.   and the first responders that were interviewed?  they didn&#39;t even do anything,  they waited outside and nothing happened .. and then they fake cried about how traumatic it was to do nothing.   </p>

<p>no blood, no victims, just bullshit.   I don&#39;t know what happened, it could have been easily cleared up.  There are easy ways to prove the positive, but proving the negative is always very difficult.   Why didn&#39;t they do the easy thing and show us Lanza with the guns?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  This sort of thing doesn&#39;t serve as evidence to people who don&#39;t believe it (which is understandable) but it does offer a little extra insight to those who know somebody who was directly affected.  </p>
