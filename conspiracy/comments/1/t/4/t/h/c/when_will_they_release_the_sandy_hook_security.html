       Not sure what you are referring to, but I do spray vinegar on my kids' chests when there are chemtrails around.  It works to help keep them healthy, not sick.  And I don't spray their faces.

       I sprayed it in the sky when I saw the chemtrails and they went away a lot faster than when I didn't spray.  My kids used to get sick a lot until I realized it was probably the chemtrails and started spraying the vinegar on their chests.  I figured they would breathe in the evaporated vinegar and it would counteract the chemtrails in the air. It helped almost immediately.  They stopped coughing and throwing up.

       That's all the proof I need.

       Jesus, relax bud. Generally people don't question religious beliefs because they entail a supernatural being who can not be proved or disproved, so even a debate is futile. Spraying vinegar on your kids would be a form of prevention/medicine, and therefore I think its more then fair to question is effectiveness.

       empirically test the effect vinegar sprayed into the air has on chem trails. We can scientifically prove and disprove a great many of things. Especially when the things we're discussing, chem trails and vinegar, are material things that could easily be subjected to experiments.

       And everything to do with you equating spraying vinegar on someone as a preventive measure (which can be empirically proved or disproved) with the abstract concept of a supernatural being (which can not). One can be scientifically proven or dis-proven. One can not. So claiming that they are both off limits for debate based upon the impossibility of empirically testing it is demonstrably false. That's my only point.

       Okay, so you don't know how science works. Also, Newton first theorized gravity in the 17th century...and again, gravity does not "= downward force". You seem to have a very poor grasp of a "known truth."

       True, you simply implied that belief in vinegar dissipating chem-trails was akin to belief in a religion. I explained that generally people do not question religious beliefs because the debate would be futile. If god was as easily disproven as chem trails dissipating by a small amount of vinegar sprayed thousands of feet away, I imagine many more people would in fact do just that.

       You won't see it because the footage contradict's the official report.
Law enforcement messed up that day &amp; probably got a group of kids killed. It's the same reason they demolished the building - Ballistics evidence pointed to a "Non-reported" interaction with the shooter.
There is plenty of information in the 48 pages they released. It's a good starting point if your curious about the subject.

       This seems plausible. So is your theory that it was not a false flag, but a coverup?

       I'm leaning that way, yes.  At one point during the event, the shooter fires 5 shots from within the classroom out into the parking lot - 3 of which hit vehicles parked there.  The report also states that the shooter's first &amp; only use of the glock 20 occurred in the classroom where he committed suicide. However, in the same report ballistics recovers a separate 10mm shell near the dead principal (*the entrance to the school, down the hall from where he died). They found 200+ rounds of unused ammo on the shooters body - indicating a larger plan.

       One cannot be tried in a court of law based on contradictions alone. When used in conjunction with "hard" evidence, it helps paint a portrait of abuse &amp; collusion. But on it's own, contradictions are not considered grounds for prosecution. The law holds all the cards (i.e. - hard evidence), so this game can't even be played.

       I'm pretty positive that people were shot that day but the thing that makes me really wonder is the footage of the 2 other "suspects" running away from the police around the side of the school and into the woods before being apprehended.  Why would innocent people run away from the police (and be wearing camo pants and a black jacket).

       Why would you be positive of that? You literally CAN NOT find footage of a bloody kid, a dead kid, a crying and injured kid, a traumatized kid. Anything of that sort from the event. Real events tend to have some pretty explicit footage. This event does not.

       Yeah.  Like I said there are still things that make me question what exactly went down.  It wasn't until very recently actually that I watched all the footage from outside of the school that was captured that day and it made me second guess myself, but as far as deaths go, I know at least 1 kid died so I wouldn't doubt that the death-count is legit.  It's how many people participated in the shootings that I'm not sure about.

       I know, so you can take my word or not.  I'm not disillusioned into thinking that my saying that (you don't even know who I am or how reliable I am) will change any minds, but for myself I know this because I know my aunt isn't a part of any cover up.  She's a stay at home mom with no ties to any sort of government shit.

       even then, it's not your aunt's but the friend.. that's another degree away.   for all we know she gave one of her kids as a sacrifice to a ritual to baal.. the point is the information doesn't contribute to finding out what happened.

       Well I trust my aunt's judgment of character because she did visit this person afterwards and everything.  They talked about the whole thing and this woman was positively devastated (according to my aunt).  I know this is nothing but anecdotal evidence at this point but I believe that kids were really killed there because of this.

       It's possible, but then if that were true, then there must be an even MORE sinister reason why the evidence is withheld - I've assessed that the Lanza story is most improbable, and likely impossible.

       For the longest time I was convinced that this one was a completely legit story.  I only recently started seeing the other side of things as far as this shooting goes.  The whole "nobody was really killed" thing is what kept me away from actually investigating it further (because of what I knew from my aunt).  I even let the whole dispute over the different guns that were claimed to have been used and then revealed to
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       not been used slide.  At this point I'm tilted like 60-40 where the 60 is on the side of something deeper than the official story having actually happened.

       the guy they took in custody that was sitting in the front seat of the police car, the guy taken down in the woods, and the other reports yeah.. things that seemed more odd were the victim performances, the lack of christmas decorations,  the use of green screen in initial reporting, interviews of kids on the scene, the lack of bodies, the medical examiner's strange behaviour, that Lanza couldn't carry those guns and ammo easily, while getting a high score with shots:kills.   no witnesses, no video, no stills, no bodies removed, no injured kids... all killed?  it seemed so clinical and un-massacre like to me.    also the nuns, wtf?  and the cops raiding the wrong school?   it all spells shenanigans to me.

       A lot of that stuff I can sort of shrug off.  The "performances" I see as being more of grieving parents who were probably prescribed Xanax to relax them and trying to spin the death of their kids in some sort of way to comfort themselves.  If it was actually actors I think there would have been some tears intentionally flowing so as not to raise any flags.  All medical examiners are basically ghouls to begin with.  They really don't have social skills because they are around dead bodies all the time so if you throw a camera in front of one (particularly one who isn't really in the public eye ever) you are going to get some weird statements/actions.  The idea that Lanza couldn't carry the guns/ammo and kill that many people I say that we know that he didn't have the gun that was taken from his trunk and when your targets are cowering, unarmed children who are huddled up in fear you can easily rack up a bunch of kills.  I can even understand with the sensitive nature of this particular shooting why there would be no release of pictures/footage of the shooting/victims.  It's the other suspects that I can't reconcile.

       sick.. even worse than exploiting the kids right after by interviewing them, drugging the parents?  at the very least the media behaved abhorrently.    it's very odd because all the interviews are like that, and even with Xanax, you can still emote honestly.   I don't agree, but sure it's possible.

       I hate to speculate like that.  we don't know what happened except for the medical examiner's confusing statements.  the parents didn't even see their kids bodies (well Posner said she did,but it was closed casket too.. also she didn't observe jewish mourning tradition very religiously at all. - of course she's a 'convert')
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree with the speculation anyway - a pile of kids would mean that the ones at the back would have some shielding, and might survive.  We didn't even see ANY efforts to save kids that were shot.. all dead on scene.   and the first responders that were interviewed?  they didn't even do anything,  they waited outside and nothing happened .. and then they fake cried about how traumatic it was to do nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       no blood, no victims, just bullshit.   I don't know what happened, it could have been easily cleared up.  There are easy ways to prove the positive, but proving the negative is always very difficult.   Why didn't they do the easy thing and show us Lanza with the guns?

       take everything you see/read about conspiracies with a grain of salt. listen to people's theories with an open mind, analyze  the evidence, and draw your own conclusions.

       I feel you on that.  I'm not a believer of the official 911 story, but my father-in-law is a career military and personally knew someone who died in the Pentagon attack.

       Yeah.  This sort of thing doesn't serve as evidence to people who don't believe it (which is understandable) but it does offer a little extra insight to those who know somebody who was directly affected.
