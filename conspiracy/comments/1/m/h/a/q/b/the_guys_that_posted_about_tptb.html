       I remember a post that was from a guy who had a friend in a an elite family. The post detailed that there are thirteen family's or groups that control everything and they are headed by a being that never ages. I think it was here in conspiracy.

       Thanks guys, i was interested in it because the idea of somebody not ageing and ruling over us is exactly what some Muslims believe about the singular dajjal. That he was found on an island chained up and they let him free to roam the earth. Kind of like LOST except instead of them keeping the evil on the island in this story he got off the island.

       To be totally honest i don't think you can rely on the English version of the internet for any trustworthy information about Islam. You cannot deny that there has been a conceited effort to implant biased ideas of Islam in English speaking peoples heads. For example, how many english speaking people with islamaphobia know that Muslims consider jesus to be the Messiah and mohammad simply a messenger? And how many christians know that in the original greek bible in the chapter of John Jesus predicts that there will be a prophet named "parakletos" that will unite ONE race of people under monotheism and the rest of the world will turn their backs on this prophet. "parakletos" is the greek version of Ahmad which was Muhamads name, although the English internet will try and tell you otherwise and so will christians as they prescribe these passages to the penticost which is a contemporary fabrication that arose once english speaking peoples learned of islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway ill stop ranting.... but yeah the Dajjal... SOME muslims think the dajjal is a group of people or a nation while others prescribe it to a single being.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Tamim al dari is the name of the guy that apparently found the dajjal chained up and according to some muslims the dajjal is now roaming the earth. SOME interpretations of the prophecy even believe that obama is the anti-christ and in his seventh year of reign the Dajjal will reveal himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry about the rant but you should do some research on the dajjal, its pretty much the same prophecy as revelations and you could say its "the second beast", the one with one eye. Christianity and Islam are the same religion in my opinion just practiced by different cultures in different ways. The Quran also doesn't say that you have to be muslim as people try to say, its a misrepresentation, the true meaning of the Quran is to unite the arabs as they used to all be zoroastrians and hindus and pagans...

       &lt;-- cant find any good youtube vids about it
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR the dajjal is the islam equivalent of the christian revelation except a lot scarier.

       "Ahmed" is a corruption of "Om", the sound of the Divine Constant.  During meditation, before one achieves samadhi (non-breathing, check out Transcendental Meditation and studies on this topic).
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal theory is that "Om" is the sound of the Hydrogen Hum of the universe; the noise of the background radiation that can be found everywhere with radio telescopes.

       exactly google searches suck and i think if there were groups or family's working together to game the worlds population information about it wouldn't prop up from google and the information that does prop up and is readily available to us is if anything just misinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       in fact, i dont think you can get any reliable information from the net unless you are on FTP networks, tor or a part of a secret forum like that gamefaqs forum that went off the radar (LUE).

       I never use google, and bing and yahoo only for mundane stuff.
       <br/>
       The worst thing is how much has been scrubbed from the major search engines. For all things economic, political, U.S. History, Google has been top listing conservative sources, (lies) since about 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other tricks.  the propoaganda machine now refers to all things Repubican as GOP, a term not many remember to use when looking up a particular party's response to something.

       I use this list a lot, depending upon what I am looking for.

       yeah google searches really dont give much info compared to what this guy was saying, his posts were all deleted anyway so blah.

       is there anyway possible to do searches on internet databases that aren't listed on google and opt out of being able to be searched through? maybe some kind of script or something?

       Do you personally think its possible to "shape shift". I've heard theologians say that according to hermetic scripture its possible but i cannot find many resources on the Qabbalah etc.
      </p>

       And in the first link it says that the other times this has happened are in 1999 and 2003. What do you think those sources were? one an alternate news source outlet and the other a internet forum.

       Perhaps it includes it.  According to the info in the link, it is

       Well...realize what the "this" that happened was.  I believe it was referring to an integrating of a "non Illuminati" member into the fold.  I might be wrong, however.  What do you think they were referring to?  The other times

       You seem to be drawing distinctions between God, the "Demiurge", and "supreme beings".  I'm not familiar with those distinctions and do not myself draw them, so I'm not quite sure how to interpret the sentence.  Additionally, I'm not sure that ANY being escapes karma - and if they can
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       create this universe, then they certainly seem worthy of the categorization of a "supreme being".
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm not sure what you are meaning by the quote you added.  If you could explain your reasoning behind including it, that would be cool.  Thanks.

       Compared to an ant we are supreme beings, and in a few billion years when we figure out how to escape maximum entropy and go on to create a new race in our image in the next universe i'm sure they will think of us as supreme beings.

      <p>
       Don't ever underestimate an ant.  One can say that compared to a drop, a waterfall is a supreme being, but one would none the less be mistaken in seeing the drop as different from the waterfall in the first place.  Afterall, without the drop, there
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       be no waterfall in the at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, taking the same logic you described above, compared to a whale or even an elephant,
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       are the "lowly" organism and
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       are the "supreme being".
      </p>
      <p>
       All this is to say that the assessment of what is and is not a "supreme being" seems to depend upon the apprehension of information that it seems we as human beings are nowhere near privy to.

      <p>
       All this is to say that the one is the many and the many is the one, as - of your own accord - what we are now is a future supreme being as yet unrealized and unmanifested.  If one were to agree with that (and I don't think this is too far from the truth actually), then it could also be said that the seed of the supreme being is manifested inside of literally
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       to some extent or the other, for if it is in us, it is in all.

       He actually answered my question. When the thread (and user) was deleted, I thought I would still have a reference to it since I still had the link in my comment history. Apparently that was only temporary because I can't find it in my history anymore.

       I followed the thread extremely closely. He talked to his friend and mentioned to him that he done the reddit post. His friend requested he take everything down. Which he did. He deleted all of his comments individually, and then the threads he had posted. Last I checked he was still active on his account during the boston bombings.
