       That is true. However modern Zionism is almost entirely unique to the Jewish people. Don't get me wrong - they wield a massive amount of power for such a small demographic however they only have it because they are allowed to. If the leading world nations weren't totally reliant on Israel for its military technology and other scientific advancements, it would be a very different story. I've always seen their existence as a nation state to be limited to how useful they continue to be for the USA. If that relationship began to be too difficult to maintain I don't for a minute think that the USA would not instantly flip their views at the first opportunity. I truly don't believe that there is such a massive Jewish-Zionist presence in positions of power to where an obvious outright breach of human rights or military sanctions would not result in its collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree with what they do or how they do it but they play a very useful role for countries like the USA and I don't think they would seriously be allowed to step out of line in ways which we might expect them to. I see them as contender for a spot in the top ten most controversial governments/nations right now simply because of their stance.

       The Semitic people actually believe they are God's chosen people.
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone tells you their people are "chosen", it means if you are not part of that group then you are automatically un-chosen. These Israeli people actually believe God wants them to have that land, so they have the right by God to bulldoze over the Palestinians houses and build up Greater Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any Jewish person who supports the Israeli rogue state are apart of this bigger problem. Whether they even understand what Zionism is or not, that state of Israel has only been around since what... the 1940s? Their government through USA proxy are the greatest terrorists this world has ever seen. And just an FYI they are most definitely not God's chosen people.

       All mono theists have irrational beliefs that affect the world negatively. The reason the zionists hav any allies is a bunch of mouth breathers think the end times can't come unless the Jews get what they want. 
If you feel the need to tell anyone the Jews aren't the chosen ones you should probably think about improving your own belief system
At least Jews read their holy book in its native language

       what? Look one thing is saying anyone who believes in Jesus (and I am saying this as an atheist) will be saved (even this is stupid), but saying "everyone who was born jewish will be saved and is more than everyone other" is just simply racist

       What I'm saying is that anyone who feels the need to say "jews are not the chosen people" is a fucking theist. And thus part of theproblem not the solution.

       And i have a lot more respect for jews than most christians. I don't see too many Christians learning greek or hebrew to study scripture. If you're going to pretend your book is holy at least have the decency not to translate it.

       to tell true I dont feel any respect to any religion. I mean if you take as truth something that cant be proven, you jail your brain to see things in only one way, with rules of the religion. (Learn about religion, they can be interesting, but dont bet everything on just one option/solution to the whole life)
      </p>
      <p>
       Basicaly Islam and christianity is saying if you dont believe in the same thing we do you should be killed or burn in hell in afterlife. But if jews are saying you have to be born there and believe in all this thing or you are less than us, that seems to me even more stupid.

       I think the rest of the world underestimates how much of a role religeon plays in American national politics. We are basically at war with Islam right now just no one says it. The Christians look around and blame the jews when we have elections and if they didn't believe the bullshit they did what the jews think wouldn't matter.

       I simply asked a question. So because Jewish people own everything they are bad? I understand the terrorist parts of everyone's statements, but because one people control organizations they are bad? I'm seriously just asking questions I do not understand.

      <p>
       Also explain to me how Israel has such a stranglehold on all of these things. I don't understand. I am really lost. Also if they do these particular acts of terrorism and what not why do we back them? Someone give me the low down on this because I do not understand at all.

       I don't listen to people that use broad terms because nine times out of ten, they're just mirroring other people's bullshit. It isn't a secret that pro Israelis have a huge bearing on US foreign policy which is verified and documented, and there's no ambiguity about it.

       "A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm (commonly known as the "Clean Break" report) is a policy document that was prepared in 1996 by a study group led by
       <strong>
        Richard Perle
       </strong>
       for Benjamin Netanyahu, the then Prime Minister of Israel.[1] The report explained a new approach to solving Israel's security problems in the Middle East with an emphasis on "Western values".
       <strong>
        It has since been criticized for advocating an aggressive new policy including the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, and the containment of Syria by engaging in proxy warfare and highlighting their possession of "weapons of mass destruction".

       "The Project for the New American Century (PNAC) was an American think tank based in Washington, D.C. established in 1997 as a non-profit educational organization founded by
       <strong>
        William Kristol
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        Robert Kagan
       </strong>
       . The PNAC's stated goal is "to promote American global leadership."[1] Fundamental to the PNAC were the view that "American leadership is both good for America and good for the world" and support for "a Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity."[2] With its members in numerous key administrative positions,
       <strong>
        the PNAC exerted influence on high-level U.S. government officials in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush and affected the Bush Administration's development of military and foreign policies, especially involving national security and the Iraq War."
       </strong>

       Both these documents were written or had signatories of the same people and also after writing them they were appointed in the Bush Administration.

       William Kristol is an editor and they often have columns or pieces written by people from the list of signatories to The Project for a New American Century.
      </p>
      <p>
       These institutions are often the source for 'expert opinion' in both the US and UK on news channels or newspapers. Google an experts name sometime and it can often be from one of these organisations that have the exact same people on the board of advisors or directors.

      <p>
       The Syrian opposition link shows you how the same people from the Bush Administration are also involved in Syria and it leads back to Israel as did Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is literally the same people all the way through all of this and if these people were absent from US politics, the US would not be involved in the Middle East as much as it is now. That's not to say that 'it's all Israel's fault' but it does wield a large amount of power in Washington. Go and research it for yourself. Things like AIPAC are not just discussed here, the media talks about how Influential it is and how they manipulate politics.

       As insidious as it all is, that's perfectly in keeping with US foreign policy and geostrategy, namely to prop up / entrench a US puppet state / ally in the middle east to help contain the asian geopolitical sphere.

       I don't think it is when another state is directing another states foreign policy causing all sorts of problems on the international stage, huge loss of life and financial loses. They are subverting democracy of another nation.

      <p>
       The US has took all the blame for woes in the Middle East but it lies with a small group of individuals that did a coup on the US government. That is right at the top of the list of bad things that can happen in politics for me.

       All I'm saying is that the US would be doing all of this even if Israel didn't exist, it's geostrategy 101... Of course, Israel exists

       The fact that the American media to a large extent is
       <a href="http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/jews-in-the-media-hollywood/">
        owned by people who are Jewish
       </a>
       isn't a bad thing in itself and the fact that
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqM2EXFdOnM">
        the Jewish lobby AIPAC
       </a>
       is the largest and most powerful lobbying group in Washington doesn't mean that it's a bad thing and that Jewish people shouldn't have a powerful pro-Israel lobby.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The bad thing
       </strong>
       is how this affect U.S. policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Jewish media control and Pro-Israel lobby has a
       <strong>
        "stranglehold on the U.S. Congress"
       </strong>
       , helping the election campaign of congressional candidates who support its agenda, and to punish those who challenge it, by funding the candidate's opponent and through blackmail, potentially ending their political career. Making it very hard to get elected and get a strong political position without supporting Israel and Jewish interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the Pro-Israel lobby has a strong influence on U.S. Foreign Policy in the Middle East and has been a major factor in pushing America into wars in that region.

       I have to disagree. The problem is indeed that so many people controlling the media are Jewish. That is the problem. Jews have certain collective goals and that are not in the interests of non-Jewish Americans. Jews are a tribe. They are unified by their beliefs, and by their suspicion, disdain, and even hatred of non-Jews. This is real. This is the problem, and we have to be willing to break the media conditioning and state the problem.
