    <div class="md"><p>could the FBI &amp; CIA have both used their influence on the media to block any real info from ever coming to light???</p>

<p><strong>&quot;I only wish the press would allow our case to stand or fall on its merits in court.
It appears that certain elements of the mass media have an active interest in preventing this case from ever coming to trial at all and find it necessary to employ against me every smear device in the book.&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Further investigation into the matter, CIA officials say, would inevitably reveal a series of embarrassing relationships in the 1950s and 1960s with some of the most powerful organizations and individuals in American journalism.</p>

<p>Among the executives who lent their cooperation to the Agency were Williarn Paley of the Columbia Broadcasting System, Henry Luce of Tirne Inc., Arthur Hays Sulzberger of the New York Times, Barry Bingham Sr. of the LouisviIle Courier‑Journal, and James Copley of the Copley News Service. Other organizations which cooperated with the CIA include the American Broadcasting Company, the National Broadcasting Company, the Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps‑Howard, Newsweek magazine, the Mutual Broadcasting System, the Miami Herald and the old Saturday Evening Post and New York Herald‑Tribune.
By far the most valuable of these associations, according to CIA officials, have been with the New York Times, CBS and Time Inc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Hoover is suspected of BLACKMAILING JFK into taking LBJ as his running mate...</p>

<p>2) In the summer of &#39;63, the FBI raided CIA/Cuban militia training compound in Louisiana...LHO was in New Orleans at the time--and there is suspicion he was working for the FBI and observing the CIA/Cubans...did LHO leave the Texas School Book Depo out the BACK DOOR so he wouldn&#39;t be whacked by Jack Ruby (CIA) at the scene???</p>

<p>3) After JFK and LHO were whacked, Hoover immediately took over the investigation and had FBI agents pick up all evidence from Dallas PD...</p>

<p>4) Could this internal battle have continued and been the cause of WATERGATE???</p>

<p>5) Could Oklahoma City have been the CIA playing a dirty trick on the FBI/ATF...is that why 35 FBI/ATF Agents were OUT OF THE OFFICE that morning??? or was OK City just another Operation to get more MONEY???</p>

<p>6) Could these internal struggles for U.S. funds and turf be the cause of 9/11 ???</p>

<p>7) Could 9/11 have been a U.S. agency slugfest between the FBI, CIA, SEC, (etc, etc)</p>
