That the Titanic may have really been an inside job designed to eliminate powerful bankers who opposed formation of the U.S. Federal Reserve. 1) I didn't have enough life boats so most of the men on board would die. 2) Ship holes created with explosives. 3)Hollywood movie to sway public opinion towards the 'official version'. 4)Titanic sunk 1912 -- Fed formed 1913.

       there are those sick mofos that are pedophiles- and then there is the accusation of being a pedophile. You can send somebody to prison just by emailing them a file and raiding their house- BOOM discredited and behind bars.

       A good friend of mine just walked into jail on Friday on a plea for child pornography.  They stole his computers and although they didn't find the pictures it did open up his family to being investigated by the CPS.  He was charged with molesting his step-daughter as well and they took his seven year old son and drugged him while under CPS "care".  The DA offered him a plea that he take either one of the felonies so he took the child pornography charge even though he never admitted as such to having it and they never found anything.  They have a 97% conviction rate in our county.  The DA threatened to drag his entire family through the court system and to also throw more charges at him if he fought it.  I was out of the country when he was married and another mutual friend of ours was his best man and will not contact him purely based on the charge alone (and I know this because I spoke with him on the phone).  From my conversations it appears that about 70% of the population instantly knows that a person must have done it without any details.  Its damning.  Oh also the DHS was out his house and they produced a heavily redacted transcript of the secretely recorded conversation when he naively invited them in to clear up the misunderstanding.  Just his words and lots of black.  So no context.  CPS asks the same question 20 times and if you continue then they will eventually get the answer that they are looking for such as that you were once in your childs room at night, so check that box.  Then they ask if you ever touched their butts and they will try to personalize it like maybe you were playing or wrestling one day and you accidentally touched your childs butt.  Then they have [x] goes into room at night, [x] touches their butts.  Lawyer up and never, ever let your guard down around these people.  There is no excuse for being naive with them.  They are vicious and self-righteous.  They are zealots.

       this was an excellent story- but it also reminds all of us to:
      </p>
      <p>
       A) never take a plea
B) never speak to police or investigators without a lawyer

       The pedophile rings get even weird when they start getting connected to Satanic rituals and MKULTRA abuse for mind control purposes.  Those elements may be there to discredit the original notion, but there are a lot of supposed witnesses and whistle blowers to both.

       Government blacklisted Hydrazine Sulfate (HS) when it showed 50% tumor regression in late stage cancer patients and Dr. Joseph Gold, who discovered it's helpful properties during his lab work at the NASA Mercury Project, didn't allow a major drug company to use it for vast profits or squirrel it away (it saved two family friends when I ordered them some and directed them on how to take it).
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, how does it help the patient?
It's an enzyme inhibitor that stops the process of turning a lactic acid molecule into a glucose molecule and thus sapping the energy of the patient.  It takes 17 glucose molecules to fuel that enzymatic process.  Tumors produce mass amounts of lactic acid.  With the enzyme inhibited via HS you quickly recover from cachexia, the wasting away low-energy state of late stage cancer patients.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare Wikipedia's article to Dr. Gold's:

       One of the major reasons the Iraq war cost so much and was such a disaster, is that they did not expect as many injured as there were.  In previous wars, the US either met little resistance, or injured soldiers tended to die at high rates.  In this one, modern medical care meant that soldiers survived crippling injuries.  Because of this, the future medical costs of caring for them, over their entire lives, increases substantially.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obamacare is a bail-out of Bush's Iraq debacle, and a stealth way of paying for it.  Insurance companies provide coverage for "prior conditions" ie. injured soldiers, while the government forces everyone to buy insurance at higher rates as a backdoor tax.  It shouldn't be a surprise that Obamacare helps insurance companies and fails to lower costs.  That's by design.

       One of the major reasons the Iraq war cost so much was that they STOLE billions.
      </p>

       And it was a
       <strong>
        9/11 conspirator
       </strong>
       who STOLE it.

        On February 6, 2007, Bremer appeared before a Congressional committee investigating fraud and abuse and was questioned about missing funds during his tenure as head of the CPA and to respond to conclusions from a January 2005 audit report, including the missing $8.8 billion U.S. of Iraq's money
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That $8.8 BILLION was in CASH:

       Incidentally, BREMER has a very interesting "Conspiracy History" that r/conspiracy should be aware of:
      </p>
      <p>
       His offices were the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh_%26_McLennan_Companies#September_11_attacks">
        EXACT offices that were struck on 9/11 by American Airlines Flight 11
       </a>
       .  These floors were also the EXACT floors that were "renovated &amp; fireproofed" in the weeks before 9/11.  His Wikipedia entry
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bremer#Early_life_and_career">
        barely mentions any of this
       </a>
       .

      <p>
       <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/06/19/missing-iraq-money-may-be-as-much-as-18-billion/">
        Other money was flown in CASH on pallets to Iraq and promptly vanished:  as much as $18 billion.
       </a>
       And CNBC says
       <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/45031100">
        up to $40 billion.  MISSING

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR  Guy who worked for Kissinger &amp; Bin Laden family in 1990s, had exact offices hit by plane on 9/11 in WTC, first person to blame Bin Laden &amp; Iraq on television on 9/11, becomes de facto "president of Iraq" and makes billions in cash disappear, never gets held accountable.

       Either A) Soldiers health care costs are paid for by the military, meaning that even after Obamacare it is still paid for by the military.
      </p>
      <p>
       or B) Soldiers are on their own for health care. In which case before Obamacare they're just fucked. And after Obamacare they can be taken care of. But in either case it's not the military paying.

       I don't think that's his point. I believe his point may be that Obamacare was masked as this great thing, such as a bail-out for the American people, when all it does is help to reimburse the high costs of the Iraq war and finally (for the insurance companies), taxpayers all over the United States will HAVE to pay for insurance.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Obama administration’s proposed defense budget calls for military families and retirees to pay sharply more for their healthcare, while leaving unionized civilian defense workers’ benefits untouched... Several congressional aides suggested the move is designed to increase the enrollment in Obamacare’s state-run insurance exchanges.

       From a review of Ronald Glasser M.D.'s

       </em>
       :

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In this deftly written and researched account, he explains that because so many more soldiers survive their wounds today than did in Vietnam, they often suffer from multiple injuries requiring "poly-trauma units." Glasser describes how improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan and Iraq blow off limbs, wreak havoc on internal organs, and cause devastating concussive brain damage--the signature injuries of our new wars. Glasser points out that today's wars with new weapons, new injuries, and new treatments all add up to "new suffering" for soldiers.

       It's more the availability and the "gadgetization" of old tried and true technology. Field medics carry all sorts of stuff that a Vietnam era medical facility would have killed for. Automatic tourniquets, blood coagulants, etc. That's why in these modern wars the fatal casualty count has been so low. Notice you have to start digging into non-mainstream sources to get the numbers of injured.

       It was a SIGINTEL ship listening to Egypt's communications since they were in a war with our "ally."
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel then attempted to destroy the ship, kill the survivors, and machine-gun the life-rafts so they could blame it on Egypt and get the US to fight
       <em>
        yet another war
       </em>
       for Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Help was on the way-McNamara himself turned it back. Not only that--the cover-up lasted for many, many years. In fact, the first two Israeli pilots REFUSED to fire on an American ship...they were jailed for 18 years IIRC.

       The big foundations ran by the richest people in the world are essentially the parallel government, they fund NGOs and non-profit advocacy groups to go into national, state and local governments and lobby as faux "grassroots" organizations.  The news media is in on it and they report that the people want (insert new policy here) and that these groups were spontaneously formed to advocate for change, when in reality they're change agents, literally, paid for by corporate money.  This is how Agenda 21 is being implemented WORLDWIDE in order to set up the infrastructure for a seamless integration into the New World Order by the mid-century.

       Regarding the Titanic conspiracy, I disagree with the Hollywood movie being propaganda - too long after the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with the rest, though, and would add a couple of details.
      </p>
      <p>
       The apex criminals who commit atrocities like the Titanic or 9/11 subscribe to a fucked-up honour code, and they believe subterfuge is beneath them. They therefore always signal their intentions beforehand (hence Morgan Robertson's novel about the Wreck of the Titan).
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the Titanic was actually "a conspiracy within a conspiracy". The majority of participants believed the event was an insurance switch between the non-viable RMS Olympic and its sister ship, the Titanic. They believed the SS Californian would be on hand to pick up passengers and prevent loss of life. However, JP Morgan's conspiracy inner sanctum had a second purpose - to eliminate Astor, his rival - and thus the Captain of the Californian was ordered not to assist the ship in distress. Most of the conspirators thought the whole operation had gone terribly wrong (but couldn't say anything for fear of their lives) whereas in fact it had achieved its ultimate purpose.

       Sorry wordpro, it's all from memory. However, the two main conspiracies - the "Titanic/Olympic switch" and the "Elimination of the Federal Reserve opponents" - are both well documented. My take is that second conspiracy is plausible but it requires that the first be one be true - JP Morgan didn't go to all that effort JUST to eliminate John Jacob Astor. He had decided the ship was going to be sent to the bottom of the Atlantic, so JP Morgan took the opportunity to send some of his enemies down with it. So he invited Astor to join him on his "new" ship's maiden voyage. Of course Morgan, inexplicably, never turned and the ship launched without him...
      </p>
      <p>
       If the "Titanic was an inside job" is new to you, your research should start with
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futility,_or_the_Wreck_of_the_Titan">
        The Wreck of the Titan
       </a>
       . It was published a full fourteen years before the Titanic sank - in 1898, and appears to have been used as some of blueprint by JP Morgan.

       Maybe this is well known but economic embargoes are used as population control for foreign countries we are likely to go to war with.  They are not an effective means of regime change but embargoes do starve off many of the poor people that might otherwise join the army or resist us.

       That's actually a pretty commonly discussed one.  The elaboration is the US Chiefs of Staff signed off on a plan to shoot down a US plane over Cuba or create Cuban terrorist attacks in the US as a pretext for invasion.  Kennedy rejected them.  Yet more reason for the MIComplex to not like Kennedy.

      </p>
      <p>
       Chem trails may be a simple convenient dispersal method for alumina, barium, strontium, etc particulate matter suspended in the atmosphere that can absorb RF radiation from high energy NexRad transmitters that would create a local region of heat/ high pressure that can be used to modify storm paths on a more granular level than HAARP. These particulate matter might also have a side effect of some negative health consequences but that is unlikely the primary objective of chemtrails. Good info:

       Geoengineering IS real. What they put inthe atmosphere is not everything that "chemtrail" people claim. However depositing silver iodide by plane seems like a reasonable way to do it, if one were so inclined.

      <p>
       I'm am not convinced that silver iodide in the atmosphere is a good thing.

       As I understand it, the point is to increase cloud cover so more light/heat from the sun are reflected away from earth, lowering temperatures in regions that are targeted.

       They totally do. I have lived near 2 AFBs, and an International airport, thus far, in my life. When I was 9 to 15 years old, the jets I would see would leave a vapor trail about 20 to 40 times the length of the vehicle itself. These trails would stay in the air as if they were a white cloud for 15 to 30 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I walked outside after typing the above paragraph. There are 4 white trails, straight lines in the sky above my office. They were formed at lunch, 4 hours ago. They form a kind of...slanted rectangle in the sky. They will be in the air for the next 2 to 3 hours as they slowly form clouds. Those clouds will fly off and we will see rain entering NM later tonight. Those are chemtrails, as I understand them. They last longer than natural vapor trails from jet travel, and they almost always become clouds that then move out of my viewing area, or rarely, reinforce an otherwise "weak" storm in my area.
      </p>
      <p>
       We regularly manipulate the weather here.

       They would have to completely shut down all types of manufacture of any metallic or wooden products throughout the country to be successful at that. They would have to take much more than guns away to "take our guns away." We are a resourceful bunch.

       The keyword in that sentence is could. Of course I will agree that with Monsanto, I wouldn't put it past them to do something like this but who knows really. The point is that GMOs can be used for great things, they just need to be in better hands.

       Exactly. Either they need to be regulated, or the research needs to be open to the public for scrutiny. Some mixture of both might make all parties happy.

       Here's two that I'm skeptical of. Around 5000 B.C. aliens came to earth and genetically modified the people of earth and created what we call "homo sapiens" today. 
There's also this one I read that says that we were created to carry the genes of an ancient alien race. And that we were designed to withstand Earth's harsh, ever changing atmosphere since they all started dying once they arrived on Earth. 
Crazy shit, man.

       Not supporting either way, but strange thing to look into:
Humans have hair on our face and chest almost exclusively, this is not shown in the primate world (hit or miss with chest hair)
our voice box works more like aquatic mammals than any other animals.
Our foot print does not follow proposed evolutionary standards, and neither does most of our muscle or bone structure.

       Very important stuff, which I don't hear anything about in this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immunization was introduced by Napoleon Bonaparte in Europe and made mandatory for every state employee and soldier. The idea wasn't to save lives, but to sort out the weak from the strong, so that Napoleons army wouldn't have to deal with ill soldiers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus everybody got vaccinated and people died by the thousands. Of course because the dead don't complain, everybody though that vaccines help against diseases, because they only saw the survivors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Napoleon originally saw the vaccination process used at African slaves, to sort out the weak slaves from the strong before shipping them to America, thus providing only 'quality slaves'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today the vaccination industry has become more evil than you can imagine. Vaccination is the only medicine, which is not previously controlled by authorities, because they don't have to write, what chemicals are inside those vaccines. Independent research found out, that vaccines contain over 120 different metals which are hazardous for the human body.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a group of German and Austrian physicians, who lost their licences to practice their professions, because they publicly oppose vaccinations, because they figured out, that some of their patients died after giving them vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_voQ8YmPEOU
       </a>
       [It's in German]
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there is tons of evidence, that vaccinated children become autistic and that vaccines are accountable for crybabies, but the 'modern medicine' claims, that those who become autistic, already had the predisposition for such diseases (and the vaccine just lets the disease appear sooner).
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore the high death rates of previous centuries was connected to malnutrition, lack of hygiene, coldness and constant war conditions, instead of a lack in vaccination, which is what modern medicine claims.

       I wanted to respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know... it is a sensible topic. I am not 100% sure and you can't be 100% sure either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore I am going to tell you the reasons, which convince me most. And I am going to produce a list, so that you have it easy to read:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Most of all I am convinced by the physicians, who lost their licence to practice their job for speaking up. The youtube-link from my previous post contains a physician, who speaks about vaccination. He explains a lot, but most interesting thing is his personal story. Because he gave up his doctor's office, after in two separated instances people had died, after he vaccinated them. He gave up the office to do research on vaccines. When he started to speak out, he was warned not to talk bad about vaccines. But because he was convinced, that vaccines harm the body, he continued and lost his licence. But he continues to speak out.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Vaccination is nothing else than an infection with diseases in small doses. You can't argue, that it doesn't harm the body, because even the 'modern medicine' will not vaccinate you, if your body is currently weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could too go on an on, what reasons exist not to vaccinate, but I believe that the produced wall of text will be a waste of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are just indoctrinated about vaccines and never give any counterargument a chance. That is the exact opposite of an open mind.

       Thank you.  It's claims like those that make people immediately assume my position on vaccination is similarly ill-founded and "nutty".
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't vaccinate, but for very different reasons, and it's annoying that people immediately assume I'm a moron like Jenny.

       What is your reasoning for not vaccinating?

       While I don't have the numbers handy, the approach we took was to look at the probability and impact of acquiring one of the diseases. We then compared that against the probability and impact of the I intended side effects if vaccinating (the manufacturer acknowledged risks of vaccinating, generally included with any vaccine or the manufacturers website).
      </p>
      <p>
       Our findings lead us to conclude that given our lifestyle, the benefits of vaccinating often do not outweigh the risks, particularly at young ages. When our children are older and their lifestyle/risk profile changes, then it starts to make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I intentionally say "individual benefits", because I'm willing to accept and acknowledge that the choice is selfish. I am ok relying on herd immunity without contributing to it.  There's almost no chance my kids will catch polio, so why would I intentionally expose them to the risk of vaccinating them?
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect my opinions to be controversial, and I'm open to changing them, but so far no one has presented a convincing argument where vaccinating (at this age) is a less risky choice than not vaccinating.

       TACMAR was/is "Tactical Markers".  Supposedly a way to direct US Military/UN Invaders to FEMA camps, mass graves, helipads, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, if you look at the back of street signs you'll see little stickers on them.  The indicate when the sign was placed for maintenance or whatever.  In "reality", they were an intricate code method of signaling.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, as someone who spent 9 years in the Army and Nat'l Guard, I never did get the class on how to read the codes.  I would have been horribly lost the first time I had to take a truckload of civilians to their internment camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's downfall was widespread GPS ownership (it was popular in the 90s), not to mention that if you WERE using the codes, you'd have to drive on the wrong side of the street to see them.  There was a brief resurgence when some folks started positing that there were hidden messages in Wal-Mart signs so those buildings could be used to herd people.  Fat guys near dairy, breeding women over in sporting goods and all that.

       Actually went to the titanic museum in Florida, cool stuff. They give you a shit ton of info and all this stuff get to see what inside parts of the ship looked like, get to feel how cold it was the night it sunk and get to touch a huge chunk of ice, plus you get a ticket with the name of someone who was on the ship they even go bygender and age so I was like 10-12 at the time and the name that was on my ticket belonged to a young teenage boy. But the reason it filled so fast is the creator made the doors that lock out the water to short, they are supposed to go all the way where the cabins are down to the engine rooms, but he wanted to have more space for the cabins and only included them in the engine room and coal rooms. 
Its a really awesome tour you should google it or next time your in Orlando i believe is where it was you should go to it.

       The elites have for centuries and maybe longer known that 'magick' is a system of mental control similar to hypnotism or magnetism. They use this system to maintain their power over people. Abramhamic Religion, Inflationary money, and Media are all high level magickal spells designed to give power to those practicing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who challenge the elite control of these methods (Crowley, Jung, Reich, Bacon, Napoleon) are usually cast as villians to the common man and suffer having their reputations destroyed or are actually killed.

       Perhaps i was being too general. Not all teachers unions are bad. However, the ones in Detroit have a long history of far below average test scores. Yet the teachers responsible for this aren't being replaced by better teachers or charter schools. I'm sure your schools system was better and each teacher was given evaluations.

       I am also intrigued by the Lindbergh kidnapping which has never been adequately explained.  Was this attack on his family an attempt to side-line Lindbergh as a potential Presidential candidate? Henry Ford was ready to back him.  Lindbergh's father was a politician and adamantly opposed to the Federal Reserve and his warnings about manipulation of the economy by a small cabal seem very possible during the Depression of the 30's.

       Ok, this isn't going to be so eloquently spoken(or typed) as the other posts, but one night I went down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories, and got stuck on the one that suggested Aleister Crowley became Adolf Hitler.

       Doppelgänger conspiracies interest me, similarly there is one about Jim Jones being Bill Hicks. I don't see it as bullshit, due to the fact that a lot of the time conspiracies start out pretty questionable. At what point do we accept things as being realistic? When someone comes out and admits truths, ha! If you would have asked me if there were ever mind control experiments done on humans, I'd have called bullshit on that one myself. It's quite realistic to think that one person could take on the look of another human being and create a false death/birth certificate, to serve whatever their purpose or agenda is. That's even more realistic than say, I don't know..a secret underground group of totalitarians controlling everything behind the scenes, yet few have any problems believing that one. It is a theory, albeit an abstract one at best, but I could dig some stuff up if you want to call bullshit on me again.

       It would literally be a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde scenario. Two completely different lives nowhere near each other or intertwining, of amazingly different ages, appearances, etc.

       If Bill Hicks were alive today, he'd be 51. Alex Jones is what, 39? Hicks died in 1994. Let's take a look at pictures of Bill Hicks:

       14-year age difference, for one. That should nix any idea that they're the same person. Born, raised and spent their lives in different countries doing completely different things. And they look

       I have a hard time believing that he's 39, and there is more to it than supposed birth dates. Besides, why shouldn't they be fun? When I'm researching a topic, I'll get caught up in the ones that I find fascinating. There is nothing wrong with an escape from reality sometimes. Having a big imagination about the possibilities is where the truth begins for some of us. Why would I stop doing the things I enjoy? Just because someone is not on you're same path for enlightenment, doesn't mean it's the wrong path.

       What do you guys think about teachers unions? I know that it isn't a conspiracy necassarily but they are pretty evil when you look into them. Horrible teachers get tenure and continue giving bad education to children. They don't want better teachers to take their jobs but is the cost of an uneducated America worth it? For those teachers it is.

       Same can be said for any union, London Underground has pointless station staff who have been replaced by machines but still get jobs. It also has an entirely automated line which is manually ran 6 days a week and manned but auto on Sundays just to keep peoples £50-60k a year jobs

       Unions are tools, a face for a specific demographic. Just as political parties, or any organization, they are only as good as the people who make them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unions are not evil, they just monopolize the work force. People think they suck because people on top don't want to take a pay cut to keep the same service going, thus they take it out on the consumers.

       Yes. 24 years in the classroom, divided roughly evenly between jobs with no union or tenure and those with a union and tenure. I actually started the teacher's union at one of my jobs. "Evil?" Again: I don't think you know what you're talking about. Unions help teachers, and bad teachers can be fired despite having tenure; it's just that principals don't generally want to go through the process. This process is long and thoroughgoing specifically to protect good teachers who happen to get on the wrong person's radar.

       Why would "Hollywood" make a movie about a well-known historical event from 1912 that no one questioned the details of? Were there rumblings of public outcry over 80 years later? Did "Hollywood" think the best was to appease these potential truth-seekers was with a James Cameron epic love story? What a crock.

       He said "Hollywood mobile" and is clearly talking about swaying US public opinion. I don't think a German propaganda film would achieve that in any way.

       Really? You feel stupid so you lash out at me? Since it was in quotes and I said that OP said it, you could've scrolled to the top of the thread and seen the phrase "Hollywood movie," which is just a few letters away from my typo. I am on an iPhone and mistakes happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, I don't get how you narrowed in on my misspelling but were completely unable to grasp what OP was saying in his original statement.

       This has been fun, though. Want to copy and paste information about any more irrelevant Nazi propaganda films to redeem yourself?

      <p>
       Edit: Well that's a stupid point. Irrelevant, some would say.

       It was a SIGINTEL ship listening to Egypt's communications since they were in a war with our "ally."
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel then attempted to destroy the ship, kill the survivors, and machine-gun the life-rafts so they could blame it on Egypt and get the US to fight
       <em>
        yet another war
       </em>
       for Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Help was on the way-McNamara himself turned it back. Not only that--the cover-up lasted for many, many years. In fact, the first two Israeli pilots REFUSED to fire on an American ship...they were jailed for 18 years IIRC.

       I wanted to respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know... it is a sensible topic. I am not 100% sure and you can't be 100% sure either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore I am going to tell you the reasons, which convince me most. And I am going to produce a list, so that you have it easy to read:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Most of all I am convinced by the physicians, who lost their licence to practice their job for speaking up. The youtube-link from my previous post contains a physician, who speaks about vaccination. He explains a lot, but most interesting thing is his personal story. Because he gave up his doctor's office, after in two separated instances people had died, after he vaccinated them. He gave up the office to do research on vaccines. When he started to speak out, he was warned not to talk bad about vaccines. But because he was convinced, that vaccines harm the body, he continued and lost his licence. But he continues to speak out.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Vaccination is nothing else than an infection with diseases in small doses. You can't argue, that it doesn't harm the body, because even the 'modern medicine' will not vaccinate you, if your body is currently weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could too go on an on, what reasons exist not to vaccinate, but I believe that the produced wall of text will be a waste of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are just indoctrinated about vaccines and never give any counterargument a chance. That is the exact opposite of an open mind.
