       What best interests would that be? I hear that alot but never explained. Just sounds good right. Makes the person feel that every decision they've made in life is now in question. Because we are hurting ourselves.  Right?

       Judging by the downvotes in this thread i'd say the number of disinfo people has spiked here the past week.

       Makes sense considering this sub has been on top of spammers/power users/possible bot accounts pretty heavy recently. If nothing else this is just confirmation.

       Working in teams most likely running about 100 different acounts. Ive posted this before but it seems likely to me these areas and there connections are being targetted.
      </p>
      <p>
       occult, money trails, names of the elite, 9/11, london and madrid bombings, chemtrails(look up agenda 21), MSM, israel, holocaust,positive properganda of smart phones and devices (thats the main thing tv networks in the uk are pushing at the moment-info for the americans here.), corporatism, feminism (women have much more of an allegience to the state as it provides them protection from rape ect.), politicians, holleywood, war, and proberly science- specifically mind control, phyciqs, alternate energy will all be areas targetted to name a few. Revolution, guns and shills will also be high on the agenda.

       You need to be incredibly careful with how you operate that subreddit. It is incredibly hard to accurately point out who a shill is. Maybe take a few notes from some similar subs like
       <a href="/r/NolibsWatch">
        /r/NolibsWatch
       </a>
       . And make it very will known that you aren't encouraging downvote brigades or anything like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And remember that it would be quite easy to start an online witch hunt against people who don't deserve it. Not saying your sub is a bad idea, but a hard one to do correctly.

       An ad hom only involves the use of an insult to invalidate a debater's point - like when someone calls someone else a shill. I'm simply calling you all idiots. It's not a ad hom, it's a straight insult.

       If that person is a shill or engaging in activities being upvoted by a shill then that is fact not ad hominium. You could be being upvoted by a shill parade right now and you wouldn't have a clue. Algorithms on analysing meta data (reddit comments) will 
be very sophisticated now, and the idea that reddit is being infiltrated will be systematically destroyed. why use the word 'you' idiots  when your talking to electricblues42. Who are you talking about exackly? Give some examples and we can look through the evidence on this thread. I am neutral  when looking at evidence, there could well be a load of nutters calling people shills on conspiracy. Please provide some evidence to back up your view point. Start by looking for the comments downvoted on r/conspiracy in the past week/month.

       Please moon-rocks, SnowdenNektieParty hasn't explained anything. 
yes i no what ad-hominium is. Notice how SnowdenNecktieParty has expressed his opinion how when someone calls someone a shill they are using ad hom. This gives blanket immunity to shills as they can't be called out.

       explicitly states that you should not downvote. OP's first attempt, and his own comments made it perfectly clear that he was encouraging it, even with his new sub, he can't keep from tacitly encouraging it.

       Yea and I bet how every comment in here that didn't originate from conspiritard is downvoted to a negative score is just a coincidence. And you're right the op did have the idea of downvote brigades, and that's always the wrong way to go about things (even if it wasn't against the reddit TOS).

       Pointing out people who use sockpuppet accounts to game the system and divert the discussion on reddit towards the direction they want is not quite in the spirit of reddit either. Pointing out and replying to that is what the OP should have tried, and appears to have tried with his second sub. Though I can't say I'd want a person who thought downvote brigades were a good idea to lead a sub like that as it probably would lead to a witch hunt. But its not entirely unlike the idea consiritard is about, pointing out people who you disagree with and arguing with them. The difference is that "shills" have the effect of moving that entire conversation of the site in popular subs and can easily have a detrimental effect on the site as a whole. Whereas consiritard simply points out the low hanging fruit of stupid conspiracy theories that only idiots believe, and makes their readers feel more intelligent for being able to see that. One has a quite useful goal, while the other only makes the readers of the sub feel better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean honestly, do you guys think you are going to change the mind of a person willing to believe in silliness like chem trails or a fake moon landing? Your opposition and coordinated group effort to silence them only strengthens their believe that "the man" doesn't want them to talk about whatever silly topic they want. The entire point of conspiritard is to reinforce the idea that their readers are more intelligent than people who believe in conspiracies, cause if the purpose is to fight against conspiracy theories then you guys are failing miserably (look at how high the number of subs to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is now compared to a year ago). Is it really something worth celebrating that you are more intelligent than a person who can believe in something so crazy? And by having that mentality you freeze out any other information that comes from a source that has been tainted by the word "conspiracy", even if the information is good and useful.

       There are a range of thinkers on conspiracy and shills are out on mass. Alot of normal people will be called shills. Our methods need to improve to isolate the real ones. Start with breaking up conversation, ad hominum, flamewaring. Nitpicking certain points while ignoring most of the evidence being laid down. These are all areas of suspicion.

       Yes, ignoring people who are derailing discussion would be a great tactic at increasing information flow.
This only works if everyone is doing it though.
I think we should continue calling them out.
Sooner or later the body of conspiracy will realize their information flow is being manipulated.

       Gonna look into it tonight, think think we need some sort of proof that they're shills. Don't want it to be a Spanish Inquisition. Might start with those 2 accounts that sent exactly the same reply to that dude. Can anyone throw me a link to that posting?

       What kind of "proof".  Most people here point to the fact that I disagree with them and make them look stupid as "100% proof" that I am a shill for either the FBI, Mossad or the CIA.

       Yes the 'out of interest...' comment is wrong 
The point is that if shills are overrunning r/conspiracy
it will derail discussion therefore we won't be able to talk about conspiracies (perhaps their are battles to fought first before we can get really good information flows.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree with the admins don't give a shit comment.
As major subreddits are being censored/targeted (care to disagree?) mass migrations will be coming towards conspiracy therefore id say its a big red target for law enforcement agencies especially as its a subreddit that caters towards sensitive issues for government (war/ 9/11, chemtrails, MSM properganda.)
Why do you think the admins wouldn't care about r/conspiracy?

       The admins don't care about conspiracy because we have a huge overlap with libertarians.  If you haven't noticed that reddit has a heavy liberal bias, it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       We aren't an easily moved crowd.   You can't stick a kony 2012 video in front of us and expect donations to roll in. $$.
      </p>
      <p>
       We aren't a major subreddit.  200,000 users is one fifth of one million.  Major subreddits have multiple millions of users.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything that is posted and/or discussed frequently in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       can be discredited simply by pointing out that it is discussed frequently in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  Mostly because of the vocal minority here who like to engage in witch hunts or even some of the fringe supremacist's recruiting that goes on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: the people who feel like they can win some battle on reddit versus the "shills" are actually making it easier for TPTB to marginalize everything we talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the actual shills come in here and get you all bent out of shape when something important is being discussed so that you will pollute your own comments sections with 1000s of insults against the "shills".  Then nobody can discuss anything because it has all been buried under your flame war versus the "shills".

       200,000 users but not readers. I for one don't trust Google analytics for the actual traffic analysis of r/conspiracy.
Funny you say Reddit has a heavy liberal bias because that isn't the trend I've been noticing recently. Pro authoritarian comments/ pro government comments are constantly up-voted to the top of major subreddits or there certainly not being outweighed in terms of up-votes. Your spot on the money about the major subreddits being easily moved. 
 The NSA probably has a good idea of what works in terms of manipulating swarms on the internet.
They've got 10 years of analysis of data at least of how people react to information in the short and long term.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe your right about me making it easier to marginalize everything conspiracy is talking about, i will reconsider.

I think it's stretching credibility to call conde nast's reddit an open discussion platform. Liberal bias my ass, leaning left off fox news yes. The biggest blog/comment platform on the planet bar mainstream media hasn't got federal attention yet? You didn't answer my question about mass cencoring on major subreddits, a yes or no would have done.

       thanks for the links, dont know why your being downvoted for providing evidence to look at even if it is faulty infomation.
I can't imagine many of your downvoters even glanced at what you've shown.

       always go to the head of the snake, that would be central banking and the fed/ecb primarily....say something that is truthful, which is always bad, about what these gangs do, and then stand back and watch who defends them, Anyone who stands up for central banking is a shill....anyone who promotes or takes sides with the official version of 911 is a shill....anyone who tries to get you to focus on politics or politicians is a shill, anyone who leads you away from the truth about money printed as debt, and that , that is what it is all about, is a shill....Its just about money, and or more importantly, maintain the "right" to print it and then attach interest. Which is TAX
      </p>
      <p>
       and also your shill group violates the witch hunt rule...

       The list of shills was just copy pasted from the list of mods in
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard

       .

       Nothing of value was lost.

       Mass censorship?  I think there are a lot of shitty mods with shitty agendas.  But I don't think reddit inc has anything to do with it.
