    <div class="md"><p>yes, there was that, but did we ever find out what that big story he was onto was? not to minimize that situation, but even if there was a connection there, that&#39;s one journalist out of all who have had their names on NSA leak articles. That&#39;s hardly statistically significant, and if it was meant to be a warning, it hasnt seemed to have any effect on those already publishing these sorts of articles in major newspapers/websites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>look, we could keep this going forever like some morbid Abbot and Costello bit, but some of us have work in the morning. the fact is, even if these kinds of threats were made, they would ultimately be toothless because this whole situation is a powder keg waiting to go off, and I don&#39;t think anyone who&#39;s responsibility it is to make sure society doesn&#39;t erupt into violent chaos wants to be the one to let that spark fly by doing something so brazen as starting to asassinate public figures. the last thing they want is a martyr.

    <div class="md"><p>That is the underlying thread of modern politics, what pretty much all western governments are suddenly considering normal. The scarier aspect (to me) is that since they&#39;re all doing it together, is there an actual reason? I mean, some of it is probably just those in power trying to conserve and increase their power, but since there is so much cross-border cooperation, it makes me wonder if there isn&#39;t an actual threat that is so bad they feel they cannot tell us what it is?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t wish to grant them excuses or try to pretend they&#39;re any more honorable than they are, it&#39;s basically a what if scenario.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so sure about this. Do we know that the tech companies are not willing participants? Zuckerberg said &quot;I knew about surveillance, but I didn&#39;t want to go to jail.&quot; Instead, he profited from his willing complicity. He could have said something publicly about the NSA and even if the government had taken legal action it would have been huge and the public would almost certainly have supported him. Additionally, facebook received a lot of its funding from in-q-tel, a cia front: <a href="http://www.consciousape.com/2012/05/03/google-bankrolled-by-the-cia/">http://www.consciousape.com/2012/05/03/google-bankrolled-by-the-cia/</a></p>

<p>Daniel Pearl may have been a mossad agent, which his killers claimed as soon as they kidnapped him. Arab media reported these claims, western media ignored them. His captors made demands regarding the release of prisoners being held illegally in Guantanamo bay, the demands were ignored for a week by the pentagon and then he was killed: <a href="http://rense.com/general20/iscit.htm">http://rense.com/general20/iscit.htm</a></p>

<p>Michael Hastings rose to prominence with the book &quot;I lost my love in baghdad,&quot; which was about his fiance Andi Parhamovich who was killed in Iraq in 2006. She was also called a mossad agent by her killers, but western media ignored this claim and it was ignored in Michael&#39;s book about her. His book also did not mention that the organization she was working for, the ndi, has cia ties: <a href="http://www.classwarfareexists.com/how-the-cia-operates-through-non-governmental-agencies/">http://www.classwarfareexists.com/how-the-cia-operates-through-non-governmental-agencies/</a></p>

<p>I have written about the possibility that Michael Hastings was an agent for this and some other reasons, <a href="http://spiritandreason.blogspot.com/2013/09/michael-hastings-double-agent.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Glenn Greenwald and every other reporter carrying snowden&#39;s revelations or discussing the nsa/prism are &quot;going against&quot; secret courts with secret laws... maybe. If the NSA were actually blackmailing any of them, I would expect at least one person to be courageous enough to make this fact public. I think it&#39;s more likely that a lot of journalists are being paid off by the CIA, and they have no desire to speak out because as long as they continue to do what they are told their job opportunities will only expand.</p>

<p>This is why I&#39;m a bit skeptical of this snowden release as well. It comes on the heels of &quot;the nsa has been targeting google&quot; (that link i included above about facebook mentions that the cia has financed google in the past too) and &quot;dna evidence proves bin laden died in 2011&quot; (but i&#39;m not going to show it to you). Both of these stories could be cia propaganda.</p>

<p>Is this really the best thing he can release on 9/11? It&#39;s enough to regain credibility with some people, but the media quickly ignoring it now (remember it was released via the msm initially) may just indicate that they do not want to draw any more attention than they have to to possible limited hangouts. I think the nsa-israel story is a half-truth at best because it doesn&#39;t mention mossad by name and doesn&#39;t mention whether there are data transfers going the other way.</p>

<p>More likely the media has interests in cooperating with the government for example they want interviews and seats at press conferences which could be denied to them if they annoy the government too much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard it put rather well that most of the reporters who were likely to do there jobs had already been dealt with (I believe Hastings was assassinated) and out of business so all that are remaining are the lackeys who are spouting public relations rather than reporting.</p>

<p>There seem to be many fearless people on Twitter but I see the government is attempting to classify who is really a journalist so they can harness the bloggers as well! Old school reporters seem to have no interest in doing anything challenging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re misunderstanding the ramifications of the spoiler effect :( The problem isn&#39;t that the third party causes the wrong Blue/Red to win.</p>

<p>The problem is that, because the third party will cause that... third parties can&#39;t win. You can&#39;t vote for a third party without fear of simply voting <em>against</em> the Blue/Red you wanted. It is WRONG for the SAME two parties to control our country indefinitely. If these two parties are SO perfect, they will still win in an Alternative voting election. Did you ever wonder what that 4-8% Perot or Paul got would look like if people could choose their candidate without knowing they were throwing away their vote?</p>

<p>What if I told you that the Blue/Red were being piloted by the same financial interests for decades, and that you weren&#39;t changing anything by electing one or the other? You&#39;re voting for two hands of the same cyborg.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t feel guilty about your mindset of &quot;everything has problems, nothing is perfect, oh well&quot;? That&#39;s a useless contribution. You are guilty of bringing upon yourself whatever transpires. Real men don&#39;t speak of the way the world is, they speak of the way the world <em>should</em> be.</p>

<p>Give me ONE good reason for FPtP. If you have no reason, then you should support the change to a better system, one that lets the people make their <em>actual</em> choices.</p>

<p>I think runoffs are a better system than FPtP, and support the idea that parties should choose their candidates by an internal process rather than a publicly financed process, and the primary should be to choose who goes to the runoff.</p>

<p>However, you need to recognize that parties change over time even if their names don&#39;t (compare Lincoln to Reagan, for example), and even if the two parties look exactly the same to you, that&#39;s just because you&#39;re standing so far off in the weeds that your politics are irrelevant and your candidate wouldn&#39;t get elected by anything except a coin toss.</p>

<p>There were never any police incidents at Ron Paul rallies. Probably because Ron Paul supporters were actually politically active, rather than OWS were they actually needed police because of all the shithead undergrads running around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but unlike the Obama rallies, the RP rallies spoke out directly against agencies like the NSA, supporters of big government like the current and past administration, the disenfranchisement of the American people, and our blind loyalty and suspicious generosity to Israel.</p>

<p>But I do think you&#39;re right. Political candidate rallies and mass protests are vastly different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ron Paul speaks against government spending of any sort. If he had his way, there would be no infrastructure, no environmental or financial regulation, etc.</p>

<p>It makes it pretty meaningless when he speaks against something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I beg to differ. He speaks against &quot;big&quot; government. A government that doesn&#39;t spend on infrastructure, environment, or financial regulation is no government at all. But &quot;big&quot; government that uses regulations to prop up &quot;TBTF&quot; banks, Monsanto, and Big Pharma, and all of the usual suspects. One that uses spends on highly protested foreign wars, spends on highly protested agencies and programs, and spends, even on things that people do want, in very inefficient ways (federal vs state, for example).</p>

<p>His message isn&#39;t about taking apart the entire government. It&#39;s about taking apart the abusive, the inflated, and unwanted parts. There would still be roads and parks.</p>

The Sulzbergers own The New York Times Company, Bob Iger owns the Walt Disney Corporation. Then you have the Newhouses who own Conde Nast which owns Reddit, The New Yorker and Vanity Fair just to name a few. Look I&#39;m on my phone so I&#39;m not digging up the links and those are just the Zionists who own media corporations that I can think of just off the top of my head, good luck getting any of them to report it. Alex Jones is even terrified to mention Israel, he blames all of the turmoil in the Syria squarely on powerful Shiite Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Quatar, and Turkey, it&#39;s pathetic. Oh yea and there&#39;s Sirius XM which is also an entirely Jewish operation founded by someone named Rothblatt and the current President &amp; CCO is Scott Greenstein, it goes so deep its blatantly obvious that Americas mass media is owned by Zionist Jewish people, even Reddit. </p>

<p>Your question about Israel has nothing to do with Zionism, but anyway, almost all its wars have been defensive rather than offensive, so it would be impossible to call them peaceful no matter what.</p>

<p>Even the earliest Zionists weren&#39;t wedded to the idea of a Jewish state being in Israel. Personally, I am an atheist and I don&#39;t really care about biblical arguments. I do feel that the Jewish people as a persecuted (ethnic/racial/religious/take your pick) group have very good historical reasons to want to self-govern.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll elaborate.</p>

<p>Historically, Jews lived in what&#39;s now known as Israel. With that said, early Zionists weren&#39;t especially wedded to the idea of Israel being the Jewish homeland, but it certainly wasn&#39;t a matter of blindly sticking a pin in a world map.</p>

<p>You can, technically, be a Zionist believing that the Jewish people are entitled to self-govern, not necessarily in Israel. It just so happens that the modern conception of Zionism is tied to Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it wasn&#39;t the point of your comment, but the idea of &quot;oh well, back to football&quot; really resonated with me.  It&#39;s frequently very difficult to engage people, even my peers,  in discussions about privacy, politics, or other issues that seem so important to me, but these same people can devote countless hours and become deeply emotionally invested in such tribalist entertainment. I&#39;m not knocking sports in general, I just wish that the ubiquitous devotion to football, which seems to be over taking American culture, could be harnessed to make a meaningful change</p>

<p>it could&#39;ve been back to american idol, back to tv, back to breaking bad, etc.</p>

<p>back to (something that isnt important)</p>

<p>its very discouraging, enraging, and sad that so many people including your and my peers just dont care.</p>

<p>theres always been the opiate of the people, the distraction. i guess it used to be gladiators in the coliseum, the closest to that we have is the UFC</p>

<p>just imagine a new york giant football game, thousands of humans there cheering/yelling/clapping for these humans to ram eachother running after a football while the nation is at war, rampant poverty/hunger worldwide etc.</p>

<p>You have to realize that most of our very Jewish news media chose not to cover this story AT ALL.  Google News not surprisingly didn&#39;t carry it.  The New York Times not surprisingly didn&#39;t carry it either.  So there are a lot of people out there still unaware.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s going to change.  The suggestion that it was a very Jewish news media in the past was almost always met with scorn.  Now, with this, it&#39;s about to go mainstream.  Try bringing this up in conversation next time you&#39;re out with friends.  They express disbelief?  Now you can show them.  The New York Times maintains a page dedicated exclusively to the NSA scandal.  Show them The Guardian story and then ask them, why doesn&#39;t this make that page?</p>

<p>This one is going to take awhile for people to get.  But baby, once they do...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except they are not spreading any truth, just their dumbass ignorant opinions. People do not understand what is going on, they just don&#39;t want to be the &#39;world police&#39; anymore. People have not gotten smarter, or more clued in, overnight in the US. Most people would still say that Assad used chemical weapons and Obama wanted to invade for that reason, and it was the public that said no. People do not realise the evidence points to the US backed rebels as the one&#39;s who used the chemical weapons.</p>

<p>People still do not understand that this incident was not a freakish one off but has been something that has been planned for a while. Nor do they even know the exact same thing happened in April with the exact same outcome... US threatening to invade, Russia proving it was the rebels who used the chemical weapons. They do not understand this is about Iran because knowing this makes it harder for them to believe they are still the good guys.</p>

<p>Do not mistake a favorable outcome for a public that understands what is going on. The US public is outraged when it is told to be, this is the very same reason there was no rage about the topic in the heading.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big-picture motive might be<br/>
about a red calf and the end-times.  Seriously.</p>

<p>edit:  deleted the link, it&#39;s not what I was looking for.  be back later with a better link.</p>

<p>edit #2:  I found it:  <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/125/transcript">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/125/transcript</a></p>

<p>audio here:<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/125/apocalypse">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/125/apocalypse</a>   (better to listen with this particular show)</p>

<p>&quot;Act One, Cowboys of the Apocalypse. Clyde Lott was a man with two main interests, cows-- he was a cattle breeder by profession-- and the Bible. He&#39;s also an evangelical minister. And one day, he was doing something that combined his two interests. Lawrence Wright wrote about him in The New Yorker magazine.
Lawrence Wright</p>

<p>He was going through the Bible and looking for all the references about cows. The early books of the Bible are essentially about an agricultural people, so there are a lot of references about cattle. And when he came upon Numbers 19, he found this reference. When God was speaking to Moses, God commanded that Moses tell his people to bring him a red heifer without spot or blemish, and it would be sacrificed to him.</p>

<p>And Clyde began to wonder where they might have gotten such a cow, because all of the cattle that he could find referenced in the Old Testament were spotted or striped. But what he also knew is that there&#39;s a breed of cattle call the Red Angus that&#39;s as red as an Irish Setter. And it seems to be unknown in the Middle East. So it struck him that he might be the very man who could bring the red heifer back to the land of Israel.
Ira Glass</p>

<p>Now, there&#39;s an important reason Clyde Lott might want to do that, and that reason involves biblical prophecy. In Clyde Lott&#39;s reading of the Bible-- and many people see it this way-- the second coming of Jesus, Armageddon, the Rapture, the thousand-year reign of Jesus on Earth, all this will occur only after three things happen. Number one, the establishment of the state of Israel. Number two, Jerusalem has to be in Jewish hands. And number three, the ancient Jewish temple in Jerusalem, a temple that was destroyed in 79 AD, that temple has to be rebuilt and reestablished as the center of Jewish worship.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the point. Nobody knows where this might lead. The potential of abuse VS benefits (i.e. security or whatever) is extremely lopsided at this point. </p>

<p>Wether the information gathering surmounts in the perfection of market research resulting in the perfect capitalism with perfectly targeted advertisement (arguably, the least dreadful outcome), or as some imagine the terrifying prospect of quietly controlling the masses like a herd of cattle, knowing exactly which are sick, or unwilling to produce any more milk for the farmers. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s what&#39;s frightening. We are at the point of ascending from a Type0 civilization to a Type1, and failing to realise the potential for self harm as a society will lead to our demise. Such is nature. And we have to put our bets on what we believe is the right path to be taken as a society. Should we try to control the populace, like worker bees and their queen? Or are people inherently uncontrollable, thriving through coexistence? I know which path I wanna take, but the ones with all the cash, the ones who would loose what they claim they own beg the differ.</p>

<p>A good friend of mine&#39;s college loans to pay for his overpriced schooling have driven him into the ground and he can&#39;t even declare bankruptcy. </p>

<p>People are willingly providing tons of private data to Facebook even with it widely known they collect and sell data. </p>

<p>We&#39;re teetering on the edge of getting militarily involved in another Middle Eastern civil war with no real plan and no goal on vague, secret evidence. </p>

<p>Since the near-collapse in 2008, the financial institutions largely responsible have become more powerful and more consolidated, and they know they&#39;ll be bailed out again when their gambling causes another crash. </p>

<p>No one knows how the hell Michael Hastings&#39; car crashed (despite slanderous bullshit about amphetamines in his system), and he said he was about to uncover something huge. </p>

<p>Colorado is a fucking swimming pool and Sydney is burning (and that&#39;s just this week) while assholes paid by conservative think tanks are still filling the airwaves with facetious climate skepticism. </p>

<p>Private prisons are lobbying to keep marijuana illegal and are making a killing off the incarceration of the innocent. </p>

<p>This shit goes on and on and on, and the more you learn about, the heavier the weight is. Israel getting our metadata is just more terrible weight. I don&#39;t know about you, but I can only fight for so much at one time. The best thing I can think of is to tackle just a few issues, like campaign finance reform, which could help to solve or at least positively impact a whole host of problems. If we get money out of politics (a message which is simple enough for people to generally get behind) we make the kind of lobbying that Israel does a thing of the past. It doesn&#39;t solve all our problems, but trying to solve every problem means we&#39;re going to solve nothing. </p>

<p>If you come across someone who is outraged that a copy of literally anything they&#39;ve ever done online, along with phone records and chat &amp; text transcripts is being provided to Israel (or any other country for that matter), then no, you would be in the wrong to cry antisemitism.</p>

<p>As I type this, I&#39;m starting to worry that soon we won&#39;t even be discussing whether or not this data collection should even be happening, rather we&#39;ll be discussing who it should be given to and who it shouldn&#39;t.  /Shudder</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zionism pertains to the right of Jews to have their own state. If you&#39;re anti-Zionist, that means you don&#39;t believe Jews have a right to self-government, in Israel or anywhere. So, what&#39;s the alternative? If you don&#39;t care, or if you naively believe that Jewish people would not be persecuted as they were for millennia prior to the establishment of the state of Israel, you&#39;re effectively endorsing that inherently anti-Semitic persecution. So, you&#39;re right, they&#39;re not equal, but that&#39;s how anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism are connected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what you mean when you use the term &quot;assimilation&quot;, but they haven&#39;t had a hard time integrating into different societies. Jews lived peacefully all over the world, notably in Europe and the Middle East, for centuries. Often, they have been treated as second-class citizens, but thrived anyway. Unfortunately every once in a while, some individual or group or another decides to scapegoat them.</p>

<p>Even in Nazi Germany, there were loads of intellectual Jews who resented their orthodox counterparts who refused to assimilate. Many supported Nazi ideology, and were surprised when they were fired from their jobs, many even sent to concentration camps, for being 1/4 or less Jewish.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousand of Jews lived all over the Middle East, in both Arab and non-Arab Muslim countries, right up until the 1970s. </p>

<p>I&#39;m reading Lawrence In Arabia ATM (highly recommended) and am finding it really informative and enlightening in light of everything happening with Syria. </p>

<p>The Levant is a part of the world that myself and way too many other Americans have failed to try to understand. At all. So I want to try to change that.</p>

<p>Please forgive such a coarse question, but how have the Zionists then expected to return to the area after millennia as a diaspora and say, &quot;Hey, this is our land!&quot;? IMO, it just seems an untenable long term assertion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, it was actually a secular (not religious) movement that started during the tail end of the 1800s in response to European anti-Semitism. In the early 1900s, Jewish organizations started to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_land_purchase_in_Palestine">buy up land</a>, so immigration actually started well before the Holocaust, but boomed right around and after it, and again in waves as Jews faced persecution in Russia and in Middle Eastern countries.</p>

<p>The important thing to note here is that Israel was very sparsely populated even into the middle of the 19th century, when there were only an estimated quarter of a million people living there. It was Jewish immigration, which provided with it advances in agriculture, cultivation of previously non-arable land, and employment, that made the land (not counting religious sites) desirable to non-Jews in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Briefly, there was hardly anyone living in what&#39;s now Israel as recently as 1850 when there were only around 250,000 people living in the entire country. Jew started buying up land even before the British mandate, cultivating non-arable land and paying tens of times more than it was worth.</p>

<p>If not for Jews developing the land, how desirable would it be today, really? Is that even important to you, or just a technicality? Ever stop to wonder why there&#39;s so much fuss over tiny little Israel that occupies the smallest fraction of a percent of the entire Middle East?</p>

<p>More to the point, if you disagree that modern-day Israel should be a Jewish self-governed homeland, then what do you propose? If you think that it should be under Arab-Muslim rule, how do you think that will pan out for the Jewish population? If you think they should leave, where should they go? Which country has the obligation to absorb them?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re anti-Zionist, if you don&#39;t believe Jews have a right to self-government and freedom from persecution, and you don&#39;t know or care about an alternative, what does that make you if not anti-Semitic?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that Jews have a right to freedom from persecution just like any other religious or ethnic group. Please don&#39;t mistake that. Self-governance is another issue. There are myriad groups struggling for that. However...</p>

<p>It is a technicality. The idea that &quot;we can have it since nobody was using it&quot; or &quot;it wasn&#39;t worth anything anyways&quot; just doesn&#39;t seem legitimate, sorry. If that&#39;s the reasoning then that puts the historical establishment of the state in question for myself and many others, I suspect.</p>

<p>What do I propose? I think that Jews, like any other religious and/or ethnic group today, should have and can create a home and space within whatever political and cultural environment they find themselves in.</p>

<p>If Israel/the Levant were controlled by Arab-Muslims? I suspect that it it would pan out for the Jews much as it has for Palestinians: poorly.</p>

<p>Why not create a secular state that encompasses the region and allows for religious freedom- Muslim,Christian or Jewish, much as the Ottoman Empire did?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even bother looking at the comments on this matter on the big subreddits (plenty of Americans getting angry that Israel is being made an innocent victim yet again, and accusations of anti-semitism everywhere), let alone trying to judge what other people say. I think they&#39;ve even banned Israel news on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> now. Because too many people got upset at the &quot;negative Israel stories&quot;. Yet somehow it&#39;s still perfectly fine for there to be hundreds of posts slandering India, or China, or Muslims or black people. But no, Israel posts needs to be removed.</p>

<p>This is just something I really don&#39;t even want to deal with anymore. There&#39;s knowing people won&#39;t give a shit, then there&#39;s stuff like Israel where Westerners or Americans in particular will start to lose their shit if you start going against Israel, start censoring and getting extremely defensive. I mean shit, there was some joke thread about Yom Kippur and people were getting downvoted and insulted just for not knowing that Jews fast on Yom Kippur. What the fuck is going on?</p>

<p>Personally I think the whole Jewish Internet Force thing is BS. They don&#39;t need to do that when there&#39;s already so many people who will defend them no matter what on the internet anyway.</p>

<p>your theory that someone told him to pull it has credence though; it was put up late at night and then removed the following evening or so.  I don&#39;t know if Drudge operates his own site or has an intern or what.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, here&#39;s your choices....1. stop using their money, at the same time, use something else.....2. a large collective of citizens encourage and or ask the military to coup against the central banker controlled government because it is controlled by the central bank....3. regionally form a colony of like minded people, basically enough of &quot;you&quot; need to all move to the same region and break away and form your own region and declare independence...</p>

<p>of these, collectively boycotting the &quot;thems&quot; currency would be the most effective and if done properly would have the potential to be the least violent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>everything is about faith and what is real and what is not....there is a saying that goes something like this; if you are among a group of people and they all believe something that is not true to be true, and you do not and know what the truth is, the truth is still the truth, even if the majority thinks elsewise.....and that is where it usually stops....what it should go on to further say is; that even if you know what the truth is, if you are surrounded by a bunch of idiots who think lies are the truth, it does not mater that you know what the truth is...because you are the minority in a mob rules situation, your&quot;truth&quot; will always be &quot;not the truth&quot;...at this stage in the game there are millions of people who know the &quot;truth&quot; the problem lies in the geographical isolation and or the truth knowers are sprinkled about with the lie believers.</p>

<p>The internet gives &quot;you&quot; the ability to seek like minded individuals, crossing regional boundaries.</p>

<p>It is a sad day that you, the people can not see that your freedom lies in unification...You all must unify with a common understanding of what the problem is{ money as debt} and how to stop it {stop using their money}...</p>

<p>It is as simple as spreading around a slang word....if you do not reclaim control of the currency supplies, and in essence kill the dollar and have a rebirth of a new currency that is decentralized, controlled by the people, with the peoples best interest in mind....THEY WILL DO IT FOR YOU, and you won&#39;t like their way</p>

<p>That being said the people who are exposing the government are actually doing a great deal. Wether they do it on the Internet or out in real life makes no difference. They share the things that they do for the people that care. The people that recognize that there is something wrong but don&#39;t give a damn aren&#39;t just doing nothing, they allow more power to those doing wrong. The fact that you don&#39;t care that the government is doing something extremely wrong is very troublesome. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are certain things you can&#39;t just find out on your own. Reddit is not my primary news source, but I find out about a ton more things here than I do other places. I go here to see the things that other news sources won&#39;t report about. Also, the difference between finding stuff here than finding stuff on say CNN is that there are usually multiple sources. This sub is made of skeptics. Hell that&#39;s the main reason most of them are here. They aren&#39;t here to find something to complain about, they are here to find out about the truth. So, if something is not correct, there will always be someone calling bullshit. Take the 9/11 conspiracies for example. There were so many people proving a lot of the stuff posted wrong. Even the people who believe in the theories were disproving them. And if you think that I just read something and believe it, you are dead wrong. I use this sub to find out about things, once I find out about something, I research it. I use many sources and take the truth out of it. But from what I have found, this sub seems to be the most reliable. </p>

<p>Also, just something I should let you know. Repeatedly insulting someone before they are insulting you shows weakness in your argument. It shows that you need the insults to make your argument stronger. So, next time you feel like insulting someone, at least wait until they do it first. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly you didn&#39;t read my comment or the comments on the 9/11 theories. I said that people here were disproving the theories. Even the people who believe in the theories were calling bullshit. I honestly don&#39;t know why you even made that argument. Do you think I believe in the theories? Half of them are so ridiculous it makes me mad. So maybe before you come up with some huge argument, you should listen to the person you are arguing against and learn what you are arguing about. That way you won&#39;t make a fool of yourself. I am actually so confused as to why you made that argument. It seems like you just skimmed through my comment, saw &quot;9/11&quot; and jumped to conclusions without even reading what I said and made that comment. For you to say that everyone was wrong only proves you did not read the comments. Saying everyone here was wrong is saying that the people who said there is no conspiracy are wrong. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yes, some people knew about 9/11, but when a government body is made up of millions of people, coordinating info before the advancement of processing power made it difficult.  Try coordinating with20 people ... Let alone millions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There you go again, jumping to conclusions. Did I ever say that there was a conspiracy for 9/11? Who are you arguing with? You actually created a counter argument without there being an argument! </p>

<p>Clearly you know what you are talking about when you can&#39;t even read a whole paragraph correctly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can one be the &quot;best&quot; conspiracy theorist, I mean what are the requirements. Does one have to be over 40 years unemployed not married and not procreated. Also does one have to scout the internet for 14 hours a day reading about weird stuf reposting this in an own theory? Maybe I am the best Conspiracy theorist the world has ever seen. I hold a golden nugget of secret super classified information. I am going to spill a small bean of the master plan. It is up to the second best conspiracy theorist to find my jar.</p>

<p>So we all talk about the illuminati but what do we actually know. I for one can tell you every women that gives birth to a child is actually an officer in the illuminati procreation wing of the establishment. They are made to breed on a pure and mixed illuminati new arian order. This order is being brainwashed by there mothers. The mothers are created around the Atlantic ocean where the lizard people from Planet X landed and still live . These lizard people are actually close relatives to the bildenbergers who made the shell corporation in contract with the lizard people. Its actually very easy because the lizardpeople live in the ground the have created an easy to mine and easy to create power source named OIL. What I am trying to say is that the lizard people produce oil which is not a fossil fuel in contract with the Bilderbergers to create a dependency around the world. Without us knowing we are actually enslaved by the lizard people. If we look close in the religions there is a little hint at who could be the lizard people. Ask yourself who has all the oil also who covers a part of their civilization in burkas to cover up there lizardpeople like trait from the rest of the humanity?</p>

<p>9/11 so happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I like this subreddit, and I don&#39;t have any particular love for the US government or the government of Israel. </p>

<p>But, I also know how to read between the lines. Some of the people that frequent this subreddit think that there is a <del>Jewish</del> Zionist conspiracy to rule the world and get their panties in a bunch for anything related to <del>Jews</del> Zionists.</p>

<p>The reason you haven&#39;t seen so much &quot;rage&quot; about the issue is because most people don&#39;t believe in a <del>Jewish</del> Zionist conspiracy to rule the world. For that reason, issues related to Jews and the state of Israel get less attention from most people than they do from posters to this subreddit.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve looked at any of the leaked data, it&#39;s been obvious from that start that the NSA has been sharing data with the other four parties in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSCANNZUKUS">Five Eyes</a>. I&#39;m sure that the US government has shared raw data and intelligence from NSA surveillance with many other countries around the world-- not just Israel, and not just US allies. It&#39;s what intelligence agencies do.</p>

<p>So, I guess I&#39;m one of those non-outraged people you&#39;re asking about. </p>

<p>I&#39;m pissed off about the NSA collection because I live in the US, and the US government has access to the data and a long history of oppression. If someone is going to kick in my door, kidnap, and torture me, I think it&#39;s more likely to be the US government than the Canadian, New Zealand, or Israeli government simple because I&#39;m in the US.</p>

<p>If I were living in one of the countries that USA shared intelligence with, I would be kind of pissed at my government for taking it. But, we shouldn&#39;t lose sight of why we&#39;re angry-- that we were spied upon in the first place.</p>

<p>You asked why people aren&#39;t outraged about the sharing of intelligence with Israel. To most people, Israel is just another country. It&#39;s no more disturbing to share intelligence with Israel as it is to share intelligence with Britain or Australia.</p>

<p>If you believe in a <del>Jewish</del> Zionist conspiracy, like a lot of folks on this subreddit, you&#39;re more likely to follow news related to Israel and to outraged by something like this. Most people don&#39;t believe the same thing, so they don&#39;t particularly care.</p>

<p>More likely the media has interests in cooperating with the government for example they want interviews and seats at press conferences which could be denied to them if they annoy the government too much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard it put rather well that most of the reporters who were likely to do there jobs had already been dealt with (I believe Hastings was assassinated) and out of business so all that are remaining are the lackeys who are spouting public relations rather than reporting.</p>

<p>There seem to be many fearless people on Twitter but I see the government is attempting to classify who is really a journalist so they can harness the bloggers as well! Old school reporters seem to have no interest in doing anything challenging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zionism just means that you support the idea of Jews having their own state. If you disagree with that, you&#39;re anti-Zionist. So if your objections to the Israeli government aren&#39;t related to Zionism, then just say you&#39;re opposed to the actions of the Israeli government. There&#39;s no need to bring Zionism into it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those just seem like random questions. The general behavior pattern of Zionists has been supportive of the establishment and continuation of a Jewish state.</p>

<p>Your question about Israel has nothing to do with Zionism, but anyway, almost all its wars have been defensive rather than offensive, so it would be impossible to call them peaceful no matter what.</p>

<p>Even the earliest Zionists weren&#39;t wedded to the idea of a Jewish state being in Israel. Personally, I am an atheist and I don&#39;t really care about biblical arguments. I do feel that the Jewish people as a persecuted (ethnic/racial/religious/take your pick) group have very good historical reasons to want to self-govern.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Briefly, there was hardly anyone living in what&#39;s now Israel as recently as 1850 when there were only around 250,000 people living in the entire country. Jew started buying up land even before the British mandate, cultivating non-arable land and paying tens of times more than it was worth.</p>

<p>If not for Jews developing the land, how desirable would it be today, really? Is that even important to you, or just a technicality? Ever stop to wonder why there&#39;s so much fuss over tiny little Israel that occupies the smallest fraction of a percent of the entire Middle East?</p>

<p>More to the point, if you disagree that modern-day Israel should be a Jewish self-governed homeland, then what do you propose? If you think that it should be under Arab-Muslim rule, how do you think that will pan out for the Jewish population? If you think they should leave, where should they go? Which country has the obligation to absorb them?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re anti-Zionist, if you don&#39;t believe Jews have a right to self-government and freedom from persecution, and you don&#39;t know or care about an alternative, what does that make you if not anti-Semitic?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so sure about this. Do we know that the tech companies are not willing participants? Zuckerberg said &quot;I knew about surveillance, but I didn&#39;t want to go to jail.&quot; Instead, he profited from his willing complicity. He could have said something publicly about the NSA and even if the government had taken legal action it would have been huge and the public would almost certainly have supported him. Additionally, facebook received a lot of its funding from in-q-tel, a cia front: <a href="http://www.consciousape.com/2012/05/03/google-bankrolled-by-the-cia/">http://www.consciousape.com/2012/05/03/google-bankrolled-by-the-cia/</a></p>

<p>Daniel Pearl may have been a mossad agent, which his killers claimed as soon as they kidnapped him. Arab media reported these claims, western media ignored them. His captors made demands regarding the release of prisoners being held illegally in Guantanamo bay, the demands were ignored for a week by the pentagon and then he was killed: <a href="http://rense.com/general20/iscit.htm">http://rense.com/general20/iscit.htm</a></p>

<p>Michael Hastings rose to prominence with the book &quot;I lost my love in baghdad,&quot; which was about his fiance Andi Parhamovich who was killed in Iraq in 2006. She was also called a mossad agent by her killers, but western media ignored this claim and it was ignored in Michael&#39;s book about her. His book also did not mention that the organization she was working for, the ndi, has cia ties: <a href="http://www.classwarfareexists.com/how-the-cia-operates-through-non-governmental-agencies/">http://www.classwarfareexists.com/how-the-cia-operates-through-non-governmental-agencies/</a></p>

<p>I have written about the possibility that Michael Hastings was an agent for this and some other reasons, <a href="http://spiritandreason.blogspot.com/2013/09/michael-hastings-double-agent.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Glenn Greenwald and every other reporter carrying snowden&#39;s revelations or discussing the nsa/prism are &quot;going against&quot; secret courts with secret laws... maybe. If the NSA were actually blackmailing any of them, I would expect at least one person to be courageous enough to make this fact public. I think it&#39;s more likely that a lot of journalists are being paid off by the CIA, and they have no desire to speak out because as long as they continue to do what they are told their job opportunities will only expand.</p>

<p>This is why I&#39;m a bit skeptical of this snowden release as well. It comes on the heels of &quot;the nsa has been targeting google&quot; (that link i included above about facebook mentions that the cia has financed google in the past too) and &quot;dna evidence proves bin laden died in 2011&quot; (but i&#39;m not going to show it to you). Both of these stories could be cia propaganda.</p>

<p>Is this really the best thing he can release on 9/11? It&#39;s enough to regain credibility with some people, but the media quickly ignoring it now (remember it was released via the msm initially) may just indicate that they do not want to draw any more attention than they have to to possible limited hangouts. I think the nsa-israel story is a half-truth at best because it doesn&#39;t mention mossad by name and doesn&#39;t mention whether there are data transfers going the other way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but unlike the Obama rallies, the RP rallies spoke out directly against agencies like the NSA, supporters of big government like the current and past administration, the disenfranchisement of the American people, and our blind loyalty and suspicious generosity to Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go right ahead and replace FPtP.</p>

<p>I think runoffs are a better system than FPtP, and support the idea that parties should choose their candidates by an internal process rather than a publicly financed process, and the primary should be to choose who goes to the runoff.</p>

<p>However, you need to recognize that parties change over time even if their names don&#39;t (compare Lincoln to Reagan, for example), and even if the two parties look exactly the same to you, that&#39;s just because you&#39;re standing so far off in the weeds that your politics are irrelevant and your candidate wouldn&#39;t get elected by anything except a coin toss.</p>
