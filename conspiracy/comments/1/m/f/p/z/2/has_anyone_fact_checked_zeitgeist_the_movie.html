    <div class="md"><p>The parts about Christ and his similarities to other deities is so blatantly and ridiculously false that it completely discredits the entire film. Claiming Horus had 12 disciples for example when he had zero, or that he died by being crucified when he is actually described as having died in a battle when his brother Set clawed out his eye. Or claiming Krishna died by crucifixion when he is said to have died from an arrow to the foot. Everything it says can be shown to have no basis at all with about two seconds of Googling per deity, and the information came from almost literally nowhere -- it just repeats the radical claims of Theosophists aiming to further a New Age agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the contents of one body of information have no direct bearing on the viability of any separate information, but, to me, the film&#39;s assertion of poorly sourced and easily discredited claims as factual is a clear indication of the likelihood of further bias and untrustworthiness in its message, as it reveals a lack of rigor and a failure to investigate have contributed hugely to the conclusions presented by the film. Granted, this doesn&#39;t serve as proof that anything else claimed in the film is erroneous -- I agree; only correct investigation is able to do that. But I would still argue the likelihood of further illegitimacy indicated by the poorly sourced information is a real likelihood, and that the indication has actual predictive power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool, thanks! I&#39;ll check it out.</p>

<p>Though how do you figure the 2nd and 3rd are worse or even just simply pretty bad? It really feels like in the first movie they were blanketing over a bunch of perceived problems fairly inefficiently. The 2nd and 3rd movies seem to show a refinement of their core argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t buy the whole resource based economy thing. I think to propose such massive ideas takes thousands of hours of research and expertise and the zietgeist guys don&#39;t have it.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that&#39;s the part I&#39;m considering right now as well.</p>

<p>On one hand, they make good points that our current global socio-economic structure that revolves around the assumption of infinite growth is untenable. On the other hand they propose this global resource management structure. Now.. I can only think of one way to make that sort of &quot;happen&quot; and that is centralized power and centralized planning. Humanity has experimented with this in the past with little success as far as I can tell (Soviet Union is the primary example here). That being said, what they are proposing is a centralized planning economic system based on the scientific theory. Something that has never been done and has therefore piqued my interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it interesting that everyone points to the Christ part of the films. </p>

<p>Really that seems like the least important part, overall. Sure, it creates the foundation for the film which is that it is all a narrative that may or may not be used to manipulate masses of people but that seems to be overshadowed by the other concerns raised within.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really get all the hate against Zeitgeist in here, but I&#39;ll give you my view. </p>

<p>As user Paperzplz said; the christ part is roughly accurate but debatable the 911 part is too shallow and the financial part is broadly correct.</p>

<p>Let me elaborate. The financial and social implications of Zeitgeist are considered &#39;&#39;utopian schemes&#39;&#39;. But eventually, a system close to this idea will be inevitable. Give or take the next 100 years, men will leap from a Type 0 civilisation to a Type 1. This is seen in the many scientific prototypes of &#39;&#39;type 1 powers&#39;&#39;. To reach Type 1, socio-economical issues can not endure.   </p>

<p>I think that at first the world will fall into an anarchic capitalistic state. After that, something which resembles an resource based economy.</p>

<p>The underlying idea behind Zeitgeist is probably closer to upcoming paradigms then most people think. </p>

<p>Zeitgeist, like everything <sup>insert</sup> <sup>something</sup> <sup>about</sup> <sup>salt</sup></p>

<p><sup><sup><sup><sup>inb4</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>getting</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>downvoted</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>for</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>saying</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>something</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>&#39;&#39;positive&#39;&#39;</sup></sup></sup></sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Christ part only proves that archetypes exist.  It&#39;s a really simplistic understanding of religion if it makes you think that anything is &quot;disproven.&quot;  I mean, let&#39;s face it, if you have half a brain, you&#39;ve realized that religion isn&#39;t there to be proven or disproven.  It&#39;s just a vocabulary for discussing this sense humans have of divine unity.  Some say Jesus some say Buddha some say atman or Brahman or whatever term &quot;spiritual&quot; people use or atheists use to describe the same &quot;feeling&quot; you get when you feel tied in to something deeper than the ego.   It&#39;s nonduality.  The Self becomes one with the Other. That&#39;s it.  Talk all you want.  That&#39;s the only point of religion.   </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve read Joseph Campbell you know that the Jesus story is just a hero&#39;s journey, so is Moses, so is Muhammad, so is Buddha, so is Krishna, so is every religious figure of all time, plus Luke Skywalker.  The meme goes back to the cave-painting days.  It&#39;s no surprise that it&#39;s found in Horus and Gilgamesh and whatever.  That&#39;s the human psyche.  It&#39;s the same story repeated over and over adapted to suit the needs of the time, because it&#39;s the only question worth asking and the only puzzle worth solving.  Man goes on journey, faces struggle, dies, realizes the unity of existence, is reborn, returns to bring the message to mankind.</p>

<p>If you think &quot;disproving&quot; the historical Christ is revolutionary, you&#39;re a noob.  Historicity is for losers.  It&#39;s all metaphor from the beginning, and metaphor is fucking powerful, even if it&#39;s made up out of whole cloth.  It doesn&#39;t matter if he is any more real than Santa clause.  He&#39;s a story and a metaphor.  That&#39;s it.  That&#39;s all he needs to be in order to control the world. Ignore that at your peril.</p>

<p>They should have just explained that, because at least then it gives you tools to better understand how narrative is used to manipulate you, and how to manipulate back and change the narrative, but they spent 40 minutes on &quot;hurr durr God doesn&#39;t real.&quot;  Narrative is the single most powerful force on Earth, but no one talks about it, they just sit back and consume it, and these days it&#39;s controlled by assholes and advertisers. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my main gripe with Zeitgeist.  Made it seem like it was made by an angsty sophomore who just took a Bible class.</p>

<p>Narrative people.  Narrative.  Much more powerful than truth.  Truth doesn&#39;t real.  Narrative is the interface between the mind and the world.  It makes people act.  Learn about it.  Read Joseph Campbell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All right, after watching the Zeitgeist series I believe the entire series could have been more succinctly presented in perhaps two, more consolidated films that presented the ideas in a more coherent fashion.</p>

<p>The first film seemed underdeveloped and naive to a degree, while still presenting a few interesting ideas which, in turn, motivated me to look into the second film. The second film quickly seemed to realize that rehashing the religious aspect needed to take a back seat to the broader social implications presented.</p>

<p>The third film was clearly the best of the three. They moved away from the gritty, scare tactic documentary style and seemed to try to present a more rational discussion revolving around the problems our society, nay, our planet faces today. </p>

<p>20/20 hindsight says that if only they had more thoroughly thought it all out from beginning to it&#39;s logical conclusion (something they seemed very fond of in film #3) they could have condensed it to 2 films and received much better reception.</p>

<p>All that aside, I really enjoy the concepts they presented me with. I am a very dedicated libertarian. Generally speaking, that means I focus very closely on the subject of personal freedom and hold that very close to my heart. </p>

<p>When I first heard their definition of this planned society that does A, B, and C for its citizens, allocates all resources and production, etc. I was very skeptical. Of course, to my understanding this smacked of other socio-economic structures I&#39;m familiar with. Communism, fascism, socialism and the like spring to mind. </p>

<p>What I was particularly impressed with is that they actually addressed this very real concern, considering our history in the last hundred or so years regarding such social structures. </p>

<p>As the film went on, it addressed a lot of concerns that I had independently made and tied it into there thesis, which of course furthered my interest. By the end I am left with a niggling sense of doubt in the way I&#39;ve always viewed the possibilities of social structure. </p>

<p>For that, I am thankful. Perhaps they are not right, but at least they recognized something I can get behind. The finest social structure can be built on a logical application of the scientific theory and the understanding and acceptance of the notion that just because we feel it&#39;s right now and seems to be working, doesn&#39;t mean it is the optimum path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, as someone who keeps an eye toward the conspiracy and used to contribute to the zeitgeist forums i have a small bit to add. I am not going to try to change the mind of any of you bible thumpers out there, or any of you die hard patriots, or anyone who believes that separation of ethnicities and &quot;nations&quot; is best. Just my thoughts, based on my experiences.</p>

<p>Long before I learned of any conspiritol thought, or even began questioning the world around me, it seemed obvious that we as a species will move toward the realization the we are ONE species and dependent on each other. We have to work together to sustain our self&#39;s on this planet and we will have to work together to move beyond this planet.</p>

<p>The Zeitgeist movement is a positive group. I am not an active member so to speak, but agree with a lot of what they perpetuate.</p>

<p>I am rambling a bit. The most important thought TZM puts forth is the thought of a social system where the MOTIVATION for competitive, corrupt behavior is removed. That is key! Whether it is something reminiscent of an RBE model or different. When we overcome the motivation for deceitful behavior and our present technological potential is encouraged to be realized we will see a very different progression/path as a species take form. A shift in the value system away from the dominant competitive(capitalism) value system to a cooperative(democratic) system is inevitable. </p>

<p>That is not NWO, that is not a bad thing. There is one species of humans. There is no question that there are groups of humans working together to oppress others. To preserve their role. They thrive off division. They thrive off the competitive monetary system(s). Divide and conquer. Keep the masses bickering amongst themselves.</p>

<p>Once I got out into the world and met people from beyond my own country and continent it really hit me that the only people benefiting from an non-unified human species are the wealthy capitalists. </p>

<p>Divided as a species we not only fall but remain stagnant in the shadow of our potential. I could go on, mostly because I am drunk. Ah, the Golden Monkey(Victory Brewing Co) taste so good. Drink good beer and disrupt the corporate strangle hold on blah, blah, blah, blha, zzzzzzzzzz,zzzzzz...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch Zeitgeist.</p>

<p>Watch Zeeitgeist and note that he doesn&#39;t like the &quot;New World Order.&quot; Note that the New World Order&quot; is totally into automated systems of government. A &quot;scientific government.&quot; This is discussed endlessly in this sub. Key search words: Transhumanism, New Age, bureaucratic government, incentivized government and socialism.</p>

<p>Watch Zeitgeist and see that his solutions are re-branded socialism and &quot;scientific government.&quot; His solution is still a centralized government that allocates resources. In order for those resources to be allocated once and not twice one must have centralization of data collection and processing. And it&#39;s every bit as inhuman and robotic as the New World Order.</p>

<p>All you have to do is watch Zeitgeist and start thinking about the applications of his solutions.</p>

<p>[EDIT] His model is a continuation of the &#39;evolution&#39; of Socialism. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how his form of centralized control is any better than another form of centralized control given that the goal would fundamentally be centralized control . . . <em>by whom?</em> Who do you think would claim control of the systems? Do you really think that the Rockerfellers, Rothschilds or whoever would just give up? Or do you think they&#39;d co-opt the next in a line of systems of centralized government? What has been the pattern so far? Do you think they&#39;ll continue the pattern?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I have to agree.. that is the fundamental issue I&#39;ve had with it all... While I do see that there might be a certain amount of logic in the conclusions presented, the end state is still a highly controlled society.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve become so upset with our money system that I now have a reflexive revulsion for the stuff. So I understand what you mean about not wanting to deal with money. I still feel as though it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to use logic on the subject, though:</p>

<p>Money is, in itself, not bad.</p>

<p>The problem is the controllers of the money. They&#39;re total dicks. We can talk about monetary policy all day long, but it doesn&#39;t matter. Fundamentally the real question is: are we playing by rules that hurt us or help us? The current money system is designed to hurt us. So I think we shouldn&#39;t play that game. We should make up a new game that doesn&#39;t hurt us.</p>

<p>And, yes, I agree about the highly controlled society being pretty lame. It&#39;s happening all around me these days. I woke up a year or two ago and realized that I&#39;m in a Philip K. Dick novel. That was a strange day. Peter Joseph, I believe, feels the same aversion to being controlled by dicks - it&#39;s just that I&#39;m not sure he really thought it through.</p>

<p>You might get a kick out of this:</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/uWbrowBAla8">Political Ponerology</a> - <em>psychopaths in government</em>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually of the opinion that a centralized system wouldn&#39;t technically be a bad thing. A centralized system is just another tool. The real question is who uses the tool? Think of a knife. A knife used by a cook gives you a good meal. A knife used by a serial killer gives you a different result. Or, seen another way, if we had a dictatorship and Jesus was at the head I wouldn&#39;t be too concerned. He&#39;d be out to help humanity and the Earth and I&#39;d be cool with that. If, on the other hand, it was Joseph Stalin, I would be highly upset. The user of the tool is probably more important than the tool itself. A skilled technician would ater the tool to suit the needs of the project. An unskilled technician wouldn&#39;t understand or, worse, might not care.</p>

<p>It is my belief that Capitalism is A.) probably long dead in this country and B.) what is called capitalism is headed by psychopaths.</p>

<p>Seen in this light it doesn&#39;t really matter what rules are passed or who gets elected. Why? Because the same psychopaths are the ones at the helm. They&#39;ll simply do what they wish regardless of what the rules are (how many examples can we think of?). I think universal health care is a great idea. And I have zero faith that ObamaCare will do anything other than harm America. I think a centralized money system is basically neutral in theory. And the people in control of the current centralized money system are classic psychopaths.</p>

<p>What to do?</p>

<p>If we can spot these &#39;people&#39; we can disallow them entry into positions of power. The key thing is to know what a psychopath is and what a psychopath isn&#39;t. This isn&#39;t some term you can bandy about all willy-nilly. I don&#39;t call a person a psychopath unless I have a shit load of thought behind it. That is to say: the incidence of psychopathy in the general population is probably 3%. Which means that a given person acting like a dick has a 97% chance of being a basically normal person just having a bad day and taking it out on you. So, just because a person is kind of a douche does not make them a psychopath. That said, if you find a psychopath you have a very situation on your hands. </p>

<p>There is only one solution that I know of for dealing with psychopaths: judo. Do not, under any circumstances engage them or allow them to impose themselves on you. You have to disengage. The reason I advocate non-payment of tribute [taxes] is because it is, on a basic level, a disengagement from the psychopathic system. Don&#39;t play their game. Play your own game.</p>

<p>I&#39;m rambling now.</p>

<p>I should have some fruit and settle down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love what you&#39;re saying here. Except that last bit. If I really wanted to disengage, I&#39;d prefer Aikido.

    <div class="md"><p>By an amazing coincidence I happen to know a little about Aikido and I agree. I think fewer people know about Aikido and this is why I used Judo instead. On a philosophical level I tend to think of water. Formlessness. Psychopaths need a target. Disallow them a target. Do not &#39;resist.&#39; Step aside.</p>

<p>At the moment we&#39;re in a tough spot because people still believe in &#39;the system.&#39; </p>

<p>The system is run by people who don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>Few people understand this and those who understand can&#39;t very well change everyone else&#39;s mind. For one thing deciding to change everyone&#39;s mind is damned close to what the propagandists do. Instead I think a program of intentional non-participation is the way to go. No violence. No shouting. Just disengagement. If you know the moves of your opponent then you can counter them (Aikido works best when you know multiple styles). There will be many different types of people who will take to defence of &#39;the system.&#39; For some people this will be their very sense of identity. This should not be taken lightly. They won&#39;t take it lightly. For them, on a psychological level, they&#39;re facing ego death. This is actually a very serious matter for many reasons. One of which is if they&#39;re facing death then they&#39;l be mentally prepared to fight - to the death. Again, this is a formally serious thing I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>I think we&#39;re in the &#39;study&#39; phase just before anything concrete can take place.</p>

<p>I think an armed revolution is wrong and I don&#39;t support it. Certainly not at this stage. It&#39;s okay to defend yourself, but aggression is the tool of the psychopath. The whole point is to avoid them and the consequences of their styles of behavior. Which is why I&#39;m all for a non-violent disengagement. If they use violence you get to defend yourself. But even then you should exhaust every option and possibility. They should have absolutely no reason to attack you. You don&#39;t get peace through violence. Using violence to get to peace is retarded (this is the U.S.&#39;s solution to Syria, incidentally).</p>

<p>But above all we must know with whom we&#39;re dealing.</p>

<p>Sun Tzu had a lot to say about knowing yourself and your enemy before engaging in battle.</p>

<p>He also said that the most effective victories were the ones that were won without engaging in battle.</p>
