       Not to say everything he says is dumb, but yesterday the guy said the Navy Yard shooting was specifically aimed at discrediting him. I mean, the guy gets outright ridiculous at times, sounding almost like a paranoid schizophrenic. But with many people laughing at him, I can't help but think that maybe that's his objective.

       i dont remember hearing that being said yesterday but i was tuning in and out alot that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aj has been at this for almost 2 decades now. most people who are awake can give thanks either to AJ directly or indirectly by a person who was awakened by him
      </p>
      <p>
       But at the same time, he has been doing this for 20 years and has been staring into the void of oblivion for the entirety of it, its sure to mess with your face. or allow you to make connections that arnt really there
      </p>
      <p>
       while he may go crazy on air and start yelling (immediately apologize before yelling again, lol) nearly everything that comes from his mouth is true. they may be true for different reasons than what AJ presented but truew non the less. Hes just like any other media outlett and is not infallible, take everything he says with a grain of salt no different than CNN or Fox
      </p>
      <p>
       to suggest hes a shill to discredit us when he practically created the movement doesnt make sense

        is that the truth that alex does reveal to the people is nothing that isn't already being said by someone else.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       alex was pretty much alone years ago when talking about the Bohemian grove, the NSA or martial law. today, more people see and accept that. if alex is indeed simply picking data from different people (data that is indeed true) then hes doing the rest of us a favor by consolidating all the info in one place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont think there will be much of any AJ listeners who are yelling "they did this because of alex jones". like i said before, im sure AJ gets overly hyped up and is running on pure emotion rather than logic sometimes. even the people that call in sound annoyed when he starts sniveling about and mocking the government the moment they start tlaking
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont get me wrong, i definitely see what youre saying. he even smoothly inigrates the events that were happening into why you need to go to the online store and spend money so it sounds like a real news piece until the end (he doesnt do this often but often enough) but AJ is essentially the father of the all the awakened people today, but was ridiculed and mocked for years, saying things that alot of people wernt talking about. its only the past 2 years or so where hes really began to resonate with people because everything hes been saying for years is coming true

       I wouldnt dismiss it so quickly. I know there will be many kids which could fall for this (and even adults) but many conspiracy teoriests starts to think for themselves thanks to them. I mean those people who will fall for anything person X says just because they believe Xs whole movement are the same people that would believe in cover stories. So you basically gain only people that starts to think independently and change few sheeps to Xs sheeps

       I don't believe him on that. You know, most people with an interest in history and politics or at least enough sense to not watch Fox Cnn and jersy shore, are not that dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think he is a very excitable and silly guy sometimes. I ignore that 25% of his show and watch the important bits, and triple check things that I have doubts about.

       You don't think very highly of the same people we are all depending on to get things changed, if that is even possible.

       I present Bill Cooper, whose credentials far outweigh Alex Jones. AJ straight up lied about the whole ordeal.

       - This is his decade long radio show which is much better then AJ's and much less sensationalist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even used to follow AJ until I realized I was being a sensationalist and not concentrating on facts and figures even in my personal thoughts. That is the whole plan my friend.

       sorry to burst your bubble, but not everyone sits at home all day leaving snide, 1 sentance long remarks on reddit and jerking off.

       Some people actually get socially and politically active. shocking, no?

       Yea, I'll admit he was douchey, but it would have been more effective if you actually supported your claims and refuted his. Pretty much just ad hominem coming from you. Example:

      <blockquote>

        better, but you still missed the mark. Sorry, but im afraid im going to have to give you an F.

       he did not, and does not want to discuss claims, facts, situations or scenarios. Hes there specifically to get a rile out of me or whoever else responds to him. Its known as "trolling". no matter what response i would have given, he/she would have responded with something just as shallow and insulting. telling me to talk to a troll using facts and logic is like telling me to contaminate a ocean of piss with piss

       You sound pretty damn confident that he was trolling. Maybe it's just me, but I thought that (even though he was being an ass) he was making a point; replying to him with supporting evidence would not just be for the 'troll', but would be beneficial for anyone else reading the comments.

       And you seem confident he wasnt. Look at his comment history, all his posts are 1 sentence long and all are insulting or baiting someone to respond. and there were no more than 1 post every couple days or so. i even made a reference to that in my comment to him. If he wanted to make a point, he would have made it, and NOT insulted me.

       Hey. Remember that one time, when our government really really wanted to bomb Syria and stuff. But it turned out that because of Alt-media a gajillion people called and wrote thier congressmen, and got it tied up long enough for a diplomatic solution.

       His bit on Morgan's show looked like it was going to be AWFUL...but it ended up being kinda helpful in the end. Another step away from that "we need them for hunting" bs that the NRA built in the 90's

       we look, guys. AJ is a loon, and that's it. Anyone remember him from just after 9/11? The years went on and the more looney he got, the more attention he garnered from the MSM, because they love anything that makes for "good" TV. That's it. That's all there is. He's not a shill.

       We need to stop the constant, never-ending
       <em>
        ad hominem
       </em>
       bullshit that we do on our sub,

       . AJ has been right TONS of times. For several years after 9/11, AJ was pretty bang on, and he was literally
       <em>
        instrumental
       </em>
       in getting the truth movement off the ground. Yes, I certainly felt sorry for him when he was cutting off his wife on the phone while he was chasing down the Bilderbergers. But is he an MK Ultra plant, specifically trained and honed, able to keep up some kind of Meryl Streep-level, Academy Award(TM)-worthy act, uninterrupted, for fifteen years? I doubt it. But is his ever-deepening lunacy of use to the MSM? Most certainly, certainly it is. Should he remain the face of the truth movement? Clearly, the MSM would love him to become just that, as his appeal to thinking-but-sane people is clearly limited. And new—and much less looney—faces of the truth movement are emerging.

       I think hes a natural product of what has been going on for the past few decades. Especially with the amount of information one can attain in this age of information, everything that has been concealed is now being consolidated and marketed. He is a man that is naturally gifted in analytical research and marketing. He tells a lot more truth than the other guys because the truth sells. Smart dude. Smart. Is he a double agent of some kind? Somehow I doubt it. The question I always have in my mind is if he's helping God. I have no freaking idea.

       Theres plenty of comments for thought here so i wont write a huge response but i would just like to point something out to those thanking AJ:
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing intrinsic to AJ that woke you up. He just has the biggest viewer base and thus you were the most likely to be exposed to this information by him. It could have been an number of other things and it could have been any number of the dozens of more eloquent, rational, and, frankly smarter, alt media sources out there. Dont get me wrong, he seems well intentioned enough (maybe hes a shill, maybe hes a scammer, maybe hes legit, it doesnt really matter) but you have to admit his delivery and attitude and just general way of going about things is abhorrent.

       This gets submitted regularly, and my opinion is that he's a fear-monger who sells the solutions to the issues he raises in his audience, making him a tidy profit. He's likely bought into some of it himself over the years though I suspect.

       Everyone keeps saying that, yet no one shows any evidence.  Other that one of his employees once working for Stratfor.  To me he seems like an earnest and overly emotional man who is trying to figure out the truth.

       Of course, man.  He's not only a shill, but - even more dangerous - he's a
       <em>
        limited hang out
       </em>
       shill, which means that even though he's a total shill, he DOES have
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       valid information.  This makes him even more dangerous because those that don't really know what's going on or are not sufficiently critically-minded (which is most people) will take in the 80% bullshit he spews as truth because of the 20% of it that's.

       And you seem confident he wasnt. Look at his comment history, all his posts are 1 sentence long and all are insulting or baiting someone to respond. and there were no more than 1 post every couple days or so. i even made a reference to that in my comment to him. If he wanted to make a point, he would have made it, and NOT insulted me.
