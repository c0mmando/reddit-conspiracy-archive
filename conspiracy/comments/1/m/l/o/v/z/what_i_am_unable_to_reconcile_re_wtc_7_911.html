       And it's very strange, the top portion in the center of WTC 7 collapses in on itself first, the windows blow open down the building, it all looks like a controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I still have never seen any credible explanation for how a government agency was able to keep such a huge operation a total secret? The Bush Administration had more holes than a sinking ship, how does something like 9/11 kept totally secret?  Even if it was a CIA group, do you know how many people would have needed to be involved with putting explosives in the WTC buildings before the planes flew into them?  Way too many to keep this a secret for 12 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone have a reasonable explanation as to how this has kept a secret for so long, when clearly hundreds of people were involved?

       That's known as the whistleblower fallacy.  Lots of people can keep a secret.  How would you even go about revealing it?  The government is watching you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tons of people HAVE come forward, just not someone in that specific aspect.  Somewhere on the net there's an interview with a Controlled Demolition, Inc employee who flirts with admitting it, though he doesn't.  It would mean his neck.  That's true for everyone involved.

       You really think out of the hundreds and hundreds of people involved with putting explosives in the WTC buildings (not just one tower, but both Twin Towers and WTC 7), not one of them became so overcome with guilt watching the horrific videos, that not one of them came forward because "it would mean their neck", as you say?  That seems so lazy to me, I don't think that's an answer.

       You really think it would've taken hundreds and hundreds of people to pull this off? I'm not saying this could be done with half a handful of people, but I think it could be achieved with a lot less then hundreds of hundreds. If you are a shitty enough individual that you would knowingly go into an occupied building and plant explosives, you probably don't even know the meaning of guilt. Then if that same individual is offered a choice of a suitcase full of money to keep quiet or a bullet to the face if they say a word, would you still be surprised if whistle-blowers are few and far between?

       Humans are capable of all manner of savagery. You think that the people who places explosives in an attempt to end lives would be overwrought with guilt upon success and reflection?

       Criminals occasionally confess their crimes, but not with any overwhelming frequency. Denial isn't just a river in Egypt...

       as regards to your assertion that it would have taken a suspiciously large organization to pull off- true dat. Except Bush was running security, 40% of the buildings was vacant. WTC7 was occupies by the Secret Service. There are accounts of the floors that that planes hit being filled with "computer memory databanks" that required reinforcement to the floors to support their weight in the months prior to the event.

       Get the demo crews to do their job then offer them and all non-essential personnel an all expenses paid trip to their dream vacation. Coincidentally, they are all on flights AA 11 &amp; AA 77 and UA 175 &amp; UA 93. No hush hush money to be paid and you get your "innocent" lives to sacrifice. Those not on the flights get reminded of what will happen if they speak out simply by someone mentioning 9/11.

       When you know that if you talk you and possible all your loved ones are dead, you would probably keep quite too. That and money, I believe.  The majority of the experts that came out and said that most of what happened was impossible when it first happened, either quickly changed their statements without explanation or died in "accidents".  Also why would they gather all the footage from any cameras around the pentagon and never release it.

        In the 2004 U.S. Presidential election, both the Democratic and Republican nominees were alumni. George W. Bush wrote in his autobiography, "[In my] senior year I joined Skull and Bones, a secret society; so secret, I can't say anything more."[24] When asked what it meant that he and Bush were both Bonesmen, former Presidential candidate John Kerry said, "Not much, because it's a secret."[25][26]

       Not "clearly" at all. In fact it's been estimated by some, with explanations, that it could have been done by as few as 3-4 dozen, including the top-down hierarchy. And if those few dozen happened to all be Mossad agents then they would have no reason to blab considering Israel's constant desire to get the US to send Americans to fight and die in wars against the countries Israel deems "enemies". Netahyahu made it clear that the attacks were good for Israel.

      <p>
       The penthouse collapses first because the core structural support for the building had collapsed and buckled a few seconds earlier. At the time the whole building came down, you're just seeing the facade and external supports collapsing. That's part of the reason why freefall was achieved for 2.25 seconds; it was pretty much only the facade and external support falling, not the core supports and floors. It's also why the building was sagging and twisting beforehand.

       You know that makes absolutely no difference right? There have been MANY steel framed buildings that burned out of control for MUCH MUCH longer than WTC 7 and their structure was never compromised at all. Do you realize that WTC 7 is the first and ONLY steel framed skyscraper to fall because of "office fires"?

       Proven? Where? The NIST report? They won't release their CAD model to be independently verified. They also changed their entire model when it was definitively proved that the building fell at free fall speeds.
