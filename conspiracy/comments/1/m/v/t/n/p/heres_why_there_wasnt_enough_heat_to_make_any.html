       Much more than a hundred thousand gallons, that's right  more than a hundred thousands  gallons of diesel fuel failed to ignite and simply flowed out into the street according to Newsday and WABC News

       "A cleanup is underway to remove tens of thousands of gallons of oil that spilled from 7 World Trade Center when the 47-story office tower collapsed on Sept. 11, according to a published report.
      </p>
      <p>
       Citing an environmental impact report made public by the Empire State Development Corp., Newsday reported Thursday that 130,000 gallons of oil leaked from the Con Edison substation contained within the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additional oil leaked from two 6,000-gallon storage tanks owned by Salomon Smith Barney, and conduits beneath the building may have contained asbestos and feeder lines wrapped in a material containing toxins, the report said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two 11,690-gallon diesel fuel tanks operated by Silverstein Properties were also inside the building, but were removed in March and April and showed no evidence of spillage, Newsday said. "

       it was an information box that popped up. when I commented saying paraphrased ' You are commenting on an (article?) that has been deleted".

       I believe it also said status 0 but I can't be sure as to that detail. I found out it wasn't deleted when I clicked my own link to it.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If I show you a recording provided by NIST under FOIA (which they cutout a part prior to collapse and forgot to edit the sound) that contains demolition sounds when the WTC7 falls will you keep believing in what you said or will change your mind?

       Denying one thing without providing an example as to what is causing the sound is a politician's tactic, or a shill even. Even debunkers provide truthers with evidence that is capable of refuting what they are interpreting, this is how you deny another person's argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you do the same and provide an example as to what is causing the sound that can only be heard in this video? I also expect that you took into account that in the first video the recording is much closer to the building than the second one.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I really hope that you don't say that's the sound of building parts hitting the ground because the sound ceases before the building has even fallen completely.

       I, too, cannot hear the sounds you're saying are there. I can hear one subtle-ish boom before the video cuts out and resumes again to the sight of the building falling. Should I be listening harder to the audio as the building falls or the audio before that?

       As soon as the building is falling there are explosion sounds on the background. Have you tried with the headphones? I can hear it 5 times in sequence, I can even hear the Van door closing mixed with the sounds.

       There is an independent video of the events in New York  from a Hoboken vantage point.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to watch because of bad, even irritating,  post production.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rick Segals input is not helpful in my opinion or else this video would be much more widespread
      </p>
      <p>
       You can hear the explosions well if you have decent  bass response in your sound. They're pretty low frequency.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also footage of the helicopters hovering over the towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Save yourself a headache and skip the opening.

       So you deny, I ask you to provide an explanation for the timed sound of explosions heard during the fall of the building and you just deny again. Did you really expect that the sound of one demolition would be exactly the same as the other? I found the video that had the closest similarity in the timing and levels for comparisson and you just say that they don't sound the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't even know why I bothered.

       And your theory is that somehow all of the fire investigators, insurance investigators, police, FBI, lawyers, etc missed this ?  Or that ALL of them are in on the conspiracy ?

       It's a simple fact that the diesel did not ignite.

      <p>
       Whether those people were threatened, which is highly likely, is not part of the facts I'm presenting.

       FEMA, for example only saw selected pieces of material miles away at Fresh Kills landfill.
