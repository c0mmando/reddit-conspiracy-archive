<p><strong>Plank 1 - Adding Pages</strong></p>

<p>There are many pages which do not exist now that would be valuable additions to wikipedia. Some examples are:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Chertoff Group</p>

<p>Yaron Shmuel, Oded Ellmer, Omer Marmari, Paul Kerzburg, and Sivan Kerzburg (dancing israelis)</p>

<p>Christopher Bollyn (author, investigated mossad&#39;s role in 9/11)</p>

<p>Britt L. Snider (former inspector general of the CIA appointed by George Tenet, as staff director)</p>

<p>Merrell Moorhead and Dr. J. Jakub (associates of porter goss)</p>

<p>Magdy Elamir (involved in a terror scandal w/ michael chertoff)</p>

<p>Phillip Marshall (author, friend of barry seal, suicided)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of CEOs don&#39;t have pages, which is hella sketch.</p>

<p><strong>Plank 2 - Revising Pages</strong></p>

<p>I think we should begin with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">9/11</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_evil">axis of evil</a>. In both instances our revisions need to be small and gradual. Getting into fights with mods will be counterproductive. Make revisions that cannot be reasonably contested, be careful not to overstate claims or jump to conclusions when dealing with uncertainties, and rely on sources viewed as credible by the mainstream as much as possible (like thepeopleshistory.net does). When you can&#39;t, do something similar to how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Fuisz#Alleged_CIA_connection">this entry</a> on richard fuisz discusses susan lindauer&#39;s book (which wasn&#39;t accepted as citable in and of itself because it was self-published).</p>

<p><strong>9/11</strong></p>

<p>A good place to start will be elaborating on intelligence connections between al-qaeda and the cia. Other wikipedia pages, the 9/11 wiki on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and r/conspiracy&#39;s search function are all good places to look. </p>

<p>Think about this as patient work being done to convince someone who knows very little about 9/11 and believes the official story. Our goal is to <em>gradually</em> transform the page from what it is now to something much more comprehensive and closer to the truth. </p>

<p>That means we should be begin by focusing on adding facts that do not radically overturn the narrative already constructed, and contesting claims that we know are too certain (by removing them, changing them, or adding facts that call them into question). </p>

<p>As more of these changes are made, the narrative will gradually shift and larger interventions will become possible. What may start off as an &quot;eyewitnesses&quot; section talking about the dancing israelis may eventually be a part of the &quot;suspects&quot; section... etc.</p>

<p><strong>Axis of Evil</strong></p>

<p>I think we should begin by adding information from people claiming the u.s., israel, and saudi arabia constitute an axis of evil.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.silviacattori.net/article3611.html">http://www.silviacattori.net/article3611.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/08/16/318983/us-israel-ksa-evil-axis-world-lepers/">http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/08/16/318983/us-israel-ksa-evil-axis-world-lepers/</a></p>

<p>At some point this may be listed as the &quot;primary&quot; axis of evil, as opposed to iraq-iran-north korea.</p>

<p>It&#39;d be extra cool if it were expanded to include russia/china at some point and then we&#39;d be close to revealing the nwo.</p>

<p><strong>Coordination</strong></p>

<p>R/conspiracy can obviously serve as a place to coordinate and discuss what we&#39;re doing. Naturally, we can do a lot of this work independently, but it&#39;d go more smoothly if we worked together. I&#39;d be down to start a google group or something like that dedicated to this. PM me if you&#39;d be interested in joining one. </p>

<p>Some of these pages are locked, so if you haven&#39;t been editing wikipedia much you&#39;ll need to have a few posts and some time under your belt before moving to the 9/11 page.</p>

<p>Suggestions? Criticisms? Additions?</p>

<p>I think the boston bombing page would be a good one to tackle too.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Sorry, but even though I do not sympathize with the community here, this is a pretty big fallacy. It is not like &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; means &quot;something that is false&quot; or &quot;something that can&#39;t be proven&quot;. A conspiracy is just that: Something a group of people conspire to do. Organized crime is hugely based on conspiracies and exists. I am sure a lot of shady deals, schemes and corruption are going on in the world of finance and bureaucracy that also qualify as conspiracies. </p>

<p>Now, as I said, I do not agree with most of the people here, but what you said there is just a plain fallacy, of course there can be conspiracy theories that can also be proven. It&#39;s just that I think we&#39;d both agree that some of the grand conspiracies promoted here are really, well, ludicrous and unproveable (and IMO unmaintainable) because of their proposed size and the proposed loyalty of the participants alone.</p>

<p>I&#39;d concurr that every citation would have to be individually checked, and I do think most, if not all, of them wouldn&#39;t hold up, but what you said still doesn&#39;t check out...</p>

<p>You are, of course, correct. My post was completely aimed towards a simple logical fallacy and critizises the categorical dismissal of anything labelled as &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, because that is, IMO, pretty stupid. If something doesn&#39;t hold up to the burden of proof, it should be dismissed. If a theory is so impropable, it borders on lunacy, it should be dismissed. If someone labels it &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, that shouldn&#39;t change anything about its validity.</p>

<p>May be nitpicking, including nitpicking about semantics, but hey, we are on the internet in a pseudonymous discussion after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You neglected the &quot;theory&quot; half of conspiracy theory and only mentioned the conspiring part. Sure conspiracies happen all the time, but a conspiracy theory is essentially just a guess that there&#39;s a conspiracy going on that&#39;s devoid of concrete evidence (which is technically a misuse of the word theory, but still in line with how theory is often used in common speech). Sure a conspiracy theory can be proved, but then it&#39;s no longer a theory, just a known conspiracy.</p>

<p>There was no fallacy in what was said, a requirement for something to be a conspiracy theory is a lack of evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a difference between a person, group or organization that&#39;s conspiring and a conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>If you want to get technical, they shouldn&#39;t even be called conspiracy theories, as a theory is definitive of something that&#39;s been extensively tested and is generally accepted. i.e. the theory or relativity.</p>

<p>A more accurate description would be a conspiracy hypothesis.... but that suggests the idea may be unbiasedly researched in hopes of finding a conclusive result, not cherry picked citations to suit an agenda.</p>

<p>And then you get into the argument of what constitutes a valid citation/reference for this type of research.</p>

<p>The problem is, by the time conspiracy theorists have a theory (or hypothesis) developed they already have a conclusion derived, and will use citations that lead to this desired end result, while ignoring evidence to the contrary, thus while the citations <em>may be</em> valid, they often ignore other information that diverts them from their pre-conceived conclusion.</p>

<p>4 In addition there are unproven allegations that the United States granted a green card to Ayman al Zawahiri, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report (p. 57) as “the most important Egyptian in bin Laden’s circle” (p. 57), and since 2011 the leader of al-Qaeda (Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed, The War On Truth:</p>

<p>9/11, Disinformation And The Anatomy Of Terrorism [Northampton, MA: Olive Branch Press, 2005], 46). It is not contested that “Foreign trial transcripts and U.S. court records confirmed that Zawahiri had previously flown to America, once in the early 1990s, and again in 1994…. Ali Mohamed, bin-Laden’s American-trained military adviser, served as Zawahiri’s host during the 1994 American fundraising campaign” (Jayna Davis, The third terrorist: the Middle East connection to the Oklahoma City bombing [Nashville, TN: WND Books, 2004], 318-19).</p>

Cf. Toronto Globe and Mail, November 22, 2001; Tim Weiner, Enemies: a history of the FBI (New York: Random House, 2012), 397.</p>

<p>10 Ali H. Soufan, The Black Banners: The Inside Story of 9/11 and the War Against al-Qaeda (New York: Norton, 2011), 75-77.</p>

<p>11 Lance, Triple Cross, 373. Cf. J.M. Berger, “Paving the Road to 9/11,” Intelwire, here: “Ali Mohamed was the utility player who created al Qaeda’s terrorist infrastructure in the United States — a series of connections, ideas, techniques and specific tools used by the [9/11] plot’s hijackers and masterminds…. Mohamed described teaching al Qaeda terrorists how to smuggle box cutters onto airplanes.”</p>

<p>12 Lance, Triple Cross, 123-24.</p>

<p>13 Soufan, The Black Banners, 561. The testimony of former FBI agents like Ali Soufan that Mohamed was not incarcerated has been challenged in a curious book by Special Forces veteran Pete Blaber, The Mission, The Men, and Me: Lessons from a Former Delta Force Commander (New York: Berkley Trade, 2010). Blaber claims to have interviewed Mohamed in a prison cell, after reading Mohamed’s perceptive document on how to track down Osama bin Laden. Blaber argues strenuously that Mohamed was not a double agent, but fails to deal with any of the countervailing evidence (such as the RCMP release).</p>

<p>14 “D.E.A. Deployed Mumbai Plotter Despite Warning,” New York Times, November 8, 2009; cf. Peter Dale Scott, American War Machine (Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2010), 246-47. Cf. The Globe and Mail (Canada), May 26, 2011: “FBI thought Mumbai massacre plotter worked for them, court told.” Another much simpler domestic example of this puzzle is Richard Aoki, the FBI informant who in the 1960s supplied the Black Panthers in Oakland with arms (Seth Rosenfeld,Subversives: The FBI’s War on Student Radicals, and Reagan’s Rise to Power [New York: Macmillan, 2012], 418-24, etc.).</p>

<p>15 Peter Dale Scott, The Road to 9/11: Wealth, Empire, and the Future of America (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007), 151-60. For a summary, see Peter Dale Scott, “Bosnia, Kosovo, and Now Libya: The Human Costs of Washington’s On-Going Collusion with Terrorists,” Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus, July 29, 2011, here.</p>

<p>16 Steven Emerson, American jihad: the terrorists living among us (New York: Free Press, 2002), 57-58; Peter L. Bergen,Holy war, Inc.: inside the secret world of Osama bin Laden (New York: Free Press, 2001), 135; Lawrence Wright, The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11 (New York: Knopf, 2006), 181-82. Wright gives a detailed summary of John Zent’s ensuing interview with Mohamed in May 1993, but says not a word about Zent’s intervention with the RCMP. To my knowledge the only privileged book to do so is Tim Weiner, Enemies: a history of the FBI (New York: Random House, 2012), 397: “He explained that he was working for the FBI and he offered the telephone number of his Bureau contact in San Francisco. The Canadians released Mohamed after the agent vouched for him.” Weiner’s relative candor came in 2012, long after this FBI scandal had already been publicized by Peter Lance and other authors, including myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>17 Cf. Washington Post, June 1, 2012: “Soufan’s case was unusual because he never worked for the CIA. The PRB’s [Publications Review Board’s] authority [i.e. legal authority] is grounded in the secrecy agreements signed by agency employees that require them to submit any material prepared for public disclosure ‘either during my employment . . . or at anytime thereafter.’” In other words, the CIA’s PRB had no legal right to censor Soufan’s book, but did so anyway – an example of the blurring of past bureaucratic distinctions in today’s shadow state.</p>

<p>20 Peter Waldman, Gerald F. Seib, Jerry Markon, Christopher Cooper, “Sergeant Served U.S. Army and bin Laden, Showing Failings in FBI’s Terror Policing,” Wall Street Journal, November 26, 2001.</p>

<p>21 Daniel Coleman, Affidavit, Sealed Complaint, United States of America v Ali Abdelseoud Mohamed, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, September 1998 (obtained by INTELWIRE.com), p.7, here. In fact Mohamed had been an FBI informant since at least 1992 (see below).</p>

<p>22 I had no choice but to remove certain relevant material from The Road to 9/11. As British and American lawyers pointed out to me, my sources had already retracted statements that they had made to me.</p>

<p>23 Lance, Triple Cross, 125. Cf. Steven Emerson, “Osama bin Laden’s Special Operations Man,” Journal of Counterterrorism and Security International,</p>

<p>September 1, 1998, here: “In a seemingly bizarre twist, while in California, Mohammed volunteered to provide information to the FBI on a smuggling operations involving Mexicans and other aliens not connected to terrorist groups. Within time, officials say, the relationship allowed Mohammed to divert the FBI’s attention away from looking at his real role in terrorism into examining the information he gave them about other smuggling.” But it could not have diverted the FBI’s attention for very long. By May 1993, five months later, Mohamed had described to Zent in some detail his activities with Obama and al-Qaeda (Wright, Looming Tower, 181-82; Berger, Ali Mohamed, 31-32).</p>

<p>24 Lance, Triple Cross, 95. Cf. Tim Weiner, Enemies, 397.</p>

<p>25 Lance, Triple Cross, 99. Similarly Tim Weiner writes that the FBI agents handling Mohamed “did not comprehend him” (Weiner, Enemies: a history of the FBI, 397).</p>

<p>26 “Ali Mohamed Case,” Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA), Department of Defense, here, emphasis added.</p>

<p>27 U.S. vs. Omar Abdel Rahman et al., September 11, 1995; quoted in Berger, Ali Mohamed, 210; cf. Lance, Triple Cross, 48.</p>

<p>28 “Sergeant Served U.S. Army and bin Laden,” Wall Street Journal, November 26, 2001: “At the time, the FBI wrote them off as harmless zealots, fired up to help the mujahedeen fighting the Soviet puppet government in Afghanistan.”</p>

<p>29 Bergen, Holy War, Inc., 134. The al-Kifah Center (al-Kifah means “the struggle”) was “known informally as ‘the jihad office.’… There was no problem finding volunteers, who might stay in Afghanistan up to three months at a time…. The volunteers joined the forces of the Hezb-I-Islami (Party of Islam), led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar” (Stephen Franklin, “Slain Muslim Had Link To Radical Cleric,” Chicago Tribune, July 11, 1993, here.)</p>

<p>115 Robert Baer, Sleeping with the Devil, 18-19, 194-96. Baer heard from another member of the al-Thani family, former police chief Hamad bin Jasim bin Hamad al-Thani, that when KSM came from the Philippines, Abdallah bin Khalid gave him 20 blank Qatari passports. Later, “As soon as the FBI showed up in Doha” in 1996, the emir ordered Abdallah to move KSM out of his apartment to his beach estate, and eventually out of the country (pp. 195-96).</p>

O’Connor and Nowosielski add corroboration from former Counterterrorism Chief Richard Clarke. “Clarke said he assumed that ‘there was a high-level decision in the CIA ordering people not to share that information.’ When asked who might have issued such an order, he replied, ‘I would think it would have been made by the director,” referring to Tenet — although he added that Tenet and others would never admit to the truth today “even if you waterboarded them.’</p>

The New York Times story is worth quoting further: “*Mr. Atriss was a co-founder of a Jersey City check-cashing company, Sphinx Trading Company, that had bank accounts with millions of dollars and had as a co-owner Waleed Abouel Nour, whom the F.B.I. had identified as a terrorist. That business was at the same location, on Kennedy Boulevard, used as a mailing address by several of the hijackers and earlier by Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, whose followers were convicted of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.”</p>

A few years later, Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal cut a secret deal with the Saudis so that OPEC would continue to price oil in dollars.

<p>38 New York Times, November 8, 1990.</p>

<p>39 New York Times, December 16, 1990. As before, it is instructive to compare the Pentagon’s version of the training given by Mohamed (“surveillance, weapons and explosives”) with that in the long article about Mohamed in the New York Times: “Mr. Mohamed met the local Muslims at an apartment in Jersey City, and taught them survival techniques, map reading and how to recognize tanks and other Soviet weapons, according to testimony by one of his students at Mr. Nosair’s 1995 Federal trial” (Weiner and Risen, “The Masking of a Militant: A special report,” New York Times, December 01, 1998; cf. Berger, Ali Mohamed, ).</p>

<p>40 TV journalist John Miller, a former New York deputy police commissioner who would later become the FBI’s Assistant Director for Public Affairs, reported in The Cell (44) that the disputed evidence from Nosair’s home was withheld from NYPD officer Edward Morris, who prepared the NYPD case against Nosair: “On the third say after the shooting, while Norris was out to lunch, the FBI removed Nosair’s 16 boxes of files from Norris’s squad room. Unfortunately the evidence was about to enter a black hole. The FBI now says it turned the files the evidence was about to enter a black hole. The FBI now says it turned the files over to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, after it was decided, following a series of meetings and phone calls, that the local prosecutor and the NYPD would have exclusive jurisdiction over the murder case. The Manhattan DA’s office won’t comment on what was done with the files before Nosair’s trail, though Norris was never informed they were available. But this much is certain: The bulk of the material remained untranslated and unread for nearly three years.” [This last sentence is hard to reconcile with the detailed description given at the time by Borelli.]</p>

Mark Huband, Trading Secrets: spies and intelligence in an age of terror (New York: I.B. Tauris, 2013), 112; “Mohamed – using the nom-de-guerre Abu ‘Abdallah – travelled to Bosnia as part of a team which trained and armed Muslim fighters there until June 1993, when he travelled on to Khartoum and was asked by bin Laden to set up the al-Qaeda cell in Nairobi, Kenya.”</p>

He is perhaps Prince Faisal bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who frequently visited the United States in connection with his horse breeding interests in Kentucky. In 2003 Gerald Posner claimed that Faisal’s brother and business partner Ahmed bin Salman had had ties to al-Qaeda and advance knowledge of 9/11 (Gerald Posner, Why America slept: the failure to prevent 9/11 [New York: Random House, 2003]), 202.

He had been to America once before, in 1989, when he paid a recruiting visit to the mujahideen’s Services Bureau branch office in Brooklyn.

<p>64 Cf. John J. Loftus , “What Congress Does Not Know about Enron and 9/11,” May 2003, here: “The … block order, in force since the 1980’s, was against any investigation that would embarrass the Saudi Royal family. Originally, it was designed to conceal Saudi support for Muslim extremists fighting against the Soviets in Afghanistan and Chechnya, but it went too far. Oliver North noted in his autobiography, that every time he tried to do something about terrorism links in the Middle East, he was told to stop because it might embarrass the Saudis. This block remains in place.”</p>

<p>66 Coleman affidavit, 2; in Berger, Ali Mohamed, 26.</p>

<p>67 Coll, The Bin Ladens, 399-401.</p>

<p>68 For a summary of some of the conflicting accounts, see Anthony Summers and Robbyn Day, The Eleventh Day: The Full Story of 9/11 and Bin Laden (New York: Ballantine Books, 2011), 215-16.</p>

<p>69 Coll, Ghost Wars, 231. In 2001 Peter Bergen had claimed that bin Laden “used his family connections with King Fahd to convince the [Saudi] government that he needed to leave the country to sort out some business matters in Pakistan. Arriving there in April 1991, he then sent a letter to his family telling them that he would not be able to return home. After some months in Afghanistan he arrived in Sudan” (Bergen, Holy Wars, Inc., 81-82).</p>

<p>70 9/11 Commission Report, 57. In the December 2004 paperback edition of Ghost Wars (231-32), Coll adjusted his account to reconcile with the 9/11 Report. He replaced his sentence, “The escort put bin Laden on a plane out of Saudi Arabia,” with two new ones: “Two associates of bin Laden later offered a different version while under interrogation. They said a dissident member of the royal family helped him leave the country by arranging for bin Laden to attend an Islamic conference in Pakistan during the spring of 1991.” (Wright, Looming Tower, 161; Roy Gutman. How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan [Washington DC: Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, 2008], 34).</p>

<p>71 Steve Coll also suggests that the “interior ministry” (headed by Prince) supplied bin Laden with “a one-time exit visa to travel to Pakistan to liquidate investments there” (Coll, The Bin Ladens, 381). Both motives may have been present in bin Laden’s mind, but his capacity to serve as a mediator may have been more influential in persuading the Saudis to arrange for his departure.</p>

<p>September 1, 1998, here: “In a seemingly bizarre twist, while in California, Mohammed volunteered to provide information to the FBI on a smuggling operations involving Mexicans and other aliens not connected to terrorist groups. Within time, officials say, the relationship allowed Mohammed to divert the FBI’s attention away from looking at his real role in terrorism into examining the information he gave them about other smuggling.” But it could not have diverted the FBI’s attention for very long. By May 1993, five months later, Mohamed had described to Zent in some detail his activities with Obama and al-Qaeda (Wright, Looming Tower, 181-82; Berger, Ali Mohamed, 31-32).</p>

<p>24 Lance, Triple Cross, 95. Cf. Tim Weiner, Enemies, 397.</p>

The FBI now says it turned the files over to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, after it was decided, following a series of meetings and phone calls, that the local prosecutor and the NYPD would have exclusive jurisdiction over the murder case. The Manhattan DA’s office won’t comment on what was done with the files before Nosair’s trail, though Norris was never informed they were available. But this much is certain: The bulk of the material remained untranslated and unread for nearly three years.” [This last sentence is hard to reconcile with the detailed description given at the time by Borelli.]</p>

<p>69 Coll, Ghost Wars, 231. In 2001 Peter Bergen had claimed that bin Laden “used his family connections with King Fahd to convince the [Saudi] government that he needed to leave the country to sort out some business matters in Pakistan. Arriving there in April 1991, he then sent a letter to his family telling them that he would not be able to return home. After some months in Afghanistan he arrived in Sudan” (Bergen, Holy Wars, Inc., 81-82).</p>

<p>70 9/11 Commission Report, 57. In the December 2004 paperback edition of Ghost Wars (231-32), Coll adjusted his account to reconcile with the 9/11 Report. He replaced his sentence, “The escort put bin Laden on a plane out of Saudi Arabia,” with two new ones: “Two associates of bin Laden later offered a different version while under interrogation. They said a dissident member of the royal family helped him leave the country by arranging for bin Laden to attend an Islamic conference in Pakistan during the spring of 1991.” (Wright, Looming Tower, 161; Roy Gutman. How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan [Washington DC: Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, 2008], 34).</p>

<p>71 Steve Coll also suggests that the “interior ministry” (headed by Prince) supplied bin Laden with “a one-time exit visa to travel to Pakistan to liquidate investments there” (Coll, The Bin Ladens, 381). Both motives may have been present in bin Laden’s mind, but his capacity to serve as a mediator may have been more influential in persuading the Saudis to arrange for his departure.</p>

<p>39 New York Times, December 16, 1990. As before, it is instructive to compare the Pentagon’s version of the training given by Mohamed (“surveillance, weapons and explosives”) with that in the long article about Mohamed in the New York Times: “Mr. Mohamed met the local Muslims at an apartment in Jersey City, and taught them survival techniques, map reading and how to recognize tanks and other Soviet weapons, according to testimony by one of his students at Mr. Nosair’s 1995 Federal trial” (Weiner and Risen, “The Masking of a Militant: A special report,” New York Times, December 01, 1998; cf. Berger, Ali Mohamed, ).</p>

<p>40 TV journalist John Miller, a former New York deputy police commissioner who would later become the FBI’s Assistant Director for Public Affairs, reported in The Cell (44) that the disputed evidence from Nosair’s home was withheld from NYPD officer Edward Morris, who prepared the NYPD case against Nosair: “On the third say after the shooting, while Norris was out to lunch, the FBI removed Nosair’s 16 boxes of files from Norris’s squad room. Unfortunately the evidence was about to enter a black hole. The FBI now says it turned the files the evidence was about to enter a black hole. The FBI now says it turned the files over to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, after it was decided, following a series of meetings and phone calls, that the local prosecutor and the NYPD would have exclusive jurisdiction over the murder case. The Manhattan DA’s office won’t comment on what was done with the files before Nosair’s trail, though Norris was never informed they were available. But this much is certain: The bulk of the material remained untranslated and unread for nearly three years.” [This last sentence is hard to reconcile with the detailed description given at the time by Borelli.]</p>

Abu Obadiah Yahiya, an ex-US Marine and security chief at the Brooklyn branch, lead [sic] a second group of US militants to fight in Bosnia.” Cf. Mark Huband, Trading Secrets: spies and intelligence in an age of terror (New York: I.B.

He had been to America once before, in 1989, when he paid a recruiting visit to the mujahideen’s Services Bureau branch office in Brooklyn.

<p>September 1, 1998, here: “In a seemingly bizarre twist, while in California, Mohammed volunteered to provide information to the FBI on a smuggling operations involving Mexicans and other aliens not connected to terrorist groups. Within time, officials say, the relationship allowed Mohammed to divert the FBI’s attention away from looking at his real role in terrorism into examining the information he gave them about other smuggling.” But it could not have diverted the FBI’s attention for very long. By May 1993, five months later, Mohamed had described to Zent in some detail his activities with Obama and al-Qaeda (Wright, Looming Tower, 181-82; Berger, Ali Mohamed, 31-32).</p>

<p>68 For a summary of some of the conflicting accounts, see Anthony Summers and Robbyn Day, The Eleventh Day: The Full Story of 9/11 and Bin Laden (New York: Ballantine Books, 2011), 215-16.</p>

<p>69 Coll, Ghost Wars, 231. In 2001 Peter Bergen had claimed that bin Laden “used his family connections with King Fahd to convince the [Saudi] government that he needed to leave the country to sort out some business matters in Pakistan. Arriving there in April 1991, he then sent a letter to his family telling them that he would not be able to return home. After some months in Afghanistan he arrived in Sudan” (Bergen, Holy Wars, Inc., 81-82).</p>

<p>70 9/11 Commission Report, 57. In the December 2004 paperback edition of Ghost Wars (231-32), Coll adjusted his account to reconcile with the 9/11 Report. He replaced his sentence, “The escort put bin Laden on a plane out of Saudi Arabia,” with two new ones: “Two associates of bin Laden later offered a different version while under interrogation. They said a dissident member of the royal family helped him leave the country by arranging for bin Laden to attend an Islamic conference in Pakistan during the spring of 1991.” (Wright, Looming Tower, 161; Roy Gutman. How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan [Washington DC: Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, 2008], 34).</p>

<p>71 Steve Coll also suggests that the “interior ministry” (headed by Prince) supplied bin Laden  with “a one-time exit visa to travel to Pakistan to liquidate investments there” (Coll, The Bin Ladens, 381). Both motives may have been present in bin Laden’s mind, but his capacity to serve as a mediator may have been more influential in persuading the Saudis to arrange for his departure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saying that some people don&#39;t know that a third tower collapsed is likewise quite different than saying <em>most</em> people don&#39;t know that a third tower collapsed. Have you ever considered that the reason why it gets less attention isn&#39;t due to a lack of knowledge about the collapse, but instead is due (in most people&#39;s minds) to that tower being collateral damage rather than a primary target?</p>

<p>People don&#39;t have the mental image of a plane flying into the third building and exploding and the associated mental horror of imagining how awful it would have been right there on either side of those impacts. A building that caught fire after the attacks and left its occupants with ample time to safely escape before collapsing just isn&#39;t as shocking and doesn&#39;t get seared into memory in the same way as graphic depictions of life-ending direct attacks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s absolutely unsurprising that that consulate issued visas for those hijackers - they were from Saudi Arabia. It also issued visas for thousands of Saudis who didn&#39;t attack the USA.</p>

<p>The story about bin Laden and the CIA — that the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden — is simply a folk myth. There&#39;s no evidence of this. In fact, there are very few things that bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and the U.S. government agree on. They all agree that they didn&#39;t have a relationship in the 1980s. And they wouldn&#39;t have needed to. Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently. The real story here is the CIA did not understand who Osama was until 1996, when they set up a unit to really start tracking him</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 transformed the regional setting.</p>

<p>President Carter and his national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, built a Western-Muslim coalition with Britain, France, West Germany, China, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates playing key roles.</p>

<p>Revolutionary Iran offered some aid to anti-Soviet guerrillas in western Afghanistan.</p>

<p>But all other foreign assistance to the mujahideen arrived via Pakistan, to be handled by the ISI whose Afghan Bureau co-ordinated all operational activities with the seven guerrilla militias.</p>

<p>This was done in such secrecy that the Pakistani military itself was kept in the dark.</p>

<p>Just to get a sense of the scale of the operation - the CIA provided enough arms to equip a 240,000-man army, and the Saudis matched US funding dollar for dollar</p>

<p>The US government doesn&#39;t deny it. Look at what zbigniew Brzezinski says on wikipedia&#39;s operation cyclone page.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is that the criteria that counts? Because bush and his neoconservative friends lied to congress about the war in iraq - real people died because of the power of that phrase and the supposed legitimacy of congress (I prefer progress).

<p>There are many conceptual/intellectual problems with the phrase &quot;the axis of evil&quot; - perhaps we should change it to say there is no axis of evil? At the very least, wikipedia shouldn&#39;t only include the neoconservative axis of evil and at least mention that other people have used the phrase in a different way before and talk about those people too.</p>

<p>Speaking personally, I never thought there was an &quot;axis of evil&quot; if for no other reason than &quot;evil&quot; is such a loaded, subjective term. It has almost no meaning... unless it&#39;s said by the CINC. The thing, for me, is those sorts of philosophical, contextual debates don&#39;t belong in an encyclopedia, especially not one as important (in our 2013 context) as wikipedia.</p>

<p>Or perhaps irony is too subtle for you. Conspiracy theorists are hallmarked by one major red flag (among several), and that&#39;s the claim to knowing an objective Truth that is secret, that no one else knows, and that they must protect, guard, and spread as knowledge. The use of Truth as a moral weapon (&quot;if you don&#39;t agree with me it&#39;s because you hate the truth and prefer lies&quot;) and not as an objective adherence to the reality of any given event. This is why 9/11 folks are called Truthers, the same reason people who believe Obama is a Kenyan are called Birthers; it&#39;s an ironic reappropriation of their main obsession, used as a means of discrediting irrational and fallacious thought. Truthers treat the concept of &quot;truth&quot; as Godlike. </p>

<p>Anyone who is so deluded to believe that they are the vanguards of a secret Truth known only to those special folks who are more intelligent, enlightened, or studied than their peers, and are so convinced that <em>no amount of contradicting evidence</em> can shake their beliefs, are just members of the Cult of Truth.</p>

<p>Truth With A Capital T and truth are two different things. Maybe Truth<sup>TM</sup> would drive home the point a little better?</p>

<p>... duh. Are you not familiar with symptom checklists? There are a variety of red flags (which I alluded to.....), all of which <em>on their own</em> don&#39;t necessarily mean much, but when taken altogether, create the intersection on a venn diagram. Which is kind of <em>exactly what I was saying</em>. Since the adherence to truth was the only one that was being discussed, being the name of the Truther movement, I didn&#39;t think it was necessary to distract the discussion with unrelated banter; I trusted that you&#39;d be able to infer my meaning, but it seems you instead chose to leap at the chance to tell me how wrong I was without looking where you were leaping.</p>

<p>They were there to document the event, possibly for political reasons, and were held in detention by the fbi for 10 weeks before returning to israel. krs-one&#39;s &quot;we cheered when 9/11 happened&quot; (attributed to him by fox news) is on his page.

    <div class="md"><p>The problem you face with most of the things you&#39;re interested in improving is that there simply isn&#39;t the totality of evidence to support any alternatives to what&#39;s currently covered. </p>

<p>In cases where there are genuine agreed uncertainties then varied viewpoints will generally be covered, but there simply is no consensus or even a consistent and whole position on any of the alternative theories you&#39;re interested in.</p>

<p>Connections between Bin Laden and the CIA are, unsurprisingly, unconfirmed and the subject of a lot of speculation. There simply are no reliable sources of information. There&#39;s accusations and suppositions, but nothing that could be considered concrete.</p>

<p>The dancing Israelis have no bearing on 9/11. Nothing about the event would have changed with or without their involvement. They are not noteworthy really.</p>

<p>As for 9/11 - there is barely any consensus among those who deny the official story. Some say there were no planes at all, some say they were remote controlled. The bulk of 9/11 conspiracy theories are focused on disputing the official story without offering any cogent alternative for the events.</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m aware none of the controlled demolitions theories even come closer to addressing the really big issue with that idea - how it may have been practical to actually achieve what they suggest.</p>

<p>Without consistent and solid theories that are backed (objectively) by evidence I can&#39;t see how you could even begin to include these on the main 9/11 page. What would your edits even say?</p>

<p>&quot;Some people reject the official explanation and instead have come up with these 17 different theories to explain small parts of the events of 9/11&quot; ??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, this is the main hang up. There is plenty of documentation on the cia and al qaeda&#39;s relationship that could be added though, that is confirmed rather than speculative. </p>

<p>There is an enormous amount of evidence that can be included without needing to offer an alternative theory - like war games and insider trading, sibel edmonds&#39; and indira singh&#39;s testimony, etc.</p>

<p>The 5 israelis were detained by the fbi for 10 weeks as suspects and have made statements which imply foreknowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>WTC7</strong></p>

<p>Danny Jowenko is a demolition expert who was shown footage of WTC7 collapsing and concluded that it was a controlled demolition before being told it had anything to do with 9/11: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3DRhwRN06I">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3DRhwRN06I</a></p>

<p>Barry Jennings was in WTC7 before it collapsed and reported hearing explosions. Only a few days before the NIST report was released, he died of unknown causes. You can read more about him here (scroll down to number 2): <a href="http://listverse.com/.../top-10-witnesses-who-died-suddenly/">http://listverse.com/.../top-10-witnesses-who-died-suddenly/</a></p>

<p>Larry Silverstein bought insurance for WTC7 only 5 weeks before the attacks. While the deal was worth $3.2 billion to the NY Port authority, Silverstein &quot;only&quot; put up $15 million for the lease. The remaining $110 million needed in equity to secure the lease was provided by Lloyd Goldman, Silverstein&#39;s partner: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122108942858221349.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122108942858221349.html</a>. Rather than having to pay another $3.1 billion to finish the deal, Larry Silverstein received $4.55 billion from the insurance pay-out. The WSJ called his project to rebuild the complex &quot;potentially highly lucrative.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Whistleblowers</strong></p>

<p>These whistleblowers have all backed up their claims with evidence. For instance, <a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2011/02/01/the-fbi-%E2%80%9Ckamikaze-pilots%E2%80%9D-case/">this</a> is a great piece written by Sibel Edmonds presenting evidence of government foreknowledge. John Ashcroft placed a gag order on her after she discovered this evidence and her testimony was included in the 9/11 commission report only as a minor footnote.</p>

<p><strong>Nanothermite</strong> </p>

<p>In 2006 Steven Jones conducted several scientific analyses of WTC dust and claims to have found nanothermite within it. Soon after publishing his findings the university he was working for ceased to employ him. You can listen to an interview with Steven Jones, here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kckpHorrFQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kckpHorrFQ</a></p>
