       They're also a threat because truckers have been held up as a symbol of good 'ol American hard working folk. They are hard to marginalize. Every generation understands truckers, unlike the young people involved in OWS, which many older people were confused or angered by.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trucking is considered a job that's in reach of anyone willing to work the long hours, so it's a symbol of opportunity in America. When the truckers rebel, that myth or symbol starts to come apart.

       knows things aren't great in here. Of course he thinks it's a vast Left-Wing conspiracy. Which is hilarious because one of his daughters thinks it's a vast Right-Wing conspiracy. Neither seems to have caught on that both parties act the same. But I digress.

       I'll have to ask him what he thinks about the trucker thing.

       Two truckers in a room will agree to anything while secretly disagreeing with each other. Three will end up two on one against. More than that and everyone just does their own thing. There will never ever be a million truck drive into DC. Source : I drove for 12 years and have heard about the same thing over 100 times.

       I wouldn't be so much worried about that as everything shutting down within a few days of truckers go on strike. Think of how many places rely on daily or near daily shipments, weather it be food or fuel. The west does not function without big rigs

       Oh, you don't want to work?  Ok, we will throw you in prison and take your truck, seize your bank accounts, etc. etc.  Then we will have the Army take over your delivery routes until new truckers can be hired, which will take all of a few weeks to do.  Also, they will hire Halliburton to help cover the gaps for the cost of a few billion dollars a week.  And they will pay for it all with your tax dollars.

       Halliburton only does Oil and gas industry now. They sold off their subsidiary KBR construction (which did the Iraq / Kuwait rebuild) back in 2007 I'm thinking in part because of all the negative press they were receiving.
      </p>

       I worked for the big H last year, in their Wireline division in Western Canada. I hated it, it ran like shit, underpaid for the risks and bullshit hours they expected. Got the fuck out of there after the winter.
      </p>

       Oh yeah I just used Haliburton as an example.  Though I'm surprised that KBR is gone- probably means an insider in the government said "no more nation-building for a while".
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, noise would be made.  Truckers are in a unique position of power because they actually own the capital (the trucks).  You can train a truck driver in a few weeks, days if you HAD to.  But if they own 70% of the big rigs in the country, no one, not even the government, can fill that void in short order.  Maybe the military, but they would be horribly inefficient at it.

       They must be on to something. Hope they follow through. I'd do it. The idea is everyone else refuses to buy a thing. Hard to get everyone on board but wouldn't three days just do it?! Silent protest from a once vocal population. I like it.

       "Truckers to Shut Down America, was urging truckers to drive to DC October 11-13, 2013 and
       <strong>
        Americans to boycott in support of the truck drivers by ceasing all money transactions for those days.
       </strong>
       At the time of that article, the site had little over 10,000 likes. I wanted to provide an update.
Three days after I wrote about the march, the site has garnered over 67,000 likes and new developments have arisen that could only have happened due to the overwhelming support for our hard working truck driving friends." -

       Ya know what's funny?  The truckers are OG, they network via CB.  Shortwave is enough to get the word around on the highways.  They'll be there just as strong or stronger if it will be meant to be.

       Have you ever dealt with truckers?  They're worse than a bunch of blue-haired old ladies gossiping all day at the hair salon.

       As much as I'd love to see this happen, I wouldn't hold my breath.  You can't even get 4 truckers to agree on where to stop for lunch.

       I'm pretty sure this whole event is invented.  This isn't actually going to happen.  The only conspiracy this sub seems determined to ignore is that most of this crap is complete disinformation.  Just because something would be exciting if true, doesn't mean it is true.  A story like this would not be ignored by the MSM because their profit and ratings motive supersedes all else.

       Good thing there is Taft-Hartley, the most un-American and cruel labor law ever.

       Basically the President can order strikers back to work if it creates a potential national emergency.

       Oh, you don't want to work?  Ok, we will throw you in prison and take your truck, seize your bank accounts, etc. etc.  Then we will have the Army take over your delivery routes until new truckers can be hired, which will take all of a few weeks to do.  Also, they will hire Halliburton to help cover the gaps for the cost of a few billion dollars a week.  And they will pay for it all with your tax dollars.

       That's the point, to show the government that the
       <em>
        public
       </em>
       is in charge, not the stuffed suits that
       <em>
        depend on us

       . We don't need Washington DC, we can live without Washington DC, we could do away with Washington DC and nobody would notice - but they need us, they can't live without us, and they can't do away with us.
