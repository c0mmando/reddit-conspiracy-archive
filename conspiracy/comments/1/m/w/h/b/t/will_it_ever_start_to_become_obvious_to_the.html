    <div class="md"><p>Many people seem to fear the global currency/ one world government idea but isn&#39;t it a logical progression? The masses will always hold the power of violent revolution over a central authority whether it is one govt or many. I tend to view the move towards a one world govt as a step towards increased space exploration and the scattering of the human race and our technology through the galaxy. Why should the world exist as a divided entity? Is that really better?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fear is not of global currency <em>per se,</em> as I fully support the ongoing expansion of BitCoin (which is in essence a &quot;global currency&quot;). My fear is a legitimate concern about power being yet again concentrated into fewer and fewer hands. The ideal distribution is maximum power to the individual with less and less power granted progressively to &quot;government&quot; or &quot;business&quot; or &quot;banking&quot; entities at the local, regional, state, national and global levels. </p>

<p>One &quot;world government&quot; (or &quot;global currency&quot;) means a small ruling elite making all the laws and decisions and regulations that affect your life from perhaps thousands of miles away with little to no real interest in how good or bad your life is so long as their power is maintained. (Yes, I do not trust Government to look out for the interests of it&#39;s citizens.)</p>

<p>Local government places their focus on the welfare of the city above the individual. State government places their focus on the welfare of the state over that of the city. National government focuses on the welfare of the nation over that of the states. And a global government will place the interests of the entire planet above the interest of anyone nation. </p>

<p>With this understanding, you can see how the interest of the individual get left far far behind the further up the chain you go. In some ways this could be seen as beneficial (for example, coherent and consistent protection of the environment to prevent global catastrophe), but at some point, the lives of individuals end up sacrificed for The Greater Good, and we all end up nothing more than worker ants serving the survival of the Colony.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a valid point about representative democracy and more division in government giving more power and control to the individual but I see a huge problem with that as well. We have had countries far too self-interested and not interested enough in the well being and survival of the human race as a whole. We are blasting through precious resources at an alarming rate and with each country acting selfishly and independently there will be inevitable competition and we will scrape the world dry in a fruitless effort to make our own &quot;section&quot; of the planet the most wealthy. Without a healthy dose of &quot;greater good&quot; over individual motivation we are doomed to extinction or collapse on a long enough timeline.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply">US money supply wikipedia page</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As of April 2013, the monetary base was $3 trillion and M2, the broadest measure of money supply, was $10.5 trillion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To pay off the 16 trillion in debt, which is owned by a variety of banks and some countries, would be devastating to the economy, the money would be diverted elsewhere instead of continually flowing.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the debt is increasing at a continually faster rate.</p>

<p>It may be theoretically possible to pay off but it is not at all practical. Our economy is a debt based economy, by the very nature of money creation, where the dollar is born with interest attached: from the very beginning, there is more debt than there is money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a youngish person (24), I disagree with this. We have been raised with unbelievable access to information, some choose to use this as an ever expanding distraction machine, but some like myself are using the internet to gain information that we would have never otherwise been exposed to if we had been born 20 years earlier. There are many people in my generation who are very well informed and still hopeful enough to push for change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if I understand what you&#39;re saying, but you seem to be indicating that the young people are easily deceived, and its the old that are waking up to the bullshit, and have had enough?</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re pretty far off the mark here.  In my experience, the old (boomers and earlier), having lived the majority of their lives in the most prosperous time in modern history, are the last ones that seem to be clueing in to the rapidly changing reality. </p>

<p>The ones just getting started in life are realizing that the world we&#39;re inheriting is an absolute wasteland, thanks to the boomers, who have sucked the wealth of their nations dry, and are still looking forward to their pensions and social security, which the younger generation will be funding.  </p>

<p>Being poor and robbed of opportunity has a way of accelerating one&#39;s awakening process. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thesis statement: You&#39;re wrong. You actually think the older generation is more informed about the world than the younger one? They aren&#39;t, they are the the ones who we now have to fight against because a large portion have been completely brainwashed by the history that has been narrated to them. See: Tea Party. Both can be completely ignorant, but only one grew up with the internet. For us young and impressionable, the internet is an extension of our minds, our rights, our virtues and our vices much more so than just as a metaphor. It&#39;s an extension of the human species.  For much of the older generation it isn&#39;t viewed this way at all. Which is why we have to fight these shitty laws now. The younger generation has a much easier time identifying the bullshit and relevant information to counter it, than the older one does. Fresh eyes and all of that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people seem to fear the global currency/ one world government idea but isn&#39;t it a logical progression? The masses will always hold the power of violent revolution over a central authority whether it is one govt or many. I tend to view the move towards a one world govt as a step towards increased space exploration and the scattering of the human race and our technology through the galaxy. Why should the world exist as a divided entity? Is that really better?</p>
