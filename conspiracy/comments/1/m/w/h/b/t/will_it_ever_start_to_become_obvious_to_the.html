       Every couple months it seems we have these budget/sequester debates in Washington. It allows the left and right to hit their favorite talking points, cutting taxes, ending regulation, saving budgets for social programs, etc; but in the end we just keep borrowing from the fed anyway. Is this a deliberate smokescreen, just a shell game, or something else?

       When the general public realizes there is no longer any possible way to actually pay back our multi-trillion dollar debt, there will be massive panic, economic collapse and civil unrest. This is not an accident, not a mistake and not being done through negligence; this is entirely intentional. It's the final step before the grand "reboot" to a single global currency. Calling it now. Save this post for future reference.

       Many people seem to fear the global currency/ one world government idea but isn't it a logical progression? The masses will always hold the power of violent revolution over a central authority whether it is one govt or many. I tend to view the move towards a one world govt as a step towards increased space exploration and the scattering of the human race and our technology through the galaxy. Why should the world exist as a divided entity? Is that really better?

       The fear is not of global currency
       <em>
        per se,
       </em>
       as I fully support the ongoing expansion of BitCoin (which is in essence a "global currency"). My fear is a legitimate concern about power being yet again concentrated into fewer and fewer hands. The ideal distribution is maximum power to the individual with less and less power granted progressively to "government" or "business" or "banking" entities at the local, regional, state, national and global levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       One "world government" (or "global currency") means a small ruling elite making all the laws and decisions and regulations that affect your life from perhaps thousands of miles away with little to no real interest in how good or bad your life is so long as their power is maintained. (Yes, I do not trust Government to look out for the interests of it's citizens.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Local government places their focus on the welfare of the city above the individual. State government places their focus on the welfare of the state over that of the city. National government focuses on the welfare of the nation over that of the states. And a global government will place the interests of the entire planet above the interest of anyone nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this understanding, you can see how the interest of the individual get left far far behind the further up the chain you go. In some ways this could be seen as beneficial (for example, coherent and consistent protection of the environment to prevent global catastrophe), but at some point, the lives of individuals end up sacrificed for The Greater Good, and we all end up nothing more than worker ants serving the survival of the Colony.

       You make a valid point about representative democracy and more division in government giving more power and control to the individual but I see a huge problem with that as well. We have had countries far too self-interested and not interested enough in the well being and survival of the human race as a whole. We are blasting through precious resources at an alarming rate and with each country acting selfishly and independently there will be inevitable competition and we will scrape the world dry in a fruitless effort to make our own "section" of the planet the most wealthy. Without a healthy dose of "greater good" over individual motivation we are doomed to extinction or collapse on a long enough timeline.

       This is a very serious and ongoing problem, but I still firmly believe the answer is not to be found in a top-down government. That system only removes people further and further from direct responsibility for their environment.

       Have you looked at the options of direct democracy with the assistance of the internet? Along with a global resource management and tracking system I think and hope that there are some outside the box options that just require a huge amount of societal change that may be impossible for people to accept willingly.

       I am operating under the assumption that the vast majority of the world's population, including Americans, are largely ignorant of economics/currency and would respond to a crisis by accepting the official Government solution. There will be a noisy, informed and largely powerless minority raising objections, and this token resistance will accomplish nothing. You disagree?

       To pay off the 16 trillion in debt, which is owned by a variety of banks and some countries, would be devastating to the economy, the money would be diverted elsewhere instead of continually flowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, but the debt is increasing at a continually faster rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be theoretically possible to pay off but it is not at all practical. Our economy is a debt based economy, by the very nature of money creation, where the dollar is born with interest attached: from the very beginning, there is more debt than there is money.

       It's always what is NOT debated that SHOULD be debated. Food stamps for poor people? Debated constantly. Huge agribusiness subsidies in the SAME BILL? No debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go down the list... right now it's about shutting down the government for Obamacare. But how about shutting down the spy apparatus? The massive military campaigns? The endless secrecy? The currency devaluation via the Fed?
      </p>
      <p>
       And neither side is pointing out that Obamacare is the big business' wet dream. Guaranteed customers and the insurance companies remain in place! No discussion of Medicare for everyone... of course not.

       When you take that phrase literally it doesn't make much sense, i said it more in a general sort of way. Mainly i am asking that when these debt ceiling debates come up, when will the arguments turn from big govt vs. small govt and move towards an examination of central banking and the implications of baseless currency.

       Nope.  There are always the young and impressionable, who will be fooled.  Too bad too, because the older folks are very tired of it, but that's the way with the young.

       As a youngish person (24), I disagree with this. We have been raised with unbelievable access to information, some choose to use this as an ever expanding distraction machine, but some like myself are using the internet to gain information that we would have never otherwise been exposed to if we had been born 20 years earlier. There are many people in my generation who are very well informed and still hopeful enough to push for change.

       Not sure if I understand what you're saying, but you seem to be indicating that the young people are easily deceived, and its the old that are waking up to the bullshit, and have had enough?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're pretty far off the mark here.  In my experience, the old (boomers and earlier), having lived the majority of their lives in the most prosperous time in modern history, are the last ones that seem to be clueing in to the rapidly changing reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ones just getting started in life are realizing that the world we're inheriting is an absolute wasteland, thanks to the boomers, who have sucked the wealth of their nations dry, and are still looking forward to their pensions and social security, which the younger generation will be funding.

       Being poor and robbed of opportunity has a way of accelerating one's awakening process.

       Thesis statement: You're wrong. You actually think the older generation is more informed about the world than the younger one? They aren't, they are the the ones who we now have to fight against because a large portion have been completely brainwashed by the history that has been narrated to them. See: Tea Party. Both can be completely ignorant, but only one grew up with the internet. For us young and impressionable, the internet is an extension of our minds, our rights, our virtues and our vices much more so than just as a metaphor. It's an extension of the human species.  For much of the older generation it isn't viewed this way at all. Which is why we have to fight these shitty laws now. The younger generation has a much easier time identifying the bullshit and relevant information to counter it, than the older one does. Fresh eyes and all of that.

       Many people seem to fear the global currency/ one world government idea but isn't it a logical progression? The masses will always hold the power of violent revolution over a central authority whether it is one govt or many. I tend to view the move towards a one world govt as a step towards increased space exploration and the scattering of the human race and our technology through the galaxy. Why should the world exist as a divided entity? Is that really better?

       The country had more debt at the end of WWII (as debt/gdp) than now and it was paid off quite fast at the end of the war. Theres no reason to say the current debt is impossible to pay off
