<p><strong>June 5, 2013</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order">NSA collecting phone records of millions of Verizon customers daily</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;..under the Obama administration the communication records of millions of US citizens are being collected indiscriminately and in bulk – regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>June 6, 2013</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data">Prism - NSA program taps into user data of Apple, Google, and others</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;..a 41-slide PowerPoint presentation – classified as top secret with no distribution to foreign allies – which was apparently used to train intelligence operatives on the capabilities of the program. The document claims &quot;collection directly from the servers&quot; of major US service providers.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-06/news/39784046_1_prism-nsa-u-s-servers">Prism - U.S., British intelligence mining data from 9 internet companies</a>.</p>

<p>The NSA and FBI &quot;..are tapping directly into the central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies, extracting audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents, and connection logs that enable analysts to track foreign targets..&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data">Microsoft handed NSA access to encrypted messages</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;Microsoft has collaborated closely with US intelligence services to allow users&#39; communications to be intercepted, including helping the National Security Agency to circumvent the company&#39;s own encryption.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>June 7, 2013</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/07/obama-china-targets-cyber-overseas">Obama orders US to draw up overseas target list for cyber-attacks</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;The directive also contemplates the possible use of cyber actions inside the US, though it specifies that no such domestic operations can be conducted without the prior order of the president, except in cases of emergency.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/obama-administration-nsa-verizon-records">Anger swells over NSA phone records court order relevations</a>.</p>

<p>Jameel Jaffer, ACLU, &quot;It is beyond Orwellian, and it provides further evidence of the extent to which basic democratic rights are being surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8F99BT8QAA">Video: Obama responds to NSA leaks, will only answer one question</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;you can&#39;t have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvienence&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;this does not apply to U.S. citizens or people living in the United States&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I will leave this office at some point - sometime in the next three and a half years&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;these things are very narrowly circumstribed, they&#39;re very focused and In the abstract, you can complain about big brother, and how this is a potential program run amok, but when you look at the details, I think we&#39;ve struck the right balance.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> I was not able to find an unedited full video of Obama&#39;s June 7, 2013 response to the NSA leaks. The New York Times edited out the end of Obama&#39;s press conference: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOgL1wkzx2Y">Obama returns to podium to answer an additional question</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/what.html">Google denies knowledge of Prism</a> </p>

<p>&quot;we provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law. Our legal team reviews each and every request, and frequently pushes back when requests are overly broad or don’t follow the correct process. Press reports that suggest that Google is providing open-ended access to our users’ data are false, period&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/08/nsa-boundless-informant-global-datamining">Boundless Informant: NSA&#39;s secret tool to track global surveillance data</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/08/nsa-prism-server-collection-facebook-google">NSA&#39;s Prism surveillance program: how it works and what it can do</a> (Guardian releases new Prism slide to explain its purpose). </p>

<p>&quot;The slide details different methods of data collection under the FISA Amendment Act of 2008 (which was renewed in December 2012). It clearly distinguishes Prism, which involves data collection from servers, as distinct from four different programs involving data collection from &quot;fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/07/google-facebook-prism-surveillance-program">Facebook and Google insist they did not know of Prism surveillance program</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;With their credibility about privacy issues in sharp focus, all the technology companies said to be involved in the program issued remarkably similar statements.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/08/obama-response-nsa-surveillance-democrats">Obama deflects criticism over NSA surveillence as Democrats sound alarm</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;when he criticised &quot;leaks&quot; and &quot;hype&quot; in the media, Obama tried to deflect criticism, saying internet privacy posed &quot;broad implications for our society&quot;. He said privacy concerns also related to private corporations, which he said collect more data than the federal government&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Why did you become a whistleblower? <strong>Answer</strong>: The NSA has built an infrastructure that allows it to intercept almost everything. With this capability, the vast majority of human communications are automatically ingested without targeting. If I wanted to see your emails or your wife&#39;s phone, all I have to do is use intercepts. I can get your emails, passwords, phone records, credit cards.</p>
