       As someone who got a degree in Sociology and then just lucked into a job at a small hedge fund doing investment research without any prior background in finance, I would say that this makes perfect sense based on everything I have learned in the last four years.

       I think part of it is definitely apathy. You're basically telling people that everything that they've believed in and everything they've been working their whole lives for is a complete sham. Most people find it impossible to accept this.

       Most people after a certain age will find it impossible to change with a system already bricked in to there minds. The young. Now those are the ones who are rebelling in any way they can. Be it criminally or econimically.

       I feel as if there is an oppostion. If there wasn't, then everything would be fine. People are suffering. Sooner or later something will happen, and they know. I can say with positivity that I am not bound by its profits nor their favors. So its possible, and people will soon realize a different world.

       If you seek education after high school then you can learn much about the financial world.  High school though is a different story.  I had ZERO financial education in high school, so I agree with you based on that experience, however in college and beyond, the level of knowledge you can obtain vastly depends on your drive to learn it.  No one can stop your thirst for knowledge after you are out of the public school system.

       I would agree. I just don't think, as bad as it may sound, that one should have to have enormous amounts of drive and personally seek out basic financial education. They have us for 13 years, you'd think they could find somewhere to fit it in amongst all the useless bullshit.

       My nephew is getting married very young, and expressed how affording a diamond ring will take time to get money for, without skipping a beat a cousin in her low 20s looked at him like he was ignorant and said "just buy it with a credit card".  When most of the room nodded with agreement, I knew instantly that something is terribly wrong with finance education, and a scary amount of the population are point in fact, financially retarded.
      </p>

       I'm not trying to toot my own horn, but I'm finding out I'm a rare person for my age.  By that I mean, by the age of 30, i paid off my college debt, bought 2 cars with cash, and put 20% downpayment towards a 140,000 home, (even though the bank said I qualified for a 300,000 home).  All this on less than 50k salary with no financial assistance from parents at any point, even during college, one time my dad handed me $10 for some gas, that's it.  Have people forgot how to save money, and stop blowing it on stupid shit?  If it was up to me I would have kept saving and bought a house with cash, but I'm having a son and the mortgage rates earlier this year were at a historic low so I went for it.  When I told the loan officer I plan to put down 20% for a conventional loan instead of an FHA loan, he asked me if I got it from a trust fund, he's so used to young people having no savings, that that was his first reaction.  Really fucking sad.

       American spending/financial culture is really fucked up. Unfortunately a lot of people are...kind of stupid and either cannot or just do not figure things out for themselves. A single class in say, one's senior year of high school would help this

       cut into...sales tax, income tax, credit card company profits, all kinds of business where people are overspending, excessive home loan, et cetera. Financial education would destroy the rich. Or at east vastly level the paying field.

       All you have to do is look at the ludicrous defence budget in America, which is a little under a trillion dollars a year. Imagine spending just a fraction of that on better facilities, teachers' salaries, and equipment. I was lucky enough to get a great education from my public school system, but many I fear are not so lucky. Hey at least we have oil and lithium on our batteries.

       That sounds state dependent. Illinois requires students to pass a federal and state constitution test in order to graduate, and these are normally taught as part of a civics or government class (typically in 12th grade).

       Don't be so general. During my freshman year of college we had an entire composition class that was based around 9/11. I had to write three different papers on it. Although, I didn't even know there was a WTC 7 until one year later, so you may have a point.

       I am currently in my second year of getting a degree in economics and have been amazed by how basic and crucial the early classes are. This basic education, however, is what turned me into a "conspiracy theorist". How is it that the majority of high school grad don't know how the Fed functions. It would literally take less than an hour to explain the process. This explanation completely changed the way I look at the financial system. Your claim makes perfect sense to me.

       There's always been a lack of education about practical investing and money management in the schools. We have classes on how to bake cakes and how to throw balls through metal hoops, but not on how to buy mutual funds. It makes no sense.

       Makes me want to scream. It seems so basic and obvious, hence why I feel that some one or some thing is actively blocking it to protect their own interests. Financial education in all schools would be huge. At the moment the US population is dumbfounding financially ignorant. You really have to go out of your way to educate yourself.

       I was contacted to go to the local high school and spend a day going over financial literacy with the seniors.  ( one hour per group).  I even went over the theory that high student Loan debt kept graduates from focusing on what I retested them because they needed a job to repay the debt.  I credited Chomsky of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a good program they do in my state it's mainly geared against credit card sent and credit rating protection.  Of course that's one hour a year for a student... Which is woefully inadequate.

       Financial Education would be death blow to a lot of industries across the spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if people worked out total cost of an item. They might even put off buying something for months at a time instead of grabbing the plastic and "just going for it".
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if people worked out how much something actually costs by simply multiplying that low monthly payment over what 60 months now? That 500 dollar TV now costs 3000.00 ?!?!?
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine the devastation if people worked out how much those credit card interest payments are literally draining them dry? Why the credit card companies might lose billions and billions of dollars!
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine how much less of a home people might buy if they knew the total cost? People might just wait for years to put a huge down payment down and look at short fixed rates, that would devastate the mortgage lenders!
      </p>
      <p>
       What if they found out about depreciation on their brand new shiny vehicles versus just buying a used one? The auto companies would cry, they would weep over the loss in new car sales!
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if students worked out just how long and how much they will owe for student loans? They might just get a trade and be able to get by just fine!
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine the billions, maybe trillions in lost revenue if people actually started to save up to buy things instead of putting them on the old plastic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine the devastation of the richest families in the world if people just stopped doing a lot of really silly financial moves over their lifetime? What would happen if people had savings and the right insurance and even, god forbid - real retirement funds! Devastating it would be, just devastating...
