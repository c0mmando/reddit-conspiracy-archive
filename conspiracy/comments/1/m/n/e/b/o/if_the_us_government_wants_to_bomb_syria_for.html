    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s literally hundreds of reasons, not necessarily any best one.</p>

<p>The dancing Israelis is well documented, with a huge FBI report about the israelis that were there to document the event.</p>

<p>Also, the fact that the 9/11 commission was &quot;setup to fail&quot; according to those that served on it.</p>

<p>Also, the programmers that worked on the NIST simulations admitted that the numbers they used were false.</p>

<p>Testimony from firefighters hearing explosions in the basement of the WTC buildings.</p>

<p>Firefighters saying that they had all the fires out and were about to evacuate the operation when the towers fell.</p>

<p>Minor debris damage on the side of WTC 7 leading to total freefall collapse.</p>

<p>BBC announcing WTC 7 fell before it even fell (video evidence of this).</p>

<p>Pilots saying that the planes that hit the buildings were not of the same type as those that tookoff the runways at their respective airports.</p>

<p>Out of over one hundred pentagon cameras looking at that side of the building, we have less than 10 frames of video showing an object hitting the side of the pentagon. FBI and other services confiscated and classified all other video.</p>

<p>Pilots saying it would be impossible for them to manuever such a plane into the side of the pentagon, much less amatuer pilots that couldn&#39;t fly a cessna.</p>

<p>Military grade thermate in the debris of WTC 7</p>

<p>And of course the  most obvious issue, jet fuel doesn&#39;t melt steel. Even if it weakened it, it wouldn&#39;t lead to near freefall collapse (it was about 99% freefall speed). The whole &quot;pancake&quot; theory is totally unscientific, and those that worked for NIST admitted this.</p>

<p>NIST never considered explosives were used, and in the investigation, explosives use was never even investigated.</p>

<p>There was molten steel for days in the WTC rubble (office fires and jet fuel cannot melt steel), and firefighter testimony confirms this.</p>

<p>I could go on and on and on, but you get the idea. There are thousands of experts from around the world that believe that 9/11 was a scientific impossibility according to how the government says it happened. Even those that worked on the comission and NIST have come forward and admitted this. </p>

<p>For everything I listed, you will find plenty of sites claiming to &quot;debunk&quot; such claims. However, these debunking sites often leave out key information.</p>

<p>For example, people will claim thermite couldn&#39;t have cut the steel columns because it burns too chaotically. Mythbusters put a bunch of thermite on the top of a car, and it only burned through the roof, not all the way through the floorboards. But this is because it was just randomly set there. It&#39;s like saying you can&#39;t make a bomb with gunpowder (or another similar explosive) if you just set a pile on the ground and throw a match on it. You can easily make a bomb, you just have to create the correct device.</p>

<p>Example of the kind of device(s) that brought down the WTC buildings (including building 7, which was pre wired for demolition, you would have to be a total moron to believe a bit of debris and office fires on the side of the building destroyed the entire thing, NIST engineers even admitted their model of wtc 7 collapsing was entirely fabricated).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;l repost what I just said to your other question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plenty of reasons.
Primarily, war to get rid of Israel&#39;s enemies, Afghanistan transitioning into Iraq on the fear of WMDs and TERRISTS. They wanted to get rid of Iraq first, but had to go to afghanistan first because thats where the scapegoat lived. Also, control of afghanistan geographically isolates Iran (Israel&#39;s main enemy).
Defense industry contracts worth trillions of dollars (cheney made many millions off haliburton contracts).
Increase of centralized government powers.
Creation of DHS.
Taking away civil liberties through the patriot act.
I could go on and on and on. If you honestly think your &quot;government&quot; works for you, then you haven&#39;t done much digging into the truth. You&#39;re a slave, doesnt matter if you make 20k or 200k. A mere peon to those that really own the country and much of the rest of the world. The rothschilds and other trillionares that own the central banks of the world.
When you have wars, and scare the population into giving up it&#39;s liberties, you can centralize and increase your power.
&quot;The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.&quot; - Herman Goring, Nazi founder of the Gestapo.</p>

<p>All despite the fact that members of his group never confirmed he died then, and why wouldn’t they?</p>

<p>He died in 2011, killed by SEALs, that is why his second in command Alman Zawahiri confirmed it, that is why Islamic Groups all over the world, from Al Shabaab, to the TTP, to Boko Haram, eulogised him as a hero after he died, in 2011. </p>

<p>Interesting you say that, as the exact opposite is true:</p>

<p>&quot;Pieczenik’s credibility is beyond reproach (bio). As well as serving under five US presidents, he wrote the book on psychological warfare and counter terrorism for the State Department, while also developing foundational strategies for hostage rescue that were later employed around the world. He also won two prestigious Harry C. Solomon Awards while studying at Harvard Medical School.</p>

<p>Pieczenik’s record underscores the fact that he is one of the most deeply connected men in intelligence circles over the past three decades plus. He was a top spymaster involved in all manner of black-ops, undercover missions and classified work.</p>

<p>Pieczenik’s assertion that Bin Laden has been dead for years is also backed up by a myriad of other intelligence professionals and heads of state, including Former CIA officer and hugely respected intelligence &amp; foreign policy expert Robert Baer, as well as former FBI counter-terror head Dale Watson, who have all gone on the record to state that Osama was dead long before the raid on his alleged Pakistani compound earlier this month.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the biggest myths about AQ out there. </p>

<p>There is literally no evidence for this. Present me with one shred of evidence AQ was created by the CIA?</p>

<p>Edit:After reading that, it seems there is just the one Dr Pieznick who believes he was dead. </p>

<p>I guess the CIA just has the one Dr. then, I mean it’s not like they have hundreds of Officials and ex-operatives who could confirm it, just one guy, and another guy who seems to have diagnosed him based upon pictures he has seen. </p>

<p>I do not see that as credible evidence. Also no one is beyond reproach, you already believe the Government is lying to you about these events, well this guy was a top Government employee for decades, and you automatically believe him because it fits a pre-conceived narrative. </p>

<p>Why would each gain to prove the other a liar? These guys are ACTORS ON THE CIA PAYROLL. Thats like saying one spy can undo another spy (working for the same people) by pointing out to the enemy that the other is a spy. That makes no sense.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not changing subjects at all, I am merely responding in turn to each of your statements/questions/assertions. </p>

<p>He did die in 2001 (after denying responsibility for 9/11) and they had to keep him alive to keep the myth of al qaeda and the threat of terrorism alive and well in the hearts of the american people in order to keep the war on terror going, and in order to rationalize more support for the invasion of Iraq after afghanistan was out of the way.</p>

<p>No, they weren&#39;t harboring anyone. The &quot;raid&quot; was a total farce. Of course, when it comes to sealing loose ends, people need to die. Hence why many seal team 6 members died a few months later in a helicopter shot down by the taliban, and more and more died in the years to come.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing to rationalize, it&#39;s all very straightforward. Intelligence experts, the taliban themselves, and plenty of newspapers (including the New York Times) said that bin laden died in 2001. This was of course ignored in the years to come when the CIA was popping up new fake Bin Ladens, but I digress.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t have to pay them anything. The taliban admitted he died in 2001. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>They did know, many people knew, Bin Laden was on dialysis and was in failing health in 2001, there is zero chance he would go on to live more than a few years at BEST. But again I digress. The intelligence experts, the Taliban, New York Times, and even Fox News said he all died in 2001. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is nothing circular whatsoever in pointing out that he died in 2001. The primary reason it&#39;s obvious he didn&#39;t die in 2006 or &quot;some time ago&quot; is because the taliban admitted he died in 2001, the intelligence experts believe he died in 2001, he was on dialysis so he couldn&#39;t possibly have lived for more than a few years, and finally, the Bin Laden videos released after 2001 were obvious fakes, as has been proven time and time again by analysis. </p>

<p>Of course it wasn&#39;t published in 2001, it was meant to bring about awareness to those that were not aware, that he died in 2001. The source information was from 2001.</p>

<p>Theres no reason to think otherwise, particularly globalresearch.ca </p>

<p>It is labeled so because they could not independently confirm he was dead, mere &quot;sources&quot; in afghanistan and pakistan said he was.</p>

<p>Argumenting from the absurd. This is also an example of the continual lack of acceptance that America is, and always has been, vulnerable to attack. You&#39;ve just been fortunate so far.</p>

<p>The only reason this didn&#39;t occur in the past is because any country openly attacking the US would get flattened.

<p>Do you realise there are training camps in the FATA region of Pakistan? In the Yemen and Chechnya, and previously in Afghanistan? Not caves, sophisticated military camps with trainers provided by the Pakistani ISI and Iranian Quds force who teach modern military techniques and guerilla warfare.</p>

<p>As you stated America itself, during the Afghan-Soviet war, trained mujahideen in tactics and weapons systems, gave them stingers, and you still think they are cave-dwellers? It is not only stupid but reeks of ethnocentrism and racism. Islamic Militancy and it’s associated recruiting and operational networks around the world are well established and sophisticated operations, not run by ‘cave-dwellers’ who have nothing but sandals and Ak-47s, but who have laptops, satellite phones and various soviet weapon systems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FBI did the &#39;93 bombing.</p>

<p>&quot;In a call to an FBI agent shortly after the bombing Salem complained, “We was start already building the bomb, which is went off in the World Trade Center. It was built, uh, uh, uh, supervising, supervision from the Bureau [FBI] and the DA [district attorney] and we was all informed about it. And we know that the bomb start to be built. By who? By your confidential informant. What a wonderful great case. And then he ‘the FBI [supervisor]&#39; put his head in the sand and said, o no, no, no that&#39;s not true, he is a son of a bitch, okay.”</p>

<p>This is public record stuff, records from a court case.  Same thing with OKC, the emails where FBI agents like Eric Holder coordinated the coverup of FBI involvement are now released and available to anyone.</p>

<p>Domestic terrorist threats, to the extent that they are real, are an operation of the US Regime.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I do, however, doubt that Osama was stupid enough to think that attacking the U.S. directly wouldn&#39;t lead to even more encroachment and attacks by the United States. Especially</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is quite easy to find on a google search that OBL said many times that he believed he could destroy the united states by dragging them into unwinnable wars in the middle east, thus destroying their economy like what happened to the USSR after the Soviet-Afghan war. OBL believed that he and the mujahideen had themselves brought down the mighty Soviet Union, he believed they could do the same to the US. </p>

<p>There are quotes if you search of him saying this. He was a clever and cynical man, he knew Muslims would die from an American invasion of Middle Eastern countries, but he also knew this would rally the muslim umma in support of his cause. He WANTED an American invasion and America gave him his wish. It meant men flooded into his training camps and galvanised and unified a generation of Islamic Militants against the great enemy. 9/11 was a two-fold victory for OBL, he showed the world America can be struck at and attacked, and he got his wish of a war that America cannot win in any quantifiable way. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>He even denied all involvement on September 17th, 2001.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And he also went on later to claim credit and praise the attacks.</p>

<p>He talked many times about destroying America by dragging them into wars and bankrupting them. </p>

<p>In Islamic Militant history there is the concept of the ‘near enemy’ and the ‘far enemy’. The near enemy being states like Saudi Arabia, who while claiming to be Islamic allow infidels to occupy their holy sites. The far enemy are places like America and Europe who support these apostate countries. Traditionally, Islamic Militants concentrated on the near enemy, but Osama talked extensively about attacking the far enemy, America in particular, as a way of drawing the wider world into the conflict. Salafi Muslims believe they are at war. OBL saw his group as the vanguard that would inspire others to act. They learnt from the assassinations of ‘pseudo-Islamic’ leaders around the Middle East in the 60s, 70s, 80s, that one shocking catastrophic act that garnered the attention of the world could have more of an effect than a ten year war that no one paid attention to. Thus 9/11.</p>

<p>Just to get the balance look at some of the stuff OBL said in the past, forget 9/11, you will quickly see he hated America and the West and sought their destruction. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is downright false, and anyone that actually does their research knows this. But I won&#39;t bother to go into that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also have a hard time believing that some people in the government could have convinced a group of people to crash planes into the twin towers leading to their death and killing thousands of people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ever heard of MK ultra? Monarch? Do some research, the government has been into mind control for quite some time. But that&#39;s mostly irrelevant as they don&#39;t need to mind control anyone, all they had to do was take advantage of people with &quot;terrorist tendencies&quot; and manuever them into the proper situation to achieve the desired outcome. </p>

<p>Take for example every &quot;terrorist&quot; the fbi has caught in the past 10 years, every single one was a FBI plot where the FBI goaded men into becoming terrorists then busted them for attempted terrorism. Like that, except they actually go through with it, and instead of the FBI, it&#39;s CIA/Mossad.</p>

<p>I am not saying terrorists didn&#39;t run planes into buildings. I am saying the methods and reasoning for it was entirely different than what they are telling you.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s not like everyone in the government is in on it, all you need is a few high level agencies (mossad working hand in hand with CIA) and black ops types, and it&#39;s quite easy to get the job done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the best evidence is that which is widely recorded, hardest to falsify, and breaks the official story. This would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>The in-place collapse of WTC 7</li>
<li>The explosive collapses of WTC 1 and WTC 2</li>
<li>The reduction of WTC 1 and 2 to fine powder</li>
<li>The anthrax attacks following 9/11</li>
<li>The primary role of Saudi Arabians in the attacks</li>
<li>The role of the FBI in aiding the hijackers beforehand</li>
<li>The insider trading before the attacks</li>
<li>The lack of any aircraft debris for UA 93</li>
<li>The lack of any aircraft debris for AA 77</li>
<li>The passports that turned up magically</li>
</ul>

<p>Then we have more circumstantial evidence:</p>

<ul>
<li>The failure of every single defensive system in the country</li>
<li>The anomalous passenger lists on all four planes</li>
<li>The disappearance of $2.3 Trillion just before and the death of those investigating that in the Pentagon attacks</li>
<li>The loss of so many SEC investigations in the WTC 7 collapse</li>
<li>The rapid installation of the PATRIOT act, invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq</li>
<li>The rapid removal of all debris from the collapses</li>
<li>The presence of many burnt vehicles around the WTC collapses</li>
<li>The magic ability of mobile phones to work in high and fast flying aircraft</li>
<li>The dancing Israelis</li>
<li>The technical difficult of hitting WTC 1, WTC 2, and the Pentagon, for any pilot, let alone a learner</li>
<li>... lots more</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking at this, one has to conclude that at least:</p>

<ul>
<li>The majority of those claimed to be hijackers were not</li>
<li>There were perhaps four &quot;real&quot; hijackers, one per aircraft</li>
<li>Whatever hit WTC 1 and WTC 2 and the Pentagon, it was not the original aircraft, and not flown by humans at in the cockpit</li>
<li>Whatever brought down WTC 7, it was not office fires</li>
<li>Whatever brought down WTC 1 and 2, it was explosive and hot, and energetic enough to crush most of those towers to fine dust</li>
<li>There was knowledge about this beforehand</li>
<li>There was conspiracy to conduct, enable, or at least, allow the attacks</li>
</ul>

<p>At the time we still didn&#39;t believe our governments would lie to us systematically. Clinton lied about a blow job and almost got impeached. But since then we&#39;ve learned that lies are the norm, and that lives mean nothing when there is profit to be made.</p>

<p>Obviously 9/11 was a conspiracy. The question is, what is a simpler answer... that 20 guys pulled this off, and fooled the worlds #1 military state, despite constant surveillance from the CIA and FBI, and for no real motives we can see except &quot;we hate you&quot;, or that 9/11 was a necessary excuse to start a new war, reboot the Military Industrial complex, take about $5-6 Trillion out of the public purse, grab Iraq&#39;s oil, and keep playing the Big Game in the middle east...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good list.  My favorite piece of circumstantial evidence is absent, though:  PNAC</p>

<p>The fact that a neocon thinktank was calling out for a &quot;new Pearl Harbor&quot; in the late 1990&#39;s, only for one of their members to be the vice president a few years later when such an attack occurs, is beyond coincidence.  </p>

<p>And before anybody tries to discount circumstantial evidence as being insufficient, allow me to remind you that Timothy McVeigh was convicted largely on circumstantial evidence for his role in the OKC terrorist bombing.  Circumstantial evidence is still that: evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>War by Deception 2013 is a great documentary with good information and sources that does a good job of showing prior knowledge of the attacks on the part of US officials, and also gets into the Israeli connection, which not everyone seems to know about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK6VLFdWJ4I">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK6VLFdWJ4I</a></p>

<p>For others who still think it was all planes, terrorists, and Osama, I would say watch the 2011 Toronto Hearings on 9/11 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpiVv8tQdmY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpiVv8tQdmY</a>. There is SO much information presented (over 5 hours worth) that shows clearly that the 9/11 Commission report, which is the only &quot;official&quot; explanation I know to exist, is bullshit. Like it was designed to be bullshit. </p>

<p>I think enough solid information exists to prove the official story for 9/11 is false, and to assign culpability tentatively to a few parties within the US and Mossad. These are 2 great sources of info, but many more exist out there. Educate yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I do believe the US government wants to bomb Syria for attacking its own people <em>with chemical weapons</em>.  Syria has been in a civil war for years and we never wanted to intervene until the alleged use of chemical weapons by Assad as that is a violation of international law. (Except of course when we use white phosphorous or depleted uranium or napalm.. that&#39;s ok.  Oh, and it&#39;s ok when Israel uses weaponized white phosphorous and claims that they were using it as a smoke screen also).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plenty of reasons.</p>

<p>Primarily, war to get rid of Israel&#39;s enemies, Afghanistan transitioning into Iraq on the fear of WMDs and TERRISTS. They wanted to get rid of Iraq first, but had to go to afghanistan first because thats where the scapegoat lived. Also, control of afghanistan geographically isolates Iran (Israel&#39;s main enemy).</p>

<p>Defense industry contracts worth trillions of dollars (cheney made many millions off haliburton contracts).</p>

<p>Increase of centralized government powers.</p>

<p>Creation of DHS.</p>

<p>Taking away civil liberties through the patriot act.</p>

<p>I could go on and on and on. If you honestly think your &quot;government&quot; works for you, then you haven&#39;t done much digging into the truth. You&#39;re a slave, doesnt matter if you make 20k or 200k. A mere peon to those that really own the country and much of the rest of the world. The rothschilds and other trillionares that own the central banks of the world.</p>

<p>When you have wars, and scare the population into giving up it&#39;s liberties, you can centralize and increase your power. </p>

<p>&quot;The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.&quot; - Herman Goring, Nazi founder of the Gestapo.</p>

<p>Members of his group, of which he was the spiritual figurehead and ideologue, committed the attack.</p>

<p>As a salafi Muslim, Osama would never take credit for any act he would consider and act of God. </p>

<p>Also in later videos he did accept his group committed the attack.</p>

<p>Also, it is not unusual for groups to carry out terror attacks and deny responsibility or to never reveal who carried it out. Similar to the way Israel denies any attacks it is involved in. </p>

<p>Osama died in 2001 as confirmed by intelligence sources, later videos were obvious fakes, as confirmed by anyone that knows anything about video manipulation.</p>

<p>Well anything is possible, but truth speaks for itself. And the evidence is absolutely overwhelming for those that do enough digging. </p>

<p>Absolutely, but we aren&#39;t talking George bush himself, we are a highly sophisticated Mossad/CIA operation. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to convince a human being to kill themselves when you&#39;ve been practicing mind control methods for decades. Or just for religious reasons, look at suicide bombers in Palestine/Israel for example. </p>

<p>The Palestinian suicide bombings are an act of absolute despair because they are forced to live in refugee camps under Israeli military occupation and their voice isn&#39;t heard. 
And U.S. aid to Israel (which has killed thousands of Palestinians) is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYM9ZnWsnk">The Main Reason</a> the 9/11 arab suicide bombers crashed the planes into the towers. Not simply religious reasons as the Zionist media likes to tell you.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If Bin Laden died in 2001 then five actors who can hardly colaborate with thier allies managed to maintain the fiction even though each could gain from proving the other a liar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would each gain to prove the other a liar? These guys are ACTORS ON THE CIA PAYROLL. Thats like saying one spy can undo another spy (working for the same people) by pointing out to the enemy that the other is a spy. That makes no sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You keep changing the subject from &quot;he died in 2001&quot;, to &quot;look how convienient it would be for those who want to fuck things up if they pretended he lived to 2011!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not changing subjects at all, I am merely responding in turn to each of your statements/questions/assertions. </p>

<p>He did die in 2001 (after denying responsibility for 9/11) and they had to keep him alive to keep the myth of al qaeda and the threat of terrorism alive and well in the hearts of the american people in order to keep the war on terror going, and in order to rationalize more support for the invasion of Iraq after afghanistan was out of the way.</p>

<p>This really isn&#39;t that complicated to understand. </p>
