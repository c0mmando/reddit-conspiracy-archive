       I've recently found myself wondering whether or not the US is really an ally of Israel. It seems more likely that it is a front for another country's agenda. The actions of America do not seem to benefit the people, nor do they benefit the government a majority of the time. It seems more and more as if it is being used as an extremely powerful tool. Anyone care to pick my theory apart?

       Whether or not you agree with someone's post, it would do a great deal of service to your credibility and this sub's legitimacy to refrain from such language. Perhaps put forth an argument of your own reasoning or critique a previous claim, but please do so with civility and respect so that we may elevate the level of discussion here. Thanks!

       We have had threads about this in the past.   The mods reply was that they want a diverse open community.  We might want to resurrect discussion on this topic.  I feel like this is the go to spot when people just want to troll.

       I actually agree. America, to me seems like the bouncer/bodyguard type that will beat/kill/steal anything Israel tells us to. Plus, while the taxpayers here are bled dry for no real social benefit whatsoever, Israel gets billions and billions of US taxpayer money in military and economic aid. This is assuredly no accident. The Rothschilds were puppeteering a lot of their dubious plans with the Balfour Declaration and the Treaty of Versailles. They are essentially, the state sponsor that got Israel created and the plan was in the works long before WW2. Since the Rothschilds and criminal bankers are still in charge, we have become Israel's bitch, so to speak.

       From ptech wiki page
      </p>
      <p>
       "The indictments charge Ziade and Peterson with concealing PTech's relationship with and dealing in the assets of Yasin al-Qadi.[19]
      </p>
      <p>
       Qadi's listing as a terrorist was overturned by several European courts, and his name was removed from blacklists by Switzerland (2007),[20] the European Union (2008 and 2010),[21][22] and the United Kingdom (2008 and 2010).[23][24]
      </p>
      <p>
       On 13 September 2010, Yasin al-Qadi "succeeded in having dismissed in their entirety the civil claims brought against him in the United States on behalf of the families of the 9/11 victims."[25]
      </p>
      <p>
       On 5 October 2012, the UN Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against al-Qaeda granted Qadi's petition to be removed from its blacklist.[26][27]
      </p>
      <p>
       Very suspicious.

       Israel is part of the world Zionist organization's plan to colonize a part of the Middle East as a Jewish state, look up the history of the Zionist organization, The US supports it due to a powerful lobby that happens to also have interests that own the fed reserve.

       I guess I don't know what you mean by Aryan then, they were a tribe of indo-european speakers from around 2500BC? If you aren't talking about modern white indo-europeans I'm not sure, whatever. I guess I'm racist. But it seems to me many nordic countries and slavic countries generally fit the bill of being almost totally white and indo-European speaking.

       I like you too and to be honest I'm not really sure what we started arguing about since my comments thread only goes back 4 comments and I'm to lazy to go back to the "rest of the comments", so you might be half right about the cylinders.

       Some great ally we have there,  huh?  It sickens me really.  I'm most disappointed in the baby boomer generation.  They think they are sooo fundamentally conservative going with the neo-con GOP party line bullshit. How can a group of so people so important to a countries greatness, be so seemingly blind and uninterested to what is happening around them?  Unfortunatley I belive the answer lies in comfort...don't rock the boat baby.
       <br/>
       Why does all of the United States dubious international policy only make sense when you insert the advantages it brings to Israel?  Why are there dual Israeli/American citizens in such crucially important appointed positions in the federal government?  Do people still believe a two-party system still works in American government and that it matters who the president is?

       Rather than Israel per se, I think it is rich, European (ie light skin color), largely English speaking, people. The 1%. Primarily the UK, but also Western Europe, and the Jewish banking establishment. These interlocking groups are the people whose profits our sons and daughters die for.

       Thank you all for proof of a theory that I had established in my own mind separate from these articles. I feel relieved, if that is even possible given the subject, that people have came to this same conclusion on their own. We will stop this soon. Just be willing to stand up when the call comes. Thank you all for waking up.

       No state controls another state. Countries don't exist for the true power brokers of the world. Countries and governments are just one more way to cause division between the people of the world to better control all that is going on. If we realized that we could work together as a world and put aside our petty differences we could do away with the facade of patriotism and create heaven on earth (for lack of a better term). But we like our simple us vs them paradigm and it's unlikely we'll break free of that line of thinking anytime soon. Least that's how I see it.

      <p>
       Edit: love the downvotes with no responses as to why you people might disagree...
      </p>
      <p>
       edit2: I still don't get the downvotes. Are people disagreeing with the working together part, or the part where I claim that countries don't exist for the true power brokers of the world? It seems a lot of people disagree with something in what I said, I'd be more than interested to find out what it so controversial.

       To an extent, you are right. At this point, all the major countries seem to be firmly under the country of the banking elite, making US little more than a valuable chess piece. However, if you think for one second that creating a one world government is the solution to all of this, you may want to think again.
      </p>
      <p>
       A one world democratic government is a government where 51% can buttfuck the other 49% and there's no where to run, no other option. I don't know about you, but I like having options. Imagine a one world democratic government that is just as corrupt as the "one nation (of many states) government" of the US. Would you really like to have no where to run, should the US continue down this path of rights erosion, secret police, full surveillance, etc - only on a global scale? Where are you going to run to - MARS?!
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the next step and say: well, I don't do anything wrong, so I have nothing to worry about. Yeah, till they do something stupid like: outlaw eating pizza. Then you're fucked, because I don't know about you, but I like pizza and the idea of having my living room xbox cam activated to see that I'm eating pizza followed by a drone flying out of the sky to scoop you up to slave wage privatized prison... you get where this is going. And in a one world govt. it's one size fit all, lobby your ass off oppression - with no way out.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is exactly what they want, is a sleek system that churns out zombies to fuel their quest for endless domination and conquest. Time to stop buying in to the NWO rhetoric of the One World One Nation One Currency One Religion bullshit.

       If you want to put that spin on the system that would dominate over our current model then whatever man. I wasn't describing anything of the sort. If you're referring to the whole heaven on earth thing that's a loaded term. For an Ancap, heaven on earth is a totally unfettered free market (to put it simply). So take from it what you will I suppose. I'm more leaving for an anarchistic solution than a communist. I agree with Bakunin that any form of hierarchical government is going to eventually fall prey to corruption. I appreciate you telling me why though.

       Yes... Strange that two sentences taken completely out of context might seem contradictory. With your first quote I was referring to all of humanity in general and in the second I was addressing specifically people who were down voting the comment without any discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really appreciate the posts you make and the comments you contribute and I'm surprised by your dismissive attitude of what I was trying to say. It's too bad people took it so wrongly and didn't bother to engage and understand what I was trying to say. Perhaps we'd be more in agreement than they assumed if they had bothered to do more than hit the down arrow...

       yeah... it wasn't the best way to word that statement. I probably should have said something along the lines of, "Would anyone who has downvoted this comment care to engage in a discussion as to why you disagreed." But I was on my phone at work and yeah, it came across poorly.

       Not only that ... those in control of America have
       <em>
        deliberately
       </em>
       dismantled and destroyed America's industrial base. It wasn't an accident, it was done with full conscious knowledge of the result. If we get Jews out of power in America, the country will immediately began to restore itself and begin to regain its prosperity. It would happen overnight, as it did in Germany in the 1930s. Germany was on its knees, and Jews ran everything; Hitler came into power, removed the Jews, and immediately Germany became prosperous again. That's not anti-Semitic, that's
       <em>
        history

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Jews didn't run everything in Germany. They had a slightly larger representation in private business leaderships than in the overall population, which can be easily traced back to the fact that most of them lived in cities and saw education as a big value - something they learned from 19th century antisemitism.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Germany was on its knees due to a lot of factors, WWI being one of them, the world economic crisis another. This was not because Jews did anything to harm the country. Why should they? Most of them felt as germans first, jews second. This is why a part of the german Jews never tried to flee, they just couldn't understand why somebody would call them un-german. The men even fought in WWI.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Germany didn't prosper because the Jews were gone. It prospered because it relied heavily on state-driven economy policies which were planned with money Germany didn't have at that moment. This is why Germany
         <em>
          had
         </em>
         to attack Eastern Europe, because of
         <em>
          Lebensraum
         </em>
         and all the goods it could take from there.

       I don't know where you looked it up, but I'm pretty sure you didn't grab the best books. Because what you posted here isn't history, it's not based on facts and arguments, but on an opinion that is clearly antisemitism.

       If you're going to post a link trying to show the level of control that Israel has over the U.S., at least try and post something based on actual facts. This was nothing but an anti-semite rant full of generalizations and "estimates" but no real facts related to the United States. There are definite comparisons to pre-nazi Germany, but stating facts from 1920's Germany does nothing to prove Israeli control of the U.S. Besides that, Jews living in America, even if they are as dominant as this "article" claims, doesn't really have anything to do with Israel owning or not owning the U.S. Might as well say we are run by Kenya because we have a black president.

       Why does the leader of Israel draw such partisan support, when they President does not draw nearly as much support, let alone partisan?  Add to the fact Netanyahu disregarded and negated what Obama has stated previously, and you can begin to see where the loyalty lies.

        A year later, when Obama stated that the 1967 borders should be the starting point for renewed two-state negotiations—an American position for more than a generation—Netanyahu delivered what Beinart describes as “one of the most extraordinary humiliations of a president by a foreign leader in American history.” Fresh from speaking at AIPAC’s annual conference, Netanyahu replied that there was no chance of Israel withdrawing to “indefensible lines.”

        I've recently found myself wondering whether or not the US is really an ally of Israel. It seems more likely that it is a front for another country's agenda. The actions of America do not seem to benefit the people, nor do they benefit the government a majority of the time. It seems more and more as if it is being used as an extremely powerful tool. Anyone care to pick my theory apart?

       What theory?
      </p>
      <p>
       That Israel controls the USA? You haven't offered any support for it other than "The actions of America do not seem to benefit the people, nor do they benefit the government a majority of the time"

       USA Support for Israel is pretty easy to explain actually
      </p>
      <p>
       1 They were our ally in the cold war. When Arab nations turned to the USSR, Israel simply because another pawn of the USA's vs communism.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 They are really the only functioning democracy in the middle east. Arabs (esp women) in Israel have more rights than any other middle eastern country
      </p>
      <p>
       3 Money for defense contractors. A lot of the aid the USA gives them is then just spent on American weapons. American weapons companies help fund political campaigns. The people they get elected then funnel USA tax payer money to them
      </p>
      <p>
       4 They're still the US's closest Ally in the region. The USA is basically buying their support (same with the aid given to Egypt)

       Dude... all day today I have been pondering "the wizard behind the curtain" in exactly those terms, and then I read this statement from you. Apparently it's gaining traction among the average nobodies...add me to the list.

       You are trying to talk to a zionist and probably a paid Israeli shill. Won't work.
