    <div class="md"><p>Stop feeding into the system and or parroting whatever you are told. Think critically. Raise awareness. Voting does have an effect, it&#39;s just limited. And more important than voting, is having someone that could be voted in. But given the amount of money to run for offices, even local offices, it&#39;s hard to find someone that isn&#39;t on some kind of payroll. Maybe it should be people like us, who are concerned with backroom deals, corporate governments, and a broken system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if I may.... just playing devil&#39;s advocate here....</p>

<p>If the game is as rigged as people think, and corrupt, etc, then what makes you sure it&#39;s inky two layers deep?
I mean, if I were orchestrating a global cabal, and using the R&#39;s and the D&#39;s as just a vehicle to achieve this cabal, why would I stop there? I&#39;d have the Green&#39;s in my camp, all &quot;Independent&quot; candidates, the Socialist party, etc. Why would I take the risk? I&#39;d let you Vite for anyone your little heart desires.... they&#39;d ALL be &quot;my team&quot;.</p>

<p>And you can &quot;vote em all out&quot; all you like, but you don&#39;t vote for Federal Reserve Chairmen, or Joint Chiefs, or CIA Directors, or NSA Directors, or .....
The people who are in power for 10-15-20 years at a time.</p>

<p>I mean, if I were &quot;them&quot; (whomever &quot;them&quot; is), I&#39;d have built a system over the decades that ensured you as an individual could have all the say you wanted, and it wouldn&#39;t make a lick of difference.

    <div class="md"><p>People don&#39;t like their bubble of cognitive dissonance to be burst.  Even in this sub, many persist in thinking that despite all the evidence to the contrary, voting somehow still works.  Most don&#39;t like to be told that the only way that something&#39;s going to get done is not if you try to vote someone else in to do it for you, but if YOU DO IT YOURSELF.  We all have to come together as one, but this takes a tremendous amount of self responsibility and initiative - initiative and responsibility that has been all but indoctrinated out of us.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t like to be reminded of the fact that NOTHING&#39;S ever going to get done until and unless we put all our stupid, petty problems aside and behind us, come together as one, and work together to solve things OURSELVES.</p>

<p>Well, being that Anarchy is NOT what most in this society think it is (i.e. a system that is &quot;necessarily chaotic&quot;, violent, and disruptive), but can in fact be extremely organized, effective, and successful (just without any overriding &quot;big brother&quot; state entity watching over everyone and, instead, with every individual having to be responsible enough to make sure and take care of themselves), I&#39;d say that Anarchy might not be a bad system at all actually.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  You said in one concise sentence what I wasn&#39;t even able to articulate as well in a mini-paragraph.  Well done.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think these could only work as local entities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think they could only work with a responsible constituency - whether local or national.  If the constituency were sufficiently responsible, hell, an Anarchic system could be global.</p>

<p>Me either honestly.  The effectiveness of really any system is ultimately dependent upon how it&#39;s practiced.  I&#39;d rather live in a fucking AWESOME dictatorship where the ruler is a rocking dude/dudette that always thinks about the people and puts them first rather than be in a &quot;Democracy&quot; that&#39;s been taken over by a shitty corporate government and turned into a practical hell hole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh that&#39;s so cute, you think the vote actually matters. By now you should realize there was no different between Romney/Obama, Bush/Kerry, etc. </p>

<p>A 3rd party system is worthless in the US because first-past-the-post voting will always result in two major parties. We need something closer to the Australian system where you have an alternative preference vote with instant runoff. Even with that system, they still elected Tony Abbott! Even so, the American system will never support a 3rd party (not since the Whigs anyway).</p>

<p>The US needs a new constitution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>American politics is like a mud puddle. You can pour all of the fresh &quot;water&quot;, read politicians, in that you like. You still have a mud puddle because of the behind the scenes bribery. the puddle needs an effective liner placed under it. </p>

<p>I have suggested many times how that might be done.</p>

<p>Basically you screen out those with psychopathic or greedy tendencies and then government officials will be eager to show they aren&#39;t among the super greedy who lack empathy or understanding.</p>

<p>The difference would be unbelievable</p>

<p>We screen pedophiles out of positions at daycare centers.</p>

<p>We should screen people who are psychopaths or near that description out of positions where their proclivities could harm all of humanity.</p>

Voting won&#39;t work, protesting won&#39;t work either. They are 100 steps ahead of us. Good old fashioned revolution won&#39;t work. At best we might get it back temporarily through a revolution, but they will already have their people ready to pounce on any available opening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vote one out, another comes in. The same people control the stream of candidates. Nobody becomes a serious candidate without the approval and support of the wealthy Jews. They control the elections. If somebody runs they don&#39;t like (such as Ron Paul), that person is completely ignored in the press, or if necessary, attacked and mocked, and never has a chance. Most of the money comes from the wealthy Jews, so those they don&#39;t like don&#39;t get campaign contributions. The best people are afraid to work for their campaigns for fear their careers will be destroyed. The Jews have the entire election system locked up.</p>
