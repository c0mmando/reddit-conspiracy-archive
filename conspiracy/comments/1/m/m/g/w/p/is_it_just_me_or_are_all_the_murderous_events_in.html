    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s something you have to consider: murders happen every day, all over the world.  In the US, 40 people are murdered every day.  Violent crimes occur every <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/crime-clock">25.3 seconds</a>.  Normally, when bad shit happens, people try and sweep it under the rug so they can move on.  You know why these events are so suspicious?  Because every media outlet reports on these tiny, seemingly insignificant evens that happen every single day.  The media is told what to report on.  True journalism is dead.  Any time you see an event like this happen that is broadcast so extensively in the media, it means there&#39;s some sort of agenda being pushed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are several layers to this.  The Syria situation is not being discussed these past few days even though there was a relevant executive order put through to arm the rebels.  The gun control debate is back, now with military backing because he attacked a base.  The &quot;mental health&quot; issue is getting pushed as well.  Remember communists used mental health as a reason to send people to the gulag.  Oppositional Defiance Disorder is considered a mental health issue and following &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; is a symptom of this disorder.  This is a propaganda campaign in the purest sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see a lot of people declaring all these events MK Ultra false flags and I get the reasoning behind it, but if the government had the power to control people to utilize them as assassins so they could advance their agenda why wouldn&#39;t they just have a day where 10-15 different controlled shooters go to malls/walmarts/grocery stores in rural areas where people would never expect something like this to happen and open fire on those crowds?  If people felt like they were targets anywhere they went (even in small towns nobody ever heard of) they&#39;d be putty in the government&#39;s hands.  The DC sniper had this kind of effect on people in that area and nobody really claimed that was part of any larger conspiracy.</p>

<p>As far as the most recent one, we have proof that this shooting was announced in the news the day before it actually happened, much like BBC saying building 7 collapsed before it actually did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen that and I&#39;ve read that the reason for this is similar to the reason that there were Sandy Hook facebook pages that were predated.  The pages themselves were created under a different name before the event took place and then the person just changed the content of the page to be what it became but the date it was created remained the date prior to the event. (People have made youtube videos demonstrating how this happens).  But if they organized a mass shooting event (which would basically enable them to advance a large part of their control agenda overnight) like I described using these MK Ultra assassins how would it be suspicious?  If anything it&#39;d seem like terrorism to the majority of Americans.  Probably about 95% of the population never heard of MK Ultra and believe most of what they see on the news and (much like is the case during any major event) people who try to call it a conspiracy would be marginalized and made to look crazy. </p>

<p>The daily courier changed the content? This isn&#39;t wordpress it&#39;s an online canadian newspaper. </p>

<p>Because the more complicated and larger operation you make it, the higher the odds are that something goes wrong, and you can call them on their bullshit. The more complicated you make software, the more bugs there will be for example. If you keep things simple and easily organized, there is much less chance of something going significantly wrong. </p>

<p>Take 9/11 for example. A massive operation, and because of that, there are so many holes in the story that anyone that bothers to research it can point out easily that it&#39;s a false flag. When you have single shooter situations, it&#39;s more difficult to do that as their planning is more precise and they leave little room for error.</p>

<p>And look what it got them? TONS of people waking up that were asleep before. If they are going to launch a massive false flag in the future, it has to be nuclear or something massive enough to shut down the internet. Mass coordinated shootings blamed on terrorists aren&#39;t enough to do this, but they are enough to wake up more people. </p>

<p>No, it wasn&#39;t incompetence, it was quite intentional. The elite do this intentionally, making it obvious for those that want to do the digging what they have done. It&#39;s part of their code, they have to warn their victims what they are doing. Theres lots of literature on the internet about this.</p>

<p>You&#39;re really grasping at straws here. You can go back an edit an article, but no one (at least working for a newspaper) is going to DELETE their article from the day before, and edit the entire page in order to report breaking news. Who would do that? You would have to literally have downs syndrome or be mentally challenged. In what actual real world scenario would that happen?</p>

<p>Even if this was a possibility, the screengrab and google confirms the article was posted with all of that information, on the 15th. There is no way around this conclusion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that the article is time stamped for 11:30pm on Sunday September 15.  What I am thinking could have happened was that someone was working on an article for the next day (because it is very unlikely that even an online newspaper is going to release new news at 11:30 on a Sunday night so it is fair to assume that the article was meant for the Monday morning posting).  They opened their page and began writing whatever bullshit article they were gonna do and saved it.  Then in the morning they get contacted that there is a shooting in progress (News agencies get this info before the public so they&#39;d know almost as soon as it begins) so rather than continue with whatever article they were going to use, this person deleted that story and began with the new story about the shooting.  He had already created the page and saved it so the Sunday September 15 11:30pm is still there but now the content has been changed.  That doesn&#39;t seem very far fetched to me.  The article even has a picture attached to it from the day of the shooting so at least that part would have had to been added after the shooting took place so why couldn&#39;t the whole thing have been after the shooting took place?</p>

<p>AP reported it on the 15th. As this website (found with google search) shows:</p>

<p>And that doesn&#39;t send up any red flags for you? Surely you&#39;re joking. These people claimed to be family members/witnesses and they are seen joking around before being interviewed immediately after a tragic shooting. Especially the sandy hook father. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Did they see their daughter buried? Every single family was escorted by FBI agents and every funeral was a closed casket. There is zero proof anyone died (although the children did disappear, probably sold into sex slavery, a favorite of the elite).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that the actors are just used as a front for &quot;grass roots&quot; calls for legislation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re contradicting yourself. You claim that it isn&#39;t a false flag, but the witnesses themselves are actors and you admit that. Which one it is? Fake witnesses that just happened to be on the scene at a real shooting and just jumped right in (what are the odds of that) or was it actually a false flag?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Isn&#39;t it obvious? Feinstein and Obama are calling for more gun control as soon as it happened, along with other politicians. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s an AR-15 or a semi auto pistol, they will call for more gun control. Surely you can&#39;t be serious as to questioning the point of this false flag?</p>

It&#39;s certainly not gonna happen after this if it didn&#39;t happen after little kids were murdered at their school.  A shooting at a military facility certainly won&#39;t create the sort of public outcry needed for any sort of gun control to get passed.  If they want people to demand gun control they would have picked a public space for the shooting I would think.  Not a private military facility.  And I did go to that site.  I&#39;m looking for more research about how this could have happened.  So far the only explanation I&#39;m seeing is computer glitch but that seems a bit too convenient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep claiming its a glitch, yet there is no evidence for this whatsoever. It is merely a convenient assumption on your part.</p>

<p>Most of the evidence points towards this being posted on the 15th, not getting the date wrong or glitching.</p>

<p>And if it were a &quot;glitch&quot; then its a hell of a coincidence that all of google archives conveniently glitched out in unison, along with the AP posting the date incorrectly.</p>

<p>The odds of that are simply astronomical. </p>

<p>This sums it up nicely:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NONE OF THE OTHER VANCOUVER PAPERS GOT THE TIME STAMP ON GOOGLE A DAY EARLY. WHY WAS KEYLOWNA THE ONLY ONE? CHECK MATE 3. on top of that, IT WAS INDEXED WAY TOO EARLY, FAR TOO EARLY FOR ANY GMT ERROR TO CAUSE SUCH AN ANOMALY. 14 hours after the &quot;shooting&quot;, Google was saying the article was two days old. If it was a GMT error, and one did indeed exist, Google would have said it happened 1 day ago on the day of the shooting, not 2. And when google puts it&#39;s time stamp, the current day is listed in hours - 4 hours a go, 12 hours ago, and only after it rolls past a certain number of hours does it say 1 day ago. So the GMT time error would only make it 1 day, NOT TWO. CHECK MATE FOUR. NAILED YOU A FOURTH TIME, WHICH IN JUDAISM IS THE FINAL CHANCE not that it was necessary because the exif data in the photos PROVE THE DATE ANYWAY. The Google time stamp error in fact has Keylowna posting the article on the 14th, a double disaster for the debunking shills.</p>

<ol>
<li>Glitch/hacked google archives (pretty much impossible unless you&#39;re google or the NSA)</li>

<p>There is no other scenario possible, because the screengrab proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that the article was posted on the 15th.</p>

<p>You say I made up my mind out of the gates, but after considerable research into the topic, and me linking you all kinds of information, you still seem to think that a glitch is more likely (NSA/google being hacked) than it being a false flag and actually being posted the day before?</p>

<p>It is untrue that it doesn&#39;t come up on the 16th, because it does. But it also comes up on the 15th. This is because AP had the story written in advance, and the small town of kelowan just auto feeds AP and didnt bother to check the story. This is how it was released on the 15th. Google doesn&#39;t lie, that page with that story was posted on the 15th.

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. What if they buried him somewhere? The place would become like a shrine for his supporters. By throwing his body into the sea they remove that as a possibility.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why they came up with the &#39;buried at sea is permissible under some Islam traditions&#39; story. It sounds lame, because it is. They didn&#39;t do it for that reason. They just didn&#39;t want the guy to have a physical grave. Makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there is anything to it, it&#39;s just getting to be too... convenient with the timing for me to continue to dismiss it as coincidence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost too horrible to contemplate. If it ever came to light that there <em>is</em> in fact a conspiracy behind this? Well I can&#39;t think of a faster way to start a violent revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, so if mass murders are about some kind of secretive agenda, then what was the agenda behind the Breivik murders?

    <div class="md"><p>Anders Brevik sent out a 1000 page manifesto. If you want to know why I suggest you find that and read it. He is the exception and not the rule. He was highly intelligent and as far as I&#39;m aware didn&#39;t take any psychiatric drugs like 99% of american mass-murderers. There is a massive correlation between psychiatric drugs and mass murders I have no idea why it isn&#39;t being investigated, the amount of mass shooters who have taken psychiatric drugs is so massive you&#39;d have to wonder how fucking blind people can be. To name but a few events: Batman, Newton, Navy Harbour all had taken psychiatric drugs. If you look into other cases they are also present.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So of the millions of people taking psychiatric drugs, a tiny fraction of them become mass killers (some after stopping their medication) and to you this is a correlation.  Somehow the 1 out of a million people who take psychiatric drugs and become mass murderers is enough for you to believe that there is some kind of connection?  This is around 0.000001%.  </p>

<p>I wish I lived in your life, where 0.000001% was enough to convince me of something, everything would be so simple, so easy, so understandable.  I wouldn&#39;t need evidence, science, logic, intelligence or reason, I could simply believe that 1 in a million was enough evidence to prove something to me.  I could flip a coin a million times, and if it landed on it&#39;s edge, I would say that when flipped, coins will land on their edges.  I could take a sip of ocean water and say that I basically drank the ocean.  </p>

<p>Please tell me more things that have a 0.000001% chance of happening that you believe &quot;proves&quot; something, I would really love to hear what kind of other ridiculous beliefs you hold with this system of fallacy in place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes actually. Some drugs have drastic effects on a small percentage of users. Even a bad effect of say 1% would have a huge effect on the populous if a million people took it. Read some labels, some say they have suicidal thoughts affect a small percentage of users, often though such warnings are not even put there. In drug trials, when they sample drugs they may not use a large enough sample size and if they do if some people sampling commit suicide they may be ignored and thought to have died of some other factor, not the drug.</p>

<p>The human mind is a complicated thing and mental illnesses affect everyone differently and to a different extent. We should not be messing with it. Not everyone will have the mixture neded for such violence, these drugs with the addition of heavy video gaming, interest in gore, hate of other people or want of fame  can push some over the edge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said, the fact that you are using the 1 in 1,000,000 chance that a person on anti-psychotics will be a mass murderer, and that this is somehow viable reasoning for your anti-drug tirade is ridiculous.  Many schizophrenics require anti-psychotics in order to be functioning members of society, and you want to take this away from them because of the 0.000001% that the medication doesn&#39;t work for?  What is your educational background that allows you to make such determinations?  Have you participated in any anti-psychotic drug studies?  </p>

<p>Please also direct me to <strong>peer reviewed</strong> sources which state that anti-psychotics have &quot;pushed people over the edge&quot; rather than the fact that the are actually mentally ill.  It&#39;s quite an interesting claim and I would like to see it supported by actual documentation, and not just take your word for it.  What you are saying has vast consequences for the other 99.99999% of people who are on anti-psychotics, so I&#39;d like to see the evidence you have collected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be. But I wonder why for decades and decades Americans had guns of all kinds - in a more free manner than the last fifty years, mind you - yet incidents like this were rare (if they ever happened at all).</p>

<p>Ask any American man over sixty what it was like to be a ten-year-old back then. Ask them what would happen if they were to have carried a BB gun or a .22 rifle down the street. (Spoiler: nothing would happen, because it was <em>normal</em>.)</p>

<p>Most likely, you&#39;ll get a description of a society in which kids indeed had access to guns (gasp!) and in which it was totally acceptable for them to do things like carry their guns into the woods to shoot squirrels with their friends. You&#39;ll hear about a long-ago America in which anyone could send off in the mail for a rifle and get it delivered to their home - with absolutely zero records or background checks run on them. Imagine such a place!</p>

<p>Was it a world of massacres, &quot;random&quot; violence, shootings at every opportune moment for the inevitable psychopaths that lurked everywhere? Nope. Was it a society of menace and chaos? Nope. Why? Was it a watchful government that clamped down on freedom in order to keep everyone safe? <em>No</em>.</p>

<p>What you witness is not gun control. Nor is it ultimately an anti-gun agenda. What it is, is <strong>people control</strong> and an anti-freedom agenda. Guns are one expression of freedom. <em>Free</em> people own guns.</p>

<p>&quot;Gun control&quot; is merely a means to an end. </p>

<p>By the way, never believe what you hear about guns (from the media or from the ruling elites). Think the rulers and the elites hate guns?? Think they have some sort of &quot;principles&quot; that cause them to detest weaponry? (They would have you believe it.)</p>

<p>But is their rhetoric <em>true</em>? <strong>No way!!</strong> Feinstein and the rest of them <em>love</em> guns. They <strong>love</strong> guns and want to have as many as possible. But they only want them for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be. But I wonder why for decades and decades Americans had guns of all kinds - in a more free manner than the last fifty years, mind you - yet incidents like this were rare (if they ever happened at all).</p>

<p>Ask any American man over sixty what it was like to be a ten-year-old back then. Ask them what would happen if they were to have carried a BB gun or a .22 rifle down the street. (Spoiler: nothing would happen, because it was <em>normal</em>.)</p>

<p>Most likely, you&#39;ll get a description of a society in which kids indeed had access to guns (gasp!) and in which it was totally acceptable for them to do things like carry their guns into the woods to shoot squirrels with their friends. You&#39;ll hear about a long-ago America in which anyone could send off in the mail for a rifle and get it delivered to their home - with absolutely zero records or background checks run on them. Imagine such a place!</p>

<p>Was it a world of massacres, &quot;random&quot; violence, shootings at every opportune moment for the inevitable psychopaths that lurked everywhere? Nope. Was it a society of menace and chaos? Nope. Why? Was it a watchful government that clamped down on freedom in order to keep everyone safe? <em>No</em>.</p>

<p>What you witness is not gun control. Nor is it ultimately an anti-gun agenda. What it is, is <strong>people control</strong> and an anti-freedom agenda. Guns are one expression of freedom. <em>Free</em> people own guns.</p>

<p>&quot;Gun control&quot; is merely a means to an end. </p>

<p>By the way, never believe what you hear about guns (from the media or from the ruling elites). Think the rulers and the elites hate guns?? Think they have some sort of &quot;principles&quot; that cause them to detest weaponry? (They would have you believe it.)</p>

<p>But is their rhetoric <em>true</em>? <strong>No way!!</strong> Feinstein and the rest of them <em>love</em> guns. They <strong>love</strong> guns and want to have as many as possible. But they only want them for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt that there are people brought in to speak to the press and pretend like they were part of the actual event but I know that at Sandy Hook children were actually killed (I&#39;ve seen people say that the whole thing was a hoax and nobody even really died).  My aunt and uncle are good friends with a family that lost their daughter.  I think that the actors are just used as a front for &quot;grass roots&quot; calls for legislation.  As far as this Navy Yard shooting goes though if it was a hoax to advance some agenda what agenda is that?  The media has reported that they were wrong about the use of an AR-15 so semi auto rifles aren&#39;t a factor.  Nobody really thinks that any gun laws are gonna be changed over this.  The most reporting I&#39;ve heard is about how Alexis played violent video games.  That seems like a pretty unimportant target.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point isn&#39;t one shooting requires gun control. It&#39;s general long term influence of the population.</p>

<p>Obviously you didn&#39;t comprehend the meaning of the article posted on jimstone&#39;s site. It&#39;s not a computer glitch whatsoever, that much is clear. The article was without a doubt posted before the shooting.</p>
