    <div class="md"><p>Well the first and foremost thing a police officer is sworn to do is to keep law and order, no matter what. A soldier is sworn to uphold the constitution, no matter what. So there&#39;s a big conflict of interest between those two groups if it were to come to that. However not all officers would turn on the people just like not all soldiers wouldn&#39;t turn on the people. </p>

<p>Afterall, we are all human.</p>

<p>Basically: Cops are far more likely to be govt loyalists and soldiers are far more likely to be against the govt for the sake of the constitution if it is indeed violated, if it ever boiled down to a second civil war and whatever the situation may be.</p>

<p>a cop in ft. lauderdale is going to arrest the guy selling crack, and is going to arrest the guy speeding. thats just the way it is. again, most cops are psychopaths, but of course there are lot of them.</p>

<p>how about the NY cop that was guna eat a chick. we&#39;ve both seen the videos of the pigs beating defenseless people... and we both know that they dont hire people with too high of an IQ.</p>

<p>the super villains henchmen are not cops. their henchmen are the corporate elite/lower level people/policy-makers.    cops, there just hired muscle, more or less. do i respect people like Sen. Graham, McCain, McConnell, Reid? no. of course not. </p>

<p>do police know about all the bullshit laws... . idk, is it their job to enforce them? yes. why attack the messenger?</p>

<p>and, do all police murderer and torture people for a living? no.</p>

<p>whose worse. the men who enlist to serve the community, or the men who enlist to kill people legally (soldiers). il choose the latter. but... soldiers defend the constitution, and cops defend the law.</p>

<p>As an institution, when a police officer <em>does</em> attempt to out those &quot;bad apples&quot; or report on illegal acts by their departments, they face dire consequences.</p>

<p>Here are two recent examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://gawker.com/5892115/nypd-officer-sent-to-psych-ward-by-superiors-after-reporting-corruption">Adrian Schoolcraft sent to a psych ward and locked up for following procedure and reporting upwards</a></p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>the vast majority of cops are good people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you would call someone who sees their peers or coworkers committing crimes, violating civil rights, using violence indiscriminately and does not report it &quot;good&quot;, I don&#39;t want to know you.</p>

<p>To address an item you stated in other parts of this thread:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well the first and foremost thing a police officer is sworn to do is to keep law and order, no matter what.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, the first thing a <em>sworn</em> Law Enforcement Officer is sworn to do is uphold the Constitution.  Secondly, they are sworn uphold the laws of their jurisdiction.  What many people don&#39;t realize is there are a vast number of unsworn LEOs - most sheriff&#39;s deputies in most states, TSA officers, and others.  They are simply hired thugs who do not have a sworn duty to uphold the Constitution - they only need to follow orders.  If their orders are unConstitutional or illegal, it is the responsibility of whomever gave those orders.</p>

<p>Take a look back at Occupy - how many peoples&#39; civil and Constitutional  and Human rights were violated?  How many of the sworn LEOs who violated their oaths were held accountable for that?  How many sworn LEOs reported their peers or superiors&#39; violations of civil or Constitutional or Human rights?  </p>

<p>Now, after thinking about the above 3 questions, do you think any differently that the problem is just a &quot;few bad apples&quot;?  If so, why do you feel that those who do not report the crimes of their peers - especially when in such a trusted position - are not equally &quot;bad apples&quot; ?</p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly certain I explained exactly <em>why</em> the majority of police are not decent human beings or good people.  <strong>Good people</strong> don&#39;t lie for people who violate their sworn duty to uphold the highest of the laws of our land.  <strong>Good people</strong> don&#39;t stand by while their peers commit murder.  <strong>Good people</strong> conscientiously refuse to participate in systematic and institutionalized racism.  <strong>Good people</strong> do not abuse their authority for brief personal gain - and <strong>good people</strong> do not stand by silently while someone else abuses their authority for brief personal gain.</p>

<p>Now as a retired Marine. I&#39;m not saying all will follow orders. However the military specializes in breaking you down and building you up. Both mentally and physically. That includes conditioning to follow orders. Many youth are easily conditioned to do such.</p>

<p>Now over time veterans through maturity in age and experince begin to lose that condition of blindly doing things, and begin to question, and make wiser decisions. However fresh out of boot. Many are geared to just react to the command due to lack of maturity.  They look to leadership for guidance. If what you face is the fresh faces then yeah they will fire on you. Because they will look at the commander in charge for leadership.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it would depend on <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> the revolution was carried out, too? If a bunch of people armed themselves and then started blowing up hospitals, attacking the grid, and generally harming everyone around them indiscriminately because they wanted to set up some sort of fascist regime (instead of attempting a legitimate coup with some well-loved military leader like a proper fascist plot...) then I&#39;m sure the average person in uniform would fire on them no problem. Hell, I&#39;m not sure that <em>I</em> wouldn&#39;t fire on them no problem.</p>

<p>edit: It would also probably depend on the success of propaganda, or the military-as-a-whole&#39;s perception of the rebellion. It&#39;s easier to dehumanize &quot;terrorists&quot; or &quot;wackos&quot; or &quot;insurgents,&quot; etc than it is to dehumanize &quot;a tired and oppressed population that, having exhausted all reasonable diplomatic and economic tactics, has no other choice but to take control of its government and social institutions by force.&quot;</p>

They want us to fire the first shot to justify their force. I don&#39;t know if you remember the Greece riots from a few years ago, they began because the police killed a boy, and the people had enough at that point, and they were unified in their dissent. The Boston Massacre is another good example. The military must side with the people, and in order for that to happen, they must be convinced to betray the elite, and in order for that to happen, the elite must use force first. </p>

<p>DHS and police and TSA and the rest of the alphabet soup is <em>not</em> the military. They are <em>told</em> they&#39;ve been fighting a war - on terrorism, on drugs, on piracy, on this on that... but the realities of war are so far removed from their understanding of life that it amounts to a delusion (which many of them readily accept), to think of themselves as &#39;warriors&#39; when their greatest victories are six of them beating up some granny over a traffic infraction or an unpaid mortgage.</p>

That is one reason why I doubt any of this would ever happen in this country, unless the general populace is disarmed first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s simple.logic. the vast majority of people in the military and police are right wing conservative types. They&#39;re not going to go after their own, never have and never will. In america it will be the &quot;socialists, leftists, hippies, minorities, immigrants&quot; and such that will be attacked like they have been since Reagan and Thatcher moved the west to the right wing along with the Murdoch empire and never let go. Look ok reddit, even young generations the 4channers etc are all basically nazis. The west is hurtling towards the far right</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You honestly think in their grand scheme they give a fuck if they detain a young black kid thats a democrat or a middle aged white accountant that&#39;s a republican? They want nothing but total control. The question is once they establish complete dominance is if they are still going to attempt hiding their intentions or simply come out and show that they won, take use quick means to vastly decrease global population (more than they are attempting now via &quot;chemical/nuclear accidents&quot;) and then they will truly be untouchable. No offense but don&#39;t live in this fantasy world where they care about money or regional dominance, they want to soak the planet in gas, light it up and sit and watch as us, the general population that isn&#39;t in there interest, die off.  </p>
