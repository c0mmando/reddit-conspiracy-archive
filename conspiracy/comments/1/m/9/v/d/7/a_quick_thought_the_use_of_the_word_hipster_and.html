        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a very young and pretty ill-conceived idea so please bear with me for a minute, i would love to start a discussion on this.</p>

<p>So first off it should be noted that in the 1980&#39;s and 1990&#39;s subcultures and countercultures were becoming increasingly violent, aggressive and political. Many subcultures were turning into legitimate social movements or rebirthing preexisting social and political movements, anarchism is a great example, the punk and thrash scene completely revived, strengthened and popularized anarchism, which was seemingly dead in the states by the 1950&#39;s. It sounds silly but without music the protest of the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 (battle in seattle) wouldn&#39;t have happened, this is but one example of direct action taking place as a direct result of music and in my opinion this was the last serious rise against authoritarian power, capitalism and globalization. Music is an insanely powerful device used for both good and evil, the elites took notice of the growing social activism stemming from the music of the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s, they also noticed music was creating extremely progressive and forward thinking subcultural movements amongst the youth of america at an alarming rate.</p>

<p>Hipster was a term used in the 1940&#39;s and it was more or less the same as calling someone bohemian, it was never used to bully or ridicule someone until the late 90&#39;s, in the coming years it was an extremely popular Buzz word amongst pretty much every main stream media outlet. Coincidentally i also noticed a huge push by the music industry to consolidate the music industry, entire music genres started to die in the late 1990&#39;s, artists were being payed to push and influence certain genres into a general style. A lot of talk about &quot;watering down&quot; the music industry was floating around in the early 2000&#39;s, well known record labels started dropping popular bands based on their musical genre. Major record labels and media conglomerates began purchasing major indie record labels, some of which they immediately shut down.</p>

<p>Around 2007 i personally started to notice the word &quot;hipster&quot; being thrown around as a control mechanism, if anyone did anything that could be considered odd or counterculture you were instantly labeled a hipster, it didn&#39;t matter which subculture you prescribed to. Anything contrary to the status quo was instantly laughed at and almost immediately followed by some vapid remark like &quot;fucking hipsters&quot;. Great example, i used to read Adbusters a lot and one day my friend was over playing video games and he looks over with a smirk on his face and says &quot;You and those hipster magazines&quot;.</p>

<p>Could the use of the word &quot;hipster&quot; as a control mechanism in combination with the death of indie genres really have a significant effect on subcultures and activism in america? I truthfully think so and i would love to hear everyones input on the subject. Also on this note everyone should really research the rap/hip hop industries relationship with the prison industrial complex...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely! It&#39;s the rhetoric of how media/advertising/social sites can almost have the Inception effect. Plant a seed in someones mind, and it permeates the rest of thought. It isn&#39;t just with the word &quot;hipster&quot;. Look at other examples- If you question the government, then you&#39;re an aluminum-foil conspiracy theorist. If you even remotely support nature then you are thrown in a category of tree-hugging hippies. These groups are groups that have been presented in such a negative way, that people will avoid displaying traits of said groups in order to avoid being associated with them. In other words, a very subtle, and influential way of controlling people.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome, thanks for posting this link, i was actually looking for a new book to read.</p>

<p>Aldous huxley briefly talks about LSD and it&#39;s positive/negative effects on subculture, social change and activism in his book &#39;The Doors of Perception&#39;, it&#39;s really quite an interesting subject but i personally wouldn&#39;t demonize the use of LSD. I would blame the death of the 1960&#39;s anti-war movement more on the rise of MSM, FBI/CIA assassinating social leaders and the FBI/CIA dismantling certain activist groups from the inside via undercover agents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would always get frustrated to the point of fighting when someone would refer to occupy protesters as &quot;jobless hipsters&quot;. I agree with you though, to me it almost felt like a single word destroyed the validity of an entire social movement. I remember being seriously speechless at some of my friends (former punk kids and metal heads) comments about the Occupy protesters in Zuccotti Park and the protesters who shut down the port of oakland, the thought of former Punk kids saying &quot;can the cops just beat and arrest these idiot hipsters already&quot; is proof enough for me that words are being manipulated to alter the general populations consciousness and way of thinking.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s such a shock to me, i worked in advertising for 5 years, if we can convince men to buy Axe body spray by exploiting their fears and insecurities imagine what the US government is capable of with an endless amount of money....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man.....just...sigh. </p>

<p>Ever think that hipster may just mean someone who dresses and acts in a certain modern, stylized way? Like having a neckbeard and dressing geek chic. Most of the people I meet that are labeled hipsters are not particularly bright in anyway. Average intelligence. </p>

<p>No offense but this just seems like a hipster circle jerk, when the same argument could be made for any sub culture like skaters or stoners or musicians. I have met people from all walks of life that stay informed and those that are blissfully ignorant. </p>

<p>I have never really heard hipster used to mock someone for making a political statement or being an activist. Even if it is used in that fashion, I don&#39;t really see it having any correlation with a decline in activism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post. Need to add COINTELPRO and their disinformation tactics (besides assassination, spying, unwarranted arrests). </p>

<p>One of Its objective was to delegitimize the Civil Rights movements and spread communist fears. Hippies and anti-war protestor labeled as &quot;addicts&quot; and &quot;anti-American&quot;. McCarthyism would serve as basis to arrest or pressure influential figures 
for their political views.</p>

<p>The change in the music industry and hence cultural was more defined in the mid 1990&#39;s with the end of the rock movement / counter-culture which by its very nature anti-consumerist/ establishment) to a more capitalist friendly (culturally and profitably); boys/girls bands followed by &quot;pop&quot; hip-hop and RnB (which shunned their predecessor&#39;s socioculturally tense lyrics). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do hipsters hate being called hipsters?  if you got a shitty life ruining tattoo just to be ironic, guess what you&#39;re a fucking hipster.  Also there is nothing Independent about Indie Music, we&#39;re talking about a genre a music with many bands having contracts to use in commercials before the songs are even written.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you even bother reading my post? Your diatribe has literally nothing to do with my post.. Also, the fact that tattoo culture is now synonymous with the word &quot;hipster&quot; further strengthens my point. Have tattoos, you&#39;re a hipster. </p>

<p>Have a mohawk, you&#39;re a hipster. Listen to punk, you&#39;re a hipster. Listen to metal, you&#39;re a hipster. Ride a bike, you&#39;re a hipster. Have a beard, you&#39;re a hipster. Have radical thoughts about society, you&#39;re a hipster. Think the government should take care of it&#39;s people, you&#39;re a hipster. Think a million middle easterns shouldn&#39;t die for the retribution of 2 thousand americans, you&#39;re a hipster. </p>

<p>The question in 2013 is what doesn&#39;t constitute as &quot;hipster&quot;? Wearing a northface jacket and nikes, driving a prius, living in a box, feeding on conagra GMO poison, blindly participating in our political system, Doing exactly what you&#39;re told, Supporting police brutality? If that&#39;s the opposite of being a hipster, please label me as a fucking hipster. The point of this post was to enable some kind of thought, not be a soap box for you to hate on people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sort of thing has always happened and has always gone through different phases. Before it was Hipsters, it was Emo. If you said anything that would be considered counter-culture or anarchist, you were called an Emo. </p>

<p>Before that, it was Goth. Before that, it was Nerd. Before that, it was Hippie. All the same thing. A &quot;character&quot; is created, so to speak, and the idea is to get as many people as possible to subscribe to that &quot;character&quot;, and of course, since that &quot;character&quot; is strange, you can lump people into that group and then they will be considered strange. </p>

<p>Just look at the term &quot;Conspiracy theorist&quot; or the phrase &quot;tinfoil hat&quot;. The second anyone brings either of those up, it&#39;s like a dogpile on the accused. It doesn&#39;t matter if the person actually subscribes to the &quot;character&quot; they have been accused of being, it will result in an immediate attack by the general public. </p>
