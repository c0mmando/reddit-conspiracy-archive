       Too vague. Let's start with your history class and go from there. What am I misinterpreting? If you have the "truth" to spread, it's gotta be mo' betta than "things aren't interpreted right" because you're telling me that you do? Or maybe you don't? And if you don't, why should I believe you that I'M the one doing it wrong? Or at least more wrong?

       That's pretty good, alright well you believe Assad did it when there is almost no proof he did. And the armed rebels would have more reason..(that's the topic we are on now)

       Current events! Now who are these armed rebels? Who trained them? Where did they get their weapons and what would their motivation be for doing such a thing? Do you really think they acted alone and didn't have a higher power supporting/directing them? What is your truth?

       They were armed by the US and there is videos and pictures of them beheading and killing people. They act alone because its s civil war with Assad and why would Assad do it when he's winning the civil war

       Just the US? There are photos and videos of
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       killing people. You can't say they act alone in the same statement where you say the US armed them. How do you know it's not Mossad? Wouldn't Israel be interested in pulling something like this off? And what about the bankers who fund all this crap? How do you know the Syrian rebels aren't just mercenaries (private security firms) doing things that the US and Israel don't want to get their hands dirty with? Hadja thought of that?

       Bring up the pipeline. This isn't about a civil war, it's money and oil. Go do your research and write a report for monday. I mean, not really, but as it stands you're just spitting out a slightly altered version of what the MSM was saying... and they never mentioned the pipeline.

       That's actually not entirely correct. What I'm trying to point you toward is someone is trying to build a new pipeline and the control of the oil to Europe would shift. We're not trying to take the oil, this time.

       You're cute. I like how you keep talking in terms of "sovereign" states like they matter or are "in charge". Could you define a "state" or "nation" for me?

       You have a better start than I had. At least you see through this bullshit at a young age. It wasn't until I was 30 that I started to give a fuck. Don't give up...find friends who care and stick with them. When I was in HS I was alone. Small town full of stupid fuckheads...but I eventually found comrades in the geeks and dweebies and the heads and the sluts! But I had to be their leader...no one was making the first move and they rejoiced when I did. And don't waste your time on useless arguments...brainwashed people will not learn or listen...but find those that do and find out HOW to talk to them and above all remember that we are human beings and we are all in this together. Hard on the problem, soft on the people. I will paraphrase Robin from Frank Miller's Dark Night Strikes back...."they are just brainwashed slaves of the enemy...we don't kill slaves." And remember what Ward Churchill said....schools are for consciousness building...the main purpose of our schools is to raise the consciousness of the students...not prep them for a lifetime of employment. Never give up. Never surrender! (that last one is from Galaxy Quest but it still applies!)

       Play the game. Just don't buy into it. Give the expected responses, just be sure you don't believe them. Tell the morons what they want to hear, and get your high marks for good robotic behavior, and then forget everything the cocksuckers tried to brainwash you with.
