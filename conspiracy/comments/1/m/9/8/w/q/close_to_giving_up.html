    <div class="md"><p>You have a better start than I had. At least you see through this bullshit at a young age. It wasn&#39;t until I was 30 that I started to give a fuck. Don&#39;t give up...find friends who care and stick with them. When I was in HS I was alone. Small town full of stupid fuckheads...but I eventually found comrades in the geeks and dweebies and the heads and the sluts! But I had to be their leader...no one was making the first move and they rejoiced when I did. And don&#39;t waste your time on useless arguments...brainwashed people will not learn or listen...but find those that do and find out HOW to talk to them and above all remember that we are human beings and we are all in this together. Hard on the problem, soft on the people. I will paraphrase Robin from Frank Miller&#39;s Dark Night Strikes back....&quot;they are just brainwashed slaves of the enemy...we don&#39;t kill slaves.&quot; And remember what Ward Churchill said....schools are for consciousness building...the main purpose of our schools is to raise the consciousness of the students...not prep them for a lifetime of employment. Never give up. Never surrender! (that last one is from Galaxy Quest but it still applies!)</p>
