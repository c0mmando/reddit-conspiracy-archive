        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Manson claims that the swastika on his forehead represents his fathers dying in WW2 for his rights, which were denied to him in the courtroom. During his trial, Manson could not call one witness, and when it came time to defend himself, the judge dismissed the entire jury so that they couldn&#39;t hear his testimony (which turns out to be true).</p>

<p>Furthermore he denies the entire Helter Skelter theory. According to him, the media perpetuated this myth to make him appear insane. He claims that his cause has always been for the environment and against corporations taking over America and in all of his interviews, he never claims that he was trying to start a race war. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxUw1jp1EZI">www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxUw1jp1EZI</a></p>

<p>This is the interview that convinced me that Manson isn&#39;t as insane as he&#39;s made out to be. Although during this period he has been locked up in solitary for 10+ years and was forced medication, he still seems pretty coherent and mentally stable. Finally he says he never ordered the killings and that his cause has always been for the environment and against wall-street.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I see is you trying to create a false stereotype about the community of r/conspiracy. Yes we always question the official narrative, but how does that mean we embrace anything. With understanding you will find that most of r/conspiracy does not &quot;embrace&quot; any one perspective out of habit. Once you can analyze all the spectrum of perspectives on a subject, then you can find the real truth from the full picture. The ability to entertain a perspective without committing to it is a vital part of critical thinking. </p>

<p>You&#39;re a fucking liar.</p>

<p>edit: Notice how in all those threads the consensus seems to be that Charles Manson was either a victim, a patsy, or a genius to be admired.</p>

<p>In fact, this is the only thread where he is loudly denounced and people are ridiculing the poster and you are saying we are all <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> trolls, so yes, the collective hivemind of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seems to swing towards the positive for manson.</p>

<p>I believe I said this: <strong>yes, the collective hivemind of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seems to swing towards the positive for manson.</strong> </p>

<p>All the available evidence shows that when the topic is brought up people tend to respond positively, and if they do feel negatively don&#39;t feel strongly enough to post about it, so the consensus on Charles Manson in this subreddit is positive unless you can provide evidence to the contrary?</p>

<p>Pretty much your rebuttal which you had to sleep on to come up with was &quot;NO BUT YOU&#39;RE STUPID!!! FUCK YOU!!!&quot; Come on now.</p>

<p>Your initial statement gives no indication that you are to any extent aware of that influencing element that exists <em>outside</em> of people like Manson and that have been shown to be as manipulative of others as they are immensely powerful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This thread is about Manson.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, as a result, also about those influences that he was also a part of - influences that, as I said above, have shown themselves to be ubiquitous in their power and manipulation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And by the way who do you think he worked for delivering children? The 99%?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You obviously have no understanding of things related to those realities detailed in docs like &quot;The Franklin Scandal&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;When not grilling guests, Snyder would often joke around with offstage crewmen, often breaking out in the distinctively hearty laugh that was the basis of Dan Aykroyd&#39;s impersonation of Snyder on Saturday Night Live (12 occasions, 1976–1979 and 1995).[5] Following a disastrous experiment with turning Tomorrow into a more typical talk show—renaming it Tomorrow Coast to Coast and adding a live audience and co-host Rona Barrett (all of which Snyder resented)—the show was canceled in 1982 to make way for the up-and-coming young comedian David Letterman.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that normal people can properly understand the motives of a psychopath. What gives them a thrill seems to be the act of manipulation or control of another person. If he can get one person to buy into his bullshit, in his mind anyhow, he&#39;s winning. </p>

<p>Considering he was arrested for it, and fled the country for decades to avoid prosecution, all of which was highly publicized, I&#39;d say the media did a shitty job of covering this up. You added &quot;which also turns out to be true&quot; as though people were seriously doubting this happened, and as though it wasn&#39;t enormous news at the time.</p>

<p>Has it occurred to you that when your only source is what Manson claims, perhaps it&#39;s best to take what he says with an enormous pillar of salt? I mean, the guy has plenty of reason to lie through his teeth.</p>
