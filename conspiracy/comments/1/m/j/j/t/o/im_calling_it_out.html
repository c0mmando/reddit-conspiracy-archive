<p>Are you talking about the Navy Yard shooting? Because people have jumped all over that. I am reluctant to call it a false flag just yet, but the postings today are swaying my opinion. I haven&#39;t really investigated it enough to know whether the flag is truly false. </p>

They don&#39;t release this sort of information until they are 100% sure and the families have all been notified.  All your other questions have all been answered.  This guy had a stolen ID but aside from that he worked for a contracting company and had clearance to be in that building (as well as other government buildings).  I did see plenty of witnesses crying and family members crying while trying to contact their loved ones who worked at the facility.  And as far as conflicting stories go, during the first few hours you are always going to hear conflicting stories because journalists don&#39;t do their jobs and instead they rush to present any information they receive because they want to be the first person to report things (and often what they are reporting ends up being wrong).</p>

Unfortunately I&#39;ve had some unpleasantries with that country which renders me unable to partake in any dealings with their financial institutes, but that&#39;s OK!  I&#39;ve come up with a better way.  I&#39;ve got these water tap filters.  They&#39;re top of the line.  Now what I&#39;m selling you isn&#39;t just the filters, but the ability to sell these filters to others (and when I say sell, you needta realize these things sell themselves).  So if you just go ahead and buy these sales subscriptions off me and sell them to others, they will sell them to others and that&#39;s how you&#39;ll make money.  (And somehow that all ties back to our original plan).</p>

<p>EDIT: OH NO! I&#39;ve just checked my little porcelain dog with the removable head and it seems my partner has stolen all of my money! If you could just advance me enough to purchase said water filtration taps...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An advance will be no problem at all.. so long as you are willing to travel for it. There&#39;s a big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is? There&#39;s one hayfield in particular. It&#39;s got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end. It&#39;s like something out of a Robert Frost poem. It&#39;s where I asked my wife to marry me. We went there for a picnic and made love under that oak and I asked and she said yes. Promise me, DwarvenPirate. If you want that advance... find that spot. At the base of that wall, you&#39;ll find a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield. Piece of black, volcanic glass. There&#39;s something buried under it I want you to have. It&#39;s your advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe if you use more question and exclamation marks, and throw in a few more misspellings and grammatical errors people will take you more seriously.</p>

<p>Do you seriously thinking that conflicting eyewitness accounts is a valid reason to be suspicious? Eyewitness accounts are <em>notoriously</em> unreliable, anyone who&#39;s taken first year psych can tell you that. Why would you assume that people&#39;s immediate reaction to a traumatic event would be to start crying? It often takes people several days to be fully hit by the emotional impact of something so intense.</p>

<p>This is the problem with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. The people here often tend to believe that whatever pre-conceived notions or assumptions they pull out of their asses <em>must</em> be exactly how everything works, they can&#39;t even bring themselves to consider the possibility that they aren&#39;t infallible experts on how the world works.</p>

<p>They also seem to be incapable of actually understanding how anyone could disagree with them, so they <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1mjjto/im_calling_it_out/cc9xo68">accuse them of being shills</a>, rather than formulating an intelligent argument... because clearly they&#39;re so important that the government would pay people to argue with them online.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear that no matter what the facts were, you&#39;d be crying false flag. You&#39;ve already made up your mind: all mass shootings are secretly carried out by the government to cover up whatever is going on at the moment. Nothing will change your mind.</p>
