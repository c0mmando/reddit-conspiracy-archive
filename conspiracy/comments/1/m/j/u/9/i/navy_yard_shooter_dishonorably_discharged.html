They&#39;re saying this guy was Dishonorably Discharged from the Navy, had several weapons convictions, yet somehow got a contractor job and held a SECRET clearance.</p>

<p>I ran this one by my ex-roommate, who was an OPM Background Investigator, just to make sure I wasn&#39;t crazy. He&#39;s telling me there&#39;s no way this guy would have had a clearance with all that on his record.</p>

<p>His first question was, who the hell did this guy&#39;s background investigation? They keep records on these, and they are supposed to go back and terminate the investigator if they missed something like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had heard he had a general discharge. It&#39;s the second best discharge. After that is general under other than honorable discharge, bad conduct discharge and below that is dishonorable discharge. Back in the day it was much easier to get a dishonorable discharge. </p>

<p>I do think the whole thing is sketchy. Dude gets severe PTSD due to September 11th, he is blacking out and shooting up a car, discharging firearms indoors (if you were in the military you know how to clean a weapon), travels often internationally, all these things are big red flags. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmm.  So I don&#39;t disagree with you, but at the same time this is a place for questioning and thinking.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion:</p>

<p>1.) it is OK for someone to post something like this to drive a discussion.</p>

<p>2.) it is OK for people to upvote this to raise awareness and drive more discussion.</p>

<p>3.) discussion on this topic does not mean that the OP is &quot;crazy&quot;.  Maybe he doesn&#39;t know that someone who isn&#39;t allowed access to certain jobs as a government employee can be as a contractor.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>By having these discussions people will be more knowledgeable.  People here will all now be able to have an educated rebuttal if someone throws this logic at them in the future.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Dumb questions can have purpose too ;) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>False, vet here. When they approve of a secret clearance they check criminal history, public family affiliation (socialist, commie parties etc.) but essentially it is done by a man who never leaves a desk. And I have personally seen secret clearance taken away for not paying bills on time. Any kind of classified clearance is a big deal. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t trust you as far as they can throw you. For a secret they just don&#39;t attach many &quot;investigative weights&quot; for the &quot;toss&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s going to take more than a day, and said investigator will stay on the payroll while he&#39;s being investigated and deposed, although at some point I certainly hope they put his ass on administrative leave.</p>

<p>Look on the bright side: they&#39;ll have to hire three temps to go back and redo every check that investigator has ever conducted. Jobs for &#39;Muricans! I feel bad for the innocents getting reinvestigated though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you here. It seems sketchy because 
A. This is 3 times in a row that the shooter was under treatment for psychosis. 
B. three times initial reports of multiple shooters that magically become one shooter. 
C. All had ar&#39;s and we know the current administration LOVES ar&#39;s.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to cry conspiracy but a pattern seems to be developing. Either these are false flags in an attempt to make a gun grab, which can be argued to to the big push for bans after the last shooting, or we have a serious problem with mental health patients gaining access to weapons. The mental health thing seems more feasible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me put my tinfoil hat back on for a second so the NSA can&#39;t read this, but it seems to me they want that ar, and all accurate midrange defense weapons banned because they are extremely effective at holding off advancing intruders and securing your perimeter. Seems like the best weapon for a revolution. They are terrible for committing crime. Big bulky hard to conceal, hard to aim at close range......but for hunkering down and being able to fire repeatedly and accurately at distance they are amazing. I could see why the Feds wouldn&#39;t want them around. Especially with an approval rating lower then bushes. Worst ever I believe for congress and the president alike.  But this doesn&#39;t sell me on a false flag. Especially not for this shooting. Aurora co, and newton ct are suspect to me but I have a feeling this was PTSD gone awry. What is annoying is as time goes by facts will get blurred and forgotten and Alex jones and his cronies will run with it as far as they can. The news makes up stories for ratings. If they have no info they just make shit up. That&#39;s the real conspiracy here. The media lies, not because of some Obama agenda but because whoever gives some info first will get the highest ratings. Fuck it if their real facts or not. Are any facts &#39;real&#39;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>people here fail to understand. a government clearance of ANY kind requires a background check. if someone is dishonorably discharged, has multiple and has weapons convictions there is no way he can get a clearance through normal means.</p>

<p>while anyone with a clean record is elligable to get one, youre under the microscope. simply losing your ID badge to get into the building you work at is grounds to decide whether or not you get to keep your clearance</p>

<p>they still gave me a secret clearance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Chances are this guy had a similar situation going on.&quot;? I&#39;d love to actually speculate what the actual chances are on this...I&#39;m going to say very small.  You&#39;re saying that his very specific, unique, individual experience is statistically likely to be very similar to your very specific, unique, individual experience...regardless of whether we&#39;re talking about a security clearance or going to the same school...I&#39;d say the chances of eding up with the same experience are actually very small.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so... since this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and the purpose of this post was to present the possibility that the navy yard shooter was part of a conspiracy, you&#39;re assuming that the chances that this guy was given a security clearance despite a shady past are lower than the chances that he was involved in some grand scheme?  </p>

<p>i&#39;m just pointing out that people who have committed crimes still get cleared.  i&#39;m one of those people.  i see no reason to believe that he was part of a conspiracy just because he committed crimes and got a clearance anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmm.  So I don&#39;t disagree with you, but at the same time this is a place for questioning and thinking.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion:</p>

<p>1.) it is OK for someone to post something like this to drive a discussion.</p>

<p>2.) it is OK for people to upvote this to raise awareness and drive more discussion.</p>

<p>3.) discussion on this topic does not mean that the OP is &quot;crazy&quot;.  Maybe he doesn&#39;t know that someone who isn&#39;t allowed access to certain jobs as a government employee can be as a contractor.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>By having these discussions people will be more knowledgeable.  People here will all now be able to have an educated rebuttal if someone throws this logic at them in the future.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Dumb questions can have purpose too ;) </p>
