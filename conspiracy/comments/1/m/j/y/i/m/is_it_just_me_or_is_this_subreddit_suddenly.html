<p>A government operation from the 60s is reason to be <em>suspicious</em> about some kind of presence distorting this subreddit, that&#39;s fair. It&#39;s not evidence that this &#39;group&#39; <em>does</em> exist, or is influencing <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you have stated is true. Thank you for being fair and allowing me to hang on to my assumption. </p>

<p>As far as this sub reddit goes, I don&#39;t think they need a crew. 
A couple of undereducated college kids working for 10 a hour could handle this,</p>

<p>On the other hand, what&#39;s
the deal with guys like David Icke,  Steve &quot;the Fail&quot; Qualye and Good Ole Boy Alex Jones?
Between the marketers, the scam artists, outright agent provocateurs and the mentally ill, one must try to discern and confirm.</p>

<p>I do not want to imply that its all bullshit. Lord knows it has it&#39;s fair share, but there is plenty of real jewels here too. Shady manipulators doing scandalous shit, work around the clock</p>

    <div class="md"><p>David Icke has a ton of great information... He gets a lot of flack for his fringe theories like the lizards and the moon matrix - but this guy has been way ahead of his time for years. He broke the Jimmy Savile story before Savile died, and he predicted 911 with stunning accuracy... so you have to give him some props.</p>

<p>Alex Jones is a blowhard and an asshole... and I can&#39;t stand listening to him talk... but he has some great guests, and prison planet is one of the best conspiracy theory hubs out there. </p>

<p>Steve Quayle I have only just found out about... he has some Coast 2 Coast interviews that you can find on youtube. He talks about some freaky stuff, but whether he is right or wrong, he knows his shit... He pointed me to Genesis: Chapter 6 in the bible, and I have to say it blew me away.</p>

<p>These people are at least sincere, and although it is good to be suspicious of them all, they do deserve a place here on this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, generalizing. Just because someone believes in baby Jesus and the devil doesn&#39;t mean we all do. Self importance has nothing to do with what he posted. He stated a fact, which has alluded you, because you believe all top up voted material represents a collective mind of everyone here. Which is false. People will do anything to feed themselves, especially when it only involves clicking on things on the Internet. Do you honestly believe that nothing like upvote groups exist? If 2 girls 1 cup is a real thing, but businesses of dissuasion are considered not a real thing, then this must not be the Internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the two plus years I&#39;ve been here this sub has almost quintupled in size.</p>

<p>Newbies are notoriously gullible and tend to get sucked into the Satanism / Masonry / Lizards / Nibiru / Jews stuff real quick like. I know this because I was one of them for a couple months (hey, I&#39;m not proud - it&#39;s just what happened). When you&#39;re rebuilding your self of &quot;reality&quot; you tend to have an open mind; sometimes a little to open. </p>

<p>I count all of this as relatively normal.</p>

<p>The only thing I&#39;m a touch impatient about is a combination of solutions and action.</p>

<p>We can discuss who&#39;s fucking us and how, but the real question is this:</p>

<p>What do you do about it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having looked deeply into all things Masonic it&#39;s mostly a distraction. Yes there are high level Masons doing total bullshit, but it&#39;s not a part of the Luciferian ideology. They&#39;re dicks within the lodges and they have no regard, respect or allegiance to the foundations of Masonry.</p>

<p>Satanism is just fucking idiotic. These people do not believe in Satan. If anything they might believe in Jungian phantoms they can interact with on a dream level or something. I don&#39;t buy the Satanism angle for a second. I&#39;ve never run across anyone within the lodges that believes in Satan, I&#39;ve never read any of their literature that refers to Satan and I see nothing within their ideology or symbol set that refers to Satan. They talk about Lucifer endlessly. If you&#39;re a Bible Belt Christian and don&#39;t know the difference between Lucifer and Satan that&#39;s a different story.</p>

<p>The lizard thing is a compete waste of time. Even if they are lizards - which has yet to be proven aside of YouTube videos with the Inception soundtrack - who fucking cares? It doesn&#39;t change the behavior of these people. Whether they&#39;re really lizards or not should not stop you from dealing with them as total dicks. One of the nice things about the lizard angle is that it makes you look like a tool when you&#39;re in public talking about politics and you call them six foot lizards. Everyone around you will stop talking to you and ridicule you. Calling them lizards alienates you immediately and stops all discussion. If they are lizards they&#39;d probably love this. I, personally, don&#39;t care. They can be whatever they want; the important point is whether or not they act like decent caring beings.</p>

<p>So much of this stuff is a total waste of time.</p>

<p>You get sucked into all these mental cul de sacs and don&#39;t do anything because you&#39;re chasing your own tail and worrying about things that either don&#39;t exist or are irrelevant.</p>

<p>You wanna screw with the blood sucking, baby eating, shape-shifting interdimensional, Satanic, Jewish, Masonic lizards from Nibiru? It&#39;s identical to screwing with humans: stop playing by their rules, stop using their money and stop giving them tribute [taxes]. The solution is identical regardless of the target entity.</p>

<p>The hip-hop video, while I agree it&#39;s wacky, seems relatively harmless. The prevailing theory about the music industry &amp; their social engineering (intentional or otherwise) definitely has some merit imo. </p>

<p>Everything about the navy yard situation seems reactionary and crappy. They&#39;re not a&#39;comin for our guns, our political climate in the foreseeable future would not allow that. </p>

<p>Although there can be few people here who don&#39;t know 9/11 was an inside job, it is not exactly pressing news. There are other things (Syria, Ison in particular) which are of immediate concern but which are being drowned out by &quot;new&quot; 9/11 revelations.</p>
