       The Navy Yard shooting in DC, is what I'm most recently referring to. And I'm honestly asking. Because it seems to be the gun of choice for every shooting out there. If there's a logical explanation, great! I just want to understand.

       Because it is one of the most popular guns in the US. Additionally, it's not made by a specific manufacturer, since it's a rifle platform, and one can even build it with separate parts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add this to the fact that it's a very reliable rifle, and you can see why so many hunters and gun owners love it.
      </p>

       However, it's not "ALWAYS" used in mass shootings. That's just confirmation bias.

       Well, I guess it just seems like it is since it was reported in sandy hook, aurora, and now the navy yard shootings. But I guess that's 3 out of god knows how many. It seems to be a reoccurring trend in the large profile crimes as of late. I also wasn't aware it was the most popular guns in the US! Thank you, that makes way more sense.

       I think a lot of attention is drawn to the AR15, and similar looking rifles, because the military uses a version of it. It looks like a military rifle, like something that an "American" would have. The AKs all look too "Russian" or "Terrorist;" they just
       <em>
        look
       </em>
       foreign. If the goal is to get people to distrust Americans with guns, draw attention to the AR. If the goal is to get people to distrust terrorists with guns, draw attention to the AK. In simple and generalized terms. But that's just why we
       <em>
        hear
       </em>
       about it more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think ExaltedNecrosis is right as to why it has been used in a few mass shootings recently. It's a good rifle across the board, simple as that. I also think he's right with his last point.

       That's what I tend to think, anyway. I couldn't offer much
       <em>
        objective

       evidence, and wouldn't take an accusation like that to court.

       It's helpful to understand a perspective outside the medias portrayal. And by no means would you call that objective. It's something that unless you have a clear understanding of the weapons themselves, you get a little lost in the hype. I feel like I at least understand that I've been mislead, which is important.

       Of the 270 million guns legally registered in the US, only 3 million of them are AR-15s. So I do not see it as one of the most popular.

       Right, but thats still 3 million owners of this gun. More if you just count assault rifles and don't narrow it to AR-15s. And although tragic, we don't see nearly that number of people committing crimes. Which people in this discussion have really helped me understand a bit more clearly. That was really why I posed the question. It's hard to see all this when your understanding of guns comes from the mainstream media alone. But, just to pose another question, of the 270 million guns owned, how many are assault rifles? Is it substantial?

       The 91/30 is the most common, if the bayonet wasn't permanently attached, (side folding) that's probably what it was. Those rounds have roughly 2600 ft/lbs of energy at the muzzle, which is about twice that of an AR-15 .223 Rem round (about 1200 ft/lb @ muzzle). Indeed a powerful round. And with that metal butt-plate, not always comfortable to shoot, but still a lot of fun.

       It def had the side folding bayonet on it. And the metal butt plate, but luckily we had a bipod for it so we could lay down. It sounds like the 91/30

       Actually, sorry, I wasn't clear, the side folding bayonet is on the M44. (Type 53 is a chinese clone of that). They are the same as the 91/30 on the back end, but the M44 has the bayonet attached and a shorter barrel as it's the carbine version. Being a shorter barrel, they can sometimes make a nice fireball.

       The AR-15 and its variants like the M-16 came from the development of a standard issue rifle for the American military by ArmaLite and then Colt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assault rifles are designed to be shoulder-fired, accurate up to 300 metres, have selective fire, use an intermediate power cartridge, and use a detachable magazine.  All of these design decisions were about giving soldiers speed, accuracy, and high hit=kill ratios over a broad range of combat scenarios.  The AR-15 variants used in many shooter scenarios are single shot, semi-auto weapons, without the 3 round burst and full auto modes of the military's hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a tactical weapon for a shooter scenario, it has multiple advantages, but mostly its range and its magazine capacity are its biggest tactical advantages.  It can also take armor piercing (AP) rounds, which would change any tactical situation involving standard police, though police in most municipalities now carry their own AR-15s in squad cars since
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood_shootout">
        the North Hollywood shootout in 97.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, the AR-15 variants are cheap, widely available, have decently available ammunition, and work well.  And many Americans have a hard-on for the look of the thing because it looks just like an M4 (another variant.)  Personally, I think an HK MR762 is a better quality model with the same design characteristics, but essentially - this AR-15 design dominates the assault weapons market.

       yes. you can get one (or build one) for less than $500. There are obviously more expensive versions.

       Survellance video shows the gunman entered the building at the Naval Sea Systems Command Headquarters, at 1336 Isaac Hull Ave., with a shotgun, News4's Jackie Bensen reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to what witnesses are telling investigators, by the time the shootings ended, the gunman was seen with a semiautomatic 9 mm pistol and an AR-15 assault rifle. Authorities are investigating whether the gunman took the security guard’s service weapon – likely a 9 mm pistol – and hid in wait for the first responding D.C. police officers, who would be specially armed with AR-15s.

       I feel like that will get foggy as things are labeled "classified." We'll know for sure in 2060. That's how I always feel these cases go. They start following these unanswered questions and block them from the public for as long as they possibly can. But I would love to be wrong about that.

       I think that a very small percentage of the gun control activists would ever realize you don't need a gun to kill a dozen people.  People used to worry about bombs in public places.  You don't need a background check to make explosives.  If someone is going to kill someone they will do it any way they can.  A naval base is no more or less tragic than cops pumping lead into innocent people and being put on paid leave.

       Well I don't know how many of the mass shooters are veterans, military, or 'defense contractors', but the AR-15 is almost identical to what you'd train on in the military.

       This last one is the only one I'm aware of that's gotten much press. And I have to say with the amount of people who don't yet know this happened today, it's not exactly the whirlwind media storm that past shootings have been. I would imagine mostly because the other shooters didn't have the military background and were "civilians." Better support for gun control. A Navy vet would have been trained by the US military and that's just a harder battle to have with the public.

       Well I was more referring to it's prominence in all three of the large mass shootings as of late. Lanza, Holmes, and now Alexis. I guess I was more questioning the fact that such different people would all share a preference for one brand of gun and why that might be. But you're right, the Navy vet using it makes sense since he'd be comfortable with it.

       Maybe, but these people must have relative knowledge of the weapon in order to be effective with it. It's not like someone untrained and ignorant of guns could be a lethal as some of these nut jobs are. Lanza killed 26 people in something near 3 minutes. These nut jobs, in the end, don't seem to by yuppies. Holmes was very well educated, Lanza was described as gifted and Alexis is/was part of the Navy.

       Funny thing is, there wasn't an Ar used at Newtown. The guy only used handguns, which you can see if you look at the footage of what they found on him and in his car. He had two handguns, and left the shotgun in the car. Aurora the guy had an Ar, the firemen shooting the guy had an Ar, and no one but Feinstein is saying that the guy today had an Ar. Basically they're trying to push an agenda against the Ar for whatever reason.

       Well I agree with you and followed those theories. But the reason I worded my question the way I did was because I wanted to understand more about the gun and why it was that the media was so hysterical about it in particular without scaring people off who might not agree with those conspiracies. So to reword my question for you, why is the agenda to make all these crimes center around the AR even when it doesn't even seem clear that it was in fact used?

       I've shot and trained a bit with one, I can tell you the AR-15 is extremely ergonomic, fast reload, light controllable recoil, accurate as hell, modern ones are reliable as an ak too. Basically the m16 (select fire military version) is the best widely available assault rifle around. Also note that 5.56 is much lighter than conventional/older loads, allowing combatants to carry more ammunition, and is designed to wound not kill, taking more people (to carry the wounded) out of the fight. In short, perfect for fighting back against a much superior force (aka a national government). I think the majority of the people in the media just go along with what the politicians are proposing against it because it looks like a "weapon of war". The point of the 2nd amendment is not to keep these weapons in the hands of the people for hunting, or even self defense against criminals, but in self defense against the tyrannical government that the founders knew would inevitably evolve. The AR-15 is the Brown Bess musket of the 20th century, and the government will do everything it can to get rid of it and any similar weapons. (aks, scars, acrs, wait for it). My bet is that after they get the "assault rifles", it'll be the handguns, than the "high powered", meaning any effective cartridge even for a bolt action. Eventually it'll only be BB guns left, and then they will take people in the night (which they already do), they will pick a scapegoat to exterminate, they will finish off the last of the dying breed of honorable men.

       So pretty much it's just the first tier of guns they figure they can ban, since they know there's no way they are going to be able to do all that in one swoop. They picked ones they could demonize so that it seems like a good idea to rid the country of them. Now working with a desensitized public who no longer fight for 2nd amendment rights, they could fully disarm without fear of a civil uprising. That's kind of the drift I had gotten from the kind people of reddit thus far, but it is simpler when I can see the dots connected for me! Thank you!

       From what I understand from some of the responses here, it's not really the best nor the most popular of its breed. But I thought the same thing before I started getting responses. The media seems to be it's marketing platform these days.

       Because it's taking market share away from the Ruger Mini-14!
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously though, there are plenty of Semi-auto rifles chambered in 5.56/.223 why haven't we seen anyone use anything else? I can understand that a .308 like an M14 is too heavy to lug around if you were trying to escape, but this doesn't really seem like the objective of most of these shootings. An AK is in a larger caliber, is cheaper, and is more reliable.  If I were a deranged shooter I would probably want bigger bullets. Higher stopping power = more dead, less wounded. The general consensus is, it seems, his that they want our guns, plain and simple. An AR-15 is an iconic semi auto rifle in the US. It gets the sheep scared and that's what they want. Plain and simple.

       I'm not sure what the vergina tech guy used. Columbine used a hi-Point model 995 carbine rifle, TEC-DC9 9-mm semi-automatic handgun, and 2 sawed off shot guns and about 90 bombs were found littered throughout the school(which led the police for a good few days after to believe that there had to be more involved because they were all in different back packs and so heavy that it was thought to be unlikey that they had brought it all themselves.)

       My mistake, it was the hi-point (pretty much the same thing). Point is, a lightweight, 9mm carbine rifle which is good for really nothing other than plinking and killing (aggressively or defensively. This style of weapon remains a better choice for home defense than an AR-15) would garner not nearly as much attention as a "scary" AR if it were used.  Even bombs aren't as scary, where's our push for the ban on backpacks and pressure cookers???  Even Helen Keller would understand what's going on here.

       Well, thank you, I know alot more about the gun now. I understand it's use for civilians and why the media demonizing it is only half the story. But a person who goes and shoots many many people, they need very little of what's listed on this site. So why this gun? It sounds to me like it's more suited for hunting than mass destruction because it's precision not bullet spitting... is that accurate or am I misunderstanding?

       The 91/30 is the most common, if the bayonet wasn't permanently attached, (side folding) that's probably what it was. Those rounds have roughly 2600 ft/lbs of energy at the muzzle, which is about twice that of an AR-15 .223 Rem round (about 1200 ft/lb @ muzzle). Indeed a powerful round. And with that metal butt-plate, not always comfortable to shoot, but still a lot of fun.
