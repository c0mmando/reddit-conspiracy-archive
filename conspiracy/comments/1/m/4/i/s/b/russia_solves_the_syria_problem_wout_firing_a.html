    <div class="md"><p>Nah. Russia has several interests in Syria/Iran and knows better than to threaten violence. They also know what the US is up to and refuses to let them get away with it (staging an attack to push war, again). It&#39;s a classic move to cockblock the US&#39;s attempts without making them (Russia) look like the bad guy, thus removing all potential UN support the US might have.</p>

<p>This is all about Gazprom killing off OPEC influence. Petrodollars are at stake here, which is one of the few things keeping the US dollar afloat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I very much enjoy seeing Obama look less like the master of the world his followers claim him to be. However, I think it is far too soon to say that the Syria problem has been solved. There is a long way to go before this can truly be claimed, the least of which involves somehow actually ensuring that they turn over all of the chemicals. Assad would be a fool to hand over everything he allegedly has. More than likely, a lot of the CW will be handed over to Hezbollah or Iran for safekeeping and the Russians will be able to report that they have in fact received all of the known CW that were in Syrian possession.</p>
