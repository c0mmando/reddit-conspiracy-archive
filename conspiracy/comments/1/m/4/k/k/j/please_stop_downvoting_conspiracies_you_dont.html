       As I said in the title don't downvote conspiracies you dont believe in unless they are obviously troll accounts, I know roaming this sub we have people who don't believe 9/11 was an inside job but please if you don't believe it that doesnt mean downvote people who do just respectfully reply to them and maybe that will start a good interesting disscussion which is what i think this sub is for.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see people downvoting things they don't believe all the time but the main point here is to put your thoughts out there and start a truly free discussion so please next time you downvote think about if its because you disagree or for other reasons, Thanks you for reading this as i made this post because this is my favorite subbreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good example:
      </p>
      <p>
       Person 1: Yeah totally Im glad americans are now realizing 9/11 was an inside job!
      </p>
      <p>
       Person 2: Actually I dont really think that, mind telling me why you think that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bad example:
      </p>
      <p>
       Person 1: Yeah totally Im glad americans are now realizing 9/11 was an inside job!
      </p>
      <p>
       Person 2 says nothing and downvotes because they dont believe it.

       I think that's not really fair. If the post doesn't give evidence or twist the theory in an interesting way, which validates the conspiracy theory they are trying to promote... Then you would have to down vote them for pointless thread.

       apparently, the people who wish to discuss reptilians do not know they have their own subreddit,
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reptilians">
        r/reptilians
       </a>
       (i say this bk there are only 3 posts, and it has been there for almost a year) ---personally, i usually don't mind a post about reptilians here now and then, but it would be cool if they used their own sub more often so their views and discussion could be more aggregated for better research/use. like they do with bigfoot, 911, ufos, jfk, subliminal, illuminati, etc....

       Despite the silliness (I hope) of the Lizard People and all other space-operaesque conspiracy theories, I respect others believes and opinions, and even while it sometimes only gives skeptics more reasons to defame and alienate, there isn't anywhere else for such posts (
       <a href="/r/alientheory">
        /r/alientheory
       </a>
       aside).
      </p>
      <p>
       So I believe that we shouldn't censor (through downvotes) conspiracy theories which we don't agree with, at best contribute to the post with reasons for the disagreement.

       The fact I am ignorant of the theory is due to the inability of reptilian theorists to provide logical explanation and realistic evidence as to their theory. I am just demonstrating what the quality of the reptilian theory showcases as "proof".
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: If they give me good evidence or logical reasoning behind the reptilian theory I'd treat them with more respect, e.g. just because The Guardian and the Daily Mail are both English newspapers don't mean I treat both of them with the same credibility. Same thing here. So if you wish to present your case, do so, however I reserve my right to dismiss the theory based upon the lack of evidence or reasoning.

       To be honest - I know this subreddit was originally meant to be a forum to discuss all types of fringe theories no matter how outlandish they may have been, but I feel over the years it has evolved into something else. It has become a place to discuss real-world issues that the MSM is unwilling to touch and that the general public would rather ignore. Sure there's still the occasional lizard people post - but for the most part I feel confident in saying that I trust this sub to deliver me (relatively) unbiased and uncensored news far more than I could ever trust r/worldnews to do the same. I think it plays a really important role in educating people about the real-life conspiracies and back room deals that shape our world today, and I think that's truly something unique that should be valued. I know a lot of people miss the "Wild West" days when you could make the front page saying that Margaret Thatcher drank children's blood to call forth the power of Satan in order to end the world in 1997 - but I have to say I kind of like this r/conspiracy a lot better. Just my two cents.

       down or up voting is the whole point. I'll at least read most things, and try to be open minded before down voting, but some things like shape shifting reptilians will always get my downvote.

       Honestly, neither do I. That being said, maybe you are more suited to r/worldnews. This IS the last bastion of discussion on reddit. I'm sure you're going to have some "whitty" comeback. Honestly, sir, I don't care. This is r/conspiracy, and technically reptilian people is a conspiracy theory. Maybe to stop this dumbassed argument we should make this sub r/conspiracytheory. Since any real conspiracy won't last 24 hours before its taken down on any sub.

       I think if you look at my posting history in this sub, you'll see I'm pretty open minded. But the whole point of upvoting or downvoting is sort of an opinion poll. Everyone has their pet their theories, but something with a large  number of downvotes on this sub usually means that the general consensus is that the story does not meet the standards of this community/sub. Over half of my Karma is from my posting to this sub, you can't get all butt hurt just because people don't like your material. I guess I view votes as feedback on the posted material, not everything deserves debate and this sub attracts a wide variety of  people. I'll look the evidence objectively but sometimes it just isn't there. If someone posts something that just comes across as batshit crazy, without citing sources or providing evidence it's going to get downvoted.
