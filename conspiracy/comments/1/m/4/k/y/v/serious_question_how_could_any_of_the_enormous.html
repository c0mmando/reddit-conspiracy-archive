       It would take weeks, and they'd have to attach the explosives to the support structures of the buildings, which would require exposing the structures.  How in the world would that happen without anyone noticing that it was happening in three of the most famous buildings in the world?

       One possible explanation: "Larry Silverstein leases a nearly worthless dinosaur WTC building complex (worthless due to the asbestos the buildings were stuffed with and needed to be cleaned up, the cost of which may have rivaled the value of the buildings themselves) weeks before 9/11, makes sure it is over insured against terrorist acts and hires an Israeli security firm. From that moment on the coast is clear to let a team of demolition experts from the Israeli army led by Peer Segalovitz into the WTC buildings. These charges plus detonators had been prepared at the premises of the Urban Moving Systems company, a Mossad front. During the weeks before 9/11 these prepared charges were loaded into vans, driven into the basements of WTC Twin Towers next to the elevator shaft, unloaded into the elevator, and lifted onto the roof of the elevator through the opening in the elevator ceiling. Next the elevator moved from floor to floor while charges where being attached to the columns as displayed in this video from 0:22 onwards. The detonators of these charges were radiographic controlled and finally detonated from WTC7 on the day of 9/11." -

       Whether you agree or not it is one possible explanation.  It took about 5 seconds using google.

       Almost immediately after the towers fell a few Janitors and maintenance guys  of the buildings reported that men in suits and plain clothes officers had taken control of parts of the building at night (after hours) earlier in the week.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember there being a maintenance worker being interviewed before the towers even fell he was pulled off the street by CNN or someone I can't remember now. But what I do remember is a janitor or maintenance worker talking about how he got out of the building and he started to say FBI was in the underground floors at the same time " explosion went off" and they helped him and his coworkers to safety. But before he could be asked another question a man in a suit pulled him away from the camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been waiting years for this to be brought up by conspiracy groups or Michael Moore or someone who doesn't believe the official story and no one I've see has said anything about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       This however sticks out in my mind because it was one of the first things that happened that caused me to think something screwy is going on. Well that and the sight of giant towers falling down in a free fall speed....
      </p>
      <p>
       But more to your question about so many people being involved how could that be kept quite, and I feel this is not a very good excuse simply because the military and agencies like the CIA are compartmentalized and have members on a need to know basis .And as for keeping it a secret, people come forward all the time and they are smeared and discredited or they disappear or die of odd circumstances these things happen all the time.  Look at recent happenings with the NSA scandal.

       If you were planning YEARS in advance you could easily plant them in the emergency light battery receptacles in the stairways. Stairways are usually close to supporting structures and unless you looked inside the emergency light fixtures and inside the battery that they were hidden in you would never know. But there are so many insiders who worked on this "project" that it could be many many other possibilities...especially if the security firm was in on it.

       marvin bush was in charge of security for the towers and the airports. his company had just recently "redone" a fireproofing of WTC, and if you believe in the nano thermite, just paint it on as normal fire retardant.

       I'm an electrician. I work in a fairly large building.  There are more places than I can count from which you can have direct access to structural beams/columns etc.  I could wire this place to blow BY MYSELF in under a week, and as long as no MAJOR renovations/installs happened, no one would ever lay eyes on anything I could potentially install.

       Maintenance spaces are everywhere, office drones just don't care to look behind the false ceiling.

       So this is a great thought experiment, actually.  Would YOU notice if someone had over the course of a few weeks added enough explosives and detonators to destroy your building?  How many maintenance workers and electricians do you suppose worked in the WTC on any given day?

       Interesting point.  I might, because I'm a naturally curious person who knows more than I should about explosives (misspent youth, heh). But it wouldn't be hard to disguise if you thought someone might look.  Fireproof paint for example is on all the structural steel and I don't know if thermite would make it look any different.  Someone already mentioned emergency light battery packs. (A very good idea, though oddly specific, hmmm) there is so much junk in maintenance spaces finding what you ARE looking for is hard enough.  After our recent earthquakes, the lifts were shut down for a couple weeks and a guy came in to 'check' them. I don't know what he was doing in the shafts, and I wouldn't know if anything was out of place anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       In conclusion, for all I know it already IS wired.

       "some unusual people" in two of the biggest buildings in the world is a lot less of a smoking gun than you guys seem to think it is.  You'd have to partially demolish any building to wire it to implode.  Period.

       Guys, listen - to demolish a building, you have to strap explosives directly to the support structures of a building.  Most of the time, this involves PRE-DEMOLISHING the interior of the building to even get at those.  You can't just set some charges willy-nilly, there's a structure and a science to it.  It's complicated, it's precise.  Someone would have noticed.

       Saboteurs and missiles don't care about how the building falls so they can just place charges and get some sort of result. But when demolishing a building and wanting it to go down cleanly you can't just do that, it might topple over instead of going straight down if you are not totally exact in what you are doing.

       Exactly. Also they normally DRILL into the concrete pillars. If they had done that there would have been a huge noise from the drilling. 
When they demolish a much smaller structure (as seen on TV) they spend 3-4 WEEKS doing the drilling (and other pre-demolishing) and the wiring, for such a large building as WTC and especially if they could only do it at night it would have taken much longer. And even if they did it at night, someone would have been in the building and heard the loud drilling.

       Why can't you do your own research?  Plausible answers and clues that could point in this direction are out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the problem is that your question presupposes a specific theory.  Instead of theorizing, maybe you should just decide if things are not the way they are presented to you by way of asking if the official explanation makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, do you think it was a good idea for the EPA to tell the people on site doing the cleanup that the air was fit to breathe?

       Okay, so walk me through it then.  You paint thermite on the what?  walls?  then what?  You wire it up?  everywhere?  wires attached on/in the walls throughout the building? where do all those wires go? How do you hide all those wires?

       Putting an explosive ANYWHERE but on the support structure of the building is unreliable, so they'd be wide open to being discovered / the plan failing.

       Thanks for addressing my question.  I want to believe that it was oversight or confusion rather than malice or even simply incompetence.  It bothers me when people are hurt by way of someone not doing their job properly, yet to consider the simplest answers to questions like this is probably wise and is likely what you're doing.

       Even if it were done as an effort to prevent all the harm that yet more mass panic would have created, I can respect that.

       So, you actually don't have an answer, do you?

       It's best to just admit that, or end the thread, rather than just give it away with a patronising and inaccurate internet meme.
