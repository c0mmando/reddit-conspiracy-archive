       <strong>
        Yesterday
       </strong>
       , after John Kerry
       <del>
        flubbed a question
       </del>
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/09/us-syria-chemical-weapons-attack-john-kerry">
        came up with an interesting new policy proposal
       </a>
       about Syria, Russia brokered a
       <a href="http://swampland.time.com/2013/09/09/warily-mccain-supports-russian-plan-for-syrias-chemical-weapons/">
        new plan
       </a>
       with the Syrian FM:
       <strong>
        Assad gives up his chemical weapons, America backs off
       </strong>
       .  The Obama administration
       <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/10/accidental-diplomacy-kerry-now-claims-credit-for-syria-weapons-proposal/">
        jumped on this idea
       </a>
       ! They were looking for a way out of this increasingly unpopular bombing idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This morning
       </strong>
       , John Kerry
       <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-09-10/kerry-dempsey-and-hagel-continue-strike-pitch-house-armed-services-committee-live-we">
        testified before HASC
       </a>
       . He spoke optimistically about the new plan, but he wasn’t ready to ask the House to delay their vote on Syria yet.  Presumably, Kerry spoke with Lavrov on the phone before lunch, because Obama
       <strong>
        <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/09/obama-makes-syria-pitch-on-capitol-hill/">
         went to the hill at lunchtime
        </a>
       </strong>
       , a rare move for presidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        At Lunch time
       </strong>
       , Obama
       <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/obama-syria-chemical-weapons-proposal-96547.html">
        spoke to the Senate dems and republicans
       </a>
       separately in two closed-door meetings. Politico’s sources report that he asked them to delay the Syria vote, in order to give the Russian plan time to be considered by the UN security council.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        President Obama has reportedly called on the US Senate to postpone the vote on possible military actions in Syria until the diplomatic solution is discussed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       While he was there, Russia’s UN ambassador
       <strong>
        <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/10/us-syria-crisis-un-meeting-idUSBRE98911G20130910">
         called a special emergency meeting
        </a>
       </strong>
       of the Security Council. At the same time, Russian TV reported that the plan included an American promise not to use force. America would never agree to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        After Lunch
       </strong>
       : Less than an hour later, as Obama’s motorcade rolled back to the White House, Russia
       <strong>
        <a href="http://www.jihadwatch.org/2013/09/un-security-council-meeting-to-consider-russias-proposal-canceled.html">
         cancelled the meeting
        </a>
        .
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       A few minutes later, the Syrian FM
       <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/10/20416189-syrias-foreign-minister-well-declare-chemical-weapons-sign-arms-ban?lite">
        pleaded
       </a>
       for a chance to surrender the weapons, saying that
       <a href="http://rt.com/news/syria-join-chemical-weapons-convention-675/">
        they still agreed
       </a>
       to the deal, but at the UN Security Council, the deal is off, and America looks like the bad guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This Evening
       </strong>
       : The president has yet to comment, but he is speaking to the nation on television tonight. Presumably, he’ll have to rethink what he was going to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Latest reports say that Kerry is
       <a href="http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/sep/10/ap-source-kerry-to-see-russian-fm-in-geneva/">
        flying to Geneva
       </a>
       Thursday to meet Lavrov in person.

        Reason why Russia cancelled the meeting
       </a>
       (From AlJazeera)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A possible diplomatic resolution on Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles seems to have become mired in political debate as Russia differs with France and its allies over a UN resolution.
       </p>
       <p>
        France said on Tuesday it would submit a UN Security Council resolution calling on Syria to
        <strong>
         put its chemical weapons beyond use or face "extremely serious" reprisals
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, an emergency UN Security Council meeting, originally called by Russia for Tuesday, apparently to discuss its own plan for Syria, has been cancelled after the Russia withdrew the request.
       </p>

        </strong>
        , the main backer of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad,
        <strong>
         opposed the French-drafted resolution and is expected to propose a weaker Security Council statement,
        </strong>
        which are largely symbolic statements on the chemical arms crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        The main sticking point was that
        <strong>
         France wanted to invoke Chapter Seven of the UN Charter, making any resolution legally binding and enforceable by military action
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        France is backed by the UK and the US in proposing the statement that Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, said would threaten "extremely serious" consequences if Syria fails to hand over its banned weapons.
       </p>
       <p>
        The US government has previously said that it would not fall victim to stalling tactics, and France's proposal reportedly outlines a rapid timetable for disarmament.

       Exactly, this is all theater.  They (US &amp;  co.) wanna bomb Syria badly, this its just building the ”causus belli”. No one is talking bought the terrorist who used the damn weapons in the first place. Don't let them bury that fact. We know the CIA Gladio army aka Al-Quida aka FSA aka LIFG ....etc will never surrender their chemical weapons they received from accomplices Saudi Arabia, Qtar, Turkey and all Gulf country conspirators.

       I can't tell if you're being sarcastic...France wants to make the disarmament resolution binding (as it should be, in my opinion), but Russia backed out.

       Instead of "pay your rent by the end of the month", basically France wants it to be "pay your rent by the end of the month or you'll be evicted"

       The timetable seems to have been designed to be entirely unattainable, so that the binding resolution would have to be enforced. That would give the west the legal permission it needs to bomb Syria without a security council vote. Evil.

       In a binding resolution all the West would have to say is "Syria didn't surrender all their weapons" whether true or not and then they would immediately have proper legal authority and justification to begin an attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't see why that kind of proposal is a terrible deal for Russia/Syria you are blind. They would never ever agree to anything that has a condition to give U.N. authorization for a Western attack because, without a doubt, said condition would be exploited by the West. Just look at how NATO took a no-fly zone authorized by the U.N. and used it to engage in a 3-month long bombing campaign directed at regime change in Libya.
      </p>
      <p>
       Give the West an inch and they'll take a thousand miles...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now when the deal falls apart Obama and Kerry can blame Russia for not agreeing to their counter-proposal. And the US MSM will pretend like it was the US's proposal all along and that by Russia and Syria not agreeing, it shows they were never serious about the idea in the first place.

       Both are skeptical of the other's proposals. The French proposal assumes Assad's guilt for the August 21 attack. And i don't think that's on the table.

       The U.S. got Assad to admit he has chemical weapons. Thereby Syria takes blame for the attacks by default(to the average MSM watching American). Now the resolutions will fall apart and the U.S. will have more support for military action. Pretty smart move by the warmongers.

       Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. If the US are blaming the government in Syria even though it was the rebels that caused the chemical attacks, what would stop another attack from happening? If we go through with the arrangement, and Syria does manage to destroy thier stockpile that wouldn't change anything. Another false flag would occur and more governments would be against Syria for not following the plan. Either way, isn't an attack on Syria inevitable at this point?

       This is why Russia backtracked their UNSC meeting once the use of military force became binding. Even if a strike is inevitable, Assad has in the past days ramped up pressure (bombings) on oppositionists, in the expectancy.

       Gen Idris of the FSA already claimed that over 30k were in the outskirts of Damascus waiting to blitzkrieg once the American intervention to begins. Time is Assad's most valuable resource; to relocate weapon supplies and decimate the rebels further, specially those surrounding Damascus

       Don't be fooled by the political theater. This is all a ploy to gain support from the American people and a few key players in the international community to strike Syria.

       interesting indeed.
I find the whole chemical attack thing pretty weird.
I would have guessed that the attack on Syria would have already happened. Do we see their plans failing or is this all part of the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean did the US really want a way out that doesn't involve military action or did Kerry just blur something out?

       Can't help but think something bad happens tomorrow. He set it up in his speech. The first 10 minutes were about how we needed to use force and not "pin prick" the situation and then all of a sudden he backed off and said he was going to take the diplomatic approach one last time...BUT effectively putting Assad on a short leash.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a false flag that happens tomorrow it would let him roll the red carpet out for a full blown "boots ON ground" campaign in Syria to overthrow Assad and keep us at war for another decade.
