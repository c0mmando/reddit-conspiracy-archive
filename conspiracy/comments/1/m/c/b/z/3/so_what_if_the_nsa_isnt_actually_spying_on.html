       I think the headline says it all, but I'll flesh it out a bit more here.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a comprehensive surveillance system in place which covers multiple communications technologies and is almost certainly scooping up the data of FAR more innocent Americans than the number of terrorists who even exist.  What if that's actually the entire point of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       If there were some under-the-table deals between the security establishment and any of the major corporate powers it would be easy to see how easily and lucratively that flood of data could me monetized.  It would be a marketing dream come true.  They would have their finger on the pulse of America in more ways than we can even imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would have the power to destroy their enemies, to blackmail practically anyone, to destroy their competitors and further entrench their monopoly status to invulnerable levels of market entrenchment and control.  They could play America like a goddamn piano, except a piano that would cough up billions upon billions of dollars per year in labor and economic activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would completely fucking own us.

       The idea that America is trying to defeat terrorism is laughable to many of us on this subreddit. I think you'll find that almost everyone here (except the trolls) agrees with you... but this is not anything new to us.

       noooooo, why would the military industrial complex want to profit off of both sides of a fabricated conflict with a faceless and nationless enemy?

       The United States is the largest seller of weapons and actively sells/gives small arms to numerous known terror entities around the world as well as the Mexican mafia/drug cartels just across our borders.  Yet some in that very same government want to restrict or take away its citizens rights to own a firearm.  Talk about total and complete hypocrisy.

       Bill Nye says a carbon tax would get all the little people PAID.  Like thousands of dollars, all for the purpose of having sufficient resources to deal with the effects of the ecological impact of the oil industry.  I don't give a fuck if you believe in global warming, how about all the inedible shrimp in the gulf?  Ecological carelessness due to a lack of accountability has a cost, if you think that's not so, explain how.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess there's a lot of military hardware and clever folks who are paid by the oil companies and their friends, so the little people won't ever be able to cause the oil people to pay for the costs they're incurring, so it's a moot point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought I had read that one of the purposes of domestic surveillance is to keep tabs on any increase in awareness about this situation regarding environmental destruction, and the masses demanding some accountability for that lost value (fishing resources, water resources, many other kinds of resources destroyed by the unaccountable oil industry).
      </p>
      <p>
       I might not live much longer, but if the idea that we're being fucked in this way becomes widespread, and the solution is clear, the whole system is threatened (and I suppose that would extend to national security, from some people's point of view).
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I view the threats that exist to agriculture, and water and the necessities of life for everyone as a threat to national security, and by extension, whatever threatens all those things is a threat to national security.

       Yes, in general, the goal is to prevent individuals from taking possession of physical natural resources, removing them from the so-called "democratic" "capitalist" system, because there aren't enough to go around.

       Oh, I agree with you.  Massive billions of dollars in profit are just another means to gain power and control.  A lucrative partnership between the security state and the top levels of corporate America is one way of gaining both at the same time.

       Profit,  power,  national security,  trickle down, surveillance, intimidation,  force, secrecy, deception, this is now the American Way,  not democracy,  not freedom.   Lives will be given,  lives will be taken,  money will be spent,  fears and hopes will be instilled accordingly.   Army,  think tanks,  banks,  and board rooms, academia,  the media a colossal spy network on commerce,  individuals, governments,  and the police/prison system will be enlisted at full hilt to make this happen,  millions of Americans are in its full time service.   "What is good for ____ is good for America."   On these points both parties agree.   On other points,  especially points that can divide and distract the population,  providing an entertaining circus,  politicians will argue and test and develop the upcoming next generation of leaders.

       I thought it was pretty obvious with such a huge surveillance system in place abuses like this is possible which is why we don't want them in place. If we actually trust the government to do this for the sake of "fighting terrorism" it's not a good way to do so anyway as mass spying is pointless. You need to go to the source, not sift through an obscene amount of information.

       I think the best part of the data collecting is how it is essentially useless to the collectors of the data,  for confirmation see, 2012 election, following a full two year campaign to :::: you must hate your President messaging:::: and the careful manipulation of the Republican Primaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       One could even consider the stealth release of the data by the tool Snowden to have a double edge.  It was quite deliberately meant to unseat the President, based on an idea that we would be shocked, surprise many of us knew of this already.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other edge, since they are making so many wrong conclusions from the data and their imagined success at manipulation of ideas, they are simply trying to scare us into shutting up, and dropping out of the dialog.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they are believing their own internet shills and propaganda.
       <br/>
       how are they going to differentiate, the real from the created dialogs?
      </p>
      <p>
       We just need them to stop spending our tax money for it.

       Well, that is one of many faces on this gem of a turd. That is their spider that is lurking on the web. Data of all kinds gets caught in that web, and that data could be used however they construe it. Six degrees of separation as they say. This allows them to not only monitor every single persons online activity, but based off of Meta data from cell phones, can provide real world information, which as has been revealed could prove an affair, drug use, or any other shady / nefarious activity.

       More likely: The government is spying on us because it fears the people and loathes them. It simply sells the data to big businesses from time to time or enables data collection on a massive scale by companies like Google to defray the costs of implementing modern Big Brother monitoring.

        Stalin, on the other hand, argued in 1933 that the further the country would move forward in constructing socialism, the more acute forms of struggle will be used by the doomed remnants of exploiter classes in their last desperate efforts - and therefore, political repression was necessary to prevent them from succeeding in their presumed goal of destroying the Soviet Union. Stalin believed that the class enemy could even worm its way into the party claiming to lead a socialist state.

       i think this should be the real headlines in the papers regarding the all encompassing NSA scandal.  Basically every day more evidence comes out showing these tools are not used for terrorists AT ALL.  even when it was stated that high ranking terrorists or anyone looking to damage America would not be using gmail, yahoo, etc. anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       even more than making money its about pure, total, absolute control.  and the average citizen was never even supposed to know.  this is like insider trading to the infinite degree but not limited to the financial markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       if they can view, im sure its not too far off that they can add or install something to your email such as CHILD PORN.  and you are now destroyed forever with very little hope for proving your innocence.

      <pre><code> The following books are a good start to get a better understanding of why this is happening. There is no conspiracy here when everything is published and accessible for the last fifty years. The people in power have written about moving away from nationstates for decades, and establishing an acephalous organization of rule. What we are seeing is the result, the race to control all of the natural resources and the destruction of the nations that do not play ball with the brotherhood.

       Corporations and the people running the show are protected by the state. If Exxon spills a million gallons of oil, the CEO and the rest of the suits bear no responsibility. Corporations are a state-protected entity. End of story. Get your facts straight.

       I'm much less concerned about corporatism than big government. I don't like to do business with Walmart, so I don't. That is the end of it. Walmart has no further power to compel me to do what they want. I have no way to escape the clutches of a government that can throw me in jail forever, take my stuff, or prevent me from growing food to feed my family on land I own.

       What "corporations"? If a company caught a competitor doing this, don't you think they'd call them out publicly in a huge way? Do you really think every single corporation out there can collude into one big "conspiracy" without anyone spilling the beans? 2-3 companies can barely come together to make ISO standards without fucking something up. This is a tin foil classic, there are so many holes in it if you think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does every single "corporation" get access to this data flow? What if there's a corporation that gets left out, don't you think they spill the beans on everyone else? What if I start a corporation, "Itsalwayslulzy Inc" ... if I have a couple million bucks, can I buy access into this data stream? Wouldn't companies destroy each other if they all had access to wiretaps of each other? Why would companies even want that?

       Why would companies want large amount of data about their customers? Seriously? It's not like data brokerage firms aren't doing this already, the NSA simply goes a little bit further. I mean how do you think companies like Stratford work exactly? This is exactly what is already happening and has been for many years. Never forget that a large amount of the work the NSA has been doing is using private companies, companies that are allowed to use their information how they chose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any relevant data that matters to how customers operate is already available legally, without the NSA's help. And any data that is about opposition groups to whatever company is already collected by firms like Stratford and HBGary and others like them.

       of the corporations.  Of course it would be a small, elite clique with access to this sort of data because the very thing that makes it so valuable would be the extraordinary level of inside connections required to access it.
