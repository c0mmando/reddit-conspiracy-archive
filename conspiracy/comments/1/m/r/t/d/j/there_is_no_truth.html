       Is every single theory truth?  No.

      <p>
       But its possible for them all (most, many, some) to be true individually.  The only absolute falsehood is that
       <strong>
        everything
       </strong>
       can be tied together with one universal conspiracy.

       There is and was always truth. Truth facts are constants and never relative. Truth does not stop to exist just because nobody knows the truth or no human being ever heard the truth. Human can approch the truth, but will never be sure about the true facts. So at some point you have to make up your opinion on impirical data you trust and you believe to be logical, be more likely and more reliable based on all the facts you believe to be true at the present and during your limited time you are experiencing beeing alive and thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Philosophical thinking is not useless and fruitless, but if you are honest it still leaves you empty-handed. You have to deal with uncertainty and exercise your best critical thinking to approch the truth in a way that is useful for your life.

       I'm going to help you immensely with one phrase, and you're going to reject it immediately, but just remember it and you'll see.

      <blockquote>

       In the context of your request, this means that you make the truth you want to see. if you surround yourself with negatives and hate, that becomes the truth that drives your world. This is understood by those that have access to more information than people like you and I do. That is why SYSTEMS OF CONTROL are so important to them, and why they are overwhelmingly NEGATIVE.
      </p>
      <p>
       A negative overarching truth helps keep people compliant and subservient. This makes control easier. This makes CLASS WARFARE inherently one-sided. This overwhelms those of us who are seeking the truth from compromised sources who reinforce the negative narratives to keep true seekers for helping to enlighten the other slaves as to their true power and potential.

       Meaning, if you want positive change in your life, IT HAS TO START WITH YOU. I'm sorry, I thought that was clear. It sounds like you're imposing the ideas of others on me because we might share similar sounding ideologies. I assure you, I abandoned "conventional religion" for EXACTLY that reason; I saw too many people using the concept of a benevolent God to divorce themselves from any responsibility for their actions in the here and now. These people disgust me.

        You are confusing thought with action. The nature of man's universe is 3. 3 dimensions, the holy trinity, man woman child, earth moon stars, 3 is a fibonacci number, it is a prime number. It is the first number to create a shape from a line. The triangle is the first shape. Sounds whacky but it's reality.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Of course that's true. I think we're on the same page, and i did a poor job of relaying the information properly. The only thing I would add is that it's easier to engage in positive action when you are focused on the positive as well. Internal conflict muddies your works.

        Rage is a valid human reaction to stimulus , it is embedded into our midbrain for a reason. Do not disengage the fight or flight reality your brain has been blessed with. If it says fight, you fight. Fighting and fleeing are actions, you would be keen to notice.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, I did not mean to imply that self-defensive rage cannot also be positive action. Ultimately, it is up to all of us to identify, choose, and then walk our paths. This also requires both thought and action. My mistake was that I assumed action was implied. Perhaps it was not.

       But true and false depend almost entirely on an individual's perspective. The individual is a construct of lower dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two aspects that require balance are best described as "positive" and "negative" energy. Positive energy would be best described as the feeling you have when enjoying the presence of your love ones. Negative energy would be best described as the adrenaline one gets from killing an enemy. There are many other, possibly better examples of course.

       But as I've been saying this whole time, that is your interpretation of what I said, because I poorly communicated my intent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, by the very physical nature and construction of our bodies, it can be argued (should I wish to be a sophist, a label you spit with venom) that all action is first a result of thought; a need for the body to receive signal from the brain to initiate action.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this way, we return to my correction to your valid points about my original post, that it is easier to initiate the kinds of actions you wish for if you first put yourself in that mindset. Otherwise, you endure draining internal conflict that may impede or all together halt your action.

       You are saying this, I do not believe or subscribe to any such thing. Truth is difficult to know for many reasons, but it can be known.

       I only include them, because there are debates on both sides regarding their benefit or harm.  To me, they still fit into the idea that it is hard to really know what the truth is.  Is Alex Jones a CIA operative, or has the latest rumors of him being a CIA operative put out there by the CIA to discredit him?  I'm not trying to make an argument either way, just saying that there are arguments for both sides, and the truth is hard to see.  Thanks for your insight though, the fed is probably a solid one to believe in.

       That's the problem, I don't know.  The craziest things could turn out to be true, facts we accept could turn out to be false.

       I guess the point I'm trying to make, is you can't clarify anything.  No matter what the topic, the public has been bombarded with the tactics in OP that lead to not really being able to hold 100% faith in the truth of almost anything.

       The truth is pure and eternal. It cannot be tainted or corrupted. It can only be obscured by a veil of lies and misdirection. But beneath that veil, it remains untouched. The truth is like a virgin girl in a house of prostitution. The whores may paint her face. They may dress her in revealing garments. They may splash her with perfumes. But beneath it all she remains a virgin. The special thing about the virgin purity of truth is that it can never be broken. The mountains will crumble and turn to sand, empires will rise and fall, but a single true statement made in the dim beginnings of human history will be as true a million years hence as it was when it was uttered on the air. What is true is always true. Lies can be told about it, but it can never be turned into a lie.

       I like to simplify things as much as possible. Here are some facts:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Money is created by a small number of central banks who are controlled by old shitty families.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Fear is the primary method of control.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Moral of the story: Scary old rich families aren't the only ones who can bring fiat currency into existence, and don't be scared.

       Truth is a linguistic entity. Truth only exists in language.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look into truth theory. My personal favorite thoery for truth is 'Correspondence Theory.' The idea is that a statement must correspond to an observable or provable fact. That the sky, itself, is blue, is not true until you state it. Only in the sentence "the sky is blue" is there an element of truth. Why? Because the statement corresponds to a fact. In order to verify the statement all one needs to do is look up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now the media is interested in a different type of truth theory. The media is interested in "Consensus Theory." Consensus theory is the idea that whatever is believed by the most number of people is true. Agenda 21 pushes this a lot - particularly when it comes to Global Warming ("a consensus of scientists").
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you ask, "Is there truth?" he obvious answer is 'yes.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Statements about verifiable facts.

       The phrase is more meant to convey that duality and balance should be the goal of all beings, not "pure" "good" or "evil".
