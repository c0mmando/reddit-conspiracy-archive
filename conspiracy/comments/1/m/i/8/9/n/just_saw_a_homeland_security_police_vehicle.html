       I have seen one of these Federal Security Services trucks patrolling the highway between Massachusetts and New Hampshire recently. I did not like the look of a federal police officer on the highway so I did a little reading into what their jurisdiction is. Basically they are security guards for federal lands and buildings, so they should only have authority on those particular grounds, BUT due to some goofy loophole, they are given broader powers because they are "federal agents".
      </p>
      <p>
       They are DHS' private federal police force. It brings the Federales of Mexico to mind honestly, the most corrupt "law enforcement agency" on the planet... well, until recent years.

       Since it's the rockies, it's either BLM, wilderness, or FFland if it's not ranches or mines. Highways cross through them all the time, it makes sense I guess if that's their jurisdiction.

       I worked for an IT firm and it took me to a place where they custom made uniforms.

       Everyday I was onsite there were new recruits showing up for additional uniforms.  This was over a year ago, and lately to the east of me I have been seeing some vehicles like you are describing from time to time.

       I live in a small town in the middle of Michigan, I see DHS suburbans around here far more often than I'm comfortable with.  One was parked downtown for a week watching traffic on the main haul.  I even posted to reddit(
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/michigan">
        /r/michigan

       ) only to be shit-stormed with how ignorant I was and how DHS probably meant Dept. Human Services.  Yeah, no fuckwits it had the whole seal on their that said Department of Homeland Security.  I also know they store their vehicles at the local fair ground after seeing one there and asking the fair ground employees WTF.  They're everywhere these days.  It's freaky because to the best of my knowledge a national police force is illegal in the US.

       I have seen DHS chargers and suburbans around exit 168 on I-69 and further east if that's where your referring to. I can say that I have seen them on more than 3 occasions. It bothers me that their presence is so far away from the border.

       I haven't looked at the Constitution lately (just like the President and Congress), but my instinct tells me there's a conflict of interest there...especially if it's on a state highway and not an interstate.

       I have heard of DHS positioning VIPER teams at railway stations and inspecting passengers, but I am not so sure if they are authorized to patrol the highways. I might be mistaken though but I would wager that what you saw was not the DHS.

       Saw them in penn station two weeks ago with full body armor. Heard on ask where the rest of the squad was. They wore uniforms identical to Army multicam as well as interceptor body armor and drop rigs for their holsters and ammo. Had dump pouches too. Bear in mind penn already had Amtrak and NYPD presence with dog teams and state police with AR-15s skulking through the place.

       They're in Las Vegas also. I've seen a few white SUV with "Homeland Security" and it's insignia printed on the door. A few friends said they've seen a couple of the armored vehicles with the same HLS mark on them. So is HLS going to be the Domestic Army that Obama spoke about some time ago?

       jurisdiction is just pen on paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, at the E.J. Nutter Center and the area surrounding Wright State University is a multi-jurisdictional area "served" by:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        WSU campus police
       </li>
       <li>
        City of Fairborn Police
       </li>
       <li>
        Ohio State Highway Patrol
       </li>
       <li>
        Wright-Patterson Air Force MPs
       </li>
       <li>
        Greene County Sheriff
       </li>
       <li>
        Dept. of Recreation and Wildlife
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Even if there is a jurisdictional issue, I'm sure they have something that covers that like "If an officer witnesses an illegal act while outside their jurisdiction, action should be taken and a request for jurisdictional backup shall be made..."
      </p>

       Still shouldn't have happened without state or county or local law enforcement present.  There would be a very dangerous precendent set by just letting DHS roll around and make routine looking traffic stops.  There are (or should be) jurisdiction issues, I would think...

       It's a Law Enforcement Officer Forum talking about the same situation. It's a point of view about the event being displayed by persons on the other side of the blue line. If I distill the alternate point of view for you, I'm no better than the television.
