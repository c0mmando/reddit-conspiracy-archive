What religion is going to win out?  What political ideology is going to lead the whole world into the future?  What race should dominate?  What nation should rule?  If we&#39;re going to go by the divisions we&#39;ve separated humanity into, then why not women?  </p>

<p>They are the largest group in the world.  And, oh, they&#39;ve been oppressed since, like, the beginning of humanity.  Maybe it is their time to run things.</p>

<p>Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs could explain why men initially needed to dominate the earth, but also could explain why women need to rule now and lead us to self actualization.</p>

<p>Global government made only of women?</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Edit:  Just want to add here.  The real rulers now, are probably men.  This would at least take the rug out from under the current power structure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, sexist.  Exactly right.  I would make the argument that the male form from an evolutionary perspective served humanity best at the lower levels of Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of needs, food, shelter, safety, security. . . Man&#39;s dominate physical form helped humanity fend off tigers and bears, live where it is hot and cold, be able to defend and protect.  Women, on the other hand, I believe, have their strength in helping humanity meet the higher levels of Maslow&#39;s hierarchy, self-esteem, love, self actualization.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course. We have a lot in common. I assume you have a fully functioning pre-frontal cortex. I assume you like music. You probably have a favorite movie or video game too. I&#39;ll bet you like animals; particularly mammals.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just funny when I hear the phrase &#39;evolutionary [whatever].&#39;</p>

<p>In your case you used &#39;evolutionary perspective&#39; in relation to women and traits you&#39;ve assigned to them. Traits <em>you&#39;ve</em> assigned to them. While I agree that there are certain strengths for both male and female psyche as well as physiological plusses and minuses the language &#39;evolutionary perspective&#39; itself is the lynch pin for me. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll explain:</p>

<p>As a poster on <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> I can assume that you likely do not believe in God. You&#39;ve used the word &#39;evolutionary.&#39; You&#39;re using Maslow&#39;s hierarchy in relation to evolution. You&#39;re discussing two theories as though they&#39;re more than theories. They are theories. People who discuss theories as though they&#39;re more than theories can be broken into three main types: academics, economists, laymen. I get the impression that you&#39;re a layman (no serious academic would bother themselves with <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a>).</p>

<p>So what some assumption I think you, as the layman I think you are, would probably hold?</p>

<p>I think you probably believe that the universe is made up of atoms and that we have galaxies due to the interactions of these particles as larger groupings. I think you think that life is a function of matter interactions. I think you think that consciousness is derived from matter and clever arrangements of matter. I think you think that random motions and random interactions gave rise to life and planets by pure chance through the magic of evolution. </p>

<p>This, however, is funny to me.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because there is no such thing as matter. Matter has yet to be found. I know about the claim made by Cern earlier this year, but I don&#39;t buy it. They stopped talking about it right quick. I think it was a P.R. stunt to secure more funding. They found a bump that kinda fits the description of the Higgs boson and then claimed it and then shut the hell up. Proving that matter exists for the first time ever is no small ting. This is literally one of the most important things to have ever happened. And they&#39;re currently silent about it. Fishy. One of the things they don&#39;t talk about is that the particles are field interactions. Let&#39;s assume that the Higgs boson is totally real and they really did find this thing that&#39;s really real. Okay. That particle is not a particle per se; it&#39;s a field interaction. Where did that field come from? What is the nature of that field? Cern has approximately jack shit to say about that. Which leaves us back at square one. Matter is A.) still completely unexplained and B.) a field interaction. We&#39;re now talking about repellent forces and not &#39;matter&#39; as I think you think it exists. That you should have a world view based on something that doesn&#39;t exist is a hell of a thing. It&#39;s no different, in my opinion, to believing that a sitting God exists.</p>

<p>Yes, you believe in something [matter] that is every bit as made-up as the Christian God.</p>

<p>You also believe in a theory [evolution] as though it&#39;s really real. It&#39;s a theory. It&#39;s a mental object. You believe in a mental object. If you think about that long enough it becomes highly amusing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also going to go out on a limb here and say that I think you probably think Richard Dawkins is a hell of a bright guy. I&#39;m also going to bet that you take seriously the words and ideas of Carl Sagan, Michio Kaku, Charles Darwin, and Bill Nye. Which is fine. Everyone&#39;s entitled to their opinions and beliefs. That said they&#39;re the McDonald&#39;s of the intellectual world. Homogenised, highly regulated, palatable for people who like stability, attractively packaged and devoid of any real nutritional value.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that I believe in God. I&#39;m not saying the theory of evolution doesn&#39;t have some valid points. I&#39;m not even saying that I don&#39;t live as though I don&#39;t experience matter as such. What I am saying is that I think these things are fine as theories, but that&#39;s as far as they go for me. </p>

<p>The key difference is that I don&#39;t believe in them. </p>

<p>You do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that women should be in charge. Men, for the most part, are too focused on immediate gratification and competition. If there is one thing women have in common, it is an appreciation for the value of proper child-rearing, and that is where humanity&#39;s salvation lies.</p>

<p>However, if we could somehow magically remove men from positions of authority and replace them with women, it would be a disaster. Society needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. The structure of our society as it is now is a male construction. Women who have some authority within the system got it by acting like men. I can&#39;t really call Hilary Clinton a woman.</p>

<p>But if we had a society that placed supreme value on the love and proper care of children, psychopathy would fall right off the radar. Without psychopathy (4% of adults in the US according to Dr. Martha Stout), we wouldn&#39;t have mad power struggles. We wouldn&#39;t have slavery. We wouldn&#39;t have war. Those things come about because of a lack of empathy, a lack of conscience. They are not &quot;human nature&quot; as we&#39;ve been propagandized. </p>

<p>Children need to be with at least one of the two parents every day for the first several years of life, ideally the first six. There&#39;s no way our current system would allow for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. We just need to make a serious move against the bad people, and ensure that ethical persons make it to office. This means abandoning parties and maybe thowing a HUGE fit.</p>

<p>And from then on putting our money where it MATTERS not just where it makes us feel good. Start taking a LONG view of the world. Just doing or going along with the feel-good &quot;right&quot; people (rather than &quot;correct&quot;) is decadant.</p>

<p>Not to say a little decadance is a bad thing, but when you live and breath BEING a part of something becasue it makes you feel good and avoid/attack rather than listen to other points of view...you are very self-indulgent and controled.</p>

<p>I guess it boils down to not getting manipulated any more by ANY ONE.</p>
