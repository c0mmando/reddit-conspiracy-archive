       9/11 was
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       effective that it literally incapacitated the majority of the world's population. The event was so diabolical, so
       <em>
        grand
       </em>
       , that it literally brought about an alchemical transmutation in the minds of the populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       The events that day polarized the world more than any before: some people were thrust further into the blindness of their "matrix", and others were catapulted directly out of it, being forced into Chapel Perilous.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've come a long way in my research surrounding this event (as have many of you), but I wasn't prepared for the revelations in this book:
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Most-Dangerous-Book-World/dp/1937584178/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355502572&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+most+dangerous+book+in+the+world">
        "The Most Dangerous Book in the World: 9/11 as Mass Ritual"
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why are the flight numbers on 9/11 so important?
      </p>
      <p>
       11...175...77...93...
      </p>
      <p>
       ...and what do they have to do with "the wickedest man in the world",
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley">
        Aleister Crowley?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Twin Towers, the Twin Pillars of Hercules, the Gemini of astrology, Jachin and Boaz of Freemasonry (with the "Salomon's" Temple Building 7 accompanying them)...were they constructed with the foreknowledge that they would be brought down in a fiery sacrificial cataclysm?
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does this have to do with the infamous Aleister Crowley? And what does the number 11 have do with all of this?
      </p>
      <p>
       In Crowley's own words: the number 11 is "the number of Magick in itself [and] therefore suitable to all types of operation. [It is] the sacred number par excellence of the new Aeon [the Aeon of Horus, Crowley's name for the new age, with himself as the prophet, of course.]"
      </p>
      <p>
       What better way to start a Mega-Ritual on the 11th day of September (111 days before the end of the year) than to have Flight 11 crash into the tower on the 93rd floor (the significance of that number will become apparent, if it isn't already).
      </p>
      <p>
       And the second plane? Flight 175 would soon smash into the
       <em>
        77th
       </em>
       floor of the other tower. We'll get to the 77, but for now what's the significance of 175?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since we're in the realm of Crowley, let's see what he had to say about 175.
      </p>
      <p>
       "There are three main methods of invoking any Deity...The 'First Method' consists of devotion to that Deity...a perfect instruction exists in Liber 175. This is the book of uniting to a particular Deity by devotion."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libri_of_Aleister_Crowley">
        Here's the Wikipedia page for the Libri of Crowley
       </a>
       . Note that 175 says "On uniting oneself to a Deity."
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you start to think this is getting way too esoteric, I'll give you three guesses as to which Deity was being invoked (and the first two don't count).
      </p>
      <p>
       Again in Crowley's own words: "I was not content to believe in a personal devil and serve him, in the ordinary sense of the word. I wanted to get hold of him personally and become his chief of staff."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, is there an unusual event that might give us an idea which Deity was invoked when 175 supposedly hit the tower?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you recall what the Commander in Thief at the time was doing, well then it should become painfully obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moment the 2nd plane hit the tower George W. Bush was reading
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Pet_Goat">
        "The Pet Goat"
       </a>
       in Sarasota, Florida, strangely enough just 10 miles away from Venice, the location of the flight school Mohamed Atta and another "hijacker" trained at. What a coincidence!
      </p>
      <p>
       This "reading" of The Pet Goat was essentially a "Black Mass", a "satirical ceremony, a Commander-in-Chief that wouldn't leave his seat until the reading of a story about a pet goat was completed ("I read this book that I may study the nature of my Deity,") during which time hundreds of his fellow Americans were in harm's way, many of them meeting horrific ends as they burned alive or plunged to their deaths from the towers ("Yet also may he deliberately practise cruelties")--conjuring the image of
       <a href="http://www.rootwerx.com/tarotdecks/bosch/the-tower/images/Rider-Waite_The_Tower_large.jpg">
        The Tower tarot card
       </a>
       --all taking place in..."Paradise," the city of Sarasota's unofficial yet widely-used nickname. Well How about that?"
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who still are unsure what Deity was being invoked,
       <a href="http://kkoagulaa.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/baphomet.jpg">
        here's an image that may give you a hint
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If you
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       think all of this is a stretch, hang on, it gets better (or worse, depending on how you look at it)!
      </p>
      <p>
       AA77 was supposedly piloted by an individual who, according to one of his instructors, "could not fly at all." And yet he was able to pull off an
       <em>
        incredible
       </em>
       stunt, and instead of attacking several more strategic points in the Pentagon, he just so happened to choose the very wing were the DoD's accounting division was located...and conveniently enough Donald Rumsfeld had announced the
       <em>
        day before
       </em>
       the attacks they they couldn't account for $2.3
       <em>
        trillion
       </em>
       in transactions. The records of this and interest in this announcement all but disappeared after the attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there significance to the number 77? You bet your occult-deciphering ass there is.

        Here's their seal

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       AA77 anyone???????
      </p>
      <p>
       From The Book of Lies: "7, the septenary; 11, the magical number; 77, the manifestation, therefore, of the septenary. Through matter, because 77 is written in Hebrew Ayin Zayin (OZ), and He-Goat, the symbol of matter, Capricornus, the Devil of the Tarot; which is the picture of the Goat of the Sabbath upon an altar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black Mass anyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan, lists 77 "infernal names" of the "Gods and Goddesses of the Royal Palace of Hell."
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets better: the Pentagon, which is 77 feet tall, is located on the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/77th_meridian_west">
        <em>
         77th meridian west!
        </em>
       </a>
       . Oh and George H.W. Bush, who first announced his plans for a "New World Order" on September 11th, 1990 (11 years before...well shit this is just getting too obvious), well daddy Bush was...77 at the time of the attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I'm not demonizing
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       of these numbers. Symbols can be used for good
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       evil, I don't believe a number can be inherently "evil." After all, "Symbols don't kill people; people with symbols kill people."
      </p>
      <p>
       Any more 77's we can add to this already overbearing occult script? You bet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure most of you are familiar with the "mystery plane" that was spotting in New York and above the Pentagon during the attacks. The plane has
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_E-4#September_11.2C_2001">
        since been identified
       </a>
       as the E-4B, a highly secretive and advanced plane also referred to as the "Doomsday Plane".
      </p>
      <p>
       A FOIA request
       <em>
        finally
       </em>
       got more information from the FAA in 2008 about this extremely unusual plane that should
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       have been there (unless it piloting the attack aircraft by remote control, but that opens a whole new can of worms. The call sign of this plane that was spotted above the Pentagon during the attack? VENUS77!
      </p>
      <p>
       For those that are astrologically-minded, the conjunctions of the planet Venus against the Zodiac
       <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m4vuo4c01W4/ULUX7nPQdBI/AAAAAAAAA74/7kuCnP21xYk/s1600/Example_Venus_pentagram.jpg">
        form a pentagram!
       </a>
       ...Venus invokes the pentagram (plenty of information available on this with a simple online search).
      </p>
      <p>
       So Flight 77 eliminates Rummy's dirty laundry (along with anyone else who knew too much) by hitting the 77-foot tall Pentagon (with 7 floors!), on the 77th meridian west, while the Doomsday Plane, call sign Venus77 (Pentagram 77!) circles above. Oh, and flight 175, the plane that evoked the "Deity", hit the 77th floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about that final number? Flight 11 hit floor 93...the final fateful flight that day was...drumroll...flight 93!
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who are familiar with Crowley, this 4th flight is by far the
       <em>
        easiest
       </em>
       to associate with the diabolical individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, there's an entire
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/93_%28Thelema%29">
        Wikipedia page
       </a>
       on the importance of the number 93 to Crowley and his religious philosophy Thelema. In fact, Thelemites ofter greet each other with "93" or will sign correspondences with "93/93" at the end. Flight 93...flight AA11 crashes into the 93rd floor...is this starting to make more or less sense?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a great deal of information out their on Building 7 as well, including it essentially being an occult-Masonic construct (Salomon building anyone?). It's 47 stories and trapezoidal shape can attest to that (the 47th Problem of Euclid, also known as the Pythagorean Theorem, "represents a perfect symbol of Freemasonry").
      </p>
      <p>
       There is of course a
       <em>
        whole
       </em>
       new can of worms to open with respect to the
       <em>
        astrological
       </em>
       importance of the 9/11 Mega-Ritual, but there is far too much information on this topic to delve into here, as this is already becoming long-winded.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, more information can be found in this
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkwBjLG1ULA&amp;feature=player_embedded#!">
        well-made series of Youtube videos.
       </a>
       In a nutshell, Saturn and Pluto achieved a position of powerful opposition on September 11th, 2001 (they are both considered to be "Lords of Death). Any astrologer can tell you that this alignment does
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       bode well for the people on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not you believe in astrology is irrelevant...what
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       relevant is that TPTB
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       believe in this stuff and they flaunt it in our faces because they
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you who
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       been studying these occult scripts, it should come as no surprise that Sirius would get dragged into this mess as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       From "The Most Dangerous Book": "Today's Coptic calendar (also called the Alexandrian calendar) is based on the ancient Egyptian calendar and is still used in Egypt, and also by the Coptic Orthodox Church. The first month of the year is named Thout, after Thoth, and thus the first day of the New Year is the 1st of Thout. On the Gregorian calendar, this date coincides with September 11th--so that date is not only New Year's Day, but, more importantly, it is the symbolic, or observed, date of Sirius' heliacal rising."
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the precession of the equinoxes has shifted this a bit, and today that date has shifted 45 days...now the heliacal rising of Sirius occurs on August 5th.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll never guess which date
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       the Statue of Liberty (really an homage to both Isis and Lucifer) and the Twin Towers were "initiated"...August 5th! (Oh, and the Pentagon was initiated in a Masonic ceremony on September
       <em>
        11th
       </em>
       1941.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The occult importance of Sirius is beyond the scope of this post, but just trust me that it's important! Did TPTB do anything to associated the event with the word "Sirius?" You betcha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do a search for 9/11 and Sirius and you'll find that the only K-9 (K=11...11-9...9-11...maybe I need to slow down a bit) who died on that fateful day was named.......SIRIUS. Sirius was dog number 17...17 is The Star in the Tarot...which according to occultists depicts the star of SIRIUS. cough.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think it's overkill that they would name and sacrifice a dog merely to add another layer to their occult script, well then you still don't really get how these events work. The
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       symbolism they cram into the rituals, the more powerful the ritual becomes.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
       with the other of another book on this topic (which I haven't read) "Prophet of Evil: Aleister Crowley, 9/11 and the New World Order".
      </p>
      <p>
       In closing I should mention that S.K. Bain, the author of "The Most Dangerous Book in the World: 9/11 as Mass Ritual", predicted a false flag event in Phoenix last Christmas which obviously didn't come to pass (although he seemed to leave it open for the next few years while Obama is still president). That being said, while he lost some credibility for this failed prediction, it doesn't affect the overall credibility of the 9/11-Crowley connection in my eyes, which seems increasingly plausible after considering all these "coincidences".

       Great thoughts here, and a great post. let's not close our minds immediately to the potential of this being a possibility; after all, if TPTB orchestrated this attack and have been able to keep it semi under wraps for this long, it would not be much of a stretch to say they are capable of the things suggested by OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an occultist, this summary resonates within me. What we perceive with our five senses in this reality, especially in relation to what we think we know about the ritual that was/still is "9/11" , is far from the whole picture.

       Thanks! This got over 150 upvotes when I posted it a while back, and I thought that some people who may have missed it last time (or who have since joined) might get something out of this information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think, however, it's a little too "out there" now that the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       user base has been broadening as of late.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I've said elsewhere, I don't exactly endorse all of this stuff...it's a summary I made of a provocative and fascinating book I read that I thought I would share.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I think that unequivocally discounting all this information merely because the premise appears absurd or implausible is not a good enough reason.

       You've already made a fatal error when you assumed it was a "ritual".
How can you expect us to not close OUR minds and keep them open when it's clear you're not doing the same and have already made assumptions?
In the beginning of the paragraph, you're telling people to have an open mind, and by the last sentence you've already showed that you're drawing your own conclusions and speaking in a biased manner based on them.

       i have my own thoughts, and the closing paragraph of my previous statement was made from a personal perspective. I believe that there is potential for just about any possibility, and I will also weigh everything with healthy skepticism. I do not expect anyone to adopt my way of thinking or theories, in reference to anything discussed here. Go start an argument with someone who gives a fuck.

       Very interesting!  It would seem almost impossible for an elite group to pull off such a heist, who's planning would span several decades (and therefore several different generations of people)... It is almost like there is an evil entity that works through man to pull this shit off...

       Or you could read some text on gematria and kabbalah. Believe it or not, "The Number 23" was neither the first nor last word on the subject. And whether you accept "numerology" as a meaningful philosophy, it is absolutely apparent that many high powered organizations and individuals take the subject very seriously.

       I spent far too many years reading and researching occult texts back in the day, thinking that there must be something in it. It was all bullshit and waste of time. There was nothing in it. I might as well have spent all that time reading about fucking unicorns for all the worth it had.

       Fine, let them be delusional retards, that doesn't mean that they won't employ their delusions in their plots. And if the practice of gematria is being used in real life applications, then it has validity, if only from an anthropological dimension. To deny the study entirely, as though the "irrationality" alone is enough to discredit it, is to deny an arguably important piece of data about the motivations of the self-styled "puppet-masters".

       Agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I've said elsewhere ITT, the specific offices that were targeted on all three buildings housed important pre-9/11 insider trading information.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems logical that the
       <em>
        primary
       </em>
       motive for targeting specific floors like that, however it was accomplished, would be to destroy this information.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the absurdly unlikely maneuver pulled off by the "pilot" of flight 77 just happened to hit the section of the Pentagon that was working on the missing money Rumsfield had just announced the day earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if whoever pulled this off was going through the trouble of eliminating precise floors, it would be easy to assign them to numbers with occult significance. They need not even be "occultists" themselves, it could've been
       <em>
        making fun
       </em>
       of occultists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, whatever they did and however they did it worked, because they certainly got away with it...so far.

       It was announced long before that. People knew the money was unaccounted (not missing - how many more times do we have to come here and explain the background again?) for long before that. It just happened to be announced again that day you're quoting.

       How on Earth did that "pilot" of flight 77 pull off that insane turn that
       <em>
        just happened

       to hit the exact spot in the Pentagon that housed the records of the "missing" billions that Donald Rumsfield famously announced missing the

       It seems extremely likely that these airplanes were remotely piloted, and if you don't think that's possible, then you've woefully underestimated our technological capabilities.

       As for the Number 23, I'll pass on that bit of Hollywood propaganda trash, and as for me "calming down", I wrote this summary last year and am reposting because of today's rather auspicious date. I assure you I've calmed down completely since then :D

       You're conflating coincidences that don't even exist now.
      </p>
      <p>
       What sort of person who claims to have researched 9/11 still believes that the money was "missing" rather than being unaccounted for, and that it was only announced that day, and not previously, and that the money has mainly since been accounted for?
      </p>

       Why would you think it's easier to remotely pilot a plane rather than pilot it manually? It's
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       to remote pilot a plane, but a remote pilot wouldn't be as accurate as someone actually sitting in the cabin.

       I'm sorry, but you don't seem to understand the Occult enough to make this appear as anything except wayyyyy off base. While it's possible 9/11 was an "inside job", you're grasping at straws with the numerology and it's more than a stretch to try and tie this to Crowley. Most people blame him as the "boogeyman" of our times regarding the supernatural, and those that know the truth about the Dark Arts are prone to laughter at the uninformed misdirection.
       <br/>
       I mean no disrespect, but to those that practice magick, this is preposterous.

       You do realize that this entire post is a summary of someone else's work, right? It seems that your quarrel is with S.K. Bain, the author of the book, and not me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think it's such a stretch to make the Crowley connection? You seem to dismiss it outright, but the sheer amount of curious numerical connections is enough to warrant a serious examination of this possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       S.K. Bain isn't the only person to notice these connections, as the author of this book (which I haven't read) makes clear in the title and front cover,
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Prophet-Evil-Aleister-Crowley-World/dp/1460920694/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1378922722&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=Prophet+of+Evil%3A+Aleister+Crowley%2C+9%2F11+and+the+New+World+Order">

       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I respect your opinion, but this has nothing to do with
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       personal "understanding" of the Occult. None of this is my own original work, nor do I completely endorse it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'm extremely intrigued by all of this, and I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       in fact have a rudimentary understanding of the occult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps those that carried out this event have a
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       different perspective of the occult and magick than even yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said before, I choose to keep an open mind on this subject...do you think you could elaborate as to why you think all of this is preposterous?

       "but the sheer amount of curious numerical connections is enough to warrant a serious examination of this possibility."
Yeah, but no. You can connect numbers like that to anything. 
Okay, let's suppose this is real.
Why crash both towers if they're symbolic of Boaz and Jachin? One denotes chaos and the other order? It wouldn't make sense to destroy both.
You're trying to support a theory based on evidence which you yourself admit to not having read regarding Crowley.
Those familiar with Crowley or Thelemic followers would see the fallacy in trying to connect the unrelated dots.
       <br/>
       Why would occultists destroy the towers?  An offering to some higher deity?  No, maybe if you were the one flying the plane and sacrificing your own life, you might have a point. Those that practice ritual sacrifice know that real powers is gained from personal sacrifice, not from throwing others onto a pyre.
The whole "Statue of Liberty" thing is pure speculation and if you've studied both sides of the coin the argument can go either way. It's a symbol of Freedom or of "The Goddess". Even if it were pagan in origin, that has NOTHING TO DO WITH SATANISM.
It also seems to suggest that the only dog that was killed on 9/11 was named Sirius (so what?  Sirius is the "Dog Star" and not an uncommon moniker for canines) and because of that, it's evidence?  I understand perfectly in the layered meaning of symbolism when working with the occult, and due to that, I can also see when people choose to "matrix" and try to connect associations that aren't really there. If you had included some Sumerian references to the Sirius star and it's meaning, it might come off as a bit more credible, but still a thousand miles off mark.
Crowley wasn't into "Satanism", if anything he was into heroin and trying to contact "Lam". This little alien guy he claims to have invoked. 
See, people that don't see a bigger picture always bring "Satanism" to the front of the stage, as if that explains things. Unless your a practicing christian, "Satan" isn't really that old. Just as old as Christianity, a couple thousand years. All the good stuff lies MUCH further back than that. Crowley knew this, any practicing magickan worth their weight in salt knows this.
       <br/>
       You are literally pulling numbers at random and making them fit to reinforce your personal point of view. 
Don't believe me?
Pick any major event in history, look up the corresponding dates and numerical coincidences and you will find the same thing. I'm sure you will find a way to make it fit.
"Call sign Venus 77"....
Yeah, she's the god of love. You certainly wouldn't want to bring her into the ritual if it's intent was destructive. It would be countering energy to the goal.
Put that stuff aside for a moment....
You really expect anyone to think that this was a ritual because they crashed the plane into a certain floor?  How did the suicide pilots know to do that? Did the count the floors as they were racing towards them in their death throes to make sure they got the right floor?  Do you really think their orders were that they must crash it into 93rd and 77th floor?
What happens if they got the wrong floor?  The whole ritual is moot?
       <br/>
       C'mon, man.
You're looking at clouds and making the shapes fit into what you want them to be.
I love a good conspiracy, but this is hokey at best.

       Below is stanza 44 of Liber Astarté, pay careful attention to the footnote indicated in the text by the brackets:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And as many Deities demand sacrifice, one of men, another of cattle, a third of doves, let these sacrifices be replaced by the true sacrifices in thine own heart. Yet if thou must symbolise them outwardly for the hardness of thine heart, let thine own blood, and not another's, be spilt before that altar. [The exceptions to this rule pertain neither to this practice, nor to this grade. N. Fra. A.·. A.·..]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now consider the following postscript from the letter "The Secret Chiefs" in "Magick without Tears" wherein Crowley discusses the motivations of the Secret Chiefs, a class of master far beyond human:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But if the Secret Masters have these boundless powers, why do they allow you to be plagued by printers, held up for lack of secretaries,worried by all sorts of practical problems? ... There are several lives of reply; coalescing, they suffice; 1. What is "wrong"? Since four wars is Their idea of "right" you may well ask by what standard you may judge events.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       With the above points made from a central text of Thelema and the consideration of the "Prophet of Ra-hoor-khuit", can you imagine that at some level of the path described by the Book of the Law, some entity or entities may see very real reason to engage in human sacrifice as opposed to self-sacrifice?
      </p>
      <p>
       And to say that Crowley was "into heroin and trying to contact "Lam"" is a ridiculous dismissal. He was an extremely prolific author, traveled extensively, trafficked in elite circles over the entire world, and was a verifiable member of countless fraternities and occult organizations. His contributions spanned from purely magickal theory to psychology and mountain climbing. I don't know what flavor of "occult knowledge" you fancy, but I can pretty much guarantee that within the vast body of literature Crowley produced, you can find the modern underpinnings of your own practices.

       I admit that Crowley was able to see what the true practice is about to a degree, but that's exactly why he would laugh about the idea of 9/11 being a mass sacrifice.  What's the endgame?  Oppression? Because excuses for war and shepherding the masses was going on long before that.  And IF that was some kind of mass sacrifice, it was a piss poor one. By that logic, every act of war could be claimed as a possible ritual offering.  And while Crowley did contribute to the art, I cannot say it was in a positive way, though popular. In the end, his light was wasted and he fell to his addictions and ego. His is a cautionary tale, though it's a wonder why so many emulate him. He missed the point.
I believe the Gov't cannot be trusted, but have still yet to see anything that offers an even remotely convincing argument that would tie 9/11 to Crowley or any kind of magical rite. 
Even tied all together, there's holes big enough in the theory to pass 3 planes through.  It just doesn't add up as an occult work.

       I don't think you have demonstrated that Crowley would "laugh" at the idea of 9/11 being a ritual in the sense that you intend. I think he would be chuckling to himself about how obvious a ritual it was and about how few people recognized it.
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to every war being a ritual sacrifice, read Rudolf Steiner in Karma of Untruthfulness. He makes a very strong case that, in fact, every organized conflict between nations/organizations is essentially systemic human sacrifice. It certainly wouldn't be an original thought in terms of occult literature.
      </p>
      <p>
       How was Crowley's contribution to the "art" not positive? With the notable exception of Austin Osman Spare, Crowley's work shaped literally every occult movement of the 20th century (and really, his influence contributed to Spare's insights in the negative sense).
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you interested in Wicca, or neo-paganism? If so, Gardner largely cribbed his Goddess invocations from Liber AL Vel Legis, spawning thousands of spinoffs from Asatru to modern celtic practicioners. Are you interested in Taoism? Crowley translated and disseminated one of the best translations of the Tao te Ching and wrote extensively about the I Ching. What about tarot? He instructed the creation of the thoth deck.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is rightly considered a luminary in the world of the occult. You seem to focus on his heroin addiction. He was prescribed heroin for his asthma. Conversely, you don't seem to mention how he kicked his rampant cocaine addiction. Or even that he wrote about the dangers of drug abuse. Diary of a Drug Fiend is a cautionary tale that ultimately resolves when the main characters begin practicing thelema.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how can you tell his light was wasted? He influenced pretty much every major figure of the counter-culture of the 60s. Here's a short list:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The Beatles
       </li>
       <li>
        Led Zeppelin
       </li>
       <li>
        Jimmy Page of Zeppelin
       </li>
       <li>
        Black Sabbath
       </li>
       <li>
        The Doors
       </li>
       <li>
        Frank Zappa
       </li>
       <li>
        Timothy Leary
       </li>
       <li>
        Aldous Huxley
       </li>
       <li>
        Stanley Kubrick
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And the list can go on. That's not even getting into current politicians who have been influenced (or grandfathered "ahem Bushes") by Crowley.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you name another individual who managed to achieve as much through his devotion solely to magick? Who gets a nod in your book?
      </p>
      <p>
       As to his ends, he died of a respiratory infection. He didn't die of an overdose, he didn't die in some crazy debauched ceremony, he died of a respiratory infection at the age of 72 in 1947 (what was the average lifespan then?). How is that a wasted life (the inversion of the 27 club I might add...)
      </p>
      <p>
       I am convinced of the esoteric symbolism inherent in the 9/11 spectacle. The gematria is convincing. The effects are manifold. The obvious parties involved (if you are convinced of the inside job theory, as I am) have all benefited greatly from the ritual. Halliburton received untold billions in contracts; Bush continued on to a second term due in large measure to the constant state of war 9/11 created; the entire PNAC received every one of their stated policy goals. If it was a ritual working, it was a fabulously successful ritual working. 9/11 perfectly fits the Crowley definition of magick:

       If you still think "suicide pilots" were responsible for crashing those planes, then I guess I misinterpreted your position on the events of 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       I shouldn't have assumed that everyone commenting in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       questions the "official" story. Do you believe the government's version of events? Because if so, this particular 9/11 conspiracy is at the very end of a long rabbit hole of conspiracies that you have to wade through first.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this was the first conspiratorial claim regarding 9/11 I ever heard, I would dismiss it completely as gibberish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put into context with everything else, however, the picture emerges much more bleak.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the very floors and offices of
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       towers
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the Pentagon housed important documents regarding pre-9/11 insider trading information. These
       <em>
        happened
       </em>
       to be the very floors all 3 planes hit on their respective buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they could pull something like that off, then all the occult mumbo jumbo would be a secondary motive...a nice artistic (and sadistic) touch to complete the ritual.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the
       <em>
        primary
       </em>
       motive for targeting specific floors was likely to cleanly remove the information about
       <em>
        that very attack
       </em>
       and other shady dealings by the same folks. The occult stuff with the numbers was just added because, well, they could.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows, perhaps they were actually making
       <em>
        fun
       </em>
       of occultists and occult rituals, which is the reason why it seems so absurd and non-occultish to you. You see, it
       <em>
        doesn't have to be occultists
       </em>
       who pulled something like this off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the connection to Jachin and Boaz is superficial at best, and one I listed along with several other examples. It especially fits in this context because WTC7 was known as the Saloman building...a name whose significance I should hardly have to explain to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The connection to the twin pillars of Freemasonry is not relevant to the Crowleyesque false false element of their destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember,
       <em>
        this is not my conspiracy theory
       </em>
       . You seem to be directing this at me by saying I'm "literally pulling numbers at random and making them fit to reinforce my personal point of view".
      </p>
      <p>

       Why? I've read a lot of Crowley and what the OP posts doesn't seem very preposterous. In Magick without Tears, Crowley suggests that everybody investigate his/her life in terms of kabbalistic correspondences and gematria. Given the nature of some of Crowley's letters to disciples and admirers, and his penchant for drawing magickal correspondences to every day events, I don't think Crowley would have any objection to the exercise the OP engaged in.

       The letter is titled "The Qabalah: the Best Training for Memory" if you'd like to read it for yourself.

       And let me guess, you're an "expert" on occult and esoteric knowledge? Please. Get the fuck out of here with your closed mind and self-righteousness. Doodling pentagrams and reading the Tibetan Book of the Dead does not make you The Occultist, and you should feel ashamed for even taking such a notary title.

       And you are uniformed and watch too much television if you would think I would use such things as credentials.
       <br/>
       I'm not the moron spouting off to try and impress, I am the one who is secure in his confidence and the knowledge that my works and experiences are beyond what you can conceive, disprove or entertain in the proper light. I am your dweller on the threshold, if you can get past me and break your chains, you'll be wiser for it. If not, you'll just have to continue to wallow in ignorance. Sound conceded? If you've already judged me as that then you have failed. Try again with the next Dweller.
Best of luck to you.
Also, a Masonic temple would be the perfect place for an orgy due to the latent Orgone still lingering about the place.

       OK, there's way too much bullshit in that to actually read but this one's particularly intellectually challenging.

       So you mean to tell us that the pilots of those planes were able to target ONE SPECIFIC FLOOR that is about 10' tall?

      <p>
       Possibly... POSSIBLY... if they were extremely experienced fighter pilots flying a state-of-the-art fighter plane, maybe.

       When I disagree when someone in this sub, no matter how outlandish their remarks/claims may be, I
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       insult them or cast doubts on their sanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only is it counter-productive, but it makes you look uninformed and rude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to respond to your post...
       <em>
        these aren't my claims
       </em>
       . This is the summary of someone else's book...did you miss that part of my post?
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, wouldn't it make sense, assuming that this crazy "bullshit" scenario has any semblance of truth, that if they were trying to hit
       <em>
        exact
       </em>
       floors (which also happened to contain the records of certain sensitive financial information, at
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       the WTC complex and the Pentagon) that they would remotely pilot the aircraft? This would ensure the accuracy of their targets.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's entirely possible to fly a jumbo jet remotely, and it has been suggested that this "Doomsday" plane was doing just that (though obviously this scenario doesn't rely on this particular explanation).

       Looking through your comment history, I stumbled upon the difference between you and me.

        You have a low opinion of people. Which is fine, I share it. The vast majority of them are stupid, lazy, unthinking, uncaring beasts and get what they deserve.

      <p>
       There is so much about that statement that I disagree with...no wonder we don't see eye to eye.
