        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We are no longer capable of resisting in any organized way when overt tyranny occurs.</p>

<p>We know that the NSA has tapped the backbone of the internet, installed splitter cables directly on ISP servers, and backdoored every operating system, CPU chip, and router.  The NSA can even hijack our cell phones to use the camera and microphone as a surveillance bug.  Each of us has a &quot;shadow profile&quot; on facebook whether we use facebook or not (do a search on &quot;facebook shadow profile&quot; to learn how invasive these are), and facebook has trackers on many websites, as does Google.</p>

<p>Internet marketing trackers such as facebook and Google create personal files on each of us.  Law Enforcement has access to these profiles, and the information therein holds more information than mere marketing preferences.  Our profiles detail the specific webpages we visit and record the time we visited them.  Law Enforcement can easily use this data to construct a psychological profile identical to the type used to identify criminal suspects.</p>

<p>We know that the NSA spies particularly on judges and elected officials.  I believe the NSA&#39;s purpose is <strong>blackmail</strong>.  &quot;<em>Vote this way or information about your extramarital affair/shady campaign contributor will get &#39;leaked&#39; anonymously to a journalist</em>.&quot;  When the CIA recruits sources overseas, it prefers to use blackmail instead of bribes/payments because blackmail does not depend on loyalty or trust, but on fear.  I believe that our elected officials have been compromised, and their future replacements will be equally compromised.</p>

<p>No &quot;second American Revolution&quot; is possible now.  I have studied what is declassified about CIA activities in countries such as Chile, Brazil, Indonesia, Argentina, Greece, etc.  As far back as the 1960s, the CIA compiles lists of targets (union organizers, political activists, academics, organizational leadership, etc.), and those targets quietly disappear.  Organized opposition is beheaded of leadership, leaving a disorganized public unable to coordinate effective resistance.</p>

<p>Tyrants don&#39;t fear rioters.  Angry mobs are random and just make a temporary mess of things.  Look at the &#39;68 Riots, the LA Riots, or even Egypt now.  Tyrants are not threatened by mobs taking to the streets.  Mass public protests alone don&#39;t topple regimes.</p>

<p>Mass armed resistance would be futile because local police departments have been militarized and coordinate with federal agencies and the military through <strong>fusion centers</strong>.  All they have to do is shutdown the power grid, place roadblocks at every roadway intersecting a trouble spot, sweep neighborhoods one at a time until each sector is cleared, and move to the next sector.  Their forces would be concentrated while the people would be kept dispersed and sequentially isolated.  Of course, the media would characterize resistance as &quot;terrorist,&quot; &quot;insurgent,&quot; &quot;mob violence,&quot; or whatever else might be effective for turning us against each other.  Divide and conquer, sector by sector.</p>

<p>Forming wilderness communities would just make targets of those who gather to them.  Recall how such communities were targeted under the Clinton Administration.  All of them were infiltrated by FBI agents and/or informants, and secluded communities are easily isolated and surrounded.  Remember Waco or Ruby Ridge?</p>

<p>It&#39;s already too late for us should things turn for the worst.  Be sure to say &quot;hello&quot; when you see me in the detention center.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you are. Debate his points. Why isn&#39;t resistance futile? His post is the doorway for the best kind of post. Why is he wrong, specifically?</p>

<p>I think resistance is not futile because:</p>

<p>Infighting will prevent a lot of the coordination that the OP is basing his view upon. When the money system dries up, you don&#39;t end up with a unified country, you end up with a bunch of suddenly unfunded pensions and pissed off soldiers/cops/agents. So now you have a bunch of well armed/well trained people floating around and making trouble. </p>

<p>Most likely, agencies like the CIA/NSA will promote any information that makes their organization appear to be &quot;omniscient&quot;. As such, any story that paints the intelligence agencies as unstoppable boogey men is probably not true.</p>

<p>The method of quelling disobedience described above, identify leaders and malcontents and eliminate, is a methodology that works on a certain population. How can we develop organizations, or support networks, that don&#39;t lend themselves to that kind of dispersal? I think there is a lot to be said for leaderless movements. The intelligence agencies use them when they fund terrorist cells, maybe thats because they are difficult for law enforcement to target. Could public groups use  similar organizational tactics (not terrorism) to negate the dragnet? I think there might be a way.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think armed resistance is necessarily the way to go. We exist in a world where we can all talk together. And if I can&#39;t talk to power, I can talk to his supporters. And more importantly, good hearted people with more power to motivate positive behavior can talk to the supporters and draw them back to the fold of civilization.</p>

<p>There are still reasons to think we can progress intelligently. We need to focus on those reasons, or hopes, and try to shape the world to the good. Don&#39;t give up the ghost until you have to.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just so easy to smear those pussy pinko liberal types.</p>

<p>To me, the sabotage of socialism is the greatest ideological conspiracy of the 20th century.</p>

<p>Can you feel the subliminal programming filling you with ridicule and revulsion at the words &quot;communist&quot;, &quot;socialist&quot; or &quot;Marxist&quot;.</p>

<p>Sheep: &quot;Communism doesn&#39;t work - look at the Soviet Union, look at China&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m probably preaching to the converted here, but the failure of socialism is a conspiracy. The Soviet Union was thoroughly infiltrated from day one, just like China. Foster maintainence of a war mentality - groom a corruptible leader - conduct a couple of purges of the principled folks in senior positions and, hey, you&#39;ve got an easily manipulated dictatorship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The failure of socialism/ communism/ fascism is not a conspiracy, as it did not actually fail. The states representing it failed. Imagine government as a a number line (-) being anarchy (+) being monarchy. The more + you go the more centralized power becomes, the names are just different numbers in succession of each other until it is all in the hands of one person, or - would have power in the hands of all people. We are moving into a centralization of power as we speak. Thus moving towards socialism. </p>

<p>Remember, everyone has the same power, we have just given them our share over the last 100 years. I think its time to take it back, maybe even by force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That instant will never come, by all counts this revolution should have happened years ago, but it didn&#39;t. The American people have grown used to tyranny and will be afraid of their lives and family when the actual shit hits the fan. Most people don&#39;t have the balls to fight completely alone, because when you do fight in that manner you have basically declared your own death.</p>

<p>This vision you have of Americans coming together in large groups and being organized is not how its going to go down. In fact daily life as it passes now will still pass. You seem to think that the government will do something that will destroy regular life and thus force Americans to start fighting. It ain&#39;t gonna happen. Nothing will change in terms of living conditions, at least not for the middle class. The rest will fall to the way side, Americans are already used to seeing people on the streets, a few more isn&#39;t going to change anything.</p>

<p>Those who have will hold on for dear life and those who don&#39;t have will not have a voice to speak out. It will be a lot less spectacular than you imagine in your head. The process will be slow, in fact you could say its happening right now, did you pick up a gun and  go fight to get your government under control? No you didn&#39;t you are waiting for the rest, you are waiting for something to happen and in your mind this event will trigger a state of combat. </p>

<p>This will not happen, you ARE slowly being strangled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yep, I used to think that way. people just have to come to terms with the fact that this is a long con and a slow descent..</p>

<p>it&#39;s not like one day the TV is just gonna start broadcasting the emergency martial law loop.. we&#39;re already in the beginning of the asphyxiation. we&#39;ll get more puppets to vote in, more puppets will be voted out, and life will carry on. it will just be more dangerous to post in places like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> since we&#39;re going to be increasingly marginalized and thought-crime is a sin.</p>

<p>pointing out inconsistencies will become more dangerous and slowly but surely we&#39;ll eventually start getting the same &#39;disappearances&#39; that the Latin American countries faced at the hand of the CIA for decades.</p>

<p>if it comes down to it, I&#39;ll be smiling in the detention center, though probably depressed as shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing will change in terms of living conditions for the middle class?</p>

<p>Are you kidding!? Everything has changed for the middle class! The middle class is a former husk of what it once was. And evidence suggests that with the tanking economy and rising costs of EVERYTHING the middle class will cease to exist in the near future. Just a tiny fraction of a percent of the extremely wealthy, and then everyone else poor, scared, ignorant, and unaware of their power in numbers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If by middle class you mean a generation that has borrowed its riches on interest and has never had to economize then I agree. That group of people will quickly fade away, but what you call middle class we in Europe call being rich. Your proportions on wealth are just completely skewed imo. The problem is many Americans don&#39;t know how to live sober lives. Most houses Iv seen the &quot;middle class&quot; inhabit are HUGE compared to what is standard in your average European city. Add to the culture of lending the advantages it has given to itself by the petrodollar and you have a people who are completely disconnected from the economical reality of the world.</p>

<p>But I agree with you that the middle class is dying and I was wrong in saying everything&#39;s &quot;A-okay&quot;. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that people will keep cooping, you&#39;re not gonna pick up a gun because you can&#39;t afford your 3 cars and mansion anymore in fact people are less likely to fight if they are poor because it takes an immense amount of energy to stay alive. And it is a lot easier to accept government unemployment benefits then fight that hand that&#39;s feeding you. And as long as people are dependent on the government for their survival they aren&#39;t going to lift a finger, definitely not those who have been born in this system of passivity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop downvoting this post, it&#39;s probably the most debate-provoking thread of the week! You may be right. We are a marginalized group. By participating here on r/conspiracy, I&#39;m sure we all have a special icon on our files that indicate we&#39;re the first to be disappeared. Every single option that we have at this point is utter fail, with one exception:</p>

<p>We need to wake up our fellow citizens before they hit us again with another false flag attack and shut down our communications. The more people we can wake up before that happens, the more likely that one of us will eventually succeed. It&#39;s sad, but enjoy one another while we can, because we&#39;re all going to be on our own soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about going after the puppets, but the controllers.  Their numbers are few; of course they are few, they don&#39;t allow new people to join.  Remove their power, and we may not take back everything we have, but it will no longer go to them, and we can work from there.  Never think &quot;It&#39;s over we.  We lost.&quot;  You are still asleep if you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding the point of the original post, yes, it&#39;s almost certainly too late, primarily due to the sabotage of organised labor (see previous comment).</p>

<p>For the stubborn, The Corbett Report has a great video on how to &quot;resist&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyone who thinks they have a chance to beat law enforcement is a fantasist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Silence does not stop the spread of fear. Why is he wrong? How is law enforcement being successfully &quot;resisted&quot;? How about instances of the law enforcement agencies being on &quot;the people&#39;s&quot; side? Make the counter-argument to negate the fear. Telling somebody that &quot;You are the problem&quot; doesn&#39;t advance the conversation.</p>

<p>*Ironically I started my last comment to you with &quot;No, you are.&quot; But the point remains, the conversation doesn&#39;t stop with &quot;You are the problem&quot;</p>

Any standard debunking of marxism or communism doesn&#39;t just focus on Stalin and Mao, it focuses on the underlying causes of why these systems fail. Have you ever read about human nature, competition, and why the economic theory of labor is horseshit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The failure of socialism/ communism/ fascism is not a conspiracy, as it did not actually fail. The states representing it failed. Imagine government as a a number line (-) being anarchy (+) being monarchy. The more + you go the more centralized power becomes, the names are just different numbers in succession of each other until it is all in the hands of one person, or - would have power in the hands of all people. We are moving into a centralization of power as we speak. Thus moving towards socialism. </p>

<p>Remember, everyone has the same power, we have just given them our share over the last 100 years. I think its time to take it back, maybe even by force.</p>
