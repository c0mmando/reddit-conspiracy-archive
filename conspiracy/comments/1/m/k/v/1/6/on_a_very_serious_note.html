        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just want to take this moment after the recent shooting to reach out to everyone here.  While we are taught from a relatively young age that violence is part of the human condition, I want you to know that it clearly is not.  I also want to point out that if you have the urge to do, or are planning, something violent that you can make a better choice.  </p>

<p>One thing David Icke says that I really like, which he paraphrased from Einstein, is that in order to fix the problems made by a certain level of consciousness you will need a higher level of consciousness to find a lasting resolution to the problem.  Violence is the last era&#39;s answer to problems and it is up to us to not follow that mindset.  </p>

<p>If you are struggling with mental illness, or violent thoughts, in any way then I strongly urge you to seek private, professional help.  While I accept that psychology is an imperfect science, it certainly has it&#39;s merits and can help if you are having trouble in your life dealing with certain things.   Let&#39;s all try to remember that every one of us has the ability to change the world around us just by making different decisions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Incorrect, throughout history violence has been used by the men in power.  This is a common thread, even within domestic disputes.  That said, it is absolutely not normal human behavior at all and the fact that you think it is makes me question what type of people you are spending time with.  Of all the people I have ever known, pretty much none of them were violent.  Again, violence is typically something the chief uses to control the masses; not an everyday part of the human condition.  </p>

<p>I would say that this is not entirely necessary <em>at all</em> for many.  The professional establishment in this society is controlled by powers <em>not</em> interested in bettering the society in the first place.  They are, after all, the same powers that have convinced you and all of us that the human condition is one bourn of violence - a perspective you yourself understand is exceedingly flawed.

<p>Unfortunately, Western medicine and techniques tend to talk you from one ledge (psychological)...and onto another (medicated) one that&#39;s just as bad if not worse.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Medication is not a bad or horrible thing in itself.  Not at all.  However - and again - the manner in which much of the West seems to prescribe it seems to do more harm than good by virtue of its focusing more on the effect than the cause of various ailments.  As a result, it often legitimately cures very, very little.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What has violence ever accomplished? What has it ever created? No martyr&#39;s cause has ever been stilled by an assassin&#39;s bullet. ... No wrongs have ever been righted by riots and civil disorders. A sniper is only a coward, not a hero; and an uncontrolled, uncontrollable mob is only the voice of madness, not the voice of reason. ... Whenever any American&#39;s life is taken by another American unnecessarily - whether it is done in the name of the law or in the defiance of the law, by one man or a gang, in cold blood or in passion, in an attack of violence or in response to violence - whenever we tear at the fabric of the life which another man has painfully and clumsily woven for himself and his children, the whole nation is degraded.

<p>Unfortunately, Western medicine and techniques tend to talk you from one ledge (psychological)...and onto another (medicated) one that&#39;s just as bad if not worse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would certainly not take any meds they prescribed as someone else pointed out, unless you have an issue verified without disclosure by multiple doctors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Medication is not a bad or horrible thing in itself.  Not at all.  However - and again - the manner in which much of the West seems to prescribe it seems to do more harm than good by virtue of its focusing more on the effect than the cause of various ailments.  As a result, it often legitimately cures very, very little.</p>
