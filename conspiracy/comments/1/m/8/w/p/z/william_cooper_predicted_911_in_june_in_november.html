    <div class="md"><p>This guy William Cooper is a VERY interesting subject. What i found most strange was that he has VERY VERY rarely been talked about on Coast to Coast AM, where you think he&#39;d be someone they&#39;d talk about. Also, i find it really interesting that he hated Alex Jones, who many of us in the conspiracy world have listened to/viewed his movies. He went as far to call him a scaremonger during Y2K</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the video of William Cooper talking about Alex Jones. this is the first part, you can find the rest on youtube really easily . <a href="http://youtu.be/NAgTFWglHrc">http://youtu.be/NAgTFWglHrc</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>My take is that who ever is promoting fear the best gets a fast track to the top. Alex Jones has done some good n the past but unfortunately he hasn&#39;t evolved. The main thing holding him back is that he&#39;s making too much money now so he doesn&#39;t want to rock the boat. It&#39;s just our economic system right now, but i think a major change in coming and at some point Alex will change him tune. </p>

<p>Thing is that show goes into ghosts, aliens, bigfoot, vampires, you name it, as well as some real events. </p>

<p>Its an entertainment show and people like hearing stories about ghosts, aliens, chupacabras, you name it... They don&#39;t say this is fact, they say hey we&#39;ve got an interesting guest here and we&#39;ll speak about ghosts or about 9/11 or about spying or about big foot, etc...</p>

<p>Whether you agree with the info or the guests or the hosts is another issue. </p>

<p>Some people believe in bigfoot, some belive in aliens, etc... </p>

<p>Not everything is disinfo if it doesn&#39;t fit perfectly into your mold of conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Its not a fact based show, its a show about different subjects and if you want to know more you can read books on the subject and stuff, its not meant to be like school where you are lectured in a boring fashion, its meant to be interesting so that it has listeners. </p>

<p>Dude, anything that is not the truth is a lie. Ghosts are not real. Vampires are not real. Bigfoot is not real.</p>

<p>When you wrap a majority of info about insane theories like space lizards living in the moon who morph into humans and brainwash us all with mind control beams and a minority of real conspiracy theories such as all the recent financial crimes ( housing crash 2008, too many stock market schemes to list, fake companies going bankrupt, the list goes on ), it makes people think that it&#39;s ALL insane theories.</p>

<p>This is a basic denigration tactic and it&#39;s the same type of shit that Alex Jones does.</p>

<p>He talks about legit shit, but the manner in which he does it allows people to view him as crazy and just write him off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prove it. Look everyone&#39;s got an angle, a view, a certain interest, certain features. </p>

<p>Could he be favoring constitutional ideas and small government and guns? Yeah, that is his angle, he hates big government and hates it a lot. He is also obnoxious and a hillbilly type. </p>

<p>So everyone has an angle, but he&#39;s covered pretty much everything, so I don&#39;t see how you can call him controlled opposition. </p>

<p>Controlled opposition in all government manuals is when you create a group to supposedly hold and oppositions views, but then censors stuff, twists stuff, throws in the position talking points in every story that he covers, all under the mantra of being opposition. </p>

<p>Disinfo agent is someone who spreads false information, where he&#39;ll talk about spying by the NSA, but would limit the scope, he would say, well they  only taped the phones and they are bad for doing it, but that&#39;s as far as it goes and then spread information about some minor unimportant stuff. </p>

<p>Unless Alex Jones is on top of the pyramid, one of the highest levels of the elites and just created a show to sort of laugh at the public as he tells them what is going on and sort of being brazen about it and having a sick enjoyment of covering the stuff, unless he is that, I don&#39;t think he is controlled opposition. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why jesuits are important. I think the elites are religionless in the sense of mainstream, mainline religions and beliefs. So to talk in absolutes like that wouldn&#39;t make much sense. </p>

<p>Like why should he talk about Jesuits? I mean that is a copout, how about we talk in names like John Kerry, Paul Wolfowitz, George Soros, etc... rather than about groups of people who have huge varieties of people. </p>

<p>That would actually be avoiding the truth, if someone blames everything on Jesuits, or on Jews, or this or that. That is the true disinfo, where instead of talking about names, you talk about large groups, especially religious groups. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quotations: Jesuit Order </p>

<p>&quot;My history of the Jesuits is not eloquently written, but it is supported by unquestionable authorities, [and] is very particular and very horrible. Their [the Jesuit Order’s] restoration [in 1814 by Pope Pius VII] is indeed a step toward darkness, cruelty, despotism, [and] death. … I do not like the appearance of the Jesuits. If ever there was a body of men who merited eternal damnation on earth and in hell, it is this Society of [Ignatius de] Loyola.&quot;</p>

<p>John Adams (1735-1826; 2nd President of the United States)</p>

<p>&quot;It is my opinion that if the liberties of this country – the United States of America – are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty. They have instigated MOST of the wars of Europe.&quot;</p>

<p>Marquis de LaFayette (1757-1834; French statesman and general. He served in the American Continental Army under the command of General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War.)</p>

<p>&quot;The war [i.e., the American Civil War of 1861-1865] would never have been possible without the sinister influence of the Jesuits.&quot;</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865; 16th President of the United States, Note: Please see the end of this document for the full quotation by Lincoln.)</p>

<p>&quot;The public is practically unaware of the overwhelming responsibility carried by the Vatican and its Jesuits in the starting of the two world wars – a situation which may be explained in part by the gigantic finances at the disposition of the Vatican and its Jesuits, giving them power in so many spheres, especially since the last conflict.&quot;
Edmond Paris (Author of the book The Secret History of the Jesuits)</p>

<p>&quot;The Jesuits…are a secret society – a sort of Masonic order – with superadded features of revolting odiousness, and a thousand times more dangerous.” </p>

<p>Samuel Morse (1791-1872; American inventor of the telegraph; author of the book Foreign Conspiracy Against the Liberties of the United States) ((Note: For Morse’s full quotation from which this excerpt was taken, please see the end of this document.))</p>

<p>&quot;[The Jesuits] are the deadly enemies of civil and religious liberty.&quot;
R. W. Thompson (Ex-Secretary, American Navy)</p>

<p>&quot;The Jesuits are a MILITARY organization, not a religious order. Their chief is a general of an army, not the mere father abbot of a monastery. And the aim of this organization is power – power in its most despotic exercise – absolute power, universal power, power to control the world by the volition of a single man [i.e., the Black Pope, the Superior General of the Jesuits]. Jesuitism is the most absolute of despotisms [sic] – and at the same time the greatest and most enormous of abuses…&quot;</p>

<p>Napoleon I (i.e., Napoleon Bonaparte; 1769-1821; emperor of the French)</p>

<p>“…The Roman Inquisition…had been administered since 1542 by the Jesuits.” 
F. Tupper Saussy (Author of the book Rulers of Evil)</p>

<p>&quot;Between 1555 and 1931 the Society of Jesus [i.e., the Jesuit Order] was expelled from at least 83 countries, city states and cities, for engaging in political intrigue and subversion plots against the welfare of the State, according to the records of a Jesuit priest of repute [Thomas J. Campbell]. …Practically every instance of expulsion was for political intrigue, political infiltration, political subversion, and inciting to political insurrection.&quot; (1987)
J.E.C. Shepherd (Canadian historian)</p>

<p>“It is impossible to read Elizabethan history [i.e., the history surrounding Queen Elizabeth I of England; queen: 1558-1603] except in the context of an army of Jesuits, masters of deceit, treachery, treason, infiltration, subversion, assassination, insurrection, civil war and coercion, plotting for the good of the papacy, and the defeat of all the Pope’s foes anywhere in the world.” (1987)
J.E.C. Shepherd (Canadian historian)</p>

<p>“The whole frightful responsibility for this terrible Thirty Years’ War [1618-1648] must rest upon the [Holy Roman] Emperor Ferdinand II, and his teachers, rulers, and bosom friends – the Sons of Loyola [i.e., the Jesuit Order].”
Theodor Griesinger (German historian; 1873)</p>

<p>“If you trace up Masonry, through all its Orders, till you come to the grand tip-top head Mason of the World, you will discover that the dread individual and the Chief of the Society of Jesus [i.e., the Superior General of the Jesuit Order] are one and the same person.” 
James Parton (American historian)</p>

<p>“All these things cause the Father-General [of the Jesuits] to be feared by the Pope and sovereigns… A sovereign who is not their [the Jesuits’] friend will sooner or later experience their vengeance.” (1852)
Luigi Desanctis (Official Censor of the Inquisition)</p>

<p>“The Society of Jesus [i.e., the Jesuit Order] is the enemy of man. The whole human race should unite for its overthrow. …For there is no alternative between its total extirpation, and the absolute corruption and degradation of mankind.” 
Robert J. Breckinridge (author)</p>

<p>Robert J. Breckinridge</p>

<p>“The Jesuits…are simply the Romish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world in the future, with the Pontiff of Rome for emperor…that’s their ideal. …It is simple lust of power, of filthy earthly gain, of domination – something like a universal serfdom with them [i.e., the Jesuits] as masters – that’s all they stand for. They don’t even believe in God perhaps.”</p>

<p>Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821-1881; famous Russian novelist)</p>

<p>“The Jesuit Order at last reached the pinnacle of its power and prestige in the early eighteenth century [i.e., the early 1700s]. It had become more influential and more wealthy than any other organization in the world. It held a position in world affairs that no oath-bound group of men has ever held before or since… ‘Nearly all the Kings and Sovereigns of Europe had only Jesuits as directors of their consciences [i.e., as confessor-priests], so that the whole of Europe appeared to be governed by Jesuits only.’” (1927; using a short quote by Jesuit Cordara)
Boyd Barrett (Ex-Jesuit)</p>

<p>“In Roman Catholic circles it is well known that the Black Pope is the term used for the [Superior] General of the Jesuits. As the Pope is always robed in white, and the [Jesuit Superior] General in black, the contrast is obvious. But those Romanists who do not greatly love the Jesuits, and their number is not limited, use the term as indicating that the Black Pope rules the White Pope…even while the former [i.e., the Black Pope] is obligated to make, at least, a show of submission to the latter.” (1896)
M.F. Cusack (Ex-nun of Kenmore; author of the book The Black Pope)</p>

<p>“…The Jesuits are the only religious order in the Church of Rome…which has lain under the ban of the [‘White’] Pope, or which has been expelled from any country because of its interference in politics. Hence we may expect to find that to obtain political power forms a main feature in the plans of the Society [of Jesus – i.e., the Jesuit Order].” (1896)
M.F. Cusack</p>

<p>“Alas, I knew they [i.e., the Jesuits] would poison me; but I did not expect to die in so slow and cruel a manner.” (1774)</p>

<p>Pope Clement XIV (Who had “forever” abolished the Jesuit Order in 1773)</p>

<p>“The [Jesuit Superior] General is at the head of this black and mute militia, which thinks, wills, acts, obeys – [as] the passive instrument of his designs. Their whole life must have but one aim – the advancement of the [Jesuit] Order to which they are attached.” (1912)</p>

<p>Jeremiah J. Crowley (Irishman; ex-priest in the Roman Catholic Church; author of the book Romanism: Menace to the Nation)</p>

<p>Father Jeremiah J. Crowley (Nov. 29, 1861 — ????).</p>

<p>“Never before in the course of the world’s history had such a Society [i.e., the Jesuit Order] appeared. The old Roman Senate itself did not lay schemes for world domination with greater certainty of success.” (1800)</p>

<p>Friedrich von Hardenberg (German philosopher)</p>

<p>“[Jesuit Adam] Weishaupt established the [modern version of the] Illuminati specifically to be a front organization behind which the Jesuits could hide. After being [formally] abolished by [Pope] Clement XIV in 1773, the Jesuits used the Illuminati and other organizations to carry out their operations. Thus, the front organizations would be blamed for the trouble caused by the Jesuits.”
Bill Hughes (Author of The Secret Terrorists and The Enemy Unmasked)</p>

<p>“[Jesuit-trained Illuminist Adam] Weishaupt and his fellow Jesuits cut off the income to the Vatican by launching and leading the French Revolution; by directing Napoleon’s conquest of Catholic Europe; [and] …by eventually having Napoleon throw Pope Pius VII in jail at Avignon until he agreed, as the price for his release, to reestablish the Jesuit Order. This Jesuit war on the Vatican was terminated by the Congress of Vienna and by the secret, 1822 Treaty of Verona.”
Emanuel M. Josephson (American physician and historian)</p>

<p>“Why would the Jesuits use their implacable enemy, the Jews, to further their designs for world dominion? The Jesuits never do anything out in the open where they can be exposed. If they are recognized as the culprits, they will be blamed and suffer the consequences, but if they can use someone else as the ‘cause of the world’s problems’, especially an enemy they can destroy in the process, then they have simultaneously accomplished two of their objectives. The Jewish people are the perfect scapegoat. Since the Rothschilds are Jesuit agents operating under a Jewish cover, using them [i.e., the Rothschilds] in forming the Illuminati back in 1776 effectively throws the onus of this conspiracy on the Jews. The Rothschilds are certainly not the only Jesuit agents that operate under a Jewish front.</p>

<p>The following sources [Ed. Note: Bill Hughes lists a number of books in later paragraphs] indicate that [Jesuit] Adam Weishaupt and the Rothschilds were the brains and the wealth behind the French Revolution.”
Bill Hughes (From his book The Enemy Unmasked)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me see, now that you&#39;ve explained yourself. </p>

<p>It&#39;s fine to say &quot;its the international bakers,&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s the Bildergbergs&quot; or &quot;its&#39; the Federal Reserve&quot; or the likes, but to say &quot;it&#39;s the Jesuits&quot; is some how wrong? </p>

<p>Now i didn&#39;t say &quot;its the Jesuits&quot; i asked how come he never talks of them? <em>that is a valid question.</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s not the same to say it&#39;s Jews, since the majority of these people are indoctrinated into their faith since birth. But to say it&#39;s the Zionist is a very different thing. It&#39;s historically understood as such. Also, to say let&#39;s look at the Jesuits, is a good questions since no one indoctrinated them or forced on them the decision they took to join a specific order within the religion of Catholicism. An order, which has historically been outlined as scheming and conspirators agains governments across the whole globe, to the point of being at one point disbanded. </p>

<p>The fact the you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about. Yet you simply decide to insult me, but hey, I guess you know better and truly understand everything and everyone else is wrong.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I lived in Austin for 2 years and actually met him one night at Guerras (a little mexican place on S. Congress) He is actually a nice guy in person, polite and not at all what he appears on the radio or at events. It is a way to make money and he knows the majority of his audience is looking to get worked up and he capitalizes on that. I thank him for getting me looking in the right direction but anyone that sources his infowars site is an idiot and he breeds lunatics. Part of knowing how to convince others is to be able to not act like a raging fool and I think it is quite possible he does it to make everyone who talks about anything remotely outside of mainstream sound like a nut. </p>

Bill was just starting to get serious recognition before he died. It was a fucking tragedy. So, he gave up his life, when it was finally starting to work out, to become a fat, belligerent, sensationalist, half-retarded talk show host with absolutely no sense of humor whatsoever? And, somehow... after faking his own death he became a foot shorter in height.... :o

    <div class="md"><p>from bookrags.com
&quot;William Cooper offers a lengthy analysis of the state of global events, presenting information, which he claims is secretly held by governments. Cooper argues that numerous secret societies exist, which were organized into a single massive society c. 1953; that a Secret Government, which controls everything, was established shortly after World War II; that the government seeks to eliminate population through various means and that extra-terrestrial intelligent life exists and often visits earth. In addition, Cooper offers auto-biographical information and proffers a plethora of putative facts regarding the massive and systematic disinformation campaign waged upon the public by those in power.</p>

<p>The text is comprised of materials from a variety of source; much of the contents are facsimile reproductions of disparate documents including letters, articles from newspapers and magazines, declassified government documents, legal proceedings, public documents and photographs. In addition, the text contains several, lengthy articles written at various times...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t we take a look at what he says?</p>

<p>&quot;In the spring of 1988 I saw a magazine that made reference to a 
document discovered by the research team of Moore, Shandera, and Friedman that outlined the government&#39;s knowledge of a downed saucer, dead alien bodies, and an operation called Operation MAJESTIC TWELVE. I knew that Moore and Friedman were government agents and <strong>the document was a fraud</strong>. I had never heard of Shandera. I knew this because I had seen a list of agents who were to initiate a contingency plan called MAJESTIC that would lead investigators off the track when such a need arose.&quot; - Behold, a Pale Horse</p>

<p>OH NO HE TALKS ABOUT ALIENS (and says it is a fraud) SURELY YOU CAN&#39;T BELIEVE THIS MAN!</p>

<p>The reason people don&#39;t want you reading what Cooper had to say about aliens because it was a topic discussed for explicit purpose of elucidating the way government cointelpro operations run, how and why faked documents are put out to the public, etc.</p>

   2. Aliens are a hoax and means of disinformation to hide their real agenda.</p>

<p>His biggest point is that there is clearly an agenda behind some American/world government and that we should be aware that we are being lied to and manipulated. He gives whichever evidence he can find and claims none to be true. He wants everyone to make up their own mind.</p>

<p>At least that&#39;s what I got out of the read. Very interesting things as far as prediction, world politics and the start of a global police state.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know the difference between Satanism and Luciferianism you need to listen to Bill Cooper. There are many within this sub that think Luciferianism is Satanism. Those people have no clue what they&#39;re talking about. When I see &#39;Satanic&#39; in a title I know exactly how ignorant they are. That sounds harsh, but it&#39;s true. I had to learn that lesson myself so, I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m perfect or anything; I&#39;m in the same boat and have to learn just like anyone else. </p>

<p>Still, Luciferianism is a deep and interesting subject.</p>

<p>To be honest I&#39;m amazed that it gets so little attention in this sub.</p>

<p>I&#39;m babbling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are right for the most part. Satanism is definitely a &#39;thing&#39;, and so is luciferianism. However they are definitely NOT THE SAME. And there is definitely a ton of importance in knowing the difference, and understanding what luciferianism means/is. The freemasons are a Luciferian society, so is skull and bones, and a number of other secret societies. Its based on paganism, and christianity, and a number of other things. But the word Lucifer eventually translates to light-bringer, which eventually translates to illuminati. There are a lot of positive and good things about luciferian religions/beliefs, but its the automatic relation to &#39;satanism&#39; or &#39;devil worship&#39; that gives it a bad name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Luciferianism is not paganism per se. I would also say that &#39;Illuminati&#39; is related to Luciferianism only in that both words involve &#39;light.&#39; I am of the opinion that the Illuminati - should they exist - would probably proclaim themselves to be Luciferians. I&#39;m also of the opinion that - should they exist - the Illuminati are likely one of multiple groups fighting each other for power. But that&#39;s a longer topic.</p>

<p>I agree about the good aspects of Luciferianism.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, after much research, I find myself sympathetic to a lot of what they talk about. In fact I find myself embedding a lot of the themes into my own life and work. I find it truly ironic that Luciferianism has been perverted by dick-holes to support an agenda that hurts people. This is ironic because Luciferianism, at its core, is more about life and beauty. Well, that&#39;s my opinion anyway. Not that I could join any of their clubs or play their reindeer games (not my bag, baby).</p>

<p>Luciferianism is a tool. An intellectual tool.</p>

<p>The real question is this: </p>

<p>Who is the user of the tool?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You got a really awful response, so I can&#39;t help but comment to clear the air.</p>

<p>There is a very obvious reason why you see people confused about what &quot;Luciferianism&quot; actually means and that is because it has multiple meanings.</p>

<p>Obviously Lucifer is a Biblical character so the word needs to be explained in the context of biblical symbology, archonemis claims of irrelevance notwithstanding.</p>

<p>In the Old Testament, Lucifer is considered an enemy of God.  He offers knowledge to mankind.  It has often been commented that the &quot;Christian God&quot; is evil, but usually (though not always) people are basing this on the Old Testament which is not Christian at all.  This may not seem obvious at the moment.  Many people assume that there is only one God figure in the Bible when in fact there are two.</p>

<p>In the New Testament, Jesus is almost exactly like Lucifer of the Old Testament.  He says things like this: &quot;No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light.&quot;  He is a bearer of knowledge, not a concealer.  To drive home this point explicitly, Jesus calls himself the &quot;Bright and Morning Star,&quot; which is a name given to Lucifer in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>Therefore, in some sense, Christianity <em>is</em> Luciferanism.  In particular you should note that in the New Testament, Jesus (Lucifer) is an ALLY of God, not an enemy.  So Christianity represents an inversion of the values of the Old Testament (freemasonry), not a continuation of them.</p>

<p>But how can this be!?  We have people who identify as Luciferians that specifically reject Christianity, so obviously they have a different idea of what it means.  This is where freemasonry comes into the picture.</p>

<p>The masonic orders are very much interested in enlightened knowledge.   They crafted the old testament symbols as an exoteric religion with esoteric interpretation.  Their belief system is more or less that by concealing knowledge they acquire a superior position/advantge over the ignorant/uninitiated and thereby can make themselves gods.  In this world view, the knowledge bearer who offers it openly to mankind (Lucifer) is evil and God (the order / it&#39;s members) are free to rule over the cattle, punishing them and controlling the rest of mankind as in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>If you doubt this, consider that the language itself is crafted with intention and that messages are encoded within it.  Do you know the tune that children use to sing the alphabet?  The ending letter of each segment (g, p, v, z) all sound similar.  This is hinting at a more general way of deconstructing hidden messages in language.  I&#39;ll let you ponder it yourself for the most part, but offer one application.  The name &quot;Jesus&quot; is one which has been imposed by freemasons who hate the Christian religion and could alternatively be (and historically was) sounded &quot;hai-zus&quot; or &quot;he&#39;s zeus&quot; and more modern pronunciation of &quot;G&#39;s-us&quot; or &quot;God is us.&quot;  This is consistent with the previously mentioned freemasonic philosophy that they are the rightful rulers of mankind.</p>

<p>Equipped with this knowledge, you can say there are several forms of Luciferianism:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Those who believe God is evil, Lucifer is his opponent, support good, and therefore support Lucifer</p></li>
<li><p>Those who believe God is good, Lucifer is good, support good, and therefore support Lucifer</p></li>
<li><p>Those who believe God is good, Lucifer is bad, and therefore oppose Lucifer</p></li>
<li><p>Those who interpret God in the Christian NT sense (good), oppose the values of the NT (support &quot;evil&quot; as most would call it), and still take Lucifer to be a symbol of opposition to God.  This is a very confused mess of the symbols as it relies on mixing interpretations of things from the OT and the NT by interpreting the Bible as a continuous story rather than two discrete and opposing viewpoints</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You should be careful to identify what type of Luciferian you are talking about among the above options.   Most people lack skill (but not the ability) to formalize the language, but are perfectly capable of comprehending your meanings if you do a good job of formalization yourself.  It is because most people lack this skill that poorly defined ideas &quot;Luciferianism is [good/bad/neutral]&quot; degenerate into silly topics more often than not.  You can stop that by clarifying the language at the outset.</p>

<p>Which returns us to your question.  It doesn&#39;t really mean anything because you didn&#39;t tell us what the words you used mean.  The answer could alternatively be that they are the same, opposite, or something else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The two are entirely unrelated.</p>

<p>The <em>only</em> people who think there&#39;s any overlap are people who believe in The Bible. No Luciferian is a Satanist. I have a buddy who&#39;s in the O.T.O. and his shelves are lined with texts that go into Luciferianism. What&#39;s absent from his shelves? Anything to do with Satan. Why? Because Satanism is totally irrelevant to Luciferianism. It would be like having a bunch of Beavis and Butthead DVDs in the middle of your Stanley Kubrick collection. </p>

<p>Satanism is essentially like <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a>. It&#39;s a bunch of people with no real catechism, canon, doctrine, theology or mythology. It&#39;s simply a reaction to Christian dogma from the mid-1800&#39;s. These days it&#39;s become somewhat fashionable to be &#39;dark&#39; or whatever. It started to become very popular back in the mid-1900&#39;s in main stream culture (especially in the outskirts of punk). Now you can find this stuff in Hot Topic shops that peddle to teenage girls. I defy you to find a book about Satanism that&#39;s written seriously. The only books about Satanism that I&#39;ve found that were written by people &quot;taking the subject seriously&quot; were written by people with the I.Q. of a wet bagel. I&#39;ve looked into it and have found nothing of interest (Anton LeVey was a douche, like Blavatsky, that was taken far more seriously than he should have been)..</p>

<p>Luciferianism, on the other hand, goes back millennia.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll note that the Masons [Luciferians] have a total hard-on for the Egyptians. Why? Because the Egyptians have Luciferian symbolism permeating their myths. All you need to do is take a casual glance at Egyptology and you&#39;ll see that te Masons essentially lifted all the cool stuff from Egypt and rebranded it with English words. </p>

<p>Important: </p>

<p>I&#39;m telling you what they think about their beliefs.</p>

<p>If you listen to a Bible Belt Christian they will claim that anything not &#39;of God&#39; is Satan. In that world view Lucifer is not God and therefore Satan. Satan is not God and therefore Satan. Think of Bobby Boucher&#39;s mother from Waterbor [1998] and you&#39;ll get the Bible Belt reasoning on the subject.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example:</p>

<p>I was once attempting to describe Lucifer to a normal Christian. I went through a couple of brief descriptions and then asked her: &quot;who is Lucifer?&quot; Her response was &quot;The Dark Lord.&quot; That is the exact opposite of Lucifer. Lucifer is the light-bringer. She got it totally mixed up. Christians do not study this subject and so you cannot count them as authorities on subjects they don&#39;t study.</p>

<p>Al of that aside the big difference is this:</p>

<p>Lucifer is a symbol for mind or thought. The light that Lucifer brings is the light of understanding (&quot;He&#39;s a bright guy&quot; - &quot;Shedding light o the situation.&quot;). Lucifer is associated with understanding and mind. What is the principle characteristic of humans? Their mind. Lucifer is the symbol for what makes Man tick. This is the ultimate thing in the doctrine of Luciferianism.</p>

<p>Satan, on the other hand, is a title for any asshole that questions God. Al Shytan is not a name (nor is Lucifer, incidentally). Al Shaytan simply means &#39;accuser.&#39; There is not deep symbolism. Within the context of the book of Job he&#39;s just some asshole that challenges God. The only people that have called that guy some big bad horrible beast are people who&#39;ve never read the book. You&#39;ll also find, by the by, that no where in Egyptian myths are there references to an accuser as being of any high significance. </p>

<p>If you have any specific questions I&#39;d be happy to answer them.</p>

<p>Mostly I would say look into Egyptology and listen to the Mystery Babylon series by Bill Cooper. </p>

<p>As a side note William Blake uses a lot of Luciferian symbolism in his poetry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a torrent of most of his radio shows and this one was labeled as being broadcasted on June 1st, 2001.</p>

<p>Been listening to his broadcasts and man, the mix of insightful comments, paranoid-sounding facts here and there (that now we know turned out to be true), arcane historical info AND anti-socialist, libertarian, pro-gun rants is bewildering. The man had a short fuse but was intelligent and saw exactly what was coming. Anyway, listen to the 9/11 <em>8-hour</em> broadcast and you&#39;ll see it was just a matter of time till he and his fellow <em>patriots</em> were raided. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>William Cooper is the most genuine example of someone trying to find the truth and disseminate fact from misinformation. Even when he was not sure about his theories, he would always preface them with a disclaimer. He was openly Christian and I am not religious. It didn&#39;t matter. His religion never interfered with his ability to give solid info. If it wasn&#39;t for Mr. Cooper I wouldn&#39;t be the person I am today; I would probably be a fear mongering Alex Jones fan. Rest in peace William Cooper, we need more people like you in this world.</p>

<p>&quot;Listen to everyone, read everything, believe nothing unless you can prove it in your own research.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>This one sentence changed my life. It made me realize that there are some people who would die for their beliefs, and some who would kill. It made me reevaluate my personal belief structure, and decide whether I&#39;d like to die for them, and go down defending them as needed.....or kill for them and proceed to shove them down everyone&#39;s throats, and if some collateral damage happens, so be it.  In essence, you can only be one or the other. After much deliberation, I decided that living a life of love and compassion, embracing diversity, and learning from people rather than &quot;educating&quot; them is what is best for me. I chose to die for my beliefs. It seems though, that in order to have any political clout in this country, you have to have come to a different conclusion.</p>

BTW: Don&#39;t you have Sheriff&#39;s in The US anymore? My Grandfather was a Sheriff in a rather large town(1878-1896), and I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;d have shot anyone trying to pull this kind of stunt in his county. Anyway, good luck with your revolution, let&#39;s hope private banking is done with. Most stupid thing ever!</p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t. There is no scale of totalitarianism. That doesn&#39;t even make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>rebelling in the streets without purpose only serves them to be able to arrest you. The first and most important thing to do is spread knowledge and truth. You don&#39;t think we are down that road?  It doesn make sense? Well lets see what we have today that we shouldn&#39;t:</p>

<p>Indefinite Detention.
NSA disregarding 4th Amendment.
No Fly list.
Militarized Police.
Whistleblowers have no avenue and face stiffer jail than those that took us to Iraq over lies. Oh wait NO ONE went to jail for that. 
Fake and Gov. compliant news (IE CNN faking locations and storys.)
Random check points.
Cant film police.
There is a drone killing every 4 days on average.</p>

<p>These are just a few, just search around, this country is nothing like it was 20 years ago. Nothing! Nearly every single Bill of Rights is under assault by Executive Order or the guise of security. Did we really need an entire new defense department (DHS)? Where are these so called terrorists? it has been 12 years and not one?? come on dude, we needed to create a department on par with NSA, CIA and FBI for terrorists that don&#39;t exists? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! That one quote has stuck with me for years. I used to listen to hour of the time podcasts while I was at work (making money AND learning :) and when he said that particular thing, it blew the walls down i&#39;ve created in my head...its so fucking true yet so basic. </p>

<p>I believe he said that during a speech he was giving when some woman got mad at him after he said something about the founding fathers spiritual/religious beliefs. </p>
