       Considering that RT and Italy's state news are now blasting that 9/11 was an iside job, I think it's possible he might have something, or have had something that is already out.

       The NSA might not have documents or data, but they DO have call records, and a connection between Brass, Intel types, the White House, and terrorists/families/ties would be a big red flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Not to mention warning calls.  Or proof of short selling stocks, predictive calls/insider trading, etc.
EDIT2:  You know all former presidents get morning intel briefings?  Does that include NSA stuff?  And if so, how is ok for them to work for groups like Carlysle Group?

       As per Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 911....I knew I remembered hearing it somewhere.   GHWB receives daily CIA briefings AFTER leaving office.  He is the only president to continue the practice (at the time of the movie.)

       I can't believe I never thought of this. Although, the 9/11 job had enough sophistication (and inside knowledge) to use lines outside of these programs for communication.

       No way.  THEY might have used outside lines, but what about ALL the other people involved from Saudi families all the way to George Bushes.  And don't forget, even if they HAD used burners, with voice recognition and HUGE deep storage, we could put a name to a voice.  Also, all the other countries ALSO spying on US.  There are records.  They can't all be deleted.  And THOSE people talking about it.  Snowden is a dead man if they ever find him.  What someone should be trying to do is unlock those 'insurance' files Wikipedia and Snowden released.  They are either decoys (which they probably aren't because the NSA could have cracked it) or they are real.

       Not that the NSA has files pertaining to it, but perhaps communications from emails of people he may have accessed using their ID's. Just a theory I'm toying with. Time will tell.

       It's possible, just very unlikely IMO. That information would cause a massive shit storm if it came out. I mean this would be absolutely earth shattering compared to the NSA revelations. Which leads me to believe that any concrete info would be stuffed in some CIA sponsored classified black hole.

       I agree. With everything that's come out of the woodwork, I'm pretty sure any evidence has been long destroyed. For example, we'll never get a clear video of the Pentagon.

       everyone remembers how INCESTUOUS these public/private intell agencies are, right???
      </h2>
      <p>
       excerpt from washington post/business...
      </p>
      <p>
       Booz Allen, based in Tysons Corner, has been a local fixture for years, employing thousands and providing management and consulting services to the government, particularly the defense and intelligence agencies. It even sponsored a local golf tournament — the Booz Allen Classic — between 2004 and 2006. It also became a leader among the contractors supplying tens of thousands of intelligence analysts to the government in recent years, including technologists such as Snowden.
Those government contracts, and thousands more like them, in 2008 made Booz Allen a ripe acquisition target for Carlyle. It paid $2.54 billion for Booz Allen as a deep recession took hold. Fearing the risks of taking on too much debt in the midst of a financial crisis, Carlyle put up 50 percent cash instead of its normal 30 percent. It borrowed the rest to buy the company, which was then privately held.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon the close of the deal, the less profitable international and commercial business was spun off to become Booz &amp; Co., leaving Carlyle with a government-only company. After the split, the new Booz Allen Hamilton established an incentive-based compensation structure that gave the remaining partners a stake in the firm’s success. In effect, said one person close to the deal who was not authorized to speak publicly, “you got to eat what you killed.”

       excerpt from the guardian june 10, 2013...by julian borger...
The current of director of national intelligence (DNI), James Clapper, who issued a stinging attack on the intelligence leaks this weekend, is a former Booz Allen executive. The firm's current vice-chairman, Mike McConnell, was DNI under the George W Bush administration. He worked for the Virginia-based company before taking the job, and returned to the firm after leaving it. The company website says McConnell is responsible for its "rapidly expanding cyber business".
      </p>
      <p>
       James Woolsey, a former CIA director was also a Booz Allen vice-president, and Melissa Hathaway, another former company executive also once worked as the top aide on cybersecurity to McConnell when he was DNI. The company headquarters in the leafy Washington suburb of McLean in northern Virginia, close to CIA headquarters and home to former and current intelligence officers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden's decision to reveal his identity as a computer systems administrator for Booz Allen Hamilton, directly handling National Security Agency IT systems, raises significant image problems for the $6bn company and its 25,000-strong staff, which has traded on a bond of trust with sensitive clients, particularly the intelligence establishment.

       and for those that may have forgotten: On the morning of 9/11/2001 GHW Bush was at a Carlyle Group meeting in a DC hotel with a close friend of the family--one of the bin Ladens...
wonder how much money the Bushes, the Cheneys, the Clappers (etc, etc, etc) have made off of the private defense/intell companies that they pump and milk the U.S. Gov't for...

       I don't see why he would have released that info on 9/11 unless it was related.  It is a very significant date.   That's all people talk about on that day.  He did it on purpose, IMO.  Which would mean he knows something.  Which I'm guess he might say when the people are ready.  The info he releases just gets worse and worse.  How much more is there?

       Nope, in my opinion he is a ghost, possibly even fictional.  No whistle blower gets media attention unless it's part of a broader plan.  His video intervies come off too crisp for someone running for his life.

       It's important to understand that when we're talking about "TBTB" we're talking about people, people who may have agendas that are mutually beneficial, of no concern, or completely opposite and hostile toward another group/faction. It is my opinion that Edward Snowden has extremely powerful as yet unknown benefactors which is why everytime he takes a shit the western media is reporting a comprehensive understanding of the consistency, the color, and the implications of the act.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also add that I've now seen enough evidence that I'm at roughly 90% certainty that secure internet practices will be guaranteed and restored through both legislation and industry practice.

       That's true but not exactly relevant to whether or not Snowden is still on payroll. Again, if Greenwald is working for the IC then he's the best actor I've ever seen.

       He's a great actor, that's the point.  After the Dorner episode I began to wonder if he even existed.  Sandy hook was also very questionable, as was almost any media event.  I don't believe anything I see on TV.

       Due to the fact that there were several whistleblowers before Snowden who were unceremoniously ignored, I too had some misgivings about his legitimacy.. but not anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, no matter who your boogeymen are, they're not immune to unfettered electronic surveillance. The popularity of Snowden is likely the result of extremely powerful people who oppose it. Think about it.. how can anyone conduct a conspiracy if there's no fucking way to do it without some other group listening in? What if somebody listens to the group that thinks they're on top? Anyhow.. you get the idea.

       Another point to remember is that if he's releasing legit info that is of concern, then media coverage is required to do damage control.  If what he says gets packaged in a more friendly manner, or the different issues he discusses are cherry-picked to draw attention away from the dangerous bits, that's all a part of a management strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am untrusting too, and I consider that Snowden's motivations are perhaps more personal than simply "the good of the people".  Something specific soured him on the whole system, it would seem to me.  Perhaps he received threats before his exit, that actually prompted him to do all of this out of concern for his personal safety.

       When Noam Chomsky says (with regards to 9/11 being an 'inside job') "who cares?", I believe he's spot-on and it goes along with what you just said.  If you think you need to prove something like 9/11 being an inside job to be able to find some wrong actions in this world, you've already been psy-opped.

       Hard to say. But the CIA sure knew but I don't think they really speak to each other. If it was an inside job they probably made sure the NSA didn't know about it or at least painted a false picture for them. Most of the info was probably in Cheney's multiple man sized safes.

       I believe some of his leaked info DID indicate that journalists and the media were pressured NOT to seriously question the "official version"...
(not sure where I saw this--if I find it again I'll post)...

       also, there was a cryptome doc that was interesting...it showed a link to a pdf file which showed that funds started to pour into Booz Allen Hamilton on Sept. 14, 2001...

      <p>
       Interesting to note WHO bought Booz Allen--the Carlyle Group...on 9/11/01 GHW Bush was in DC at a conference for the Carlyle Group (with a close family friend--one of the bin Ladens)...In 2006, the Carlyle Group bought Booz Allen...hmmmmmmm.

       Possible, but I believe it is highly unlikely. Snowden had access to procedures, regulations and the organisation of the surveillance state. I believe he hadn't access to Black Operations. He probably wouldn't have access to files about 9/11. I believe,
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       there was any complicity of the government, most of the evidence for this complicity will already be purged from the files.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is a real possibility that there are areas where 9/11 and the surveillance state overlap:
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past potential subversives and potential whistleblowers who could become a threat to the state have become victims of targeted spying. It is well know, that this happened to communists, peace-activists, civil rights activists, the Black Panthers, native american groups. But it also happened to various JFK-researchers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen for example to broadcast:
       <em>
        Mae Brussell - FBI &amp; CIA vs. Warren Report Critics- (6-27-77)
       </em>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-TNlFSW9Sk&amp;amp;list=PLA3AE1666479EF849">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-TNlFSW9Sk&amp;amp;list=PLA3AE1666479EF849
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Zachary Sklar, who was the editor for Jim Garrison's book
       <em>
        On the trail of the assassins
       </em>
       was on BlackOpRadio where he talked about the kind of attacks Garrison faced (Show 38 from 2001 - scroll down).
       <a href="http://www.blackopradio.com/favorite.html">
        http://www.blackopradio.com/favorite.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Or read what happened to Peter Lemkin:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/29445-peter-lemkin-a-casualty-of-jfk-s-assassination.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So I believe that it is possible, that there could be similar to the
       <em>
        No Fly List
       </em>
       a special list which is related to 9/11. Such a list would have the names of people on it who are either privy to classified information about 9/11, or are looking into 9/11 as researchers. Those people will be surveilled more intensively, than the average citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Kevin Ryan and an unsourced
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Inquiry_into_Intelligence_Community_Activities_before_and_after_the_Terrorist_Attacks_of_September_11,_2001#Media_involvement">
        Wikipedia
       </a>
       article, members of the
       <em>
        Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities before and after the Terrorist Attacks of September 11
       </em>
       were targeted by FBI surveillance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently both co-chairs of the 9/11 commission have gone public. In the article
       <em>
        It's time to debate NSA program
       </em>
       , they wrote their concerns. The article contains no hint, that Keane and Hamilton have themselves been targeted by the surveillance state, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were.

       ...personally, i don't think most "involved" had to know the endgame -- they had to merely follow orders. For example, why were the flights not intercepted by military craft (as they had been over 70 times in the nine months prior to those events: concerning lost transponder signals or variations on a flightpath)? Those who did not act were not necessarily in collusion, as such, they were simply directed away from the key planes, or not put in the air at all. War games produced the necessary cover to overlay another operation even as most were doing their duties responsibly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The official (conspiracy) theory has very few involved; so i see no reason why government/military involvement must involve countless hordes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mistakes are inevitable -- so there is always hope that something/someone would surface. Cognitive dissonance seems a greater obstacle to overcome even when tangible questions are raised.

       Yeah. I agree with you on the broader conspiracy...I was referring to the people who would have layed the wire to blow up 3 buildings in downtown manhattan days in advance of 9/11. THAT conspiracy. Someone would have come forward.

       ...fair enough; it's a logical conclusion to make, no doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that some technology was used to bring down the buildings. 10 floors per second makes no sense to me -- and the buildings are decimated, virtually liquified into waves of powder. So where is the weight that crushed the floors below?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible that some technology was involved that standard demolition crews do not use. The evidence for nano-thermite is strong. But who knows what particulars were employed? Again, it's conceivable that workers applied tech that had a purpose beyond what they were told.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the meta-event was planned long ago; so preparations were likely ongoing for a long time. People follow orders. They don't question a process, particularly if they are being paid big bucks to quietly complete a task. i still hold hope for something to surface -- however likely or not.

       Ah, but the flights were intercepted, brought down, and the hostages safely taken off. Then, of course, different people replaced those planes with drones and guided them into their targets, and yet other military took the hostages and dropped them into the sea, and then those controlling the drones were killed in WTC7, and the hostage clean-up team found themselves dead in Afghanistan...

      <p>
       Another: the planes involved were equipped with drone tech that over-rode the pilots actions. And from then on, no one on board the flights was in control. The highjackers could have been patsies, thinking they were involved in a drill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Control centre for the mission is not clear to me; your supposition may be right, though 7 came down at 5:20pm so that's a long time to have the crew sitting in waiting. But concerning Building 7, my opinion is that it was wired to go the same time as the two towers but, for whatever reason, the building remained standing so it was dropped later in the evening.

       I've wondered this.  When it came out that the NSA was spying on love interests and no one really did anything, I concluded that leaks about the NSA will not launch a revolution.  So why not drop some serious info that will kick start change?  Because he doesn't have anything that juicy?  Because he doesn't want to incite chaos?  Check out

       for a possible explanation, revolution has to grow properly...can't just explode.

       I'm starting to have my doubts about Snowden and his

       WTF is up with this. If he has information critical to the wellbeing of you, I, and the rest of America, he should data-dump this shit and let the world deal with it. This jerking around, little bits here and there, just enough to keep everyone feeling dejected, controlled, monitored, and most importantly-- glued to their TV and computer monitor-- are making me think more and more with each passing day that this is nothing more than a con, a huge con, a psycho-informational 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, what has resulted from this? Nothing. Not a fucking thing. No arrests. No actual investigations beyond journalistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Yes, we are lying to you. Yes, we are tracking you. Yes, we are illegally storing everything you do, say, buy, and talk about. Yes, it is illegal. Illegal as fuck. We are still here. We are still here. We are still here, still doing it. We are still here. We are still here.

       The argument for the weekly snowden leaks is to keep the nsa and the leaks on the news as long as possible. If there was a single data dump the media would be all over it for about a week and not another day.

       1.)  Remember not long before this they were pushing for CISPA, SOPA, PIPA and other tyrannical ways to suppress the internet but failed?
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) In the past, they always denied leaks as false, including domestic wiretapping by many whistleblowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) MSM and Government confirmed that the Snowden leaks are true whereas they always denied similar leaks before.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.) Since they haven't been able to censor the internet without backlash, they decided to "let people know" that the government is watching everything they do (an implied warning to stay in line).   People will self-censor government criticism out of fear of being labeled a terrorist.

       In order to release something, he would have to have something. To have something, the NSA would have to have recorded something and he would have had to find it. Or maybe he recorded it himself. Guys joking on the phone about how they did 9/11. I suppose it is possible, but it requires extreme luck and stupidity. I will give you the stupidity, but the luck is harder....

       Anyhong presented by the 9/11 truth movement is a lie.  For your particular question, I can answer it simply. The government can't keep secrets! If there was any evidence that supported the idea that Bush was responsible for 9/11 it would have gotten out. You know how big of an operation it would of been? It would of gone well past Bush's cabinet members. Also, you can look at any u.s. administration ever and they all have there leaks. Now matter how big or small they all get out. Most notably Watergate, Iran Contra, the recent NSA scandal and of course Bill Clinton's stain on a dress.

       What a bad argument. Because some conspiracies have been uncovered, that means they have all been uncovered? What about JFK? What about some conspiracy we've never heard of and hasn't been released? Again, a terrible argument. And theorists don't even say "bush did it". Most people think it was various intelligence agencies. OP, you should watch "WTC7 in freefall part 1 2 and 3". Not a lot more needs to be said

         My counter argument is that you take a list of uncovered conspiracy theories, and because of that = all conspiracy theories get uncovered. What logic is that? If I catch my friend lying to me twice, and then never worry about getting lied to again because "hes such a bad liar", thats retarded. What I should say is "Man, jimmy lies a lot, I should be suspicious and fact check anything he says"

       is responsible for 9/11. W. didn't even give a fuck about Osama for

       This is completely untrue. There is a deep and rich history of vast power abuses being kept secret for decades. Operation Gladio, the Phoenix Program, etc. When certain things are found out, the documents are destroyed before being made public. MK ULTRA, Operation CHAOS etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider this. The US is currently under 30 states of emergency and has the Continuity of Operations shadow government in effect. But NO ONE in the mainstream talks about it! THATS how good they are at keeping secrets: even then they are out in the open, they are secret.

       Here we go with the mindless generalizations from the dipshit that probably doesn't know anything about the Bush family.  GHWB ran the CIA, in case you didn't know.  He was also a CIA asset when he was working for "Zapta Oil" when Kennedy was killed.  He was in Dallas, but he has lied about it numerous times, switching stories from working overseas and Houston, TX, and most recently deciding he "does not remember" where he was that day (Which was the '9/11 moment' of the baby boomer generation).  How about Poppy Bush's closest friend and business partner, Allen Dulles, who was fired from head of the CIA, by JFK, after the Bay of Pigs episode?  Ever since Prescott Bush's dealings on Wall Street, they have been a family deeply ingrained in the American elite culture.  They aren't just some random-ass political family.
       <br/>
       Bush Jr though?  He's not a master mind, as we all know.  He's not even a good liar, I don't think.  He barely made it into Yale, and he almost didn't get tapped for Skull &amp; Bones, the 'secret society' fraternity at Yale that John Kerry also was a member of at almost the exact same time.  He's never been particular spectacular.  He's not much more than his father's son, to put it simply.
      </p>
      <p>
       People tend to be extremely elaborate with 9/11, acting like it is some crazy executed plan involving the highest levels of government.  That's not what it was at all, I would bet.
For all we know, the terrorists who took down those planes were probably none-the-wiser to what they were really doing(by that I mean in the "big picture", they certainly knew they were flying planes into skyscrapers).  They were probably just patsies that thought they were martyrs for Al-Qaeda, which I'm sure they were to most radical Islamists.  But do not forget, we created the Mujahideen in the 1980s through the CIA.  The Saudis were our most valued satellite in the Middle East at the time(and I would venture to say they still are at the end of the day), and Osama Bin Laden, who is from a very wealthy Saudi family, led the newly created group of "freedom fighters".  Which is exactly what they were called when Al-Qaeda was fighting the Soviets.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR
       </strong>
       The CIA does not fuck around.

       Saying OBL didn't do it is different from saying who DID do it.

       The recent NSA scandal has been going on for a very long time. It takes time for the truth to come out. As for 911 I originally said the same thing that the group involved would have to be massive and in turn couldn't be covered up. I guess I still believe that but the idea that the bush administration ignored info and allowed it to happen is completely possible. With the info we have now and the deception about Iraq I would actually say it is probable.

       Way to just dismiss everything said on this thread without a single good use of reasoning or even one fact.... Can I just assert thing too and pass it off as an argument?
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not saying that I disagree with you, just that your "arguments" are actually just uncited assertions.

       Here we go with the mindless generalizations from the dipshit that probably doesn't know anything about the Bush family.  GHWB ran the CIA, in case you didn't know.  He was also a CIA asset when he was working for "Zapta Oil" when Kennedy was killed.  He was in Dallas, but he has lied about it numerous times, switching stories from working overseas and Houston, TX, and most recently deciding he "does not remember" where he was that day (Which was the '9/11 moment' of the baby boomer generation).  How about Poppy Bush's closest friend and business partner, Allen Dulles, who was fired from head of the CIA, by JFK, after the Bay of Pigs episode?  Ever since Prescott Bush's dealings on Wall Street, they have been a family deeply ingrained in the American elite culture.  They aren't just some random-ass political family.
       <br/>
       Bush Jr though?  He's not a master mind, as we all know.  He's not even a good liar, I don't think.  He barely made it into Yale, and he almost didn't get tapped for Skull &amp; Bones, the 'secret society' fraternity at Yale that John Kerry also was a member of at almost the exact same time.  He's never been particular spectacular.  He's not much more than his father's son, to put it simply.

       People tend to be extremely elaborate with 9/11, acting like it is some crazy executed plan involving the highest levels of government.  That's not what it was at all, I would bet.
For all we know, the terrorists who took down those planes were probably none-the-wiser to what they were really doing(by that I mean in the "big picture", they certainly knew they were flying planes into skyscrapers).  They were probably just patsies that thought they were martyrs for Al-Qaeda, which I'm sure they were to most radical Islamists.  But do not forget, we created the Mujahideen in the 1980s through the CIA.  The Saudis were our most valued satellite in the Middle East at the time(and I would venture to say they still are at the end of the day), and Osama Bin Laden, who is from a very wealthy Saudi family, led the newly created group of "freedom fighters".  Which is exactly what they were called when Al-Qaeda was fighting the Soviets.
      </p>

       <strong>
        TL;DR
       </strong>
       The CIA does not fuck around.

       Hard to say. But the CIA sure knew but I don't think they really speak to each other. If it was an inside job they probably made sure the NSA didn't know about it or at least painted a false picture for them. Most of the info was probably in Cheney's multiple man sized safes.
