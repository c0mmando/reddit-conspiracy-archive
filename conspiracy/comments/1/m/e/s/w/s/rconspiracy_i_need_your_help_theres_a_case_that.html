       First off, when it comes to the world of UFOs, you need to scrutinize and torture every aspect of an UFO incident to figure out the truth, thats why im starting up a new discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, I made a thread in
       <a href="/r/ufos">
        /r/ufos
       </a>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1j02th/skepticalbeliever_discussion_and_opinion_time/">
        here
       </a>
       sometime ago, but being
       <a href="/r/ufos">
        /r/ufos
       </a>
       theres a lack of more leveled headed skeptics that can and will reasonably find the faults in the case. Im coming to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to engage the crowd, to give food for thought on the subject, but most importantly be able to have the friendly, open, and more skeptical
       <em>
        leveled
       </em>
       headed intelligent discussion that you just wont find in places like
       <a href="/r/ufos">
        /r/ufos
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/skeptic">
        /r/skeptic
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The subject of ufos has long been considered a subject more of investigation/open discussion than science, and this case has had a surprising lack of discussion and therefor lack of skeptical fact checking for something that could be as important as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'll just copy and paste somethings from the previous thread to get you people caught up to point so we can start talking.

       <strong>
        Abstract:
       </strong>
       Small town of Colares in Brazil came under "attack" by unidentified flying objects in 1977. The objects were reported to come in the typical saucer and cigar shape forms, along with other shapes and sizes. They were seen coming out of the sea and going airborne, and appearing just in the air. One doctor reportedly treated 35 patients during the accounts with two dying. Up to 80 people reported being attacked. Most victims reported being hit by a beam of light and some end up being paralyzed when hit. When hit, people were left with burns and puncture wounds, which makes this a case with actual physical evidence that shows something did in fact attack, and that something was in fact in the air over Brazil in 1977.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a Brazilian government operation called Operation Saucer, in which Brazil kept and recorded documents, up to 500 pictures, and 16 hours of film. The operation was canceled suddenly after three months with no explanation of the happenings and had its files classified for 23 years.
      </p>

       So, can we dive in? What are your thoughts and what are some problems/inconsistencies of yours you would like to point out? Do you have any additional information that should be taken into account?

       I just want to take a moment to thank you for this post. I wholly agree with the importance of skepticism and critical thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've long thought that one great way to "unify" people in order to control them would be to create a unique common enemy to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I don't at all question the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence, I don't quickly dismiss the theories that government (and worse), may attempt to utilize such concepts when grasping at more power.

       I feel your pain regarding r/ufos.  There are some really good people over there but the majority are not interested in anything resembling critical thinking.

       You could just as easily be describing this sub, or any other random/meaningful grouping of people. Critical thinking demands that one considers with equal weight that one's own understanding/beliefs may be incorrect. Almost no one here demonstrates that ability when challenged.

       This is probably neither here nor there, but I would like to add that there was definitely a US presence in Brazil during this time. My father was in the Air Force, E7 but was actually on his way to making E8. We were stationed there right about the same time, from 73 to 76. He never would tell my mom what he did for the Air Force, but that it involved documentation and paperwork that he could not talk about. He was not prone to dramatics and he was a very quiet man. I know this proves nothing and is little more than a side story but felt compelled to add it here.

       I would look for some type of political motive: like somebody wanted to scare the people off of the island, or they wanted to push something off of the headlines or they wanted to test some kind of army weapon. It could be the US or the Brazilian government.

       Brazilian here. I know nothing about ufos and can't really help on this case but there are multiple classified papers that were released to the public not very long ago. Research operation prato. There were also a lot of TV shows covering this case and also others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure there are more experts that could take a closer look into those files. They are just getting released now. During that time Brazil was under a military dictatorship and all the military secret files are being exposed right now to answer questions about all kinds of crimes the dictators did to people. Torture, conspiracy and murder against the opposition. In the middle of those files are the ufos ones. It's decades of reports and investigation by the militaries about the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I heard so far is that they were more intrigued about them then they were hiding. But they gathered evidences and hired experts to solve those cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look also at "et de varginha" (varginha's alien). It's the Brazilian Roswell. Something did crashed in that town in the late 90s and the military did collect debris. There are dozens of witnesses about the ufo flying before the crash and a few that saw the alien.

       and, wtf would be the alien's motivation to cause a skin burn anyways? It seems like this is more like a weapons test or something. the US govt has been known to test weapons on civilians... you never know

       Victims reported that it seemed like when they were being attacked they also had blood taken from them. But theres not way to be sure of this, other then the witness testimony, which can be iffy at times when it comes to UFOs.

       We know for a fact that the Brazilian government investigated and we know for a fact that this investigation was classified.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we can assume that A) something happened (a real event), and B) the authorities not only took the time and expense to investigate, but that they found some things they wanted to remain secret.  This fact, to me, eliminates the possibility that this was a hoax.  Hoaxes don't get classified - if the Brazilian military found out it was bullshit, they would have every motivation to make that information public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, this comment assumes physical objects were present and performed as described, and interacted with humans through some kind of beam technology.  These are my assumptions going forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as submersible aircraft are concerned - they are possible, but the flight characteristics reported here have not yet been created by humans, and definitely not in 1977, though to be fair, the Reid Flying Submarine 1 was built in 1964, and Japan did launch a couple flights from a submarine in 1942.
       <a href="http://www.aerofiles.com/sub-aircraft.html">

      </p>
      <p>
       DARPA put out contracts in 2008 for designs of this nature, but only because materials science has caught up with the concept.  And they're still not talking about anything that can hover in mid-air.
       <a href="http://www.naval-technology.com/news/news89904.html">
        LINK
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, despite classified R&amp;D outpacing consumer available technology by decades - we can rule out humans as the creators of this reported technology in 1977.  It is definitively impossible for humans to achieve these flight characteristics even today.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, where does that leave us?  If we can effectively dismiss the idea that these intelligently-controlled objects of varied description were created by humans - what are our options?  They are limited to an unknown intelligent race on Earth, or an unknown intelligent race from off-planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It follows that an intelligent race with construction facilities to create these 'vehicles' or probes would have a hard time existing on Earth without humanity's knowledge.  Possible, but less likely.  So, we seem to be stuck with the ET explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       What factors go against the ET explanation?
      </p>
      <p>
       The light-speed barrier is one.  Yet modern physics tells us that space can be and is distorted by gravity, and that wormholes, while calling for an inordinate amount of energy manipulation to be created, are not precluded by our understanding of how the Universe works.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't see any reason to outright dismiss this event, or to dismiss the ET interpretation.  Perhaps someone else can point out the flaws in my reasoning, but in my mind this is a very clear cut case of ET/human interaction.

       Some nice thinking... but let me add a couple of variables here:
      </p>
      <p>
       The technology that the government has is light years ahead of what we know they have
      </p>
      <p>
       When talking about ETs, we might also be talking about Earth-based life forms which are able to exist outside of our dimension (inter-dimensional beings).
      </p>
      <p>
       If there are beings coming up from the sea, that may mean that they can live under the sea... which means that they could live on our planet without detection

       I watched a show on the history channel I think it was about this. I thought about it for a good while and the types of craft and what seems to be a weapon of type are all very far ahead of our abilities at the time. At least that we know of.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened is not however above the possibilities of humans. We could with tech we know of now mimic this event rather closely. We have stun lights that disorients people it is pointed at and the physical damage could be replicated with lasers. In this situation even craft that appear to come out of the water could be replicated. Tech is usually explained to the public a decade or two after it's creation. So it is possible I suppose that it could be one of their more powerful governments testing weapons in such a way that it keeps the tech in the shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it isn't man made then we would be looking at a something above our understanding. Beings with technology that we can just barely imagine. Whatever they would have been doing during this time period would be very foreign to us. We would need to think very outside the box to figure out their motives. For them it could be similar to our unmanned recon devices. I suppose it could be possibly these were totally automated and were scanning the population or testing reactions idk. I'll think more on it.

       While I think the US and even other countries will have some pretty funky secret craft and weapons, but I just cant see us having sea to air capabilities with these radiation weapons way back to the 70's. Its not outside the realm of possibility, but I dont just think we would have such tech back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if it was some country (lets say the US), why test the tech on Brazilians? We could get the same results on animals, and even today we still test sound/radiation weapons on US personnel. And if you get caught doing something like this to another countries peoples, that would be an act of war, and thats exactly what the US tried to avoid in the entire Cold War.

       I don't believe that we have water to air craft back then either. It is possible that  with more conventional craft that they could have fooled someone into thinking that it came out of the water at night. For example if they had a light source hanging below a helicopter that went down into the water and then just pull it up out of it. With no lights on the copter it would look like it flew out of the water on it's own. These are just possibilities. They at this point can't be decided one way or another at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for why they would do it to Brazilians instead of animals could be that these weapons were meant to be psychological in nature so it would have to be tested on humans. It is dangerous internationally to do this to another countries population but depending on the country the pressure the US at that time would have been so powerful that most small nation's leaders couldn't have done much. Would have most likely been hard to prove. The biggest danger would be mechanical failure that would leave you stranded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aliens on the other hand would be on a completely different level. If they got here then most likely they have developed warp drive systems. The amount of power needed for drives like that is unreal, since they have it though means their capabilities are basically endless. The other options for them to be here is that they have been here for a long time and their travel here took many generations over thousands of years. This makes them much weaker in technology so their motives would be much different.
      </p>
      <p>
       With slow travel methods they would basically be galactic survivalists. Their ships would have to be long range self sufficient. This would give them much more real world issues that may require them to come to our planet. They could use a system of planet hopping that needs raw materials from time to time. With that in mind what would they gain from these actions in this case? Are these test being run on us? Basic data collection they do on any species they come across? I can't imagine that they would have any reason to fear us so it isn't some kind of scare tactic. Do you know of any other incidents like this one?

       i think it was a weapons test by secret military agencies that have obtained ufo technology. they could have used mind control techniques, the same used in abducted victims, to implant memories. that can explain the retired air force general's experience with the ET.

       Unfortunately, there's nothing to go on. We have all sorts of eye witness corroboration, and some physical records, but beyond that we very quickly run into a dead-end on account that we never have anything alien left in our possession afterwards that would act as your "smoking gun".

       And obviously there isnt direct evidence of aliens, in that nothing points to aliens. But what we do have points to something of intelligence, in that accounts are backed medical records/evidence of something in the physical realm attacking people with more advanced radiation technology while flying.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I said intelligence in the title, not aliens.

      <p>
       Also, intelligence is a place holder like UFO's are to what those unidentified flying objects. Anything could the intelligence, the real question who, and what are they. But the difference is that the term UFO has a large spectrum of outcome, with most of them not being very interesting and important, while the term intelligence has a much smaller, and more important, spectrum of possible outcomes.

       It would be nice. And as you said earlier, if things like this case do turn out to be aliens, it could point to them being malevolent, which wont be very nice. Also, their malevolence could explain why world governments have been so quite, not to panic the public in mass.

       Information offered through Wanderer, sound vibration, Nikola [Tesla], also being experimented with for potential destruction: example, your so-called Philadelphia Experiment.

       Thus, we felt a strong need to involve our thought-forms in whatever way we of the Confederation could be of service in order to balance these distortions of information meant to aid your planetary sphere.

       26.21 Questioner: Then what you did, I am assuming, then, is to create an air of mystery with the UFO phenomena, as we call it, and then by telepathy send many messages that could be either accepted or rejected under the— following, of course, the Law of One so that the population would start thinking seriously about the consequences of what they were doing. Is this correct?

       Ra: I am Ra. This is partially correct. There are other services we may perform. Firstly, the integration of souls or spirits, if you will, in the event of use of these nuclear devices in your space/time continuum. This the Confederation has already done.

       I would start with the hidden hand interview. Once you understand that, the law of one (Ra material) makes more sense.

       It's "channelled" material, which basically means it's a guy pretending some super-intelligent force is speaking through him. Strangely they never seem to be particularly bright.

       They're mainly not crazy (that really is a tiny, tiny minority), but I'd say many have weird pattern-matching oddities which makes them consider some connections between events more significant than they actually are. They're also very polarised - lots of black and white thinking. They also like the illusion of control. Everything has to be under control, even if it's the bad guys in charge, because the thought of chaos is probably just too disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I only tend to take exception to the weirder stuff, or the theories with weak foundations, or the actually harmful stuff like anti-vaxxers. All the political stuff? Well, there's far too much dodgy stuff going on in the world of politics. They're not exactly wrong on that front at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, as that MadHatter guy in here says "nothing will be done by anyone", and he's right. Everybody here is sitting in a web forum talking about how bad everything is, and it changes
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       in the outside world. I'm not excluding myself from that - I'm not changing the world talking here either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, I'm not just replying to you here, I thought I could take the opportunity to share my thoughts with the wider audience that generally doesn't like me.

       Hey man, thanks for the thoughtful reply.

      <p>
       I was mostly making a comment (via a sarcastic joke) on how the minority of conspiracy theorists who are
       <em>
        legitimately
       </em>
       crazy taint the image of the majority who are completely level-headed, but your reply is very appreciated.

       For what it's worth, I do not consider myself a conspiracy theorist. I subscribe to this subreddit because I find it interesting, and also to, on occasion, offer my viewpoint as a skeptic. I believe that a lot of what is posted here has a bit of truth behind it, but by extrapolating from the bit that is known, to form a "conspiracy theory", it warps the truth to the point that people discounting it as "ridiculous" is completely understandable.

       You could just as easily be describing this sub, or any other random/meaningful grouping of people. Critical thinking demands that one considers with equal weight that one's own understanding/beliefs may be incorrect. Almost no one here demonstrates that ability when challenged.
