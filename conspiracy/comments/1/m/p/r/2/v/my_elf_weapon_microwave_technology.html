<a href="http://www.freedomfchs.com/usarmyrptonmicrowavefx.pdf">http://www.freedomfchs.com/usarmyrptonmicrowavefx.pdf</a></p>

<p>Alexis apparently carved &quot;My ELF Weapon&quot; into the gun he used to start his rampage.  It has also been well covered that he was recently reported to be &quot;hearing voices in his head&quot;.<br/>
A quick Google search of ancronyms for ELF comes up with top hit being &quot;extremely low frequency&quot;.  Please pay special attention to page 3/20 and also 10/20.  I encourage you read the entire report but these two pages are specifically related.  This report uses the phrase &quot;extremely low frequency&quot; multiple times to describe this technology.  </p>

<p>This is the top paragraph on page 10:
&quot;Application of the microwave hearing technology could facilitate a private message transmission.  It may be useful to provide a disruptive condition to a person not aware of the technology.  Not only might it be disruptive to the sense of hearing, it could be psychologically devasting if one suddenly head &quot;voices within one&#39;s head.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>semantics but yeah you&#39;re right. It really is very similar to radio - audio frequencies 20hz-20000hz are transmitted on carrier frequencies from ~ 80,000,000hz - 100,000,000hz (20hz-20khz can be carried by a small fraction of the higher frequency spectrum, hence how we have multiple radio stations) </p>

<p>I&#39;m beginning to suspect that this is a large part of the reason for the drug war, being that it probably causes their EM weapons not to function as expected because people be all high and not givin a fuck what the voices in their head are saying </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah similar.</p>

<p>There are other ways though. A voice signal can be split in such a fashion that the formants are transmitted to one side, and harmonics to the other (such as from two EM/ultrasound sources). This results in a voice that only the target can hear, that will not be heard by others in the beam&#39;s path.</p>

<p>Also bone conduction and other more exotic techniques, such as the neurophone - developed and patented by an individual to aid the hard of hearing, but &#39;appropriated&#39; and classified by DARPA or something for military applications - such as communication with dolphins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny you should post that. Along similar lines, I&#39;ve got a similar hunch.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.radiohead.com/Archive/Site4/">Radiohead &quot;scary bears&quot; logo</a> may be related to old Soviet mind control technologies... They live a bit closer to the ol&#39; <a href="http://www.artificialowl.net/2008/12/abandoned-giant-duga-3-system-antenna.html">&#39;scrapyard&#39;</a> so maybe the brain rays or whatever are stronger there. Or they&#39;re just more attuned to it, being brilliant musicians following in the stead of Pink Floyd and all.</p>

<p>Either way, chances are the old Soviet shit would have used an analog system, as digital computer systems of the 30s would not have been particularly suited to graphics and they were a new thing (or nonexistent) anyways. T.V. existed though. The reason I bring this up is that the simple features of the logo or whatever lend themselves to easy vector rendering - if you know what a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve">Lissajous figure</a> is you&#39;ll know what I mean.</p>

<p>That said, the &quot;scary bear&quot; or whatever can be decomposed into component figures (with scale distortion) in a number of fashions. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>&#39;ears&#39; plus two teeth = &#39;scissors&#39; - guess what you can snip with those! (answer: whatever is scariest late at night when you&#39;re sound asleep in bed!)</p>

<p>The eyes - well, you know how quick cats are, and what they do to eyes when startled!</p>

<p>The whole mouth is like a big saw for trunk-like objects, like one of those two-man saws!</p>

<p>Basically pretend you can&#39;t move and then &#39;fantasize&#39; about all the various nasty things that you could do with various parts of this framework or whatever. It&#39;s a fun game - use your imagination!</p>

<p>Sleep paralysis is there to keep you from hurting yourself and others - acting out nightmares (or dreams...) and the like. It sets in shortly before REM.</p>

<p>Sleep tight!</p>

<p>That&#39;s &#39;cause Hollywood&#39;s at least half of the problem (they&#39;re not actually doctors!). It&#39;s brainwashing/interrogation/torture stuff.</p>

<p>Just think about it - &quot;scary bears&quot; is Soviet era methodology. Think of how it must have advanced since then (then being the early &#39;90s).</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s gotten more subtle and more complicated. No less vulgar, depraved, brutal, or malevolent. I mean the methods themselves, not Russia (7,940 days without a Soviet Union, and counting).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True and a fair point.  However, the report is about nonlethal weapons and each are covered.  Each are used for data/message transmission.   The paragraph I quoted is specifixally refering to &quot;microwave hearing&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was about to say this, matey!</p>

<p>ELFs do have a veritable effect on the human psyche arr. Hark, specific frequencies tend to elicit particul<strong>arr</strong> mental/emotional state, akin to confusion, dread (as when we hoist our Jolly Roger arr!), paranoia, melancholic and choleric states, sanguinity, and phlegmatic mood. They can be carried by microwave, or simply on ye ol&#39; bass lute. Scurvy Lou can belt a good one when he&#39;s thrown back a tankard of grog!</p>

<p>In fact, the landlubbers say they&#39;d banned vibrato in those fancy theatres on account of it.</p>
