    <div class="md"><p>...As an engineer who does structural simulations at work and took multiple advanced classes in FEA and Dynamics Simulation, you have no idea how complicated those models are, or the horsepower that goes into the simulation.</p>

<p>It takes about a half hour for my computer to run a static stress simulation on a steel tube frame about 9ft x 3ft x 7ft, assuming idealized conditions, perfectly uniform beams and construction (ie, all welds perfect and identical) and no outside stresses beyond weight of the frame. If you wanted to make it any bigger, one misplaced decimal or fixture point out of the hundreds of thousands could throw the results of the simulation off by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>A simulation with ANY accuracy of the scale you are asking for would take WEEKS to set up by a professional engineer in highly advanced software (Ansys would be my first choice for such a simulation), and could take DAYS to process even on an extremely powerful server farm.</p>

<p>One rinky-dink website and their back-end server could NOT handle that kind of processing power.</p>

<p>The simulator &quot;JFK Reloaded&quot; is not comparable here, as ballistic physics are far, far, far simpler and on a MUCH smaller scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh a fellow engineer...</p>

<p>I was about to type most of what he just said so I&#39;ll add my $0.02. </p>

<p>I think saying it would take days is extremely optimistic. I know that car crash simulations (1 car hitting a barrier) that lasts a few seconds in real time, take well in excess of a week on a 32 core computer. For that type of building with a proper mesh and then the aircraft with the proper mesh.... Months. And that&#39;s assuming you get all your constraints, boundary conditions, relationships, etc correct the first time. I know I usually screw at least one thing up. </p>

<p>And for thermal loads and stresses I&#39;m not even sure what type of elements you would use. </p>

<p>Also, if I recall correctly the twin towers were one of the first uses of high strength concrete. If you don&#39;t know anything about pouring concrete, I&#39;ll tell you, pouring any concrete over 10ksi is not fun. The stuff flows with the consistency of play-dough. That means there is likely to be voids and holidays but you don&#39;t know where. </p>

<p>There are so many details that could effect the structural integrity that you&#39;d have a hard time getting anywhere near an accurate model. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your referring to the guys with the shovels then got starters there is no context where that concrete was poured and for the second reason, the fact that they had to use shovels indicates its stiff. </p>

<p>What was the sump last time you cast 10ksi concrete? Personally I had a little less than 1&quot; and nobody though I could get it out if the mixer. Of course if you mix concrete for a living you likely have more knowledge than me. But there aren&#39;t a lot of places that mix this type of concrete. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No offense, but that&#39;s not true for high strength concrete. There has been research on self consolidating high strength mixes in the past decade or so which uses fly ash to increase the flow properties but back when the towers were built I seriously doubt the used fly ash. Silica fume is a definite possibility but that won&#39;t help your ability to pour. </p>

<p>High strength is super stiff because of its low water to cement ratio. This is further hindered because of the massive quantity of rebar required in the structural components for buildings like these, especially at joints, intersections and around openings in panels. It&#39;s also risky to use a vibrator in these dense areas of rebar because if you hit the rebar with the vibrating wand you essentially guarantee a void around the rebar, thus no bonding which then results in loss of any tensile capacity you though you had. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One misplaced weld can change the stresses on another by an order of magnitude or greater. Consider a small truss with 4 Junctions, each in theory capable of holding 10,000 lbs. One of them has a small defect, enough to reduce its load-carrying capacity to 9800 lbs, only a 2% reduction. Now say the whole structure experiences a load of 39600 lbs, or 9900 lbs per junction. The one that has a 2% deficiency collapses. The other 3 do NOT survive because, surprise, now they have to hold up their portion, plus another 3300 lbs assuming the collapsed weight is evenly distributed--in reality it could all be placed on just one, giving it a load of almost double what it was made to hold. When that collapses, move to the next which now has triple the load it is designed to hold, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>Now spread this across hundreds of support beams on dozens of floors and you can see how quickly the safety factors can be overwhelmed by huge factors to cause near-instantaneous failures, all budding from one small initial failure. Many buildings are designed to account for this potential failure scenerio, yes, and many construction styles COULD survive in some cases. However, depending on how widespread the damage is or the types of errors in the construction or how their factor of safety is obtained, it may not be enough anyway.</p>

<p>Point is, there is <em>no</em> margin of error acceptable for a simulation or full-scale reproduction if you want to have accurate results. A few pounds  of stress on one side could magnify to tens of thousands or more on the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There you go jumping from what may be small error and determine that absolutely will ruin all results. This is a logical fallacy--error must be taken in consideration before a simulation takes place and measures are taken to ensure per-determined parameters stay within range. </p>

<p>Newsflash--there is always error in complex simulations and there are methods to extrapolate data from what is tested. Science is handy that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was an admittedly extreme example how fast things can go wrong from a model, and how for a model of this scale, your margin of error will be too large for any useful results to be produced unless you are incredibly precise. Sure, it is POSSIBLE to get a useful model. I&#39;ve heard the 9/11 Commission did an ANSYS model of at least 16 floors of the building as part of their report. The level of detail required, however, is staggering and grows exponentially as the modeled system expands</p>

<p>Proof by contradiction is not necessarily a logical fallacy, especially when dealing with mathematics.</p>

<p>Oh, and calling someone a &quot;n00b&quot; is Argumentum ad hominem, which is one of the biggest logical fallacies :3</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of COURSE they dont know. In the mind of a typical conspiracy theorist, there&#39;s no room for facts or evidence. Only opinion. Someone plants the seed that its the government&#39;s fault, throws a couple of well thought-out words together and then everyone else just echos that opinion without a moments thought. And when you give an opinion enough times and its parroted enough times by enough people, it magically transmorphs into FACT right before your very eyes! </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter that Bush was to blame. According to fear mongers like Alex Jones, Bush is only a puppet in the grande conspiracy. it&#39;s the NEW WORLD ORDER that pulls the strings.</p>

<p>If you put that on TV, it would be probably the most watched show on the planet. As big or bigger than the Super Bowl. The ad revenue would be enormous (but I confess I have no idea about ad revenue for TV). </p>

<p>Why does Richard Branson have to build a stupid space plane for rich assholes to joyride in? That crazy fuck could do something useful with his money. </p>
