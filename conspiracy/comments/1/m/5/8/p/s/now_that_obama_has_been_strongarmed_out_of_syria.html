<p>This false flag needs to be at the very least equivalent to 911.</p>

<p>WHY?</p>

<p>Because 91% of americans are opposed to more wars. This is causing Congress to vote for pacifism.</p>

<p>The American citizens are not going to be swayed to go to war through political rhetoric.</p>

<p>This false flag is going to have to be HUGE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you never played chess?</p>

<p>EVERY attack ever made is made to provoke the enemy to strike.</p>

<p>(Unless annihilation is achieved in the first strike)</p>

<p>Does it matter if the attack comes from a &quot;particular country&quot;? </p>

<p>NO</p>

<p>Attacks can be organized by groups across boarders.</p>

<p>&quot;False Flag&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that we were attacked by our own countrymen necessarily. (Although that can certainly be the case)</p>

<p>&quot;False Flag&quot; simply means that the group/country that the victim blames for the attack is also a victim, and the real criminals get to watch both sides mutually destroy each other.</p>

<p>Most wars are false flag wars.</p>

<p>It is very rare that a war is started by a country faxing over a declaration to it&#39;s enemy.</p>

<p>Have you ever reached around someones back to tap them on the opposite shoulder? They then look to the left and blame the other person for tapping them? That is false flag.</p>

<p>What better way to achieve destruction than to have two of your enemies fight each other? </p>

<p>It&#39;s like getting a free lunch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as a party manuevering to get into the US into war there is pretty much a false flag and then there is allowing a bumbling agent to successfully attack the US.</p>

<p>Well I&#39;ve watched several seasons of Burn Notice and that is how he does it.  It makes sense (and great show btw).  Its always best when the people committing the act are acting on their seemingly independent volition.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are many parties that would like to see the US be attacked hard and that list includes all of the elites from; Saudi Arabia, Qatar, all of Western Europe, Israel and Turkey.  Yeah, so all of the criminal scum in those countries would love to see the US get hit real hard.  Will it happen?  Unfortunately, too many people believe that they will benefit.  Then with Syria&#39;s chemical weapons removed Israel won&#39;t need to worry about getting disease fucked in the ass and they would likely think that they could weather a few dozen missiles that get through the missile defense shield there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well who the hell is big smartgrid?</p>

<p>The smart grid is a government program, and there is a drill set for Oct. 12-14 with FEMA enacting the scenario of massive cyber and physical attacks on our power grid to determine what would happen in the event of it going down.</p>

<p>They could very easily let that drill go live and ensure mass panic and chaos that would also allow them to get away with doing bad things while it&#39;s happening since there would be no phone, television, or most importantly, internet.</p>

<p>Shit, if they use any EMPs there will be no use of any electronic devices and everybody with a pace maker will die.</p>
