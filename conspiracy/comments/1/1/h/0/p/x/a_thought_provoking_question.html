       In the past presidents have refrained from the pushing highly controversial policies until their second term to avoid defeat. For this president even indefinite detention of citizens and many other policies was not much of a concern for him. Keep in mind I'm not saying that Mitt will be any better. But what kind of crazy shit do you guys think this guy will pull in term 2?

       He will just take another soft step toward world government and try to make it seem like a good choice.

       I agree. Gun control is first on the agenda. I'm afraid he will do much more than a soft step but a very aggressive one.

       Ya, sanctions the US imposes... You do understand..?  And a lot of countries still use it.  Iran gives China roughly 15% of their oil and natural gas, that is a higher percent than we get from the Saudis, not to mention India and Japan as well.

       Obama wrote a signing statement saying he thought the detaining went too far and that
       <em>
        he
       </em>
       wouldn't use it. I've never seen anything that suggested he specifically requested that the unlawful detainment of americans be a power added to the law.

       Whether you believe him or not is another issue. As is whether or not the signing statement matters. Though I think we all know what happens to presidents that get on the wrong side of the MIC

       In addition to that when it had been blocked by judge Forrest the White House called her action (to strike down indefinite detention) "unprecedented" and the Obama doj atty general Eric holder asked for the ruling to be put on hold (clearly after that they leaned on her and has it overturned). So your intimation that Obama and his office have nothing to do with this is absurd. It was his very people that fought to get the indefinite detention back in there, but not him that tried to get in there in the first place? He didn't want it in there but when it was taken out he wanted it back in, is that right?

       Out of curiosity, did you even read the link I provided you? It absolutely addresses your point. I can explain it to you, if you'd like. But you seem like you might be smart enough to figure it out yourself. Maybe?

       Yes in order for it to be tackled by the regular courts, as opposed to the way the same actions are enabled by the patriot act but behind secret courts. That's the exact point they make.

       Enough of your redditor douche attitude. Fact of the matter is Obama did not hate the idea of having it in there and then fight to get it back. Here's a suggestion, learn how to use some logic, get rid of the trendy douche attitude and go get laid and/or go fuck yourself.

       Learn to use logic? You are the one that is completely unable to understand the fact that Obama included those provisions so there would be clear legal avenues to challenge them. If he didn't it meant the same powers would continue to be enshrined
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       protected by secret courts.
