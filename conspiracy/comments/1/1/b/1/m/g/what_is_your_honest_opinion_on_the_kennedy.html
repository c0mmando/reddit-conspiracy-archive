    <div class="md"><p>It is also somewhat suspect that Oswald himself had ties to the intelligence community. As you delve into GHW Bush, Nixon, and E. Howard Hunt&#39;s personal histories and whereabouts that day (or conflicting versions of events), the situation becomes even more suspect. I&#39;m not some expert on JFK, but the (very low-budget) film {JFK II](<a href="http://youtu.be/DkVGShtuPcQ">http://youtu.be/DkVGShtuPcQ</a>) goes into some of the very specific details I mentioned above. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Granted that we are speculating here, I think you may be correct in your hypothesis and in raising that question. It seems as though many entities had a direct interest in eliminating Kennedy, and that is certainly an interesting thought about some particular entity or faction &quot;winning&quot;. I think Lyndon Johnson&#39;s ascension into presidency via Kennedy&#39;s assasination, and looking at those with close ties to him(there are many suspects) is probably the key to answering that question, in my speculative opinion...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you on most points except the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>JFK isn&#39;t the best example of showing why Oswald couldn&#39;t have pulled it off. Here&#39;s a non-Hollywood produced film called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsMKMMlleOE">JFK II</a> which goes <em>way</em> beyond the iconic &quot;back and to the left&quot; scene. Also, on a side note, I no longer think the so-called &quot;laws of physics&quot; are the final say in all physical phenomena. Appealing to their authority may be relevant in this case, but it&#39;s a strange world out there, and I believe anything is possible, including the inevitable demise of these &quot;laws&quot;. But yes, any schoolchild would see the gaping logical flaws when presented with the supposed &quot;physics&quot; of the official story of the assassination</p></li>
<li><p>You can&#39;t forget the involvement of the Mafia and the anti-Castro Cubans. The CIA absolutely is culpable, but so was the FBI. This went to the top. I also used to think that Executive Order 11110 was a much bigger deal with regards to motive than I do now. Sure, it was a factor, but that legislation would&#39;ve hardly put a dent in the monopoly of the Federal Reserve. It was just one piece in a larger picture of an increasingly independent-minded president.</p></li>
<li><p>This aspect of the story doesn&#39;t get mentioned as much, but I think it&#39;s important: <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/kennedy-proposes-joint-mission-to-the-moon">Kennedy had <em>just</em> announced that he wanted to work with Khrushchev on a joint mission to the moon</a>. This would have changed <em>everything</em>, especially the whole Cold War absurdity which was proving so lucrative for TPTB in terms of keeping the population scared and submissive. President Johnson of course nixed this idea completed and continued to ramp up tensions with the Soviets.</p></li>
<li><p>Enochx brings up an important point that has only begun to be discussed more in recent years with respect to the Kennedy assassination. JFK was beginning to curtail Israel&#39;s rogue nuclear program. Bad idea. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbrZGNDA7A">Here&#39;s a video of Gaddafi speaking about this subject.</a> This is by no means an endorsement of Gaddafi on my part, but I do find it interesting that so shortly after making such bold pronouncements (and after attempting to create a regional and independent African currency) Gaddafi was quite literally done away with.</p></li>

<p>No, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110">Executive Order 11110</a> was not in any way against the Federal Reserve. It was part of Kennedy&#39;s plan to eliminate silver certificates and replace them with Federal Reserve notes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your answers. My next question would be where you thought the second shooter was hiding? </p>

<p>Many people (including eyewitnesses at the scene) believe he was at the grassy knoll. Here&#39;s my problem with it. Would it not have made more sense for the second shooter to be in a position in line with the direction the car was moving (i.e. behind or in-front, like the book depository) to make for an easier shot? Shooting a moving target from the side would have been far more difficult. Why would he not be sitting in the book depository next to the first shooter?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not debating your opinion... just offering that the terrain looked a lot different than I had anticipated from all the TV and movie stuff I&#39;d seen prior.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t been there, at least take a tour via google street view. I&#39;m not saying it will change your mind (it might make you more certain of what you believe) but that it&#39;s an interesting little part of Dallas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I haven&#39;t been but I see your point, &quot;in front&quot; might be pushing it a little. It is to one side but still an excellent spot to take a shot, far better than the book depository...</p>

<p>Indeed it is, being a roughly pyramid shaped plaza with an <em>obelisk shrine</em> and other details of interest.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been to the book depository museum in Dallas, and thus disagree with your statement about the spacial relationship of the depository and Kennedy&#39;s motorcade.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not commenting on whether or not there was a second shooter.... just that it&#39;s incorrect to say that the book depository was not adequately positioned for the assassination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on the way you worded your response... I think you disagree.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in the book depository, right next to the window that LHO fired from. It&#39;s positioned perfectly to shoot the president during his motorcade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right on. I wasn&#39;t trying to prove anything regarding LHO.</p>

<p>My comment was focused on the position of the 6th floor window in the depository in relation to the president in his motorcade. From that window, the president would have been a VERY easy target.</p>

<p>I agree that it proves nothing regarding Oswald or a second shooter. I actually <strong>DO</strong> have an opinion on that, but its not related to the point I&#39;m currently making.</p>

<p>Anyone who is interested in the JFK assassination would very much enjoy the 6th Floor Museum. It was very cool.</p>

<p>One thing I did while I was there that&#39;s also interesting... I walked over to the infamous grassy knoll, and just stood there and looked around for a minute or two. It struck me as interesting that I still had a clear shot of the depository window on the 6th floor.</p>

<p>Again, it proves nothing, like you said. All that was &quot;proven&quot; to me was that it&#39;s entirely <em>plausible</em> that shots on the motorcade came from that window. That does NOT disprove that there could be a 2nd shooter, or that LHO was framed... But to say that its not possible for shots to have come from the depository... that&#39;s just false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said before, the only belief of yours I was willing to challenge (even though I disagree with you entirely) was the position of the building in relation to the president.</p>

<p>After you visit the museum on a trip to Dallas (which you may or may not have the opportunity to do) I think you will agree that it&#39;s possible for shots to have come from there.</p>

<p>The fatal shot? Maybe, maybe not.
The only shots fired? Maybe, maybe not.
Possible to shoot JFK? Yes 100%.</p>

<p>In the museum there is also wonderful breakdown of the zapruder film, as well as a half dozen other less prominent films by other citizens on that day.</p>

<p>Will it prove anything? no. But based on your level of interest in this subject... You&#39;re a fool if you don&#39;t visit this museum. It&#39;s very cool.</p>

<ul>
<li>Was assassinated for refusing to allow Israel to have a rogue nuclear weapons program, and attempting to force the domestic Zionist-Jews working within the U.S. Government to be classified as &quot;Foreign Agents working on behalf of Israel&quot;.   Jack &quot;Ruby&quot; Rubenstein was used to seal up the loose end and silence their pasty.</li>

<hr/>

<p><strong>RFK</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Was assassinated for passing the legislation that forced the American Zionist Council (A.Z.C.) to register as a foreign lobby.  This lead to the A.Z.C. to morph/rebrand itself into A.I.P.A.C.   Which was specifically formed to avoid the intent of RFK&#39;s law to reign in the influence of Zionist-Jews on American Foreign Policy.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>In the 1950s President Eisenhower&#39;s administration repeatedly demanded the leaders of the American Zionist Council register as &quot;agents of a foreign government.&quot;[31] <strong>In November 1962 Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy&#39;s Department of Justice ordered the American Zionist Council to register as a foreign agent because of FARA violations alleging it was being funded by the Jewish Agency for Israel and acting on behalf of Israel. Under pressure from the Israel lobby and the President Lyndon B. Johnson administration, the Department of Justice later withdrew its demand.</strong></p>

<p>The American Zionist Council was reorganized as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). In 1988 former Senator William Fulbright in the 1970&#39;s and former senior CIA official Victor Marchetti, both enemies of AIPAC, unsuccessfully petitioned the Department of Justice to register the lobby under the Act.[33]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Definitely
2) The coverup was vast and involved lots of people from many walks of life including but not limited to the Secret Service, the doctors at the hospital JFK was taken to, The guy who did the autopsy, the CIA, E Howard Hunt, other politicians, the mafia, and the main stream media.
3) the motive was probably going to war in Vietnam and increasing the defense budget, control and power.</p>

<p>These are of course my thoughts on the matter.  I&#39;m sure people will disagree.  I think <a href="http://blogcritics.org/video/article/dvd-review-dark-legacy-george-bush/">Dark Legacy</a> provides some interesting view points and things to consider.  It also paints an interesting picture of who was probably involved in the conspiracy.  Definitely worth a watch and it is streaming on Netflix for anyone who has Netflix and is interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that there was a &quot;probable&quot; conspiracy based on since debunked acoustical evidence. The National Academy of Sciences, in 1982, concluded that the so-called gunshots on a Dictabelt recording were recorded &quot;one minute after the assassination&quot;. The HSCA did correctly conclude that Oswald fired all the shots that struck anybody that day in Dallas (including that of JD Tippett). They found that there was no evidence of a conspiracy or cover-up by anyone within the FBI, Warren Commission or any other government agency. They were suspicious of organized crime but, given that no one ever talked, that seems less and less likely with each passing day. Oswald acted alone!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fake. The official story, that is. Shitty Carcano bolt action rifle (that jammed when trying to recreate his trigger pulls? How did he get of two shot on target with such a dirty firearm? </p>

<p>Answers to your questions:</p>

<p>1) Yes, absolutely. And I believe both shots were fired closer that the book depository.</p>

<p>2) Huge. He said he was going after the CIA. The CIA blamed him for the botched Bay of Pigs invasion and knew he was coming for them. They did what any group would do when threatened with destruction.</p>

<p>3) Pretty sure I answered that one above, but they may not have been the only ones behind it. I am sure they had private contractors.</p>

<p>Nice post, OP! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now although I feel the show is annoying and obviously pushing an agenda, the show Bullshit by penn and teller shows that the gun used by Oswald is known for some weird physics.  The high speed small sized bullet Causes the object to go towards the shooter, as they demonstrate on watermelons.  I thought there was no way till I saw it.  They do it right on their show, they shoot watermelon with the same gun, and the watermelon fall off their stands towards them.  I still think there is a massive cover up,  but that is one thing that at least is debunked to me. What do you guys think?</p>

<p>Entire interview is great, but will really blow your mind between 20 minutes &amp; 40 minute mark.</p>

<p>tl;dr of book:  Oswald worked for David Ferrie (intelligence spook played by Joe Pesci in film <em>JFK</em>) in New Orleans, and was Army Intelligence <em>and</em> had early ties to New Orleans organized crime.  Oswald was working as an assistant on a vaccine project that ostensibly was creating an anti-cancer vaccine but in fact was mutating viruses, leading to SV40 and AIDS in later decades.  One of the research assistants who worked with Oswald has stepped forward, and has proof that she worked with him:  tax receipts for the IRS.  And there&#39;s more ...</p>

<p>Granted, the news outlets generally say the POTUS will be driving through a certain area to wave at the crowds, but the timing is generally off. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen the Oliver Stone film. The closest I came, don&#39;t laugh, to see any of the evidence laid out on film, was the episode of Quantum Leap where Bakula&#39;s character leaps into LHO. There was even a disclaimer at the beginning of the episode stating the events in the show were based on findings of various reports and studies. The only thing different was that Sam prevented Jackie from getting hit and only JFK died. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes there was absolutely a conspiracy. The question is, to what degree? I think LHO was involved, many like to paint him as the &quot;patsy&quot; which he was, but I don&#39;t think he knew they were setting him up to be. I don&#39;t think LHO was capable of making the shots that he made at that range, on a moving target, with that gun. It was virtually impossible. Also, look at the direction in which Kennedy was thrown from the force of the shot, back and to the left. How could this be possible from a shot from the right rear? And since when is a bullets entry wound larger than an exit wound? 
Next you have to look at the motives. Who has the most to gain, and who has the power to pull it off? Remember that JFK had fired the head of the CIA Allan Dulles for the whole Bay of Pigs debacle. So not only are friends and colleagues upset with Kennedy for the firing, they were also upset for the lack of support during the Bay of Pigs in which 100+ Cuban exiles were killed. Secondly you have the mafia. They were pissed at RFK because of his hard-nosed stand against organized crime. J. Edgar Hoover had been working with the Organized crime families for years until young Bobby was appointed Attorney General. So now you have elements of the CIA (which at that time answered to no one) and you have nearly every organized crime family, not to mention J. Edgar Hoover for hanging him out to dry with the mafia. I won’t even address the LBJ factor. Needless to say, there were a lot of people who were more than satisfied when JFK was pronounced dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oswald did it alone.</p>

<p><strong>The timings of the different shots is all speculation.</strong> So you can say it was a certain number of seconds, but nobody knows for sure. Anyone who claims to know the exact timings of the shot is almost certainly bullshitting you.</p>

<p>The distance in which Oswald shot Kennedy is well within his ability and range. As a marine, he shot something like 38/40 at 200 yards. The longest shot(the head shot) in the Kennedy Assassination is 77 yards.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t even realize that there is more film of the Kennedy Assassination other then the Zapruder film. There is video of the grassy knoll as Kennedy is being shot in the head. Orville Nix filmed the grassy knoll just as everything was happening. People try and point out shadows and shit but it seems to be all BS in my eyes. There is nothing there. If someone shot from the grassy knoll, Zapruder himself was in perfect position to see it. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSBXW1-VGmM">As for all the &quot;magic bullet&quot; stuff this video explains it well.</a></p>

<p>The best way to prove it to yourself is to actually visit Dealey Plaza. You&#39;ll see it is much smaller then it appears to be in photos and videos.</p>

<p>Entire interview is great, but will really blow your mind between 20 minutes &amp; 40 minute mark.</p>

<p>tl;dr of book:  Oswald worked for David Ferrie (intelligence spook played by Joe Pesci in film <em>JFK</em>) in New Orleans, and was Army Intelligence <em>and</em> had early ties to New Orleans organized crime.  Oswald was working as an assistant on a vaccine project that ostensibly was creating an anti-cancer vaccine but in fact was mutating viruses, leading to SV40 and AIDS in later decades.  One of the research assistants who worked with Oswald has stepped forward, and has proof that she worked with him:  tax receipts for the IRS.  And there&#39;s more ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha without ignorant speculation, it would be hard to. Scopolamine was widely tested by the CIA back then and if they had a hand in it, they almost certainly would have used this drug on the killer(s).Apply the same thinking to the Aurora shooting.
