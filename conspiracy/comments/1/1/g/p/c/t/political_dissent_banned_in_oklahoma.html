    <div class="md"><p>Nothing new.  This will be the 3rd election in a row with just R v. D on the ballot in OK.  After such a heartbreaking primary and convention season with regard to Ron Paul&#39;s candidacy, I had hoped the libertarians would have their shit together to capitalize on that untapped momentum.  Not a chance.  After 12 years, they apparently prefer to continue bitching about their difficulties in obtaining the signatures, instead of focusing on a strategy that will net the signatures and get over that 1st hurdle.  After all, Americans Elect was able to round up the signatures first crack out of the box.  Then they didn&#39;t want to run a candidate.  Perfect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why wouldn&#39;t it be? As far as I can tell, any non-winning amount of votes is worthless with the US&#39; retarded election system, so what would be the point of asking for a million votes if they can&#39;t even get thousands of signatures? It&#39;s just a waste of time if they have no chance of winning the election.</p>

<p>I&#39;d actually be surprised if any major election didn&#39;t require this, simply to avoid having a million crazy people on every ballot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In every other state 3rd parties and/or write-ins exist.  While of course it is legal, since this is the system our glorious legislature has set up.  That you seem to be arguing oklahoma&#39;s restrictive ballot access should be utilized in other areas is unnerving.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not arguing for anything, it&#39;s just that I assumed similar hurdles would be in place in most large elections. They definitely are where I&#39;m from.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t see the problem. To win, you need at least hundreds of thousands of votes, millions in larger states.  If you expect to get that many votes, how hard could it be to gather a few thousand signatures? With first past the post, a minority of votes doesn&#39;t gain you anything, so there&#39;s no difference to not being on the ballot at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does matter, since a significant percentage of the vote will automatically enter that party on the ballot next go around, if I&#39;m not mistaken.  That&#39;s why the 2 big parties don&#39;t have to gather the signatures for each election like the smaller parties do.  To be fair, the signatures required are significant, 3% of total registered voters, which amounts to around 50k signatures from valid registered voters.  Apparently it&#39;s too difficult for our inept libertarians to jump that hurdle, even though they&#39;ve had 12 years of practice.  </p>

<p>The only way to lower the percentage needed (and thus have more similar requirements to most other states) is to change the law.  Supreme Court has repeatedly showed it will not intervene on behalf of the third parties or the voters of the state.</p>
