       In my town there has been a rise of measles and mumps in children, one died because people like you stopped giving their children the vaccines for them.  The thing is, even if you get the vaccine you can still get the disease if you have a lot of contact with someone with the disease, so a small number of idiots refusing to get something that will keep them safe, can lead to a situation where everyone around them can get sick.

       No. Apart from all the mercury etc the fact is flu shot is based on last years virus. They mutate so fast the odds of it being effective are very long. It's just another big-pharma scam. Money for them, side-effects for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should balance your decision against your general health though. If you are old or weak it may be worth considering, people do die from flu.

       There is no mercury in the flu shot. There is thermisol, which can break down into mercury, and it's been removed from most standard vaccinations and can only be found in the combined flu shots.

       Not sure why people are downvoting you, there really isn't any mercury(Hg) in the flu shot. It's just an antiseptic and preservative. It's even in tattoo ink.. The mercury is in a compound called Thiomersal and it is as follows.. C9H9HgNaO2S.. If you take some Chemistry classes, you would learn that when elements combine to form stable compounds, their properties change. Hydrogen is flammable, yet H20 isn't.. People really shouldn't fear science.

       Thermisol  from the medical dictionary= a mercury-containing compound used as a local antibacterial agent in the form of the tincture. Used also as a preservative in pharmaceutical preparations. Known as Merthiolate.

       No. Just wash your hands regularly, and don't go licking anyone who is sick. If you do get the flu, drink tea with lemon and honey, maybe some Theraflu, and sleep as much as you can. You'll be fine in a few days. This isn't the 1800's, the flu isn't going to kill you...it isn't worth the risk of being injected with shite.

       Well, yes, the risk of infection is much higher, which is the whole point. Doesn't make harmless microorganisms in vaccines suddenly turn harmful, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, directly reaching the bloodstream through infection of open wounds is common in nature.

       I'm not a anti-vax'er but I don't get the flu shot because it's just the flu.  If I get it... I'll un-get it in a couple days.  Simple as that.

       All vaccines are dangerous, but sometimes the kind of life you lead outweighs the risks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically you just ask yourself how many different people you come into close contact with on a daily basis. If it's a lot then you ask yourself how bad a week of sickness would be for you. If you meet a lot of people, have a health condition which makes a flu dangerous to you (or have a job where you'll get fired if you're sick) then a flu vaccine might be a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise it's hardly worth it, and remember, you'll need a new one each year.

       Actually, ingestion does send chemicals directly to the blood stream. Many medicines/pain killers are given via injection as well. What can't you believe that we need to be told? That it doesn't matter how the chemicals enter the bloodstream as long as they enter the bloodstream? Really though whats your point and why can't you believe people still need to be told this? I can't believe people are still anti science in the this 21st century. Not just science, basic science that has helped the world tremendously.

       Because stomach acid destroys many fragile compounds long before they can be absorbed (such as insulin). But for compounds that can survive stomach acid, they go into your bloodstream all the same. Some compounds cause GI problems (like unbuffered aspirin) that bypass that problem with injection. There's a lower and more unpredictably variable bioavailability for digestion, since the compound may pass before being absorbed, or the absorption may be affected by food/drink taken with the pill. Digestion is a delayed onset, which is unsuitable when you need an immediate effect (such as during a stroke or heart attack). I could go on, but you get the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this changes the fact that two molecules, one injected and one ingested, will still enter the bloodstream just the same.

       I'm no expert, but I would guess that its because our bodies metabolize certain chemicals differently than others. The core foundation of science is questioning truth. How am I putting science on a pedestal?

       Bingo what? It doesn't matter how something gets into the blood stream as long as it gets there. Why is this any different than if chemicals were absorbed through the stomach or even the skin? They still make it to the blood stream.

       All medicine has side effects and vaccines can have some really nasty ones. The worst side effects of a common flu shot are Encephalitis (acute inflammation of the brain) and Guillain–Barré syndrome.

       I used to get the flu shot in highschool and i still got the flu every year. I moved away from home for college and was too stoned to go get one. I still got the flu. Either way you are going to get the flu so why bother wasting time getting the shot? Apathy FTW!

       There are a gazillion articles out there breaking down the ingredients of the flu vaccine cocktail. I have not found one stating, "the chemicals in the flu vaccine are vital to staying healthy". Personally, I will not inject myself with Formaldehyde or all those other questionable chemicals.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the effects of Formaldehyde?

       The best sort of flu prevention is a proper diet.

       Ninja edit: I have never had a flu shot. I get sick maybe once every two years for a week. I've never died. I have a healthy immune system. Maybe it's luck or maybe it's because I eat healthy.

       Do humanity a favor, get the flu shot. Don't listen to people who try to tell you that its bad for you. You see, the flu is contagious. By not getting the flu shot, you are just making yourself a possible stepping stone for the flu virus to spread.

       I'm guessing that you don't get the shot? And thus, other "smart people" will not get it either?

       Your misinformation has no place here. You are not contagious when you get the vaccine and you also do not get the flu from the vaccine. Its misinformation agents like yourself that cause the public to become ignorant and afraid of science.

       How do you know, it's not been tried out yet, vaccines usually contain live viruses and a lot of them have been reported contaminated earlier. I'd say wait and see, if the first people don't turn out sick or catch sleep disorders from them I guess it's ok to take it. But since we don't really know yet I would NOT take it at all, at least not the yearly useless flushots.
      </p>

       No, I'm not a misinformation agent, just skeptical towards the history of vaccines and it's related industry.

       Vaccines have a proven track record of being effective. Polio is a great example of what modern day vaccinations can do.

       The proven track record of the polio vaccine========In 1960, it was determined that the rhesus monkey kidney cells used to prepare the poliovirus vaccines were infected with the SV40 virus (Simian Virus-40).[50] SV40 was also discovered in 1960 and is a naturally occurring virus that infects monkeys. In 1961, SV40 was found to cause tumors in rodents.[51] More recently, the virus was found in certain forms of cancer in humans, for instance brain and bone tumors, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, and some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.............

       The ingredients in a flu shot are documented. The chemicals are documented, and the example I linked to on cancer.gov states cancer can be a high possibility. I derive my opinions from scientific studies and proof.
