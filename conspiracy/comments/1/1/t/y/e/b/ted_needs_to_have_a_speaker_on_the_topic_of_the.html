       As a TEDster it disappoints me that an architect or demolitions expert hasn't gone on TED and debunked the WTC collapse. TED only has a video of how two mothers found forgiveness post WTC collapse. Any one else on here wish this, also please post links to videos I want to spread the truth through video.

       What do you mean?  A single beam failed due to thermal expansion which caused the entire building to collapse straight down, including 2.5 seconds of total freefall acceleration which happened because the interior of the building had collapsed first and the facade was holding itself up.  After the fact they also found samples of steel that had holes corroded through them (also the first time in history), but this is simply due to the fact that normal office materials combined together during to form a eutectic mixture.

       But I have looked at the structural engineering.  According to NIST the whole building came down due to a single beam failing.  Totally believable.

       Whats's that?  Thermal expansion causing a single beam to fail which leads to a progressive collapse that has 2.5 seconds of freefall and eutectic mixtures spontaneously forming which melts holes in the steel and news agencies reporting on it before it even occurs?  There is nothing out of the strange about this.  Perfectly normal.  Happens all the time!

       I'd say its way more likely that they made a mistake and made an incorrect announcement during a hectic event. Way more likely than the US government deciding to fill in the BBC in one of the most complicated false flag attacks ever for no reason at all except to let them announce the collapse ahead of time.

I think the point is that someone knew the building was going to come down.  By the way BBC wasn't the only one to report on it...I know of at least two other news stations that had been given information that &amp; was going to come down.
        <strong>
         So how did anyone know that for the first time in history thermal expansion was going to cause a single beam to fail, which in turn would cause the whole building to fail?  Answer that.

       That is Ashleigh Banfield.  You can tell they've been waiting for it to come down because she says something to the effect of "Here, it is" - meaning the event they've been waiting for is occurring.

       Would they have said that because the building had been hit by another falling building and had fires that had been left to burn as emergency response was elsewhere? Maybe they were making an educated guess that it would fall.  I still see literally NO reason for the BBC to be informed of this false flag attack.  Or any news station for that matter.  They would report a collapsing building anyway, why would the government let more people in on their plan when there is no gain at all from BBC reporting it falling?

       No, because it would be impossible for them to know the building was going to collapse since the reason it collapsed, thermal expansion, had never caused a building to collapse - it wasn't even considered a possible mechanism of collapse.

      <p>
       You are entirely missing the point.  The question is how anyone knew it was going to come down?  Explain that or admit you can't - I am not even remotely interested in your speculation about how you think the world works or your inability to come up with speculative reasons why someone would do x, y, or z.  If you want to explain how anyone knew that building was going to collapse and not any of the other damaged buildings in the vicinity feel free to do so.

       They didn't "know" it was going to come down. Either they misreported it (what a shocker, people can be wrong sometimes during a chaotic event like 9/11?) or they thought it was going to come down based on the fact that it was hit by another building, it was on fire, it was evacuated, and no one was trying to put the fire out.  Give me one, just one reason why the US government would inform BBC reporter of their plan.  Just one.

       See, this is a perfect example of you either being in denial or having deficient cognitive abilities.  When Ashleigh Banfield points at a building and says
       <strong>
        "that is the building that is going to come down next"
       </strong>
       that is a very definitive statement that it is known the building is going to come down.  What are you saying exactly?  That they just made some wildly accurate guess and turned out to be right in spades?  That's preposterous.
       <strong>
        Just admit someone knew the building was going to come down and then explain how they knew it.
       </strong>
       It's a very simple question.

       None of those things have anything to do with why the building collapsed according to NIST - their report said the building collapsed due to thermal expansion which caused a single beam to fail.

       Oh really, and what?  She had x-ray vision which allowed her to see that steel was expanding which would cause a beam to fail which would in turn cause the entire building to fall straight down?

       She might not have thermal vision, but everyone there could see the building buckling.  You don't need a degree in engineering, physics, or architechture to see when a building is buckling, its going to come down. Especially since 2 buildings had fallen ontop of it already.

       I watched your little video.  Pointing to building 7 "heard several reports from several different officers now that that is the building that this is going to go down next.  In fact, one officer told me that they are just waiting for that to come down at this point.  There is no way its going to be recovered and there is no way they cab stabilize it". So case closed. Police said they wouldn't risk men trying to combat a soon to collapse building with no one in it that they deemed structurally unsound.  What is the conspiracy here?  They didn't have prior knowledge they found out from police a short time before the building fell that it was going to collapse.  If you think this proves some government conspiracy then you are quite dense

       They did have prior knowledge..."That is the building that is going to come down next" is a definitive statement.  So how did they know this building was going to collapse?  Keep in mind that the reason for collapse was "thermal expansion" of the steel, which NIST itself said was a "novel phenomenon" and one which was not thought to be able to cause collapse.  So how exactly did they
       <strong>
        know
       </strong>
       (see Banfeild Quote, or BBC report) this building was going to collapse since it is 100% impossible for them to know that thermal expansion would cause it to collapse?

       Um, so which is it?  First you say they didn't know, then you say the police did know.  The question is how did

       know it was going to collapse keeping in mind that thermal expansion ("a novel phenomenon") was the cause of collapse?

       When I said they didn't have prior knowledge I mean that did not know of some conspiracy to destroy the building by the government (often referred on this sub as a demolition with charges or some other BS).  The police and firefighters decided the building was a LOST CAUSE and could not be saved. It was literally on fire and falling apart and they then made the decision that it could not be saved.  Then they evacuated the area around the building because it was FALLING APART.  They did not know the day before that the building was going to fall.  They saw a building that was already evacuated that they decided could not be saved and then it collapsed. Then the news reporter heard this and reported the news.  I'm not sure what you are trying to get at here

       The BBC got wind of the collapse. So they reported it. It's been shown they have connections to Silverstein and were near him when he gave the order to "pull it".

       Thats how they knew it was coming. The time was just wrong.

       You and the rest of the professionals in the field of demolition. However, they have figured it out. Thermite. which coincidentally happened to be purchased through the obscure Pentagon accounting records that coincidentally had no receipts, most of which were coincidentally "blown up" by "terrorists" on 9/11.. too many coincidences. And it is for this reason I just don't understand why more people have not said anything or called bullshit.

       right, i heard about that too, when rumsfeld said there was something like a billion dollars missing? and the plane happened to crash into the accounting sector of the pentagon and leave the lawn unscathed. also how come there was no wreckage found during the pentagon? or am i wrong? and how they found the passports of the supposed terrorists in the world trade wreckage... that creeps me out, i feel like someone put it there...

       I would like to believe the American way is finding the truth. But then we look at Julian Assange for instance, who is considered a terrorist to America, yet in reality he did what the system teaches us in any journalism course. Rely only on FACTS. And the fact is you're right there was no wreckage at the pentagon there are many photos proving this, except for a single turbine from what is believed to be from a cesna sized plane.. Watch loose change it clarifies a lot and to me that is the documentary and creative piece that institutions should be viewing in film and journalism courses across America, I dare say the World. Furthermore, the passport thing I just don't understand why they would cite an illusory occurrence as such. It is almost like they are just throwing it in our face that they did it and they know the general public wont do anything about it. I told my friend the other day this. I'm not so much mad at the government, Zionists, secret society, or whatever we argue is doing this, I am more mad at the people who are naive and believe they did not do it. It is these people we have to blame for why they can get away with this. There is strength in numbers and when people realize that we can take the power back then we will actually have a fight against these tyrannical hidden agenda war mongers.

       The thing is though that if their controlled demolition is physically disproved, the rest of the theory takes a subtantial hit, since there's no way to show the government did it, whoever that may comprise of. I've personally seen what a kg of thermite does to a steel beam, and it's highly
unlikely that that's what brought down WTC 7 (or the towers for that matter).

       Because it doesn't matter what happened to the buildings or the planes. What matters is that the event was exploited, and maybe created and/or guided, to start wars on behalf of Israel and an end-game of the Oil Age.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal opinion is that it was planned and guided, and mostly for Israel. But that doesn't matter. The broad truths don't require any "ah ha!" It is straight up geopolitics.

       Your claim that because 1% of Architects and Engineers are part of A&amp;E for truth then 99% are against it is a straw man. Did you read your own source?
      </p>
      <p>
       The subject is how many people have access to all the information regarding 9/11 and how many are questioning the story?

       Also, claiming that I believe the towers were brought down by explosives is also a strawman. You should perhaps read up on your logical fallacies.

       No amount of architectural or demolition "experts",.. no matter how respected or experienced,.. are ever going to prove any sort of "grand truth" regarding 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a variety of reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) All the case-studies in the world are NOT gonna give you an EXACT description of what happened on the morning of 9/11. You could have a 30yr demolition expert and ask him to blow up a new mountain and he won't be able to tell you EXACTLY how the mountain will crumble/fracture when the explosion happens. The only way we'd KNOW for CERTAIN what happened on the morning of 9/11 is if we have 100's of environmental sensors inside those buildings and used that data like a "black box" to replay what happened. Anything outside of that (without verifiable evidence) is simply speculation/opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) The drama/controversial-nature of the topic has created to much "noise". It's almost impossible at this point to separate the accurate details (if there are any) with the conspiracy theories, assumptions, hearsay and rumors.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) Much of the evidence was destroyed in the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Expecting to unearth/prove some "bombastic truth" about 9/11 is similar as expecting to unearth/prove some "smoking gun" regarding the JFK assassination. I think it's unlikely to ever happen at this point (and to be honest, I'm OK with that). I wish people would move on and quit picking the scab.

       There are multiple steps to getting at the truth of 9/11. The first and by far the most significant is the critical examination of the official stories. The plane and fire induced collapse theories for the WTC towers are clearly false. It doesn't take advanced expertise to recognize that. Anyone who comprehends high school level physics and is intellectually honest can understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a person accepts that, then they may want to take the next step to figure out what actually did happen. As you suggest, that is much more difficult now that so much of the evidence has been destroyed. But no "bombastic truth", to use your term, is necessary. A failure to come up with "an EXACT description of what happened" does not make the official stories true.

       We should neither believe nor dis-believe any theory until we can scientifically prove 1 way or another. That's my point. Considering we'll NEVER be able to do that with 9/11...it's likely going to remain a controversial conspiracy theory without end.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing we know for sure about 9/11 is that planes impacted the buildings.. and the buildings collapsed. That's it. Any speculation about WHY the buildings collapses is unfounded/unprovable until verifiable scientific evidence is presented. (which can't/won't ever happen, since we don't have telemetry/environmental data from the impacts)

       LOL. I'm "biased" against them because they are clearly false. Bias is a bad thing only when it leads someone to make false claims or illogical arguments. Do you have a bias against putting your hand in a fire? Do you have a bias against jumping off a cliff?

       We

        can
       </strong>
       scientifically prove that the official story is not true. In numerous ways. Perhaps the most obvious is that matter does not fall through the path of most resistance.

       My conclusion that the official story is false is not predisposed, it is the end result of examining the available evidence. It is presumptuous, insulting, and simply wrong for you to assume my conclusion is predisposed.

      <p>
       This is off base in so many ways. First, I am not presenting any theories. I am skeptically examining an official theory. Second, science is not about consensus. It's about evidence and rational analysis. Third, I am troubled by your use of the word "neutral" in combination with your presumption that my conclusions are predisposed. I suspect you mean that anyone who disagrees with your opinions is automatically "biased" and must be dismissed. Ridiculous.

       What you're referring to as "evidence" is in fact NOT evidence. It's opinion, supposition, conjecture, theory and everything else BUT evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my whole point. We don't have any evidence of EXACTLY how/why those buildings collapsed. We just flat DON'T. We have a lot of peripheral/after-the-fact data but we don't have any hard/verified evidence of what made the buildings collapse. (IE: Seeing long swerving skid marks on a road isn't evidence of anything besides that there are long swerving skid marks on the road. Anyone who says anything beyond that is flat wrong unless/until they can prove unquestionably WHY the skid marks were created. Even if you see deer hoof prints in soft mud besides the road doesn't prove the skid marks came from avoiding a deer unless you have video or some other way to connect the two irrefutably). The same is true of 9/11. There may be lots of circumstantial evidence.. but none of it holds any water unless you can unquestionably connect them).
      </p>
      <p>
       In lieu of that conclusive evidence,.. the ONLY rational, scientific or fair thing we can say is: "We simply don't know."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's it. Anything other than "We simply don't know." is conjecture.

       You bring up valid points. I have to find where I read this, but I believe several scientists did tests on the dust that was found on ground zero, and it revealed and unusually high content of thermite. That is what is strange cause that is A) not easy to come by, though I may be wrong here. B) I'm no architect but I don't think you construct a building by utilizing exothermic oxidizers to strengthen the structure.

       What you're referring to as "evidence" is in fact NOT evidence. It's opinion, supposition, conjecture, theory and everything else BUT evidence.

       That's my whole point. We don't have any evidence of EXACTLY how/why those buildings collapsed. We just flat DON'T. We have a lot of peripheral/after-the-fact data but we don't have any hard/verified evidence of what made the buildings collapse. (IE: Seeing long swerving skid marks on a road isn't evidence of anything besides that there are long swerving skid marks on the road. Anyone who says anything beyond that is flat wrong unless/until they can prove unquestionably WHY the skid marks were created. Even if you see deer hoof prints in soft mud besides the road doesn't prove the skid marks came from avoiding a deer unless you have video or some other way to connect the two irrefutably). The same is true of 9/11. There may be lots of circumstantial evidence.. but none of it holds any water unless you can unquestionably connect them).
      </p>
      <p>
       In lieu of that conclusive evidence,.. the ONLY rational, scientific or fair thing we can say is: "We simply don't know."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's it. Anything other than "We simply don't know." is conjecture.

       You keep parroting this phrase.. and it makes you look less and less intelligent every time you do it. Please go into detail describing what it is you think that phrase means/proves.

       Would they have said that because the building had been hit by another falling building and had fires that had been left to burn as emergency response was elsewhere? Maybe they were making an educated guess that it would fall.  I still see literally NO reason for the BBC to be informed of this false flag attack.  Or any news station for that matter.  They would report a collapsing building anyway, why would the government let more people in on their plan when there is no gain at all from BBC reporting it falling?
