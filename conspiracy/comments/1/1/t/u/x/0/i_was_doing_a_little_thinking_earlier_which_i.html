    <div class="md"><p>Also they are disassociating the word &quot;Jingoism&quot; with those damn snacks &quot;Jingos&quot; I am totally serious.  If some dumb idiot now hears the word &quot;Jingoism&quot; he will immediately think of those snacks.  Also the Italian car &quot;Fiat&quot; has commercials on TV constantly, if you try and tell someone what Fiat is, they just glaze over and think of cars.  There are a lot more examples of &quot;controversial&quot; words being co-opted by a corporation or a product to almost change the meaning of the word to mainstream culture.</p>

<p>So if someone doesn&#39;t know what &quot;Jingoism&quot; is, they are more easily swayed by it.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think that by describing them in terms equivalent to Hitler&#39;s youth is misleading at the very least, and manipulation at it&#39;s most?</p>

<p>I believe they are training 18-24 year old men <em>and</em> women ((Source)[<a href="http://www.americorps.gov/for_individuals/choose/americorpsnccc_femacorps.asp%5D">http://www.americorps.gov/for_individuals/choose/americorpsnccc_femacorps.asp]</a>). They came from AmeriCorps, which, if you didn&#39;t know is pretty awesome for what they do.</p>

<p>Why is all this a bad thing?</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the misleading terminology used in the links of the original post that are making most people frightened like this is some sort of modern day Third Reich has come back to the future or something.</p>
