       Also they are disassociating the word "Jingoism" with those damn snacks "Jingos" I am totally serious.  If some dumb idiot now hears the word "Jingoism" he will immediately think of those snacks.  Also the Italian car "Fiat" has commercials on TV constantly, if you try and tell someone what Fiat is, they just glaze over and think of cars.  There are a lot more examples of "controversial" words being co-opted by a corporation or a product to almost change the meaning of the word to mainstream culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if someone doesn't know what "Jingoism" is, they are more easily swayed by it.

       I would have not have believed that r/conspiracy post about that not too long ago, until I had seen the video. The way they repeatedly scream the word in the commercial just screams forced subliminal repetitive conditioning.

       I mean, I realize what word disassociation is, but the Jingos one just sounded too petty, and retarded till I saw it. :P

       yes exactly, the word is too relevant right now for it to be some kind of "coincidence", so they are literally thought controlling with that, try and bring up the word "Jingoism" at work, and people will be like "JINGOS!", its like oh damn.

       Wesley Clark's son had a good interview (with TYT) a while back in which he talked at length about advertising and subliminal messaging.  It was really interesting to me because it made me think "of all the evil things going on, why would a general's son be so concerned about Madison Avenue?"  Needless to say the connection is pretty clear if you put a little thought into it.

       ?? I may have missed your tone of voice with your question.  Do I believe they are training 18-24 yr old men at the DHS? Yes. Do I know why?  No,but I have a feeling its not for the security of our homeland.

       No no. I am laughing because people here are calling them "youths".

       Don't you think that by describing them in terms equivalent to Hitler's youth is misleading at the very least, and manipulation at it's most?

       How? Hitler Youth? That was a paramilitary group. This is a group that goes into action after a disaster for relief and clean up. How is this the same thing the Nazi's did?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: And quit calling them "youths"! 18-24 years old is a young adult, no where near being a child in our society. Hitler Youth were actually children aged 14-18.

       By law they aren't. The descriptive language (using "youth") conjures up images of Nazi Germany. This isn't anything like that at all. This program is a
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       thing because most young adults are fresh out of high school and have zero direction. These young adults are actually building experience and getting their college tuition waived. This isn't a security apparatus either. Where are their guns?
Oh right, there are none.

       Don't you see? This whole "going to war with Iran" thing, it's just to keep YOU, the conspiracy theorist, SCARED. Who cares where America goes to war with, America fights with everyone! If they really NEEDED to attack Iran, they would've done it by now. They're just stretching to see how far they can go, then maybe they will attack but shit will have hit your face long before that

This has always been on the back of my mind, it really doesnt matter where the next war is it most assuredly will end badly with how much the world is pissed off at each other right now. Keeping the people who know the truth and could potentially have the power to stand up  to the governments and say NO MORE WARS too worried about their plan to band together and fight.
