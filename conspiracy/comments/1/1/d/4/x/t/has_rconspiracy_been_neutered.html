       Seriously. All I see are bogus stories, comments infested by shills. And when real stories of interest get posted and start getting upvotes, they get disappeared and have to be resubmitted. And more recently, I'm seeing the trend of a self post asking
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       what they think about a particular aspect of "the conspiracy realm", effectively datamining consensus and sniffing out who's who.

       It's been neutered in the sense that stupid political images are constantly dumped here and make it to the top. I wish these things were just gotten rid of. People only do it for easy internet points.

       This subreddit needs posts with more substance and breadth, not silly political cartoons that make a point everyone here already agrees with.

       It can make a difference. Old/dead/dupe/silly/shilly or shit stories get a -down. New conspiracy related stories get an +up, alternative news stuff gets nothing. That's the way I play it anyways.

       Seriously! Agreed. How can you expect people to give you the time to take your lengthy thoughts seriously, when you can't take the time to decide where and when to hit the "enter" key a few times, for easier reading? Sloppy. And IMO 70-95% of those posts aren't worth reading. If you're not intelligent enough to make your thoughts presentable, I'm usually skeptical you're intelligent enough to say anything of real worth.

       There is actually a purpose to paragraphs.  They separate blocks about concepts. When someone just does stream of consciousness, run-on spewing, instead of organized thinking, it's usually a sign they're merely opinionating.  That's my objection here.  And that it reads like a speech to a high school graduating class.

       Yes it is difficult to read, however, that is not a reason to downvote a comment. If you couldn't read it just leave it alone. If you disagree with the content, then say why. He was on topic and made a post that added to the discussion. These are the criteria for up and downvoting.

       The rest of your post was just complaining. You gave your opinion (which, we've already gone back and forth about) and you insulted people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't down vote your post, I don't down vote or up vote anything that has no substance. In case you haven't noticed, people just aren't agreeing with you. Shocking.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Downvoting someone's perspective is idiotic, but people don't want to hear that, because it's easier to have an opinion button to silence people who you disagree with.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I personally find it easier to find someone's post if it's an average post if it has been down voted.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He contributed to the conversation, they did not. I pointed it out, everyone got butthurt. That's the synopsis.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He contributed a post that by hitting enter four times it would have been much easier to read. Could someone have been more polite in saying it? Probably. But I can see the upside to encouraging someone to actually format their post so people won't just skim by it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I see a post like that filled with run-on sentences and opinions that I
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       I've already read from another perspective, I generally will just breeze through it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a community 100% based around word formatting and discussion with words, wouldn't suggesting that other people at least make an effort to make their thoughts attractive to read through, be a good thing?

       <p>
        I never called you specifically butthurt, but of course you knew that.

      <p>
       Said what now? You said "can just all keep proving how but hurt you are.." in a reply to me. That is calling me butt hurt?

It personally makes me sick to read comments such as his as they are short sighted, satirically optimistic, and nearly all bullshit. No one here who's worth their salt pays any attention to such a reckless statement regardless of its format.

       Could have something to do with the fact that the place needs utterly abandoned, and a new place formed. With new mods, new rules, new face.
      </p>
      <p>
       No more of this idiotic reptile bullshit, no more taking literally any post on the front page that has any mediocre resemblance to military and screaming that it's military propaganda, no more calling OMFGF@ FALSE FLAG at literally... every...single...fucking...international event to ever fucking take place...
      </p>
      <p>
       While we are at it, no more upvoting people who put forth their own little personal "Theory" with absolutely zero proof or even thought process.
      </p>
      <p>
       No more screaming SHILL SHILL at every single person who comes in and asks for some proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, the new place should be called something like Conspiracy SCIENCE. 
People value fact, observation, evidence, logic. You have none of these things? Good bye, we don't want your stupid fucking Conspiracy Theories. We want your Conspiracy Hypothesis, we want you to QUESTION our theories, so that we can solidify them into an even better and more evidenced solution, or throw them in the fucking trash.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's half the problem around here anymore, people get their little theory in their head, and they never want it to be proven wrong. That's not how intelligent debate works, and that certainly isn't how a true and honest search for the truth works.

       I believe the universe is more vast than we can fathom, thus I find any and all theories on life interesting and amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intelligence exists and is sublime. I certainly hope we are not the pinnacle of intelligence in this universe, that would be very sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I believe in the Annunaki? Let me put it this way: I certainly do not believe in the history of man as presented by the institution of rule and control the a small % of the human population in power put forth.

       I wish you were king of this subreddit. It's like you ripped the words out of my mind. You nailed the issue perfectly. This subreddit is infested with Weekly World News bullshit, and over half the subscribers here fall for that crap, or they actively promote it to make the important conspiracies look like ridiculous by proxy.

       Shill no longer has it's proper dictionary definition here. It now means "an insult to describe someone who doesn't comply to the status quo of the social circle." I've seen people called trolls and shills because they stated actual verified truths that went against some preposterous and warrentless theory.

       Nothing wrong with discussing people's personal theories, but much of what you say is spot on. It's almost impossible to have a real discussion about any topic, be it reptilians, ufos, illuminati, or banking/now cabals. And that's just the fringe stuff. It seems even more difficult to converse about factual world events in here and that's troubling.

       As a mod and a subscriber to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       since its inception, I don't really agree with all these comments about the downfall of this /r/ - in fact, I am of the opinion that this /r/ has been vindicated - as the shit we as conspiracy theorists have talked about for decades is finally being recognized. This world is owned, the perception of this reality is closely controlled and there is a very small % of humans who control the fate of the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have seen a signficant uptick in users in this /r/ and we have also seen a great awakening to the reality of this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a mod, anything is wlcome in this /r/ other than blatant hate on [any topic] as it reveals ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignorance is the cancer of this /r/ and the minds that want the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should we discuss reptilians? Human origins? Paranormal? Energy? Spirit? God?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes we should - but at the same time we have some pretty fucking pressing matters at hand: the subtle oppression and control that humans suffer from at the hand of other humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans actively conspiring to exploit and control our reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans working to limit the free flow of true knowledge. Knowledge of our true nature, true power, true divinity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck every religion on the planet - they are all a ruse to blind you from yourself. You are a component of this universe - a sentient and conscious component. You are the universe, appearing separate, in order to learn and observe yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything that is, lies within, you are perfect in every way.

       Agreed with most of what you said. The only thing I disagree with is a matter of perspective I suppose and I can only speak for myself as a person who has been here for a little over a year with regards to what I see as a reduction in acceptance of opposing viewpoints and rampant misuse of up/down votes to stymy genuine dialogue. I'm not about to jump ship or anything and am pleased to see and agree that people are starting to understand the nature of our society.

       I'm not sure you even know what evidence even means at this point, because you've provided nothing of the sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you kind of just have a vibe of childish ignorance. You prove exactly my original point.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have no evidence, and when your little pet 'theory' is questioned, you simply call people idiots, motherfuckers, cunts, and after taking a look at your post history.... about every other insult there is plus a few extra colorful ones.

       So once again, thank you for giving yet another example of why you are the cancer of this sub.

       I'm here. I wish we had more of a tight knit relationship with our mods. I feel like I don't know who the mods of this place are, just that they disappear important threads most of the time. If we could feel like the mods really were some of us, then this place would be a lot nicer.

       I dont remove anything. If you PM me - Ill look into it. I think that users should be allowed to post pretty much anything here, users votes should dictate the content.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said; we (as a community) should also self-moderate out idiots, shills, bad content, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods on here are not some hivemind at all. I personally do not censor any information, and be warned: every single thing that happens on every subreddit is monitored closely by The Man. They have been very active in their efforts to develop behavioral shaping systems for online forums (HBGary, most famously - and the military propaganda that has been happening over the past year) - we have greater imminent threats to our freedom of thought right now that some of the more theoretical topics that would be typical to this type of forum.

       Finally, I think we need sub-sub-reddits so that we can categorize the content of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       better.

       Great post! I really like the idea of sub-sub-reddits. That way people can discuss pure theory and conjecture without being relegated to another subreddit with no members. I like what one poster said about conjecture and theorizing being much more effective than evidence when indexing a wide range of data. It definitely has value to it and should not be shunned here.

       You could just use link flair, that's what we do in
       <a href="/r/MetaHub">
        /r/MetaHub

       .  You can search by flair tags, and even make buttons to filter the sub by tag.

       Nice!  Though I'm 100% confident I don't suck up to the mods.  Just ask alllie.

       You could link to a batcrap loony blog post about Hitler's reanimated corpse living on a secret CIA-funded crystal moonbase planning to take over a flat earth using undersea pyramids and Freemason reptilian government officials, and it would be upvoted furiously, and anyone questioning it in the comments would be downvoted to hell. Seriously. I have not seen any evidence to the contrary in the 1+ year I've been here.

       Yep, stuff that used to appear on the front page of other subreddits has now been relegated to conspiracy, while real conspiracies are all but gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the story of the young girl locked up.  This was once something that would appear in news..not now.

       I have been noticing the self posts being used to form slide. When I see them I usually investigate the user and all of their past posts to determine whether they are a troll/shill and tag them with reddit enhancement suite.

       I have to admit that I having a bit of trouble keeping up.

       Everything good is in new and frequently gets buried/ignored. I think there should be a 2 tabs at the top that shows posts with negative votes (buried), and those that are removed by moderators (removed) instead of those posts disappearing into oblivion.

       See, here's the thing.

       This sub has went pretty mainstream of late. You almost have 100,000 subscribers. A lot of these subs are people who found the sub after x-posts to Skeptic, Conspiratard etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you call shills are actually people who don't buy into conspiracy theories, and will debate them with you. As I said the other day, if you claim to know the "truth", prepare to defend it.

       The number of subscribers to r/conspiracy has nearly tripled since I became a redditor. While that fact may be the biggest reason I recognize so few monikers these days, I suspect many regular submitters have grown tired of the politics and soap opera-esque drama that occurs between fellow redditors and moderators.
      </p>
      <p>
       As regular contributors have jumped ship, the quality of the content in r/conspiracy has gone downhill.
      </p>
      <p>
       While images are capable of conveying a strong message, there is no depth of information. Images are the Burger King of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP, I'm in total agreement with you in regard to the self-posts asking why r/conspiracy redditors think the way they do. If these self-submitting redditors were truly interested in conspiracies they wouldn't have to ask the types of questions they ask.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last of all, I miss ImJulianAssange. I don't know what kind of drama transpired between the mods and ImJulianAssange and I don't care. What I do know is r/conspiracy has the depth of a mud puddle since he's left.

       Moreover, when people start responding, almost as a rule, the OP is condecending to the poster and acts as if they aren't actually interesting in learning anything.

       Reddit isn't the best place to expect people to understand the difference between theories and accepted reality. Like 9/11 for example. We really just want a better investigation, because really we are theorizing the possibility of alternate conspiracy. What happened on 9/11 was a conspiracy by definition but the perpetrators are what we question. They key here is questioning. It's like the difference between an atheist and agnostic, and givens reddits obsession with atheism do you really expect them to think things might be different then what they think? Most people on reddit are pretentious about their knowledge and believe what they know to be reality so they would more then likely be cynical about anything outside of their knowledge base. It's only a matter of time. Lies can only be hidden for so long before reality bites.

       all conspiracy news sources are destroyed by these methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       very simple to flood these sites with wackjob crack which does the double job of burying actual stories and also prooves to those on the fence that conspiracy theories are nothing but wackjob crack.
      </p>

       there is no way to really combat this effect.  just keep an open mind and spread news and insight that you think is important.

       I rarely ever come here anymore. It's mostly bullshit and shills. There's worthwhile stuff every so often, but it's hard to battle bots and "neo-nazis" who are really just here to undermine credibility.

       this place is full of fucking shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       let me just say something about fucking fake space programs like those fake moon landings and fucking robot on mars fakes and bam pair of shills imedietly appear and start throwing insults and derisory comments with no fucking profs. You want to believe nasa is really sending those robots on mars or moon or whatever fine, but for fuck sake if they did a multi trillion scam one time they will do it fucking again and again, and they have the money to insert fucking shills everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       for fuck sake. fuck you shills eat my dick you fucking idiots, I'm enjoying when you will be fuck by the same people you are working now like those military idiots soldiers who are send home dead or crippled or fucking intoxicated with enriched uranium weapons by the same people who they are fighting for.
      </p>
      <p>
       fucking karma
      </p>
      <p>
       so about your question, there never was a r/conspiracy is a continue fight over fucking information and fuck all the shills again, them mother fucker retards

       seriously. When someone disagrees, they are not debated or argued with, they are instead immediately declared as shills.

       I post shit all the time that never even seems to get a view, no comments or anything and they are totally conspiracy.  Just like any site that shows the truth the jews and the US gov slowly start to place their spys and then it ends up being lost forever.

       Personally, I like the way this sub has evolved. Even with the really far out theories and the shills. I think the current mods are doing a good job too.

       Here's a perfect example of someone adding to the discussion with an on topic comment that is not insulting or hateful in anyway and look at his karma. This is what we are talking about. People are totally abusing the up/down vote system. It's frustrating really.

       Any one can anonymously click an arrow on a page. It takes next to no effort (or thought). There is absolutely no accountability for their action.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, but if the karma is already in the negative that person will feel compelled to click the down arrow (without even reading the content). We want to go with the flow. We want to fit in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an inherently  broken system that can
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       produce optimal results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone suggested a long time ago that reddit keep the arrows and get rid of the karma. But nooooooooooo. Fuck that. I gotsta have my points baby! Touchdown! Home Run! Goooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal!
      </p>
      <p>
       The system cannot work because its driven by selfish, petty, ignorant humans.

       I am one of your so called "shills". I don't just do it for the money, I do it because we are right. The ends justify the means. We will win in the end. Information is power, and we have devised methods of information control that are leaps ahead of what you imagine. We control this subreddit, we allow a certain proportion of posts to rise so as not to make things too obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       We target certain users with what we have dubbed "stress overload". This is an effective method of removing users, as they feel they are leaving of their own accord. We have done quite the job on 9000sins ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       Enjoy your petty subreddit, you mean nothing. You have no influence.
