       Friends, lend me your ears for but a few moments. I have frequented this subreddit for over a year under various user names. I spent a long time lurking, and have been posting recently, contributing thoughts here and there as I feel compelled and passionate about certain submissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something has come to my attention lately, and I know many of you have noticed the same thing. This community is becoming saturated with noise. Part of this is because the community has grown. More users than ever are subscribed to this subreddit and that brings a broader range of mindsets and awareness levels to the subjects discussed here. Some are trolls. Many are shills. A fair amount are simply ignorant to many things some of us have studied for years. It is a diverse and growing community and I believe that is a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, I've noticed a frightening trend here. The anti-Israel / anti-Zionist rhetoric has become rampant as of late. Many threads are saturated with comments blaming this that or the other thing on "the Jews". Many comments bash even the citizens of Israel as evil, maniacal bastards out to destroy the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not doubt such Zionists exist. I do not doubt Zionism as a foreign policy is flawed and failed. I do not doubt evil minds and hearts steer policies that influence nations as a whole. Despite this, I feel that many of my fellow redditors fail to see something very important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of you are failing to see that you are simply "othering" a group of people elsewhere in the world, the very practice that so many of us speak out against. We complain that our own government creates Emmanuel Goldsteins to be scared of, to chant and cheer and rally against, and we call the people who can't see through the lies "sheeple", among other things. In the same breath, we call Zionists monsters, maniacs, and destroyers of the world. I've seen comments calling for the destruction of Israel, people HOPING that they get nuked or invaded. This sickens me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever thought about the average "Zionist" and what his life may be like? Have you ever even contemplated that perhaps your average Zionist is a Joe like any other. He gets his news from poisoned sources, he hears his government's cries for war and security, and he buys into it not because he is inherently evil but because he just doesn't know any better. He hasn't been blessed with the keen awareness that many of us share, that the world around us is but a projection controlled by a few maniacal puppetters. He is a sheep just like our fellow citizens. He is not the enemy. He is a father, a brother, and a son.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is our duty as researchers and free thinkers not to hate these "sheep" but to try and bring them into the light, whether the sheep be in the US, Israel or elsewhere. We need to do all we can to change the hearts and minds of our fellow citizens. We need to shift the collective consciousness. Can we please stop hating a specific group of people (The Jews) and instead focus on how we can move forward? I feel our subreddit, if we can simply change our perspective, can be an overwhelmingly positive one. I'm afraid that lately it has been teetering on becoming a haven for hate speech against a group of people that are probably just like you and I.. trying to get by, trying to live comfortably, and longing for truth and peace. A group of people riding on a bus driven by a mad bus driver.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Do not be divided. Do not stand against one another. Stand together and stand strong. Fight the good fight, friends, I'll see you on the front line.

       I don't see this here (at least anymore than in r/worldnews), and I've been reading r/conspiracy for two years now.  I certainly see anti-Zionist posts, but I feel that overall, people in this sub are careful not to portray all jews as people who support/partake in the actions/beliefs of Zionists.  Just my two cents though.

       I know this is a day old but, there are those who are anti-Zionism, and those who can't say anything about their anti-Zionism without mentioning that they
       <em>

       Good point, I should have clarified that that is what I've been seeing more of lately. It's not a generalization on this community as a whole, but it is alarming when more and more comments do seem to equate jews as zionists. I'll look at some recent threads and provide some sample comments in a bit.

       I do worry though about shills coming here and being blatantly anti-Semitic in an attempt to portray this entire community as a bunch of jew-haters...
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, I worry about people posting links about "less serious" (
       <em>
        braces for downvotes
       </em>
       ) conspiracies like UFOs, aliens, ghosts, etc. because they stand to crowd-out other seemingly more relevant conspiracy posts (Ex: links that expose the lies being told about about Iran/Syria so as to get populations in the West to support yet another endless war in the ME).

       9 months ago, when the new moderators were selected, great effort was put forth by the mods and the community to make a clear distinction between "Jews" and "Zionists"; the former being a generic reference to a shared cultural history traced to the Hebrews, and the latter being a highly destructive, war-mongering political movement focused in Israel. The reason for this distinction was so as not to blame "average people" (synagogue-goers) for a "political movement", because there are a great many Jews (very prominent orthodox Jews) who are vehemently opposed to Zionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, this distinction between Judaism and Zionism was made precisely because of the consensus that Zionism is the actual culprit (the political extension of the Rothschild central banking cartel) which continually beats the drums of war.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, now that we've made this clear separation between persecuting Jews and being opposed to a violent political agenda (Zionism), you're now suggesting we shouldn't be opposed to Zionism because Zionists (despite constantly crying for the blood of others) are "just people, too"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I find something very sick in this proposal, because you could say the same thing about the wealthy elite in general who profit off of war - "they're just people - brothers, sisters, moms, dads". And, while that may be factually accurate, it ignores the psychopathy being perpetuated in those families.

       I think it is possible to be opposed to policy and political attitude without reducing the conversation to hate.  I think that is an important thing to remember.  Love for all people everywhere does not mean the tolerance of disgusting values, but it does mean the acceptance and love of even the most depraved.  That is the challenge.

       But that wasn't his point. His point was that the average zionist is likely no different than the average American. They aren't wealthy, they don't have any power that you or I don't, they are citizens under a 'state' not much different from ours. If anything, they suffer from
       <em>
        more

       government tyranny. This is in direct opposition to the lifestyle of the wealthy elite that you seek a comparison to.

      <p>
       It's as if you didn't try and understand a single point behind his reasoning.
      </p>

       He never said the actions of the 'greater Zionist movement' were excusable, only that it's understandable why some people
       <em>

       zionists.

       You're now mixing Israeli with Zionist.

      <p>
       You are confused, bro.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionism is a global political movement involving many government officials and banking oligarchs who give precedence to the state of Israel over their own nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zion isn't a "state", and Zionists can be citizens of
       <em>
        any

       government.

       No, I'm not. I'm definitely referring to Zionists as an Israeli that wasn't a zionist was not successfully propagandized and escaped from the very system we are talking about.

      <p>
       Sure, I gave the example of Israeli zionists, but that's because they are a great example of what the OP is talking about. You can switch out the Israeli government with any other you'd like.

       If you had entered into this with something other than a desire to pick a fight, I might have taken some of what you've said seriously. However, that chip you have on your shoulder makes you look and act lop-sided, like some kind of snarling hunchback. Furthermore, this is not the first time we've interacted (note the age of this account) and I don't recall you being so hostile to me in the past. Is there something twisted happening in your personal life recently? What's up, dude? You're quite the nasty monster today.

       Look, dude. I don't have a beef with you, and have no desire to bandy petty insults. When you get over it (whatever it is that's eating you - bad day? bad week? whatever), you might discover that I'm not your enemy and never have been. I made a significant point that the OP himself clarified via apology (if you had read the whole thread beneath my initial comment). That is - even the OP admitted that he was unclear about this matter. No amount of hostility, personal invective, or insult is going to make me retract anything I've said.
      </p>

       I'm sorry you're having a bad day and feel the need to take it out on me.

       Who asked you to retract anything? The OP merely made the same point in a polite fashion in his response to you. Though, it's not as if you responded back and thanked him for correcting you or anything like. So how am I to tell? Oh, this post here? Great, thanks!

       The "loud vocal minority" of which you speak are the leadership of the movement. Your question is very similar to "so, you're blaming agents provocateur for following the orders given to them?"

       To clarify, I'm only saying that you're essentially saying that because of what the vocal ones say, you're letting that mean that all people are of the same stance/feeling.

       I'm not even necessarily disagreeing with the notion you're making, I just find the generalizing/stereotyping to be a little strange. Not identifying those who are cynical as the problem, but instead all people with the belief system.

       No, I didn't miss your point, nor did I miss evenmoretiredoflibs' point. You're trolling with implication and innuendo (Oh, so you &lt;are obviously herp derp durrh&gt;.). Neither of you are interested in a discussion about the topic. Your point is to attack whoever you're talking to. And while it may seem like that was what I did, initially, if you look closely, I gave a pretty thorough explanation of why I found the OP's proposal confusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I know you're trolling, is because - like all trolls - this is a dead thread. No one will see your trollery here. No one will know that you're a troll except those you troll. It's a cowardly way to participate in reddit - to attack people when it's assured that no one will be around to defend them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been watching you biggles, and I finally caught you - lurking here, in the darkness of this dead thread - doing the underhanded shit I've always suspected you of.

       What...? Like seriously, what is this.. I'm not attacking you, I'm trying to discuss something with you. I'm not trolling you with some innuendo or implication, I'm asking a question..
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I guess I apologize? I really don't know what to say. You really just had the most adverse reaction ever to me asking you a question.. If you think I was trolling by asking you that question, you really are just looking for things to mean more than they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try reading my comment
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       thinking there's some hateful undertone that you put on it, and then realize that I was simply asking you a question. There was no tone on my comment, there was none of this
       <em>
        "(Oh, so you &lt;are obviously herp derp durrh&gt;.)
       </em>
       " garbage... You just read it with some harsh tone that didn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, you're doing exactly what you're complaining to me about thinking I'm doing. You're attacking
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       in a thread you believe is dead, when all I did was ask a question, and you just read it as something it wasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am interested in discussion about the topic. Your comment (to me, which is why I asked a question..) seemed like you were dismissing an entire group of people just because of those who represent them. Like other countries hating Americans, because of who the politicians are.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was afraid of people not seeing my posts, I wouldn't post in some of the most active threads in this sub.. I apologize that I worded my question in a way that left it to be implied that I wasn't just actually asking a question.

       Sorry for this miscommunication, I'm not saying to support Zionism. I'm saying that your average citizen who supports it is likely ignorant, and is not the true enemy. Citizens who support Zionism but who are not making the decisions that influence global policy are hardly to blame for this. There is a small group of people in control and I'm simply trying to differentiate that from someone who may buy into the Zionist paradigm.
