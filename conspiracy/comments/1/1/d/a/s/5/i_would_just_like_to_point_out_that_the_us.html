    <div class="md"><p>Lol dont mind me, just over here sowing some dissent seeds. I have wondered about the explodin helicopter. No one ever mentioned what the hell caused millions of dollars in military hardware and a dozen or so highly-trained spec ops agents to just explode like that. It didn&#39;t sound like bin laden was prepared for that type of assault so it most likely wasnt him or his men. Equipment failure is equally dubious. Id have trouble believing the Pakistanis would blow it up however. But I can envision a scenario where they realized what we were trying to do, took action (helicopter) then under pressure from the white house (who was intently watching the whole raid take place via satellite as shown in the famous picture) backed down and let us finish the raid. We wouldn&#39;t retaliate because it&#39;s about the worst-kept secret in the world that we cannot afford another war, or even another enemy in the region. </p>

<p>According to my information, the death toll is much higher than what the US government has stated. But the Bush administration does not want the panic to spread. The United States should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself; the people who are a part of the US system. -Osama bin Laden 9/29/11</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My working theory:</p>

<p>9/11 was a PNAC inside job.  Bin Laden (business associate of the Bush Cartel) was permitted to escape and live out his remaining years in declining kidney health.  In exchange, Team Bush/PNAC would use his image for terror purposes to transform the U.S. into a prison-economy/militarized police-state economy, and to transform the world into a mess that would prepare for stage 2:  the economic takedown.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, CIA baby Barack Obama, who was raised by Allan Dulles CIA psychologists (along with dozens of other sleeper cell children) in a closed-laboratory environment (similar to how <a href="http://spitfirelist.com/for-the-record/ftr-724-wiki-of-the-damned/">Julian Assange was raised in the CIA-connected San­ti­nike­tan Park Asso­ci­a­tion mind-control cult in Australia</a>) is prepared for a meteoric rise into the White House out of nowhere, where he will follow the Bush/Cheney/PNAC crime-spree &amp; shield them from prosecution &amp; codify their police state as &quot;normalized&quot;.</p>

<p>Bin Laden dies in Pakistan <em>of natural causes</em> and the body is put on ice.  A hard drive containing &quot;Al Qaeda Masterplans&quot; is placed inside a flower vase in the foyer of the Bin Laden &quot;ISI house arrest&quot; safehouse in Abbottabad, to be &quot;found&quot; by troops for later CIA analysis &amp; misdirection.</p>

<p>These planted (Karl Rove special) &quot;Al Qaeda plans&quot; will lead to a botched takedown and a missed nuclear false flag.  This fiasco will be used to purge the CIA after the U.S. military coup.</p>

<p>The Bin Laden corpse is propped-up in place, SEAL Team 6 enters and shoots the corpse.  SEAL Team 6 do not know he was already dead.  Photos are taken.</p>

<p>These photos must remain private (not public) <em>because if they are witnessed by a forensic pathologist, it will be immediately apparent to the trained eye that Bin Laden&#39;s forehead tissue damage from SEAL bullets was post-mortem -- he was already dead.</em>  Lack of bleeding from the bullet wound is inconsistent with living tissue.  Congress are shown the photos but none recognize the telltale signs.</p>

So the the Abbotabad raid which resuscitated Osama for a few brief moments only to kill him again certainly came as a profound surprise to me. </p>

That way we would avoid hurting the credibility of our allies in the Pakistani government. If I were inventing the story I probably would have put him in Yemen or Iran or something.</p>

<p>Also, we should have invented a story about how bin laden was definitely armed and shooting at our forces, instead of having all this messy disagreement about whether he was shot in cold blood. Now we have Noam Chomsky and Ron Paul crying about how we broke international law because we shot an unarmed man in the head. If bin Laden was shooting at us old west-style, or he at least had some hostages or something, we could tell Ron Paul to STFU and quit complaining.</p>
