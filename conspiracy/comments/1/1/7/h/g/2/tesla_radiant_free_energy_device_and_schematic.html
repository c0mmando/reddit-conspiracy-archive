        The Dirty Energy Conspiracy - Why do they hide the radiant energy from us?
       </a>
       But first, I would like to describe to you a short list of “free energy” technologies that I am currently aware of, and that are proven beyond all reasonable doubt. The common feature connecting all of these discoveries, is that they use a small amount of one form of energy to control or release a large amount of a different kind of energy. Many of them tap the underlying ether field in some way; a source of energy conveniently ignored by “modern” science.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Radiant Energy. Nikola Tesla’s Magnifying Transmitter, T. Henry Moray’s Radiant Energy Device, Edwin Gray’s EMA Motor, and Paul Baumann’s Testatika Machine all run on Radiant Energy. This natural energy form can be gathered directly from the environment (mistakenly called “static” electricity) or extracted from ordinary electricity by the method called “fractionation.” Radiant Energy can perform the same wonders as ordinary electricity, at less than 1% of the cost. It does not behave exactly like electricity, however, which has contributed to the scientific community’s misunderstanding of it. The Methernitha Community in Switzerland currently has 5 or 6 working models of fuelless, self-running devices that tap this energy.

       The real conspiracy is that tesla free energy is not necessary.  Solar pv, solar thermal, wind turbines, hydro electric, biofuel,ocean thermal difference heat engines,deep depth geothermal, are here, totally viable, just that the oil/coal/nuclear/nat-gas companies won't stop raping us.  Eventually there will be cold-fusion/tesla-free-energy, its just not needed.

       <em>

       Yes, the use fossil fuels and nuclear energy is the greatest conspiracy.  Saudi Arabia is sitting on top of $100 trillion, no fucking way in hell they are going to unilaterally disarm.  Same thing with the nuclear power and the CIA/engineering corporation.  You threaten saudi arabia and you'll wind up with a bullet in your head.

       Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity after his death, but since the 1990s, his reputation has experienced a comeback in popular culture.[18] In 2005, he was listed amongst the top 100 nominees in the TV show "The Greatest American", an open access popularity poll conducted by AOL and The Discovery Channel.[19] His work and reputed inventions are also at the center of many conspiracy theories and have also been used to support various
       <strong>
        pseudosciences
       </strong>
       , UFO theories and New Age occultism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracists and fantasists like Tesla because he was a bit of an outcast and did wacky experiments they use him to back up false claims about free energy and other shit. He helped develop AC and radio George Westinghouse hired many engineers at that time to put it all down to one person is misguided and it's like saying Steve Jobs did all the work on apple products he didn't he paid a fuck load of people to work on them. There was probably hundreds of experiments carried out by many people it's part of any development process.

       It's important because there is a whole dimension of electricity/energy/physics which has been hidden from the world. It's called Radiant electricity.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many schematics available on the nets which show how to do this. Only, this schematic is simpler and closer to what Tesla proposed. Except for the diode, every other component is from Tesla's times.

       <p>
        Can it save me money? 
Yes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can I build crazy shit with it?
Yes. Some of this tech is topsy turvy to the current understanding and literature. It needs to be understood to be put to good use.
       </p>
       <p>
        does it allow something to run without having to be plugged in? 
You can do that. You can also charge batteries with radiant electricity (its many times more efficient than regular electricity) with this and use that to drive your regular electric appliances.

       Okay I watched all 3 videos. As someone who has no idea about any of this, what exactly is this and why is it so important? This person created a machine that draws energy from the air and can power light bulbs? I assume that's what this is. So are you saying this is some sort of free energy and could be improved and potentially power much larger things? And the magnet lowers the amp...What does that mean in laymans terms? Didn't read the two papers and idk if I will. Tesla and people like him really intrigue me and so does the idea of free energy but only on a, 'oh that's fascinating level'. Are you saying I could build this fairly easily and do something with it?

       This fairly simple device produces a form of energy which Tesla referred to as Radiant Electricity. There is a huge amount of information available on this suppressed technology, most of which is disinformation meant to take you on endless goose chase.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll attempt to explain this in layman terms. Please excuse me if it's too short or too abstract. I've only come upon this in the last 2 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyday electricity is a force that is created by interaction with a magnetic field. By using a conducting metal to cut the lines of force of a magnet, you create electricity or Alternating Current as we call it today. There is whole another form of energy which is found in nature like the light from a firefly which is totally different to this form of AC electricity. Tesla had an insight into this when he was working on DC motors early in his career. He later made experiments to recreate this new form of energy and called it Radiant energy. Radiant energy is a pure form of energy which binds all its energy in electrical form and is propagated by longitudinal waves(like sound waves).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike radiant electricity, regular electricity has a magnetic component and an electrical component and produces heat due to the magnetic component.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is Radiant energy important ? It has properties which make it ideal for transmission using natural mediums like air or the ground. You could also transmit this energy through a conductor with zero loss in transmission. This is called 'single wire transmission'. This is just one of the applications of this energy form. It's applications are numerous and perhaps is a window to the Cosmic force which scientists are now calling 'Dark Energy'. Tesla called it the Cosmic force. This cosmic force was well known in the 1800s and was called 'aether' or 'ether'. Its  been hidden away by the tptb because it's a limitless source of energy. Meaning it's not bound by material constraints like mass and space. This form of energy can also be used for levitation, which is also hidden away by the tptb. I suspect, Tesla knew about this and made devices which made this possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       "That electrical energy can be economically transmitted without wires to any terrestrial distance, I have unmistakably established in numerous observations, experiments and measurements, qualitative and quantitative. These have demonstrated that it is practicable to distribute power from a central plant in unlimited amounts, with a loss not exceeding a small fraction of one per cent, in the transmission, even to the greatest distance, twelve thousand miles — to the opposite end of the globe." — Nikola Tesla

       Tesla's Fuelless Generator and Wireless Power Transmission
      </p>
      <p>
       Book Description
      </p>
      <p>
       Nikola Tesla's life (1856 - 1943) spanned two scientific periods - that of the 19th century which saw the universe as filled with an invisible matter, the aether, and that of the 20th century which saw the universe as an empty vacuum with bits of matter in random motion. As an example of the difference between these two world views when the idea of the electron was proposed at the end of the 1800s it was then pictured as a spinning vortex of this aether that condensed into solid matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, Tesla's engineering accomplishments, particularly the alternating current generator, transformer and motor, translated easily from the older science to the newer science. Motors invented in the 1880s ran just as well in the 1920s even though the old science upon which they were based was considered wrong by that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shift in scientific paradigms was, and still is, an obstacle to understanding Tesla's later work. His discoveries were based on a broader understanding of electrical science than that of his day or even than that of today. This is particularly true in relation to his work in the 1890s on a new type of electrical generator that would, he claimed, extract energy directly from the “ambient medium.” It also applies to his wireless power transmission method which rested on the concept of the earth being filled with an incompressible material that allowed the transfer of force to any place on the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following papers are an effort to translate Tesla's accomplishments in power generation and transmission from the language and concepts of 19th century science into today's scientific language.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nikola Tesla's “Free Energy” Documents reproduces the inventor's 1902 letter to Robert U. Johnson about Tesla's new energy generator that would not consume fuel. This letter was found in the Tesla Collection at Columbia University Library when attending the IEEE Tesla Symposium in New York in January 1976. This letter will come to be considered as important in the history of electrical science as the papers of Franklin, Faraday and Maxwell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nikola Tesla's Later Energy Generation Designs was prepared for the 26th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference in August 1991. The paper documents that Nikola Tesla claimed to have built an electrical power generator that would not consume fuel, where in his writings the description of such a device is found, the theory of how a fuelless generator could be possible, and a suggestion as to how Tesla's new device might have operated. The paper moves from historical fact, the claims for such a generator in a letter hand written by Tesla, to speculation about the operating principles of the inventions. At the time of writing the paper, the historical material was certain, but the engineering explanation of how the new type of generator work was not convincing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Second Law of Thermodynamics and Tesla's Fuelless Generator was prepared, for the 28th (1993) IECEC conference. It takes up Tesla's argument for a fuelless electric power generator that does not violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Though the device appears to supply power without fuel, it is not a perpetual motion machine. Tesla's explanation and a modern analysis is given of the device's operation. This paper presents a more satisfactory theory about the engineering aspects of the new generator than the 1991 IECEC paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the papers on Tesla's new type of electrical generator were published there have been a number of inquiries about his Notes on a Unipolar Dynamo article and the Carl Linde device for air liquefaction. The Tesla article and a book chapter on Linde's device have been reproduced here.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Special Case of Voltage Gain is a technical note showing that the equation for voltage gain will have to be modified for a special coil that may be related to Tesla's fuelless energy generator design. A regular coil and one of Tesla's design are measured and compared. Measurements show that the Tesla design is over 900% better in voltage gain than predicted by calculation.

       Self-Generating Electrical Discharge - Alexander V. Frolov
"The «self-generating discharge» SGD produce longitudinal electromagnetic wave that is not accepted in classical physics since it can be created only in some substance like the sound wave can be created in air. But it is the experimental fact and the substance we have to talk about is the ether or the material space. Alexander Chernetsky used the term «physical vacuum» to show principal difference between his «structured vacuum» and «vacuum as nothing».  The waves we'll discuss are the energy density waves created locally in  space so there is some volumetrical density of this energy. In other words, the space is product or result of some process and its energy density is depend of the parameters of the process. When we'll get the way to generate the wave it means to create some local change of the space or material object structure located in the area of the wave. The experiments proved it."
      </p>
      <p>
       "N.Tesla investigate the standing wave of electrical nature like the wave he observed in process of natural storm. In 1932 he wrote: «...I showed that the universal medium is a gaseous body in which only longitudinal pulses can be propagated, involving alternating compression and expansion similar to those produced by sound waves in air.» [6]."

       Tesla and Moray both said it is basically a radio receiver tuned to the universe. This means a very very high frequency. because of the tubes in Moray's device the frequency must be above x-rays. They both said we are surrounded by a sea of high and low frequency energy, you just have to tune into it and draw the power. The higher the frequency the more energy packed into a certain length of waves. Somewhere between x-rays and gamma waves.

       The methernitha machine is very interesting but their doesn't seem to be much real info on it. I have been looking into "fractal antennas" lately to pursue my Tesla/Moray device. Fractal antennas require no tuning circuit, can pull multiple frequencies,very high frequencies, and really remind me of ancient symbols.

       The coil is wrapped on a rare earth magnet.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could also convert static to AC using a Tesla coil. Refer

       Fractal antennas are really fascinating. But you must resonate the tank circuit and impedance match to get good results. You could use a Input filter or two.

       free enegry means we will need much more resources! we will create engines, computers, cars, everybody will have AC, giant fying cars, stuff that could use that free energy, we will create giant excavators which rip the earth, destroy everything, we don't need to save enegry anymore, so we will be creating giant amounts of heat = goodbye life on earth

       I could understand this in developing countries. The good thing is that if this got to a big enough scale and deregulated then maybe we wouldn't have vehicles and engines that needed gas; therefore less carbon dioxide. I think it would be a trade off which would actually be better for the environment.
