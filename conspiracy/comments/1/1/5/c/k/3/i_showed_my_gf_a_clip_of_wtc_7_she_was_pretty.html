<p>I would focus on architects and engineers.</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/4fmseAai4Is">http://youtu.be/4fmseAai4Is</a></p>

<p>Keep the hystrionics to a minimum. Especially when a person has just learned about these things the last thing you want to do is show them [her in this case] some Alex Jones bullshit.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also mention that there have been no criminal cases or indictments. The FBI never found any links to Osama bin Laden for 9/11. To the day of his announced death Osama&#39;s FBI page never even mentioned 9/11. So, the FBI doesn&#39;t think it was Osama. There were no criminal prosecutions. In fact the money links stopped at a Pakistni general who happened to be luncheoning at the White House on 9/11/2001. None of this is discussed by the media or the government.</p>

<p>The critical question of &quot;who did it&quot; has never been answered officially.</p>

<p>[EDIT]</p>

<p>I also like this one rather a lot:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very amateurish.</p>

<p>They have some interesting points, but don&#39;t fully understand what they&#39;re saying. They make claims without backing those claims up. There are many assertions and assumptions injected in ways that come off as a bad thesis film from a second-rate university.</p>

<p>Mind you, I agree with the general idea that the 9/11 attacks were fishy [to say the least], however the manner in which Loose Change discusses this very serious subject is not what I like to see. Then again, I have standards that are probably unreasonable.</p>

<p>What&#39;s my view summed up?</p>

<p>Loose Change is kind of like a poorly executed brochure on a very poignant topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as reputable goes this is about as good as it gets:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.webcitation.org/5tmFOBanU">http://www.webcitation.org/5tmFOBanU</a></p>

<p>Until I just dug this up I didn&#39;t realise that the whole thermite thing was actually backed up by some rather solid looking experimentation.</p>

<p>What&#39;s astonishing is that NIST says thermite couldn&#39;t have been used (not that they tested for it) because:</p>

<p>&quot;In order for the thermate reaction to melt steel to take place, there has to be materials. If you look at the amount needed--at least 100 pounds for one column--you need someone to get that amount in the building, and place it, and for the reaction to take place. It is unlikely.&quot;</p>

<p>Unlikely? Surely the whole scenario in of itself is unlikely, the unlikely stuff is exactly what should have been investigated.</p>

<p>Even though it&#39;s unlikely the thermite is still there, and perhaps since it appears to be of the military not available to the public type <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=5d5iIoCiI8g">you would not need much of it</a> to do severe structural damage.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know what happened on 9/11, I am not convinced by either conspiracists or the official story, both seem to be selling a story. What I do know is that there is rather good evidence that specialist thermite was found in dust taken from various parts of the city.</p>

<p>That there is enough for me to be thinking that perhaps what happened on 9/11 was a bit different to what is commonly thought and taught.</p>

<p>When you start considering just the mere possibility of being lied to on this scale it begins to alter your whole world view.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t focus on 9/11 too much.  There are many many other events which don&#39;t have to be proven and are scary as shit.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the power of nightmares:

<p>Hope you didn&#39;t show her some bunk documentary.  It&#39;s important to understand the history of imperialism and to demonstrate that there is a wide ranging covert war, and a motive for these freaks to do these things which they do.</p>
