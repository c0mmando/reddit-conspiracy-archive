       Because it was a shit study. "Oh no, 100% of the 10 rats in our exceedingly tiny test group got cancer, which should not be at all surprising because this breed of rat has a 70% chance of tumors and our test size was way too small for a 100% rate to be statistically significant!"

        here’s an old study on this line of rats published in 1979 that looked at the spontaneous development of endocrine tumors. After two years, 86% of male and 72% of female rats had developed tumors of the sort described by Séralini et al. Note that the time period of this 1979 study was the same as that of Séralini et al, two years. In other words, the “treated” rats developed as many tumors as expected for this particular strain of rats allowed to live to their natural lifespanand in fact the control groups arguably had an unusually low incidence of tumors.

        Several study links supporting those statements can be found here, as well as a good breakdown of why the study is generally bullshit and horribly constructed
       </a>
       . Basically, the study itself was flawed by having too many experimental factors, and far too small a population for each experimental factor, and not controlling for known faults in the chosen experiment subjects that should counsel for the use of other subjects, especially when testing for tumor formation.

       Unless you are some kind of rat or genetically modified food expert I can actively dismiss your assertions on the study. The article itself mentions nothing "this breed of rat has a 70% chance of tumors" however it does show a significant increase in premature death in the rats. ANewMahine615 please eat all of Monsanto's GMO crops and do your part for natural selection...

       And then give a vague apology about how bad their day as been, so we should stop questioning why they banned more than a handful of people for questioning their removal of content. Yep, mods are fun.

       u/politicbot is a bot which resubmits all posts from political subreddits to r/politic.
       <br/>
       u/go1dfish created it as an alternative to r/politics
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you are confusing that bot with his other bot - u/moderationlog which scans the new queues of various political subreddits periodically to check which posts are removed. Posts which it discovers have been removed are logged at r/moderationlog. Only that bot can submit to r/moderationlog, users however can submit removals to r/politicalmoderation. Sometimes for example, I browse r/moderationlog and any removals I find interesting, I will resubmit them to r/politicalmoderation to highlight them and/or for potential discussion. This is the intention of the two subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe u/politicbot resubmits even the removed posts to r/politic also.

       A text interview from 93 with Bin Laden? There's no proof that interview took place at all, as far as I could see. I can write up an interview right now and say it took place in 93.

       So that would be the first time someone has used photoshop, or someone has lied in a newspaper article? Shouldn't we be skeptical on both sides? 
We don't seem to use the same reasoning when something appears to support conspiracy positions, or ideologies. There isn't anything even interesting in the supposed interview, that would get it removed from reddit. Wow, he was, 'allegedly' helping to build a road. Man that is some interesting intel right there! I can see why illuminati of reddit would want it removed!
