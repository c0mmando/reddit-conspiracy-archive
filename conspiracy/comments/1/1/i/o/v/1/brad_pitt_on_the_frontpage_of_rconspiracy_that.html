       Brad's image from "Fight Club" is a quite iconic, but we all know that Brad could not work in Hollywood if he actually rebelled against his Zionist Masters in Hollywood.

       He's a pretty vocal Obama supporter for gay rights/drug issues. Pretty stupid. Let's put up a picture of someone like Rogan who is constantly ranting against the two parties and things like NDAA if we're going to go the celebrity route.

       Tyler Durden was character Brad Pitt played. I like the character Tyler Durden and he isn't as much of a kiss ass in real life like Brad is. I think Tyler Durden is representative of a conspiracy type character.

       I think Joe is okay too. I just don't know anyone in Hollywood or other celebrity that will stand up against the Zionist Power Matrix.

       Pitt does walk the walk (after a fashion) by doing charitable work with his money. I might not agree with how he's doing it, but the homes he got built in the 9th Ward after Katrina is more than you've ever done.

       Again, you know nothing about me or what I do. For all you know I'm part of the 1% and have given 99% of my earnings to charities. I never understood this worship of celebrities like this guy. If he really truely cared about people he would expose the power elite like Hunter S Thompson did.

       Maybe he's not in a position to. We don't disagree there at all, people who do know should talk, and do so in a way that they aren't trying to monetize the information. Pitt has the ability to do so, but doesn't. That doesn't make the work he has done any less important. That was my only point, not that we should 'worship' anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the big reasons I think people in Pitt's position don't talk is because the public hasn't demonstrated a desire to respond to the information in a meaningful way. For instance, we both agree on the premise, but just spent how long trading blows instead of focusing on the issue? While the public does that, a celebrity that has outed what they know will have had an accident, overdose, or worse. Then the media focuses on their death, and the real story is ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Happened to DMX. Happened to Michael Jackson. Happened to Tupac. Happened to Marilyn Monroe. Happened to any number of celebs that time has forgotten.
      </p>

       If you want people like Pitt to speak, you and I have to pledge more action than shit talk on a message board.

       Again, you keep trying to peg me as a worshiper. I said maybe he's not in a position to, that's not making an excuse, it's making an observation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very clear that there's a industrial segment of Hollywood dedicated to destroying celebrities that don't toe the line. Perhaps Pitt isn't positioned in a way where he feels he could resist this industry and get the message out in a significant way. Perhaps he doesn't want to die yet. Perhaps he's just selfish. We're both speculating at this point, no need to try and make it personal.
      </p>

       But for some reason, you seem to take open discussion as a personal affront, and must attempt to destroy the credibility of anyone engaging in it. Why is that? Why are you repeating the same thing over and over, regardless of what I say? What's your personal stake in all of this?

       Hollywood marketing pablum nonetheless, I've always had a soft spot for that film's iconic imagery and specially the last scene, with the skyscrapers going into the ground, a dark foretelling of 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes I wonder if 9/11 might actually have been perpetrated by Tyler Durden-style anarchists led, lied to, and financed by neocon entities. They thought they were bringing a
       <em>
        Year Zero
       </em>
       with a financial clean slate, they actually helped fast-forward the Empire agenda...

       Their unmasking wouldn't have served the desired narrative of the rising Islamic boogeyman. They already had a very
       <em>
        videogenic

       patsy available.

       If that were true, the FedGov wouldn't have been able to sit on the knowledge, they would have fed their patsies to the media and skipped straight to the 'domestic terrorists are the enemy' mantra we have now.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I think it's safe to say 911 was done a State actor that FedGov doesn't control 100%. But! Predictive programming is very big in the mind control sectors of the US Government. So prepping the minds of the obvious 'radicals' that would embrace a film like Fight Club isn't out of the question.
