    <div class="md"><p>Maybe he&#39;s not in a position to. We don&#39;t disagree there at all, people who do know should talk, and do so in a way that they aren&#39;t trying to monetize the information. Pitt has the ability to do so, but doesn&#39;t. That doesn&#39;t make the work he has done any less important. That was my only point, not that we should &#39;worship&#39; anyone. </p>

<p>One of the big reasons I think people in Pitt&#39;s position don&#39;t talk is because the public hasn&#39;t demonstrated a desire to respond to the information in a meaningful way. For instance, we both agree on the premise, but just spent how long trading blows instead of focusing on the issue? While the public does that, a celebrity that has outed what they know will have had an accident, overdose, or worse. Then the media focuses on their death, and the real story is ignored. </p>

<p>Happened to DMX. Happened to Michael Jackson. Happened to Tupac. Happened to Marilyn Monroe. Happened to any number of celebs that time has forgotten. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, you keep trying to peg me as a worshiper. I said maybe he&#39;s not in a position to, that&#39;s not making an excuse, it&#39;s making an observation. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very clear that there&#39;s a industrial segment of Hollywood dedicated to destroying celebrities that don&#39;t toe the line. Perhaps Pitt isn&#39;t positioned in a way where he feels he could resist this industry and get the message out in a significant way. Perhaps he doesn&#39;t want to die yet. Perhaps he&#39;s just selfish. We&#39;re both speculating at this point, no need to try and make it personal.</p>

<p>But for some reason, you seem to take open discussion as a personal affront, and must attempt to destroy the credibility of anyone engaging in it. Why is that? Why are you repeating the same thing over and over, regardless of what I say? What&#39;s your personal stake in all of this?</p>

<p>Typical excuse bro. You do sound like a worshiper to me with all of these excuses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But for some reason, you seem to take open discussion as a personal affront, and must attempt to destroy the credibility of anyone engaging in it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dude he has no credibility since he&#39;s a puppet to the elite. Why are you dense to the truth? And where am I &quot;attempting to destroy&quot; discussions? I merely gave my own opinion about the guy and you got your panties in a knot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you repeating the same thing over and over, regardless of what I say?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you can&#39;t read. I have to repeat myself since you&#39;re brainwashed with celebrity worshiping.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s your personal stake in all of this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t have a stake in this? Just my own opinion? Why is it so hard for you brainwashed sheep to understand that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hollywood marketing pablum nonetheless, I&#39;ve always had a soft spot for that film&#39;s iconic imagery and specially the last scene, with the skyscrapers going into the ground, a dark foretelling of 9/11. </p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder if 9/11 might actually have been perpetrated by Tyler Durden-style anarchists led, lied to, and financed by neocon entities. They thought they were bringing a <em>Year Zero</em> with a financial clean slate, they actually helped fast-forward the Empire agenda... </p>

<p>No, I think it&#39;s safe to say 911 was done a State actor that FedGov doesn&#39;t control 100%. But! Predictive programming is very big in the mind control sectors of the US Government. So prepping the minds of the obvious &#39;radicals&#39; that would embrace a film like Fight Club isn&#39;t out of the question. </p>
