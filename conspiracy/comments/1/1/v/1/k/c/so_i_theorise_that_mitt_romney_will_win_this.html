<p>Now when someone runs for presidency and just lie...and lie...so blatently and so frequently, you have to stop and wonder why. Why would he tell so many lies? </p>

<p>So lets just say he becomes president. He&#39;s told so many lies about how everyone will be better off under him that it won&#39;t take very long for everyone to realise none of it was true...</p>

<p>Unless something big happens that takes all the focus away from him. Something he can use as an excuse.</p>

<p>What one thing is super profitable to him and his corporations that will give him an excuse to not come through with any promise, but still make him look like a good leader? War and Terror. A major terrorist attack and another war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm. No i don&#39;t think so. However in saying that, maybe he&#39;s just a much much better liar than Romney? </p>

<p>No I truely don&#39;t think he will. Look at who is financially backing him. A lot of really big players who will not benefit at all from war. 
I can&#39;t see any major links between Obama and companies that will profit from a large military engagement. I also can not find any evidence that his proposals are unachievable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your justification for this assessment? As i responded to Junkmale&#39;s same question, I pointed out why I do not believe Obama will wage another war in his term. 
I did not go in to great detail, however I can, quite easily, bring enough evidence to back up my statement. 
What evidence do you have to back up the statement that it would be the same regardless? </p>

<p>Keeping in mind that I would be very interested if there was something that could back up this theory - that isn&#39;t easily debunked.  I would be just as content to find out that Obama truly is an evil mastermind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I feel like society as a whole is going through a degradation process.  Mitt Romney is getting away with these things because of the people living in this country.  He&#39;s only lying to give certain groups what they want to hear.  They don&#39;t care if it matches up, only if it sounds good at the time. </p>

The only thing that has me thinking is that they would have to control the collapse to make sure it is a short term solution to fix (i.e less than 5 years) or at least get back on track, othewise the value of the money they are stealing would not be all that much</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yah pretty much. I can&#39;t possibly see the same outcome if Romney loses. </p>

<p>I do not know how inevitable it is. Iran has a much more powerful standing defence force than Israel and a massive surplus of oil, which Israel does not. I don&#39;t believe Israel would be able to sustain a war with Iran for very long, and unless they go in with the support of the US (which they can&#39;t unless Iran strikes first - which is very unlikely) then they will be up against China &amp; Russia who both are very strongly tied to the Iran at the moment. </p>

<p>The USA is not going to support a first strike on Iran, specifically because it would face serious, and potential military, resistance from both China and Russia...</p>

<p>In saying that if Romney wins, that&#39;s probably what he&#39;s going to want to happen....</p>

As to what that outcome may be because of unhappy voters remains to be seen. But if it is violent or unruly enough (perfect opportunity for a false flag), I don&#39;t think mittens would hesitate to put us under martial law, or military rule in general. Now the only question would be if they paint the enemy as domestic or foreign. A xenophobic mittens would probably paint it as foreign, but still close to home enough to scare the average sheeple.
   Mittens has too many masters you see, so it&#39;s hard to tell who he will sell us out to first. Wallstreet and the corporate cronies would drop our wages, break unions, and essentially make china our role model for business ventures (Sweat shops, poor/unsafe conditions, cutting costs at all corners, etc.), Selling us out to the military industrial complex, halliburton and the like, would wind up bringing us to war with Iran, North Korea, and every other little nation that has been in our crosshairs for the last decade, if we don&#39;t go to war on ourselves first that is. </p>

<p>The only thing that could truly detract from Mittens being a do-nothing liar (as well as his entire party) would be a civil war in the americas, kicked off by a false flag. They already keep the country divided, coke or pepsi, red vs blue, so a new civil war wouldn&#39;t be hard to imagine... </p>

<p>IF thats the case, I need to get to work on my prometheus device. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>unlike the last two most significant assassinations, it is unlikely, if he is asassinated, that it would be a conspiracy, rather a crazy racist fucker. white gun toting military drop out crazy sniper guy...just the type of guy who would have it in for obama. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t think the republicans would want that to happen. i think they would risk having Sleepy-pants as POTUS</p>
