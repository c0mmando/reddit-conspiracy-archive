<p>Douglas-David has filed court papers showing she has more than <strong>$53,800 in weekly expenses</strong>, including for maintaining a Park Avenue apartment and three residences in Sweden.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m saying that they would be better off compared to making $8 an hr.  This would also drive up the average hourly wage to aprox. 19-20 an hr which is most certainly a livable salary at this point and time. Of course, these are all hypothetical numbers, but I&#39;m just trying to prove a point.</p>

<p>Now, I know there are plenty of macro arguments that state that in the long run, raising the minimum wage would actually have a negative impact by raising inflation and the cost of production, etc. ( however, most folks that state this are of what I call the &#39;neo-fascist&#39; variety, i.e Michelle Bachmann, Paul Ryan, Koch brothers etc.) </p>

<p>But if you have a counter argument to raising the minimum wage, I&#39;d love hear what you have to say. Always curious to hear alternative viewpoints. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, Upvote for having an open mind. It seems like more and more people are getting the attitude of “My way is right and everyone else is wrong.” </p>

<p>Second, While I agree with the people you listed that raising the min wage is a bad idea, I don&#39;t agree with the majority of the other things they believe. While I believe that capitalism is the best option right now, I think it&#39;s bullshit that major corporations are getting <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2011/03/ten_giant_us_companies_avoidin.html">refunds</a>. I think we should have a flat tax. Everyone pays the same amount. This way no one can bitch about someone else not 
“Paying their fair share.”</p>

<p>That being said, I am a part owner of a small restaurant chain. I have seen first hand how the min. wage effects everything else ( I can provide proof but I ask that it be through a mod since it is personal info I am sharing.) Min. wage effects both Micro and Macro economics. </p>

<p>I live in the state of Oregon where we have a min. wage increase almost every year automatically. That means that almost every year I have to raise my prices just to keep my personal paycheck the same. I am by no means rich. I don&#39;t even own a home. With the economy the way it is it&#39;s hard to convince people to eat out as much as they used to. Then when the new year starts I have to raise my prices which pushes more people away. It is a very difficult cycle.</p>

<p>Another shitty fact about Oregon is that we can&#39;t pump our own fucking gas. We have to have someone else do it. If gas stations have to pay some guy 31k a year ($15 an hour at full time) then gas prices will go up and I am sure you can guess where that goes.</p>

<p>Sorry, kinda went on a fuck Oregon rant.</p>

<p>When the min. wage was first thought up it wasn&#39;t designed for a single person to provide for a whole family. It was designed to prevent sweat shops. The idea is that young people work at min. wage and as they learn more skills or get a degree they will be paid a fair wage to support a family.</p>

The average peasent&#39;s measily saving become virtually worthless while the elite become less rich. They also own things like buisness that create money which invaluable not to mention they control resources which is more tangible than money. Their assests will see them through this kind of financial crisis. They are also global players and have their investments whidespread. If anything they will discover new ways to profit on the hordes of people who&#39;s small saving become worthless, and so does their personal value become worthless. If anything this only gives the elites a cheaper workforce to employ in their monopoly game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The Rich invested in as many things as they can to get their hands on. Money as an exchange medium won&#39;t fall away - there will be a new one in a matter of months, and that new one will reflect investments. In other words - Land. Energy sources. Minerals. Vehicles. Skills. Real estate. Patents. Stores. Warehouses. Goods. Medicines. </p>

<p>These possessions will start generating a new kind of value. I dunno, amero, neuro, credits, krugerrands, latinum. Who cares?

    <div class="md"><p>This difference is that when the money becomes worthless, you&#39;ll be in debt and they, the rich, wont.</p>

<p>Then they will come in, and put liens against and seize everything you thought you owned. Why do you think there are basically no more family owned farms in the USA anymore? This boom-bust strategy has been continually used by the rich to steal from the poor - while convincing the poor that its their fault that they just didnt work hard enough. When in truth, they never had a fucking chance at the game. Continually devalue the currency so you can never get your head more than an inch above water no matter how hard you work.</p>

<p>The rich WANT the dollar to crash for this reason. As it crashes, more and more of you will be forced to take out loans, a second mortgage or whatever, to keep your heads above water, to keep food on your table. And they&#39;ll be happy to give you a loan. And then when its over and you default? They&#39;ll be coming for all your shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was Trump that said &quot;The more money you have, the less money things cost&quot; or something to that effect. Basically, that when he wants a hotel, he doesn&#39;t call the reservations desk like us, he calls his friend Mr. Hilton who then reserves him a room at no charge, because he knows that one day he&#39;ll need something Trump has. It&#39;s the same with all the mega-rich. It&#39;s about networking. Knowing the right person, etc. </p>

<p>And once fiat money crashes, well Trump still owns office towers and needs to vacation, while Hilton still owns hotels and needs offices for his employees. And Mr. Bentley needs both hotels and offices, but knows that Trump and Hilton still need someone to drive them to/from events. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once people well and truly realize that fiat money is not backed by anything at all, that&#39;s when the system collapses. We are close to that point. All we need is some runaway inflation.</p>

<p>Thing is, the elite want to move us all away from cash. They want us doing all our buying and selling by computer chip, so that they can monitor everything we do, and tax us on every transaction. They hate cash for that reason.</p>

<p>But -- and this is the interesting insight -- electronic money is fiat money. Think about it. What is it, except some bits and bytes? It&#39;s nothing, and it&#39;s backed by nothing except force of habit. It certainly isn&#39;t backed by <em>trust</em> any longer ... who in their right mind trusts the government, or the Federal Reserve, or the banks?</p>

<p>I strongly doubt if money becomes completely worthless; that people will just bend over to the new system of essentially making those who own property overlords. If money is no longer of value in any way - then the fact that they &quot;own&quot; property is a facade.</p>

<p>edit;</p>

<p>I&#39;m answering this question as if there wasn&#39;t a collapse, but if money had <strong>no value at all</strong> because of the title saying worthless.</p>
