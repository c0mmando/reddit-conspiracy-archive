       Long story short I learned today J. Edgar Hoover was "born and raised a Freemason". I'd like to know what this actually implies. Growing up I thought it was some type of cooky "conspiracy theory term", but now that I've piecemeal'd evidence on certain events over recent years....I need to reevaluate the context of what Freemasonry means, and I'm just looking for some help. Thanks

       You have to believe in a creator of the universe. That's it. You don't have to be religious. In fact, Christians are one of the main opponents of freemasonry (not talking about the US new right "christians"), as they believe that freemasonry is the organization which will give rise to the antichrist.

       It's the world's oldest and largest fraternity. In order to join you must profess a faith of some kind, be 18 or over, male, and a free man (not a slave). Initiation and progress to the third degree usually costs a couple of hundred bucks. After that, you can join York Rite for another 7 degrees, Scottish Rite for another 29 degrees, or the Shrine if you wish.

       There is a lodge about 25 minutes bus ride away. Meetings are in a nondescript building on a street full of grocery stores, a travel agent, a layer, and accountant place. Theres a sign that says meetings are every third monday, by invitation only, no solicitors. However this of course is only a local lodge, in my city. There is of course a much larger and more impressive lodge in NYC, can't get any where near there.

       I often wonder about Masonry. On the one hand you have all these powerful people throughout time that have been Masons. Yet on the other hand there isn't much to go on as far as conspiracies, as far as I know. My father in law has been a mason his whole life and he said he's never heard of any conspiracies. His brother is/was Grand Master Mason (I think) at one of America's oldest lodges in the nation. Acacia lodge 18 in New Jersey if I recall. My father in law told me he asked his brother one day if he had ever heard of any conspiracy worthy happenings and he laughed and said he never heard or saw anything. It's possible he said, but he was never brought in on anything.

       These days I think Masonry is pretty harmless. A throw back to a time when you needed someone to trust and being a mason meant you could be trusted. It also provided context to the universe at a time when science was still devolving. The "creator" of the universe is refereed to as the "grand architect", using tools as metaphors i.e., a compass provided direction, a ruler provided a straight path, a chisel to shape and mold character.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a conspiracy then they are doing a great job of covering it up.

       Why would powerful people tell the low level initiates ANYTHING?

       There are two theories about Freemasonry. One is that it developed, literally, from the masons guild of the middle ages and that in its secret meetings it promoted democracy and freedom, subversive ideas in the days when Europe was ruled by kings and popes. And that is why Washington and most of the founding fathers were masons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The catholic church's hatred of masonry supports this idea. Only Freemasonry's opposition to the rule of the popes would arouse such hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other idea is that European Freemasonry was invaded and subverted by the Illuminati, a group of European wealthy. George Washington, a mason, warned against them.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The first President of the United States, George Washington, believed that the Illuminati intended to separate the people from their government in his letters in the Library of Congress.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Certainly most of the lower levels of masonry are unaware of any nefarious plots. What exists at higher levels, they don't know. Have the upper levels been subverted?
      </p>
      <p>
       But let me tell you about the black masons, which a black co-employee told me about. He had been invited to join the black masons and said that that was the only way a black man could get promoted to supervisor in our workplace. And that once they were promoted they were obligated to protect and promote other black masons. He also said that there was a testing period during which the candidate would have to prove his loyalty to the group. For instance, if a brother mason called him up in the middle of the night and told him to bring a change of clean clothes and a shovel to the middle of nowhere, he was supposed to do it, secretly, in an almost help bury the body type scenario. He said he had talked to his preacher about it and had been told he couldn't join. So he had given up the idea of ever being a supervisor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if the white masons are like that. That they promote and protect each other. Like fraternity brothers do. (No wonder there's a glass ceiling.)

       You have a citation for that? Cause I'd be surprised if they had an open organization with a list of names, even then. And there's about a hundred years between the French revolution and the statue of liberty.

       Just google illuminati and statue of liberty, open your eyes. They celebrated the statue of liberty the days following the revolution, not the american one, they gave it later as you are very correct in mentioning. But it gives you a clue as to why the us recieved it.

       It comes from what is known as "mystery religions" which were fertility cults that initiated people into the truths of the religions.  Also a lot of the symbols used in freemasonry have to do with sexual organs, astrology, numerology, geometry, magic - basically a lot of esoteric stuff that is regarded as extremely flakey by most people.  This presents a problem when you are talking about freemasonry because it can sound like you are endorsing these things, which makes you sound like a kook, but you are really just describing Freemasonry.  The million dollar question is why do the most powerful people in the world believe in this stuff?  Its interesting that they (the initiated) claim to have secret knowledge, which the ignorant masses (the profane) are ignorant of.  By the way, as others have pointed out there are tiers to masonry - so many of the people involved in it really are just businessmen, who as far as I can tell think the aforementioned stuff is as flakey as everyone else.

       They know this.  The worship of Venus and Saturn are old hat.  Research the Theosophical Society, as it is the root of Freemasonry; with Mystery Babylon/Talmudic Judaism at its heart.

       Normally they only let black people join for publicity to make people think they're not racist, read "Sammy Davis Jr.". That's why they have the Prince Hall Masons, which is the black branch that isn't considered as "true" as the white one. Whites have their Masonry, Blacks their Prince Hall, and women their Eastern star, among others. For the most part, if you see anything on a car indicating that the owner is a Mason, they're usually black and therefore Prince Hall.
