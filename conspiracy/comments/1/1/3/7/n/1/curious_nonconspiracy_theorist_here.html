       </a>
       : "I'm a skeptic, so let me burden YOU to do the work for me. Go out, find conspiracies with proof and send them to me." I have a better idea: start with an easy one, like 911 and do some damn homework. Look it up. Read, watch, educate yourself, and form a critical opinion. It's nobody's job to "convince you" of anything.

       As I said before, I'm just honestly interested in the variety of conspiracy theories people actually believe.  Think of it as a distribution curve:  Is it skewed toward relatively mundane theories, such as the fed making sure money stays in the banks, as I think someone else in this thread commented, or is it skewed toward the radical, such as shape-shifting "reptilians" that walk among us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm truly not looking to persecute.  Just curious as to what people on this subreddit believe.

       Leading people to distrust your intent as being purely academic. So if you'd like to tell us what you're actually looking for - noting that you have already stated proudly that you "laugh at conspiracy theories" in your OP - then you're more likely to get actual responses.

       "im not a conspiracy theorist, and i laugh at most conspiracy theories". you're already putting them down before you even hear them out. the fact is you have already admitted you follow the patented "label them crazy conspiracy theorists and what they say wont be true" ploy. it says a lot about who you are when there have been numerous 100% proven "conspiracy theories" that panned out, and you/people still only look at them as nothing more than loony bed time stories.

       Hm...it may depend on what you mean by "conspiracy". My examples would be: The Gulf of Tonkin was concocted to get us into Vietnam. The MKUltra experiments happened. Whistleblower Thomas Drake has some great details on the NSA. Those are real events and things that, at the time of their occurence, were covered up. The Drake case might be one of the best, most recent examples, in my opinion.

       I, for one, believe that the Federal Reserve was created by a coalition of concerned businessmen and politicians to help the American people. Their plan was to take the power to print money, but only use it for good. So far, their track record is 100%.

       It is hidden in plain sight,if you don't or can't see it you really are not looking are you?
mockingbird,cointelpro,paperclip,false flags,MKultra the list goes on and on.
you are blind and they own you if you can't see it.
I would like to say we laugh at you but is is too sad to know how many accept the lies and manipulation presented as history and fact.

       So you want to see which one of you're two preconcieved notions of what every single one of us believe in is the more accurate. Because we all believe the exact same stuff, right? You want to know which one of you're two biases is the right one? You ever wonder if some of us don't believe either of the two things you list. Do you realize how you twist different people's ideas together and put words into people's mouth. That stupid post on the front page... yes it was stupid... but it didn't imply that they were withholding a cure. It implied that they had no economic motivation to look for one. There is a prefectly good argument against this... so why do you have to twist what was said in order to make it seem extra crazy so you don't even have to argue with it. It's because you're fucking lazy, and you're fucking stupid. I don't see why people waste effort trying to convince you people of anything. Eat GMO, drink flouride, and don't prepare for an economic collapse, please.

       Here you had someone, who admittedly doesn't believe in conspiracy theories, yet he is intrigued that there is such a large population who do, and he comes to try to understand what all the hubbub is. Then what happens? You act like little children who don't understand anything about logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what guys... the burden of proof, is always on the person making the positive claim. We are the ones who make positive claims about these theories, the burden of proof is on us. So your childish, go figure it out yourself blah blah, is fucking stupid and literally, every....single....fucking...time... it makes you look like you dont have jack shit as evidence and that is how you cover it up.
      </p>

       For fucks sake guys, if we want to be taken seriously, you have to start acting like intelligent people for a change.

       I think conspiracies exist for a number of reasons, both logical and illogical. No explanation is to remain unquestioned, but if the answer refutes the theory, that should be taken into account.

       MK Ultra testing went on for a very long period, the FBI targeted minority leaders and infiltrated the black panthers, and was responsible for arming them. The government was also responsible for bringing crack to the poverty stricken areas of the country, in an effort to snuff out the revolution seeking minorities. The crack cocaine was tracked back to the Contras, which were backed by Reagan's administration. The FBI also was running covert operations on Martin Luther King, trying to assassinate his character, threatening and blackmailing him over the phone, and trying to convince him to commit suicide. Once again, you can find information on these operations quite easily
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the most obvious one to me, but of course there's a multinational shadow government that has been planning the course of humanity. How else could you possibly explain the number of foreign governments we have sent the CIA in to infiltrate, funded the opposition of, and then bent to the will of the private entities they had revolted against? It's absurd the way the United States government has acted solely on the behalf of corporations who couldn't have their laborers revolting for increased rights in the past, and yet people pretend that the war we've found ourselves in is for anything but genocide and the dollar that comes with it. More than one U.S. official has claimed that the number one foreign policy should be depopulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything that is happening is to the will of a few. Why do so many of our ranking officials have these secret clubs that we aren't allowed to know anything about? They don't sit around and twiddle their thumbs while giggling at how everyone thinks they're actually doing something. Not a single high ranking official will comment on their time spent at Bilderberg beyond petty small talk, and if you mention the Bohemian Grove, they run straight for the hills.

       Different definition of "conspiracy".
      </p>
      <p>
       Consipracy in the context of this subreddit, from what I've seen, means people in power conspiring to control others' lives or the outcomes of world events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy in the context of the google search you linked means a simple plan to commit a crime.

       There's only one definition of Conspiracy, as it applies in legal cases and to this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your bias is what prevents you from learning, which is why you think all conspiracies are bunk. Why you're here is anyone's guess, but hardly anyone is dense enough to believe it's of educational or benign intent.

       Conspiracy in the context of most of the posts I've seen on this subreddit is most closely defined by definition (2).  Conspiracy in the context of the google page linked earlier is most closely defined by definition (4).

       Not exactly sure what my definition of "evil" has to do with anything.  I simply don't consider two-bit murder conspiracies actual conspiracy theories.  Partly because they're not theories, they're crimes.

       The only difference between your cited definitions is the concept of evil, which can be argued to be subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is my entire point about your stance. Your request in the OP is demonstrably and deceptively subjective. Which would logically lead to a person questioning your actual motives, here. Along with your proud and seemingly necessary announcement that you 'laugh at conspiracies'. .

       So, your theory is that conspiracies do exist, but always within the caste of people without power.  People in power never conspire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a reasonable or logical theory, but you're entitled to it.

       Oh, so you're telling me that r/conspiracy is devoted only certain conspiracies, and you get to decide which conspiracies qualify as "conspiracies".  Those where convictions have occurred don't count, right?
      </p>

       It's not a fair or honest discourse, but you're entitled to your own personality and way of dealing with people and situations.

       Perhaps you should re-post this and re-ask a question that you actually want an answer to?

       The conspiracies on the list you provided are not the same type of conspiracy as, for example, the "9/11 Truth" conspiracy, or the "Illuminati Shadow Government" conspiracy.
      </p>

       This is a simple concept, but you insist on twisting my words.  Please attempt to understand my point before you jump to a conclusion.

       Read that document.  Basically they are saying Democracy doesn't work, and what is needed is a strong central non-democratic Government.  And what is the message of that flag in the crosshairs?  Isn't it that nation states should or are going to be abolished?  Just keep this document in your mind next time you are laughing at how crazy someone is that believes that elites really are trying to build a totalitarian one world government.

       Not absolutely convinced, but I keep hearing of evidence that the 9/11 events were at least partly an 'inside' job.
