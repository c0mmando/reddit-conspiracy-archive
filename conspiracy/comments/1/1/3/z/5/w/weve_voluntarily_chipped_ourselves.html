        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Aaron Russo claimed that he knew about the 9/11 events prior due to a Rockefeller advising him of it. The event was to occur to get us at war with Iraq and some other countries with an end result of all of us being RFID chipped. I&#39;m pretty skeptical about end results because there are so many variables, one truly can&#39;t create an event that will create a specific outcome with 100% certainty. But now (for awhile) there is something that wasn&#39;t around in 2001, something that is essentially a tracking chip. We carry &quot;smart phones&quot; with GPS tracking capabilities. We use them daily; they go with us everywhere. We voluntarily purchase these things that allow us to be tracked. The US Government isn&#39;t a gov&#39;t of the people so I wouldn&#39;t put it past them to be using cell phones for tracking purposes. Plus any newly issued US Passport is chipped. No one held a gun to our head or told us to comply. Even if you don&#39;t have a contract with a wireless provider, most people use facebook and post from their phone. It wouldn&#39;t be difficult for the gov&#39;t to determine who the phone is associated with. We did it all ourselves... completely voluntarily.  </p>

<p>TL;DR: Instead of being physically chipped, we went out and bought smart phones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Asia if you want to do business / own land then you need an ID card.  If you want an ID card then you must get your fingerprints digitally scanned.  At the boarders they use automatic cattle gates, you go in holding your passport, and are cleared automaticaly by the machine (it reads the chip and scans your face to match).  If you combine this turnstile tech with the body scanner tech used in USA airports then they have a total body print that creates a near 99.999999% accurate ID system.  Even sci-fi movies that speculated on eye and fingerprint swaps didn&#39;t predict that you would have to swap bones and guts in order to beat the machine scan.  Add the tech used in Iraq and Afgan to scan eyeballs in the field that automatically upload via internet connection.  Same portable eyeball scan tech has been used to register 1 billion Indians.  There is no need to chip the population, because all persons will have submitted BIO data into the global system plus carry chipped ID cards/passports plus carry a celluar device.   <em>Here is the scary part</em> detection systems will be set up to locate anyone NOT carrying a celluar device ... once spotted they will be interegated (ie BIO scanned) ... go Bigfoot style and live in the mountains ... nope ... the drones will pick you up via infared signature ... there is no way off the grid ... end game is just offer a chip at birth to avoid future hassel of registering later on in life ... they&#39;ll sell it as child protection just in case some pedo kidnaps the kid they can be insta-located. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because of the patriot act and similar laws in other countries. Your cell has 911 location services. It&#39;s just not for Fire/med etc... It&#39;s also used for tracking where your cell has been. Who you called at that location. How long you bee there etc... They can even without a warrant order cell companies to give all data text to them. They can even turn on your camera and microphone and monitor without you even being aware.</p>

<p>They can even turn on your webcam at your home or work computer. They also have info on everything you do and type on the computer.</p>

<p>Wanna see what&#39;s on the web for myself. Here is Hanahou&#39;s reddit comments when you do a search on the web.</p>

<p>Pages and pages of everything I said and done is public, and the police don&#39;t even need a warrant. They can just print it out to use against you. </p>

<p>&quot;Well now Mr. hanahou. I see that we have evidence from your reddit comments you were threatening the NSA on 10-7-2012.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;But I was only kidding!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Doesn&#39;t look like it to me hana&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We already know phones are the easiest tracking devices ever. What better way for everyone to carry it than to put fun games, music, media, and a whole slew of distractions into one bundle. Police access data readily from cell phone towers, and cell providers even have protocol and prices for the data that can be offered to police. Cell providers profit from the police state. GO figure, every corporation is evil</p>

<p>TL;DR: Instead of being physically chipped, we went out and bought smart phones.</p>

<p>Glad I don&#39;t have one.  I grant that it&#39;s perhaps because I&#39;m simply so poor, and if I had a lot more money and important shit to do I might get one, but the point is that I don&#39;t have one.  I&#39;m sure it doesn&#39;t really matter all that much because I do have a cell phone (a regular one with just dial/number buttons that you can only talk on and that&#39;s it), but it&#39;s at least not an iphone type.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Maybe I actually wouldn&#39;t get one even if I did have enough money, because I&#39;m also not on any social network either and that&#39;s not based on lack of money, so...</p>

<p>Anyway...Just saying  .Nothing to see here.  Move along...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah -- my phone isn&#39;t connected to my body nor does it control my bank account. You&#39;re correct about being tracked. At least if the government is going to track me it can provide me with directions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you are correct. However, while you can not receive calls, you also can not be tracked. In order to call, you have to remove the case, which means that you show up again. So, you can prevent tracking to a certain extent, but once you use the phone, you can be located to the point of usage.</p>
