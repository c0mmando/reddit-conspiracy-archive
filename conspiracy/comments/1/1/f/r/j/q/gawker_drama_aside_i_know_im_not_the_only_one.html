       Furthermore, it is a banning of a news source for revealing the real name of a reddit user that
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       is a public figure, having a number of subreddits under his stewardship gain national attention through MSM; had his whole family do AMAs (formal/informal) complete with 'interesting' private details, and would ask people to just call him "VA" in reddit meetups.
      </p>
      <p>
       The irony here is that Chen's article covers meta-issues regarding the said article, and Reddit's response to it, much better than anything I've seen so far on reddit itself.  The stench of fear is indeed strong on reddit; And it shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as "doxxing" goes, it's about as mild &amp; tenuous as you can possibly get.  Reddit is milking this "doxxing" thing for all it's worth, 9/11-style.  Perhaps the admins can set up a Department of Username Security or something of the sort.

       Look, this wasn't even 9000sins idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was my idea.  I (flytape) was pestering the mods to participate in the BOYCOTT (not ban).  There is an important difference between a ban and a boycott.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was a ban nobody would have even asked you your opinion on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simple fact here is that doxxing isn't cool, and if a website outside of reddit starts to dox people the ONLY thing we can do about it is to BOYCOTT it.  We have no other method to fight it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can say is that everyone who is pro-doxxing of VA because of the forums he moderated, I sincerely hope that someone exposes every stupid idea you've had on this anonymous internet forum to your real life affiliates, your boss, your parents and children, the government and anyone else who might want to hold it against you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't believe that this was my idea then I'll upload screen shots of the conversation I had with the mods about it.

       I don't think the proposition is so disgusting, because I believe things should be considered and discussed. I do, however, think actually following through on it would disgust me. The reason I phrase my response this way is that many of the denizens of this particular subreddit also feel compelled to be activists. They want to DO something that (they feel) will have an impact on the world. While I hold sentiments similar to those (I want to have an impact), I don't necessarily want to be part of plebian circlejerk activities (which I think this particular one may be manifesting as) - doing it because everyone else is doing it. I'm not a lemming who'll jump off a cliff just because all the other lemmings are doing it.

       When your free speech causes someone else to lose their ability to speak freely it becomes censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gawker.com crossed this line when they uncovered and published VA's real name and location as an attack on how he exercises his free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not enough for the feminist cult to simply opt out of reading/viewing content they find offensive.  They are compelled to censor everyone.  They want to destroy their opponents rather than build up their allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       VA was an easy target because of his fringe fetishes that often come close to crossing the line into illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The feminist cult also wants to BAN gonewild because it objectifies women and "teaches a new generation of privileged white males to objectify women". But they can't because the girls submit the content.

       Calm the fuck down OP. There is no censorship going on that I know of in here just a confused mod about the whole drama that happened earlier this week. Besides, it's not like there's a shit ton of gawker posts in this sub anyways.

       Let me repeat myself again. VA deleted his account because the admins keep supporting SRS. Not because of Gakwer "doxxing" him even though he did an interview with them earlier...
