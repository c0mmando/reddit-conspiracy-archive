        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I learned recently about gawker.com and the hunt for the real identity of violentacrez. This is completely unacceptable for any site to do this to any one of us. There is a huge boycott of gawker.com right now, and in the spirit of this sub I ask you, the users, should we join the boycott of gawker.com and it&#39;s affiliates? This isn&#39;t about censorship, it&#39;s a form of protest. I hate having to selectively comb through submissions to find stuff from individual web sites. I also hate to remove anything at all because of how much shit it stirs up, especially when Facebook links and the like gain lots of traction here. So what should we do? Ban Gawker, or let the votes decide? Remember that if we allow their links than they profit every single time you click a link. And those profits may be used to hire a person who might expose YOU next. Just some food for thought. What do you think?</p>

They are a news site that needs readership to stay afloat. I don&#39;t think they or their readers care at all about a conspiracy theorist.

<p>It looks like it might be time to leave reddit behind. It&#39;s become part of the problem.</p>

<p>Shit, they might dox all of the most active users here and sell that info to whoever. </p>

<p>This has already been done. As I imagine you know.</p>

<p>Man, fuck these assholes. Why can&#39;t they leave us alone! But no, they must make us like them. No respect or discussion. Just mob mentality and cheap outrage.</p>

<p>When they drive people from their (internet) communities, that is when people start flipping out.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that posting the link does not mean I agree or disagree with the story, I posted it for comment, that&#39;s called free speech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vigilantism is a very dangerous action. That they set up a page with names and data on suspected posters of illegal and questionable material is risky, any personal vendetta or special interest can brand you as a pervert and turn your life into hell just by adding your data next to actual culprits&#39;. </p>

<p>Then again, have to say that, free speech and everything, many of the subreddits in the controversy had borderline material that while technically legal is ethically undefensible and it helps bring the wrong kind of attention to this place. For Gawker it is just hits and promotion; they are using the justified outrage of people here that have been in contact with that kind of abuse and found outing the pervs the only effective way to protest.</p>

<p>Difficult to try and side with guys that put violent, hateful or illegal material. Difficult as well to accept the kneejerk tactics that might be abused against others later, just for dissenting actitudes.</p>

<p>Gawker.com (which to be fair, is usually very sensational and pot-stirring) found out the idenity of Violentarcez, who is a redditor imfamous for creating subreddits like <a href="/r/creepshots">/r/creepshots</a> <a href="/r/beatingwomen">/r/beatingwomen</a> <a href="/r/jailbait">/r/jailbait</a> and countless others.

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah, it is and it isn&#39;t. This guy caused a lot of pain for abused women, abused children, and he was racist and homophobic on a pretty large scale. Because he&#39;s never had to deal with those problems in his life it was pretty easy for him to make fun of horrible stuff like that, then say things like &quot;eeeeyy lighten up guys! it&#39;s a joke!&quot; Personally, I find it fucking hilarious that now he has to own up to all the things he&#39;s said when he was a big man because he was anonymous.  </p>

<p>To be my own devil&#39;s advocate though, I don&#39;t think he should be killed for those things and now that his name is out there, one could easily look up his address and go and slice his throat if they really wanted to. I wouldn&#39;t be sad or anything, but I&#39;m not for vigilante justice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they do care, but they care on both sides, in balance. I still haven&#39;t made any decision on it, myself. And, as a result, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a decision that should be made in haste - especially not after all the effort sunshine-x put into u/uncensorship, and the fact that you&#39;ve configured u/automoderator to approve everything.</p>

<p>My biggest fear about making any sort of &quot;recommendation&quot; toward the decision is that you might actually act on it (no offense, but you&#39;re kind of impulsive that way). Thus why my comment is neutral at this point.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very troubled by the violation of anonymity and have been scratching my head and tugging at my beard for ways to improve it on reddit.</p>

<p>One idea I had this morning was as follows (totally unrelated to the gawker thing, btw)...</p>

<p>A few days ago, someone suggested that we all spend one day &quot;ignoring usernames and just voting on comment quality&quot; (or something to that effect). While this is certainly how things <em>should</em> work, it&#39;s not actually possible to ignore usernames, once you&#39;ve been around for a few months. So,... I came up with another idea (that I&#39;m still refining, but willing to share a little bit here, now)...</p>

<p>reddit should make it so that usernames do not appear at all until <strong>after</strong> you&#39;ve voted on a comment. <strong>AND</strong> votes must be locked in and unchangeable. <strong>AND</strong> the little &quot;dot&quot; between the up/downvotes can become a neutral vote, allowing you to vote neutral. Then, once you&#39;ve voted (and it is locked and unchangeable), the username of the comment/post would be revealed to you (while you are logged in). Furthermore, anyone not logged in will not see usernames at all.</p>

<p>In order to identify users in comment threads prior to voting, usernames would be replaced with incrementally numbered &quot;name-place-holders&quot;</p>

<p>So, for example...</p>

<p>You, 9000sins, post a submission. To non-logged-in users and to users who are logged in, but have not voted yet, It would simply show the username &quot;redditor0&quot;. And, every comment you make under that submission would also identify you simply as &quot;redditor0&quot;. Subsequent commenters would be identified as &quot;redditor1&quot; (2, 3, etc.) in the order in which they add their comments. So... if I&#39;m the first person to comment on your submission, I would be identified (to non-logged-in users and to logged-in-users who haven&#39;t voted on MY comment) as &quot;redditor1&quot; for every comment I make in under that submission. </p>

<p>Under someone else&#39;s submission, I might become &quot;redditor42&quot; (or whatever number was next when I added my first comment to that submission).</p>

<p>The problem I see is that someone could upvote one comment in order to identify a user (throughout an entire post), then downvote every other comment made by that user. So, it&#39;s not perfect (yet). I&#39;m still thinking it through.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Anyway, back to the gawker thing. Has there been any comments about the duration of the boycott? If there is no duration (e.g., until an apology is issued or an article retracted or whatever), then I&#39;m opposed to joining the boycott, because it appears to be potentially permanent censorship.</p>

<p>I also agree with many aspects of all sides of this issue, for what it&#39;s worth.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>VA should have known this was a potential. </p></li>
<li><p>VA was &quot;putting himself at risk&quot; the whole time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>However,...</p>

<ul>
<li>gawker crossed the line (anonymous does this to gov&#39;t officials and reddit throws a fit over it - banning the links and stuff, because it&#39;s a violation of policy to reveal personal information).</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m a strong advocate for anonymity and I think what gawker did was reprehensible. But, I also understand that the internet is no longer anonymous - TPTB have access to <strong>everything</strong>.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a sad reflection on the state of the internet and social media, but I also think it holds a great deal of potential to bring about important change for the better (if we, for example, downvote every gawker post, rather than clicking through to the ad revenue). It can also give reddit a chance to review their own activities (ref: sunshine-x&#39;s 10.x issue).</p>
