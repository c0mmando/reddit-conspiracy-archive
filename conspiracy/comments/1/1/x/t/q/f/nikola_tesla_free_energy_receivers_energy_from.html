        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Well, too much spare time so I thought I could already post this... For all I know, Nikola Tesla harnessed the cosmic rays and caused them to operate a device, thus getting energy from the sky. The schematic that is known already by many people is a simple one: four diodes connected in series, wired to an isolated aluminium plate put high up in the sky (the bigger and higher the better), to a 220 uF and a tension of 25V capacitor, and to a copper bar grounded as deep as possible.
I have made myself a circuit plan, which can be used as a radiant-energy phone charger. I have put a pic for y&#39;all to see. It&#39;s a nice project, which has been suppresed for all I heard, but an innovative idea. Have fun..</p>

<p>You can build the simple circuit by OP and extract energy from it.  If that&#39;s not proof then what is ? </p>

<p>Hint: with a little bit of capacitor conditioning (like Stan Meyer Water Fuel Cells) the voltage ramp up will be quite a bit faster and stronger because capacitors need to be adapted to radiant charging. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was I making noise and using foul language? Disappear? Conspiratard?</p>

<p>Wow, that&#39;s almost all the classic conspiracy tricks to discredit someone in a conversation. Why not call me a shill and a zionist while you&#39;re at it? My point was that for the hundreds upon hundreds of videos and claims of the title of &#39;mastering free energy&#39; it&#39;s still a dream. I see the same types of videos over and over. Some guy puttering about in his garage/workshop with magnets, coils and other various gadgets. And they all have one thing in common. Well, one major thing. None of them have any kind of education in the field. Nobody is a chemist, an electrical engineer but somehow they magically figured out a way to solve the world&#39;s energy problems in their garage? And when prompted to demonstrate/repeat their construction in front of actual researchers and engineers, they turn evasive.</p>

<p>So yeah, I&#39;m going to remain skeptical until such a time arrives that &#39;free energy&#39; is something tangible and not just in the domain of scammers and hustlers working out of their garage.</p>

<p>Is it so hard to come up with an answer to simple devices and experimental proof ? </p>

<p>And where did you get the idea that energy will make you millions ? It&#39;s available for free everywhere. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFVCst1bdds">Tariel Kapanadze FULL VIDEO invented a 5 kilowatt free energy generator </a></p>

<p>&quot;A Georgia Republic inventor, Tariel Kapanadze, claims to have invented a 5 kilowatt free energy generator. In a demonstration video, the device appears to produce copious amounts of energy from no visible source.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The components apparently include a radiator buried in the ground, a wire to a water pipe, a Tesla coil/joule thief, a spark gap, transformer, capacitors, 5 ferrite cores from old TV HV transformers, and some other unidentified components.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so lets take this slowly since you seem to not understand me.</p>

<p>I remain skeptical because:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Scammers and hustlers have been making extraordinary claims about free energy/perpetual machines for hundreds of years.</li>
<li>2. All of these supposed revolutionary inventions have not passed official inspection and/or suddenly disappear/break down when someone comes to check it out.</li>
<li>3. If it&#39;s free, why are &#39;inventors&#39; keeping their machines/components secret and not publicly verifiable?</li>
</ul>

<p>And don&#39;t patronize me and think I will sit through a 1 hour video in russian about some supposed energy device. The first thing they do is bury it in the ground, seriously! Then we&#39;re just going to take their word for it that they are really testing their stuff on the thing they just buried in the ground? Come ON!</p>

<p>And you still haven&#39;t answered if you power your electrical devices at home with your verified and proven technology that you yourself claimed to have.</p>

<p>I&#39;m waiting.</p>

<p>(I&#39;m not saying this technology is impossible, but what I <em>am</em> saying is that I am <em>very</em> skeptical that garage-joe-shmoe stumbles onto it without any kind of education what so ever. It&#39;s like I would suddenly claim to have written a mathematical proof for P=NP without any kind of mathematical background. It&#39;s absurd.)</p>

<p>From this statement we can deduce that you speak Russian and have a background as an electrical engineer. You&#39;re also able to verify the events that take place during the video you linked. Is this correct?</p>

<p>Know-it-all? I said I was skeptical and there are tons of scammers/grifters that love to use the &#39;free energy&#39; ploy. And no, I don&#39;t usually build circuits because that&#39;s not one of my hobbies.</p>

<p><strong>Are you using your schematics and proven technology to power anything substantial in your home?</strong></p>

<p>If you want to keep insulting me and any skeptics of &#39;free energy&#39; technology it is your right to do so, but atleast try to acknowledge the fact that the balance of historically proven fraudsters to legitimate researchers/inventors tips in the favor of the conmen and snake-oil salesmen.

<p>There are threaded copper ground rods that allow coupling. There are also ground rod testers.  If that doesn&#39;t work you can drill a well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the circuit with the aluminium foil (I used only aluminium foil as at that moment I couldn&#39;t get an aluminium plate large enough) working. I got only 4 volts with it, since I used foil instead of plate and it wasn&#39;t even big, just large enough to test it.. but even in this manner, i got it to work. I only wanted to test it back then.
