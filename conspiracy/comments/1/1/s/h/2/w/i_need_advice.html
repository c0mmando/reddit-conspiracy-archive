        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, so I&#39;m a 16 year old kid, and I need some advice. I know that some of you are probably going to immediatley disregard this post because I&#39;m too &quot;young&quot; to understand this kind of information, but I know quite a lot about how corrupt America is. I know all about 9/11, JFK, Illuminati, the music industry, how America&#39;s trying to invade Iran, vaccinations, the &quot;terror&quot; attempt on the Federal Reserve, and many more. The point of this post is to ask the open-minded people of r/conspiracy about how I am supposed to keep living the rest of my teenage days without feeling like a &quot;crazy&quot; person. Everytime I hang out with my friends they always blast that new rap shit that constantly sings about &quot;fucking bitches&quot; they are just horribly blinded from the truth. Everytime I say something that isn&#39;t mainstream they freak out. An example would be Maijuana, they say &quot;It&#39;s horrible for you&quot; and I say to them how it&#39;s actually good for you for many reasons. I try to tell them how they&#39;re being mislead by the government in the most respectable way possible, but they just laugh and call me an idiot. I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s anyone else out there that&#39;s going through the same type of things I&#39;m going through, and if there is I would like to have some tips on how to deal with this. I live in a very small town, so it&#39;s not like I can just make new friends. Anyways, I hope I get some advice from somebody on here. Thanks for taking the time to read this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All you can do is be yourself and keep faith in what you know but don&#39;t let the information get to you, try to lead a normal life -whatever that is. At your age it is important to integrate with other people so don&#39;t let your interests overwhelm you. There is plenty of good music, films and even television programs for you to enjoy that can help you maintain a social veneer so to speak, just choose the things you like and not what is &#39;fashionable&#39; Keep away from the shit and choose your moments wisely if you want to inform people, less is more sometimes.</p>

<p>You&#39;re 16, enjoy yourself. Treat your research as a hobby, not a lifestyle choice otherwise you could easily alienate yourself.</p>

<p>Be aware, keep reading and keep searching. Just don&#39;t let it dictate your life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 25 so I&#39;m not sure how much sway my opinion will hold. Stay informed, don&#39;t conform to the mass produced media zombies of your generation, choose one of your friends that you would deem to have an open mind and show him what you have learned, start small and work your way up, you&#39;re in a position to help the people you know avoid the mistakes of my generation and my parents generation/their parents, by not paying attention or refusing to open ones eyes, the evidence is all around you and if it was obvious to you then perhaps one day it will be obvious to them also. I&#39;m canadian, I have great friends, I build houses and i believe in the coming shift, and so should you. Pro tip - Don&#39;t bring up conspiracies at parties, they are a major bring down :P unless you see a group of chill stoners talking shit about the establishment of course.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Find a hobby that you enjoy and can do by yourself. I don&#39;t associate with people that aren&#39;t open minded.. which means I don&#39;t have many friends at all. I don&#39;t see the point in having friends that don&#39;t share similar interests and especially ones that call you an idiot - &quot;conspiracies&quot; aside, they aren&#39;t good friends and I would suggest distancing yourself from them.</p>

<p>If you really need people to talk to, make some internet friends with the same mind set as you who you can discuss these things with without fear of being judged. You&#39;ll be better off.</p>

<p>I sometimes think to myself, man, I must be a loser, I don&#39;t have any friends. But you know what, that is what society wants us to think. We&#39;re not alone in our thinking, and we&#39;re not the losers...the people that are asleep are the losers, and they don&#39;t even know it.</p>

<p>Anyways, the best thing to do is find any open minded people you can and then slowly introduce them to things they don&#39;t know - if having friends is really that important to you.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry about what other people think, again society tells you to. If people think you&#39;re crazy, so what. At least you&#39;re ahead of the game.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My best advice is don&#39;t for one second be certain about what you belief. You think you&#39;re right, of course you do, we all do. But realise that so does literally everyone around you, and to them, you&#39;re the one blinded to the truth. </p>

<p>Remember that what you might think is trying to tell them the truth, they may see as preaching, so always try to approach those kinds of issues with caution. </p>

<p>As for them calling you an idiot, that&#39;s just not respectful, ask them, no, <strong>tell</strong> them to treat you with respect even if they disagree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be proud of yourself for being a sophisticated young thinking awake person.  Pick and choose your moments to bring up your &quot;radical&quot; opinions on issues.  And remember making people feel stupid is not going to change their mind or make them see the light.  So be extremely patient with those that you love.  It may take a while to bring them around to even just accepting your views.  Some may never.  The matrix is a powerful thing to contend with and I am afraid that most folks will never break from its powerful grip on their minds,</p>

<p>Realize they are as ignorant as we all were at some point and adapt your approach- don&#39;t tell them how things are, ask questions to debate and expand upon. Plant seeds. </p>

<p>People go through the five stages in &quot;waking up&quot;, you&#39;re ahead of the game regardless of the stage you&#39;re currently in, your friends are not, so keep that in mind.

    <div class="md"><p>You can take it seriously, but dont expect others to aswell. As a critically-thinking person, it took huge quantities of information and evidence being presented to you in order to shape your opinions on the subject. Quantities of information you&#39;re not likely to be carrying around with you at a given moment. Fact is, if some other kid your age started telling you all this stuff without context, you might have trouble believing it too. Pick one or two easy to  remember key words for a topic you care about, and tell them to google it. They&#39;ll likely be just as shocked as you and to might find they come back to discuss it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t bother trying to tell people what you know. It&#39;s not that its necessarily wrong or crazy, but you cant just up and tell someone that the exact opposite of most things they believe (pot, government, 9/11) is the actual truth and just have them accept it. Unfortunately it takes a particular type of person to be able to consider their own beliefs as having the potential to be wrong.  If asked, everyone would say they have an open mind, but how many truly do?  More these days, I would suspect, but there is still a disappoinntingly large collection of people who cannot accept a different belief to save their lives, regarldess of evidence.  Denial is often the stance of these types. Perhaps its just experience over the years, but I think you can usually tell pretty quickly who have this capability of questioning, and who will reject the reality of the situation.  These people are typically very shallow minded and its not uncommon that they be selfish and easily distractable or any combination... and I mean that in the least insulting way possible.  There is no easy way to influence these types of people unless you take it in very slow steps. You need to give them the idea in tiny pieces of information, and try and get them to feed it themselves. If you just tell them everything they wont get iit and youll be their weird friend, but if you give them a teaser like, &quot;Hey, did you know that Fukishima might explode because the reactors building is threatening to collapse?&quot; or &quot;did you see that vid of Nibiru being visible next to the Sun?&quot; Maybe they will check things out for themselves.  In a lot of cases you can&#39;t just up and inform people, so think hard before you start trying. You need to make them want to find out for themselves. Sometimes is possible, a lot of times its not.  But at least you&#39;re going to have an easy way of finding out who your close friends will be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alas, I&#39;ve only got but one feel to give. I wasn&#39;t very popular in highschool but I definitely didn&#39;t have the distance of view you do at that age. I can&#39;t imagine what it must be like to see through not only the shallow walls of highschool but also through the american dream while everyone around you is either still acting like a kid or reciting the pledge at the beginning of the day without ever considering what it means. </p>

<p>It is lonely no matter what and probably doubly so, being so young. Try to stay positive, try to engage people if they seem open to these types of conversations. The best bit of advice I can think of is to try to make peace with feeling alone and thinking differently than most people. Sometimes I daydream I&#39;m from another planet and then it almost feels like it makes sense. Good luck man. </p>

Dont bombard them with all the conspiracies you know because you will end up being a social outcast (not a bad thing [actually good it is infact the social outcast you need to make friends with because they are actually the most open mindes people.]) but you should enjoy your last two years because you wont get life that easy again.

<p>Some just don&#39;t want to listen, don&#39;t go tug-of-war with them, instead try and inform those who want to listen.  Just a small heads up, there are people who talk, and there are people who listen; from my experience, the ones who listen are better friends.</p>
