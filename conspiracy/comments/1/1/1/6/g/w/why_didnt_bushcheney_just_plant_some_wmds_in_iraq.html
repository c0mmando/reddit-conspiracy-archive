    <div class="md"><p>They were hoping there would still be some WMDs left from when Rumsfeld and friends sold them some in the 1980s.  </p>

<p>The remaining WMDs were destroyed by ground troops in Gulf War 1.  There was a documentary that went into the details of that talking about how the crates had countries of origin printed on them.  Some were from France and other European countries and some were from the US.  They speculate that the weapons stores were destroyed to hide evidence.  </p>

<p>The explosions rained down the residue from the chemical weapons for miles killing many soldiers - even ones equipped with hazmat suits.  </p>

Since they had to back pack everything into northern Iraq early on, it was $100 bills. Everything cost $100. From intelligence to coffee and cars.

    <div class="md"><p>Because it wasn&#39;t necessary to achieve his goals.  He wanted to destabilize the region and give reasonable belief that Saddam was creating/exploring the creation of WMD&#39;s.  He accomplished that tenfold, and was able to garner enough support to remove Saddam under the premise that they might exist, even after months (years?) of NATO searches coming up empty.  </p>

<p>Why put yourself at risk of being found-out when you can simply use your propaganda machines (mainstream media) to shape the opinions and beliefs of the public into whatever you want?  That was the point of 9/11, after all - to convince the public that people wanted to kill us.  When we were able to give reasonable suspicion that Saddam was one of those people that wanted to kill us, it was easy to do literally whatever the fuck we wanted from that point on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interestingly enough....I knew an EOD tech that was in Iraq when it all kicked off. He said they did have some, but it wasn&#39;t very much...and most of them were either destroyed or not in working order.(e.g. leaky chemical weapons)  They of course disposed of what little was left of it.</p>

<p>Now I imagine showing those on TV really wouldn&#39;t have gotten the desired effect.</p>

<p>EDIT: And really to the average American WMD is kind of a subjective thing. You could produce some photos of a few RPGs and mortars, with the wrong fuses screwed in, that don&#39;t even work and people would think you were showing them WMDs.</p>

<p>Also, imagine the kind of havoc we wreaked with these: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1QvyodEwg0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1QvyodEwg0</a>

It just wouldn&#39;t have worked, it would have been too complex and all they wanted to have is pretext, not context.</p>

<p>You got to understand that it was much easier to falsify a story about WMD&#39;s and &quot;throwing babies out of incubators&quot; than to transport a nuclear bomb to Iraq.</p>
