    <div class="md"><p>You apparently don&#39;t realize that TPTB are so unbelievably arrogant and hubristic that they often openly mock the shit out of the 99% by waving the truth right in front of their/our faces saying &quot;Ha.  See?  You&#39;re so fucking stupid and indoctrinated that we can tell you the truth right to your stupid, filthy face - that we&#39;re using you, that we&#39;re killing you, that we&#39;re making you our fodder, that you&#39;re nothing but an expendable nothing -  and you still won&#39;t be smart enough to <em>get</em> it and figure it out. lol&quot;</p>

<p>Also, the world and the machinations of control and manipulation therein are very complicated.  This means that within the constructs of power, there are always those few individuals in the upper echelons that - here and there in sometimes discreet and other times not so discreet manners - actually <em>try</em> to truthfully inform the masses of dumb sheeple.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a <em>massive</em> uphill climb, however, and posters like you tend to give a good indication as to why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  You weren&#39;t being awesome - and using the word Sheeple won&#39;t make you anymore awesome one way or the other.  Your use of attempted wit shows that you are more intent upon childish antics like looking cool in how you say things than actually intelligently figuring things out.</p>

<p>Again, things are complicated.  You might figure that out if you stopped trying to sound smart or whatever it is you&#39;re trying to sound like.  The paradox is that the harder you try, the less like it you look.</p>

<p>lol.  That&#39;s exactly what an emo hipster that wants to be cool would say. :)  Good job.</p>

<p>No.  It&#39;s more complex than that.  Regardless, however, nothing about the movie indicates that there&#39;s no NWO.  Additionally, I&#39;m not necessarily saying that WTD <em>is</em> an attempt by some members of the elite to &quot;warn the masses&quot;.  What I <em>am</em> saying is...well, what I already said:  That those members <em>do</em> seem to exist, and anyone would be remiss to think or assume otherwise.</p>

<p>Anyway, go back to your cool stuff, emo boy.  Nothing to see here.</p>

<p>First of all I&#39;m not asking you to do anything but stop trying to &quot;sound&quot; cool and pay focused attention to real shit.  Second of all, that you say it&#39;s conjecture simply because I didn&#39;t give you the mountain-sized wall of references that exists - the mountain-sized wall that you and people like you would likely find some sort of manner to, somehow, still not understand as valid - is pure and unadulterated ignorance.</p>

<p>Yeah.  And that&#39;s all one needs to know to understand that literally <em>every</em> single comment you&#39;ve posted on this thread has some sort of attempt at wit or sarcasm.  This is almost always - consciously or subconsciously - nothing more than an attempt on the subject&#39;s part to mask the turd of what little point they might actually have with the distracting perfume of attempted wit or faux intelligence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s, unfortunately, pretty glaring in your case.</p>

<p>No, man.  Occasional wit and even sarcasm aren&#39;t a horrible thing in and of themselves.  However, it&#39;s just that - as I mentioned - if one uses it too much or at the wrong times, etc, it easily ends up as a crutch that limply props up a feeble intellect more than anything else.  No one&#39;s saying one should always be some sort of sourpuss curmudgeon, but taking a serious, sober look at issues and comments made by people can really go a long way in helping one understand the world and themselves <em>much</em> better than would ever otherwise be the case.</p>
