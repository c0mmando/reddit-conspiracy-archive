       I was a kid when this movie came out and I didn't really get how this worked. I thought there was no way it was possible. That the people would see through the lies. That the government wouldn't even be tempted to risk such big lies. Now that I'm fully grown and aware of the true state of things, I'm really curious to go back and watch it.

       Insane how they can make movies that depict the truth, but people can simply write it off as entertainment.

       Want to see a movie which predicted the future of fucked up TV (the way TV is today)? Watch
       <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/">
        Network
       </a>

       The saddest part is how they tell us everything... and then it comes to be.. similar to how

        Ike warned us about the MIC
       </a>
       .... then voila... there it is, doing exactly what he warned about.

       Network was cool. The scene where that fat man explains how corporations work and own everyone was very awesome, and reminded me of Brave New World. I think it's true too, countries are owned by companies of which we are just the workers.

       You apparently don't realize that TPTB are so unbelievably arrogant and hubristic that they often openly mock the shit out of the 99% by waving the truth right in front of their/our faces saying "Ha.  See?  You're so fucking stupid and indoctrinated that we can tell you the truth right to your stupid, filthy face - that we're using you, that we're killing you, that we're making you our fodder, that you're nothing but an expendable nothing -  and you still won't be smart enough to
       <em>
        get
       </em>
       it and figure it out. lol"
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the world and the machinations of control and manipulation therein are very complicated.  This means that within the constructs of power, there are always those few individuals in the upper echelons that - here and there in sometimes discreet and other times not so discreet manners - actually
       <em>
        try
       </em>
       to truthfully inform the masses of dumb sheeple.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a
       <em>
        massive
       </em>
       uphill climb, however, and posters like you tend to give a good indication as to why.

       No.  You weren't being awesome - and using the word Sheeple won't make you anymore awesome one way or the other.  Your use of attempted wit shows that you are more intent upon childish antics like looking cool in how you say things than actually intelligently figuring things out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, things are complicated.  You might figure that out if you stopped trying to sound smart or whatever it is you're trying to sound like.  The paradox is that the harder you try, the less like it you look.

       If I cared about looking cool, the last place I'd be is Reddit! Anyway, are you saying that "Wag the Dog" exists as a way for TPTB to wave the legit Matrix in our faces so we still think there's totally no NWO? Like when Count Dooku told Obi-Wan Kenobi the truth that Palpatine was a Sith lord, because he knew Obi-Wan wouldn't believe him? NO1113 YOU GENIUS! Anyway now I'm gonna go watch "Attack of the Clones" again... or listen to one of my TBTBT albums.

      <p>
       No.  It's more complex than that.  Regardless, however, nothing about the movie indicates that there's no NWO.  Additionally, I'm not necessarily saying that WTD
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       an attempt by some members of the elite to "warn the masses".  What I
       <em>

       saying is...well, what I already said:  That those members

       seem to exist, and anyone would be remiss to think or assume otherwise.

       First of all I'm not asking you to do anything but stop trying to "sound" cool and pay focused attention to real shit.  Second of all, that you say it's conjecture simply because I didn't give you the mountain-sized wall of references that exists - the mountain-sized wall that you and people like you would likely find some sort of manner to, somehow, still not understand as valid - is pure and unadulterated ignorance.

       You keep bringing up the word "cool." Why do you think I'm so cool? All you know about me is that I post on Reddit - and that is really uncool!

       Yeah.  And that's all one needs to know to understand that literally
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       single comment you've posted on this thread has some sort of attempt at wit or sarcasm.  This is almost always - consciously or subconsciously - nothing more than an attempt on the subject's part to mask the turd of what little point they might actually have with the distracting perfume of attempted wit or faux intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's, unfortunately, pretty glaring in your case.

       No, man.  Occasional wit and even sarcasm aren't a horrible thing in and of themselves.  However, it's just that - as I mentioned - if one uses it too much or at the wrong times, etc, it easily ends up as a crutch that limply props up a feeble intellect more than anything else.  No one's saying one should always be some sort of sourpuss curmudgeon, but taking a serious, sober look at issues and comments made by people can really go a long way in helping one understand the world and themselves
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       better than would ever otherwise be the case.

       Good point.  Some people are
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       entirely stupid, however, that it's difficult to not feed the trolls.  I'm sure some feel the same about me - even though I literally
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       troll.  I might often be an asshole - sure - but I don't troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good point, however, and thank you for coming on here and pointing this out.  The post above I was thinking about making my last anyway, but - again - thank you for coming on here and mediating.  Good on you.

       I hear what you're saying, StartSelect, but I'm actually learning a lot - about how to be cool, awesome, and "emo" (though I'm not sure if that's still a word people really say), and also how to accept unprovable theories as facts (better to fit in here, and at church!). "no1113" is helping me a ton!

       Okay, so, stop being totally rad, and start taking strangers on the internet totally seriously. Got it. But when should I call people "emo hipsters"? Just when they post hilarious jokes, or also when they don't automatically believe anonymously-posted conjecture? (is that what "trying to be cool" is?)
