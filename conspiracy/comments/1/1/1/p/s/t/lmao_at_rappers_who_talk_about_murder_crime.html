       WAG THE DOG all over again.  Logically, the people who are making rap songs, rap videos about selling drugs, murder etc etc...They do it in a way where the message is that they really are authentic and have done it.  With that said, how the fuck is this not considered a "hot boy" move?  These are all fucking liars and people eat it up thinking its real.  Who the hell commits SERIOUS crimes, and then makes videos/songs promoting it and trying to make money off it.

       Disagree. They are telling stories for the purpose of entertainment, but a lot of the big names CERTAINLY have a past in drug manufacturing, distribution, or direct sales. A lot of these guys come from small communities where their crew's history in drugs and violence is easy to find out. Rick Ross on the other hand is totally fabricated. He stole his identity from a guy who was incarcerated in the jail Rick worked at.Whoops. Also: there is a history of this sort of glorification of vice in music. See: Sicilian Cosa Nostra music or Mexican Narcocorrido.

       Tom cruise is a actor, he gets in character for his roles.  When he's not working a role he is just Tom Cruise.  Entertainers have a persona to keep up, theres no end to their "role" as and entertainer.  Again where is the conspiracy you are looking for?

       They do this to brainwash the black youth into becoming gangsta types.  Public Enemy was anti-govt anti-NWO and they basically got run out becuase of groups like the aptly named gangsta rap group NWA, look at where all the members of NWA are now.  BIG money.  White people deal drugs and shoot people too but you don't see rock bands on a mass scale glorifying it.  I am a musician, I've toured the US coast to coast, the punk scene especially has been molded the past 15 years or so into being less about "fuck the man" into more of "fuck the world" its all by design. Popular music is being dumbed down to a great extent because they cannot have people thinking outside the "box"

       The CIA at one point shovelled money to artists like Andy Warhol to change the focus of the art world from representational art, which has often historically had a political element, to abstract and conceptual art, which is traditionally apolitical. The powers that be do have an interest in cultural engineering and it wouldn't be surprising if they promoted gangsta rap for this purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another interesting thing about the rap world: watch who gets arrested for weapons/drug charges and who the changes stick to. If the charges don't seem to stick (Snoop Dog for example), then you're likely looking at a state asset.

       Art should always have a point, which is why I abhor abstract art.  A lot of musicians have been able to bury meaning in their music.  A lot of musicians have also been able to bury pro-New World Order type themes in their music as well, those are usually the artists that get promoted the most unfortunately.  When you listen to pop music especially today some of it is so mindless and some people
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       listen to that kind of shit, if you try and show them good music with messages or even deep meanings like David Bowie(who I believe was publicly ridiculed for having anti-NWO songs) they will scoff and be like that shit is stupid.  I have so many "friends" with that mindset it is sickening.

       Pop music is the ideal form of propaganda: omnipresent, easy to dismiss, and "glamorous". The perfect medium from which to promote an attitude of mercenary, hedonistic nihilism.

       Pop music and college education.  College because you pay for the information you are told, therefore you hold onto it much tighter.  The whole "green" agenda is being propagated through the college system.  It is literally the NWO in disguise.  They get all the liberals to sign up and voluntarily agree to the terms of the New World Government and New World Green Religion.  It is genius on their part.  Bad for us however.

       because then it would be pointless. The point of art is to convey a point or an idea through subtle or very obvious means, sometimes
       <em>
        both.

       Acting can be an art, drawing, painting, music, etc.  Find me some good art with no meaning.  Find me

       that would be a meaning. If the purpose is to have something pretty for your eyes, that would be the meaning.  Classical music didn't necessarily have an "interpretation" it was just a collection of pretty sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poetry however usually has a meaning, good poetry has several layers of meanings, good musicians write good lyrics with several layers of meanings, a good example of this would be the band They Might Be Giants.  Almost all of their songs have a surface level meaning, a deeper meaning, and then also a super deep meaning that ties in with the rest of the album's super deep meaning.  Most people however when listening to their music don't get past the surface meaning, because they've never thought of looking deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Herein lies the problem.  When people stop looking for deeper meaning in anything, that is why good, deep art is important.  When they push shit with next to no meaning in the mainstream,
       <em>
        constantly
       </em>
       , it is a bad thing.  This is literally the first decade where that has really began.  Mainstream music from the 90s on back was almost all deep, meaningful music.  A good example of this is David Bowie, his songs have surface meaning and when you really examine them, they have underlying meanings, and when you examine whole albums of his, the whole album will have a main theme and all the songs on the album will have an even deeper meaning.  I could go into it but it would literally be a wall of text.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talent is going bye bye on the mainstream level of media.  Most pop artists just sing and dance but don't actually have anything to do with the songwriting process, television is being bombarded with "reality" stars that are famous for
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       other than being on a "reality" show.  They are eliminating the good artists from high up positions in art.  That is what I am getting at.  It's being dumbed down ON PURPOSE, its part of the plan dude.  It
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       to happen in order to bring in the NWO, people can't be thinkers, only followers.
      </p>
      <p>

       Glam metal bands had meaning wtf, they all did, most of them were satanists, they were trying to get people into that kind of lifestyle.  A lot of them were Crowley/Golden Dawn followers.  Look at some glam band lyrics.  Shit, Bowie is one of the first glam rockers there was!  You might be one of the slow ones that doesn't actually understand how poetry works on several levels, that's okay though.

       There is no evil "they" in hip-hop. Lots of artists start out by selling cds out of their trunk. Sometimes a big label picks them up, but the only master they answer to is $$$. The labels go with what they think is going to sell, and take a gamble. Supply and demand. Music has dumbed down over the past few years which I think is as much a result of television's dumbing down (reality and game show culture). Music sorta had to follow suit. That said, the independent world of music is experiencing new levels of popularity, and the definition of pop could be in for another shift.

       Major labels are owned and operated by the same people who own and operate major media, they have an agenda.  They
       <em>
        tell you
       </em>
       what is popular.  Even 2pac, who was a big player in the "gangsta rap" movement said that it was social engineers who pushed that type of music to change the black culture.  To keep them dumbed down.  Study up boy.  I was a touring musician for several years in a punk band, we saw the hierarchy in the industry, we met a lot of big name punk industry people, I partied with the owner of No Idea records who is like one of the godfathers of modern punk, he even told us there was an agenda to who got big and who didn't.

       I know folks way higher up the chain than Var. Been at the music game for 20+ years. My point is, the major labels are failing. I know people they've signed, and I'm seeing what's getting bigger in the independent sense. Last few years of the Grammys yielded massive wins for true indie artists: Arcade Fire, Adele &amp; Bon Iver. If there was a huge conspiracy, why would your supposed "powers-that-be" let the indies slip through the cracks? Their agenda is money. If you'd ever met an actual A&amp;R person from a major label, you'd know any conspiracy about them is a total joke.

       You think Arcade Fire, Adele and Bon Iver are indie artists? LOL! just because they "sound" indie, doesn't make them indie.  Those acts are all on major labels or on major label subsidiaries.  Major labels are not in decline, they are bigger than ever they just know how to market to the "indie" crowd now to get people like you to think that Adele is "indie" haha!  They push acts that promote their causes.  Arcade Fire is a good band, I am not going to deny it, Neon Bible was definitely an anti-NWO album.  I've met a lot of A&amp;R types, they are not the big boys, they just look for sellable acts.

       I'm done with the battle as you have proven yourself hilarious. Their labels are indies. Example: Arcade Fire's records are put out by Mac from Superchunk who owns Merge. The same guy who just started a movement to turn North Carolina from a red state to a blue state. CONSPIRACY!

       The USD currency, powered by the petrodollar scam, allows the US to have a ridiculously overfunded military and a ridiculously overfunded propaganda wing. Random fun fact: Arnon Milchan produced Oliver Stone's JFK documentary, most likely having a say in the film's content, and also helped smuggle US nuclear tech to Israel.

       Your looking at it from the wrong angle. The thug life style, the violent gangsters, drug slingers, etc, that's all a marketing ploy that came from record labels. Keep the dumb ones fighting as drug king pins, fill the prisons, keep the streets violent so police get more funding. Yes they are entertainers playing puppets for a narrative from the record labels. That is about as conspiracy as it gets in this. If you went into kanye as illuminati or something is the only way it goes any deeper.

       I don't see rappers as actors, more storytellers than anything. Yes there are some phonies that celebrate the criminal lifestyle but that's just the nature of the business. But there are some that use their positions to teach and hand down wisdom; those are the ones that go largely ignored as most people would rather hear a materialistic message.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at some point responsibility falls into the hands of the individual, who can choose a life of crime, perhaps nurtured by consumed media, or not. Throwing around blame is not the way to go about things.

       If you think of rap like that, I think you need to learn about how hip hop got started. Sure there are some fakers but there are definitely MCs that have gone through a lot of that shit...

      <p>
       Also I find it interesting that you mentioned Jay Z when he recently wrote a book about his past life as a drug dealer and how he became a rapper... And why would you cite TI when he just recently got out of jail... Were they just tricking us and he didnt really go to jail? He was just in Cuba with 2pac, right? RIGHT?!

       I know folks way higher up the chain than Var. Been at the music game for 20+ years. My point is, the major labels are failing. I know people they've signed, and I'm seeing what's getting bigger in the independent sense. Last few years of the Grammys yielded massive wins for true indie artists: Arcade Fire, Adele &amp; Bon Iver. If there was a huge conspiracy, why would your supposed "powers-that-be" let the indies slip through the cracks? Their agenda is money. If you'd ever met an actual A&amp;R person from a major label, you'd know any conspiracy about them is a total joke.

       that would be a meaning. If the purpose is to have something pretty for your eyes, that would be the meaning.  Classical music didn't necessarily have an "interpretation" it was just a collection of pretty sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poetry however usually has a meaning, good poetry has several layers of meanings, good musicians write good lyrics with several layers of meanings, a good example of this would be the band They Might Be Giants.  Almost all of their songs have a surface level meaning, a deeper meaning, and then also a super deep meaning that ties in with the rest of the album's super deep meaning.  Most people however when listening to their music don't get past the surface meaning, because they've never thought of looking deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Herein lies the problem.  When people stop looking for deeper meaning in anything, that is why good, deep art is important.  When they push shit with next to no meaning in the mainstream,
       <em>
        constantly
       </em>
       , it is a bad thing.  This is literally the first decade where that has really began.  Mainstream music from the 90s on back was almost all deep, meaningful music.  A good example of this is David Bowie, his songs have surface meaning and when you really examine them, they have underlying meanings, and when you examine whole albums of his, the whole album will have a main theme and all the songs on the album will have an even deeper meaning.  I could go into it but it would literally be a wall of text.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talent is going bye bye on the mainstream level of media.  Most pop artists just sing and dance but don't actually have anything to do with the songwriting process, television is being bombarded with "reality" stars that are famous for
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       other than being on a "reality" show.  They are eliminating the good artists from high up positions in art.  That is what I am getting at.  It's being dumbed down ON PURPOSE, its part of the plan dude.  It
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       to happen in order to bring in the NWO, people can't be thinkers, only followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try showing anyone who listens to mainstream music an old 70s record and count the seconds before they whip out their phone and headphones and start listening to something in their "comfort zone".
