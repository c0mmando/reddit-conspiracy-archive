        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>About 2 weeks ago my mom called me to see if I had a bug out plan, which is interesting because we have never talked about anything like this. We have discussed politics, religion and various other issues, but nothing along the lines of &quot;What do we do if the shit hits the fan?&quot; </p>

<p>Her reasoning behind this is that her best friend of 37 years called her and said that her daughter and son-in-law were called into a private meeting on base regarding a probable evacuation scenario of the East Coast. 
(Son-in-law is in the Special Forces, apparently high up. I think the base was Ft. McPhearson in Georgia). </p>

<p>From what she said, the daughter and SIL where brought in and made to sign a non-disclosure agreement saying they would tell no one, under the penalty of treason, what they were told during the meeting.
They were told that in 4-6 weeks (this was around 9/20) the East Coast would experience some type of disaster that would cause it to be under water. They were also told to make a go bag and be prepared to leave at a moments notice. </p>

<p>That is about all I have. This does come from someone I trust, and someone who trusts her daughter and son-in-law. I don&#39;t see any reason for them to make it up or freak out over a routine or drill. From what my moms friend says the military does not do these types of drills without warning everyone that it is just a drill. She has been married to a military man for 20 years. </p>

<p>On a seperate note, one of my best friends brother who is in the Special Forces went AWOL about 2 weeks ago. Went home to see his family in Texas then disappeared.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s about it. Has anyone heard anything along these lines? I have read that the east coast is in for one hell of a winter, but that&#39;s all I have heard. </p>

<p>Thoughts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im actually from Australia, I know what I&#39;m talking about when it comes to cyclone//hurricanes. the simple fact is that I don&#39;t think that the east coast ever constructed their buildings with this type of disaster in mind (and why would they? It was a freak of nature). I know in Australia, all houses and buildings are constricted to cyclone standard now, meaning all new houses are designed with these &#39;what if&#39; situations in mind. Maybe New York need to look at implementing similar design standards</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the comment above was Just World Bias crap - blaming victims because it must be their fault somehow if something bad happens to them.  It makes a person feel superior and it&#39;s reassuring to think, &quot;These things can&#39;t happen to me - <em>I</em> am safe because <em>I</em> am a good person and make good decisions.&quot;  </p>

<p>There&#39;s not a lot of <em>new</em> construction happening in NY, so even if you decided to enact standards to put the whole city up on stilts or whatever, that&#39;s not going to happen any time soon in neighborhoods with densely packed $500,000-$1,000,000 homes - not to mention the skyscrapers in lower Manhattan.  And there&#39;s not a lot any construction can do about 5-10 feet of flowing salt water.  Deaths also happened from trees falling through the roofs, electrical wires, people on life support dying when the power and backup power was lost.  My point was when people outside the situation look at the destruction and death count and think, &quot;Why don&#39;t those idiots just <em>build stronger houses</em>?&quot; that kind of judgment is baseless and fucking ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well spotted, and I recall seeing the original article this came from at some point, but I notice it says &quot;<em>If</em> the volcano collapsed in one block of almost 20 cubic kilometres of rock,...&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently current thinking is that it will crumble gradually in a series of landslides. Let&#39;s hope they&#39;re correct.</p>

<p>EDIT - I&#39;ve just investigated further thanks to your link. The Author also wrote &quot;The Cassandra Prophecy: Armageddon Approaches&quot; in 1999.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using the secrets of numerology contained in the books of Daniel, the Old Testament prophet, and the Revelation of St John the Divine, this work reveals the Bible&#39;s greatest secret - Judgement Day. The conclusion of this revelation is that mankind&#39;s destiny has already been decided. The author examines ancient prophecies from many other sources and compares them with events taking place right now on earth. It predicts the death of Pope John Paul II, the Californian earthquake, world wide famine, and natural and environmental catastrophes the earth will face as we move into the 21st century. It also sees the beginning of a nuclear war, global economic collapse and the fall of the Roman Catholic Church. The book uses no coding system, no secret cypher hidden in ancient Hebrew or Aramaic texts and no mystic or astrological keys to reveal the secrets of the Bible&#39;s numerology. Instead it identifies and then corrects two fundamental errors in theological interpretations of the Biblical texts and then by simple arithmetic arrives at four precise dates. Of these four dates, three are in the past and are the three most important dates in the history of Judaism this century. The fourth date is very final - Judgement Day in less than 25 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, he&#39;s also thinking we have a maximum of 12 years remaining until &quot;Judgement Day&quot;. Gosh.</p>

<p>However, if Greenland or part of Antarctica (which have shitloads of ice <em>above</em> the sea) are posed for a sudden collapse, that would raise the sea level several meters in a few days. In the case of Greenland, the East Coast would feel that first, alhough given time sea level would raise worldwide.</p>

I hope we can all take this and be a little more skeptical of our government and what information they choose to desiminate to the masses.

If our government had foreknowledge of an impending disaster and did nothing than this is a smoking gun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the issue I&#39;m grappling with. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not as though the media didn&#39;t hype this up. They most certainly did. In fact, for 4 days straight. The language used was &quot;unprecedented&quot; and the like; in all honesty, the media did enough, it&#39;s just that Irene from last year received the same amount of coverage and did 1/10 the damage. Thus, everyone was leary of all the media hype this go around; &quot;the boy who cried wolf&quot; so to speak.</p>

<p>But herein lies my main issue: let&#39;s assume (for sake of argument; i have no proof of anything at all) that the military could have forecasting models able to predict storms 4-6 weeks in advance and that the best public forecasting is about a week (still enough time to communicate to the public). Perhaps these methodologies warrant classification since our adversaries could benefit from them should they be unclassified. Maybe it&#39;s a cost/benefit? In this instance, transferring these forecasting tools to the public, while useful for the U.S. population, <em>isn&#39;t enough to compromise the competitive military advantage it grants in our military operations worldwide.</em></p>

<p>Should i be concerned? Well, the theme for me is that the military has access to knowledge that could directly impact the lives of the population, well in advance of public capabilities.</p>

<p>What other gaps in knowledge am I aware of that could threaten me or my family?</p>

<p>More importantly, what other gaps am i UNAWARE of? Do you see what I&#39;m getting at here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, let&#39;s see what I have so far for the next few months...</p>

<p>11/1: &quot;possible doomsday this month&quot;
11/5: Operation by Anonymous</p>

<p>And come to think of it there was one more in November. Perhaps I didn&#39;t include it due to it&#39;s close proximity to the fifth.  Then again, the election is just before so I could have been considering that date as one of significance...but I have to temper that with the fact that it&#39;s an election year, so tensions are high.</p>

<p>I used to have many more, but lately I watch feeds and look for trends then having actual dates.  And I &quot;harvest&quot; predictions when I see &#39;em.  Someone says &quot;doomsday alert October 16&quot;, and I put it in my calendar.  More than half the time, a week or so out from the date you&#39;ll see more posts about it.  But sometimes from GLP, also from ATS.  I should start keeping track of where I hear them, but so far I haven&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;She&quot; who? The OP&#39;s mother?</p>

<p>If you re-read the story, you will see that the people who allegedly got the info directly, the same people who had to sign the non-disclosure,  are the OP&#39;s mother&#39;s friend&#39;s daughter and son in law. It mentions specifically that the son-in-law is &quot;high up&quot; in special forces, though does not say about the daughter.</p>

<p>So your specific point here is invalid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The purpose of my post was explaining that you read the OP wrong. OP does not mention any civilian signing a document. It is the OP&#39;s mother&#39;s friend&#39;s daughter and son in law. It is true that it explicitly states the son-in-law is special forces, and does not mention his wife&#39;s affiliation. It is possible she is military as well (I&#39;ve seen this kind of thing.)  If she is a civilian (and it does not explicitly state this) it may be the case that they are housed on base, etc. It isn&#39;t as weird as you made it out to be. Not like they grabbed some random dude off the street, gave him a speech, and made him sign. lol</p>

<p>None of them have so far actually come to pass, which is a good thing.  Assuming reddit and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> continue indefinitely, eventually one of these warnings will be real - but how can we tell?</p>

<p>This one isn&#39;t particularly convincing - probably the best candidate for the cause of this would be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Palma#Megatsunami_threat.3F">Las Palmas supertsunami</a> but there isn&#39;t any real evidence that this could happen, and more important, how could you possibly know in advance!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe anything Basiago says. The Project Pegasus story is entertaining, but his &quot;report&quot; regarding life forms on the surface of Mars is some of the craziest BS I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;m very open minded, and will listen to anything. But that stuff is just pure retardation. I suspect Basiago is a disinfo agent or something like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See for yourself, <a href="http://www.projectmars.net/docs/research_papers/2008-12-12_MARS_Andrew_D_Basiago_The_Discovery_of_Life_on_Mars.pdf">The Discovery of Life on Mars by Andrew D. Basiago</a>. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s one of many hilarious quotes: &quot;In The Bowl to the left of The Rock Garden, and at three locations within The Rock Garden, a human reptilian species can be seen (below). They have bulbous heads and flesh-toned arms and legs but creep along the ground. Their lizard-like bodies are flat, as if cut out of rubber, like the popular children’s television character Gumby. The author has given these relatively inert human-reptile hybrids the name The Gumby Lizard.&quot;</p>

<p>And one of my favorites: &quot;Above The Scorpion Man (left), darkly hooded figures (center) drag a woman (right) to an uncertain fate. Are human beings from Earth being abducted and taken to Mars? Are the 600,000 human beings said to be on Mars volunteers, conscripts, or abductees seized on Earth in military abductions (MILABs)? These hellish scenes haunt the imagination.&quot;</p>

<p>Mind you... these are all pictures of rocks and shadows. Seriously. Whoever wrote this had to have been hallucinating at the time. Read the PDF... it&#39;s one of the funniest things you will ever read. You will quickly see why I don&#39;t believe a damn thing this guy has to say. His slideshow presentation of this information is even better. He keeps a straight face and everything while showing the audience pictures of rocks, talking about dinosaurs fighting reptilian humans, the Scorpion-Man, the Gumby Lizard, Arachnid-Man, and the rest. IT&#39;S ROCKS AND SHADOWS.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
