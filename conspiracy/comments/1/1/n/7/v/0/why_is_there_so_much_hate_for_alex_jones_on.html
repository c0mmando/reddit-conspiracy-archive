Alex is talking with passion sometimes with too much thats true but fear mongering? The Police State is in the USA exising RIGHT NOW with the things like NDAA,Violation&#39;s of the Constitucion,False Flags,Brutal Cops. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look up Alex and Y2k. He is a fear monger and that proves it. I listened to Alex for a long time my friend. I was all hyped up thinking shit was always going down. He got me. This is why I&#39;m a little bitter with him. I see other people who just find him and their facebook posts always seems to be about fear. Not saying what he talks about isn&#39;t true because he gets a lot of his sources right from MSM. He just hypes it up. It&#39;s not what he says about stuff as much as what he doesn&#39;t say. He keeps you distracted from the real cabal that runs the planet. He&#39;s kinda like a Pied piper. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he is a great source of information, but there are a lot of things that bug people:</p>

<p>If you listen to his show live, it is FULL of ads. </p>

<p>He talks in a voice that sounds kind of ridiculous.</p>

<p>He sometimes (quite often) goes on pretty crazy-sounding rants.</p>

<p>Sometimes he sounds completely batshit crazy.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard him being interviewed on a legitimate UK radio show about 911 and he just went nuts... he wouldn&#39;t shut up and he kept changing the subject... it made me very embarrassed and the interviewer had to turn down Alex&#39;s feed and carry on talking to the other guests. In this case it was entirely reasonable.</p>

<p>He ALWAYS interrupts his guests too much.</p>

<p>He talks about himself too much.</p>

<p>The headlines are often (usually) sensationalist and misleading. You read them and think &quot;WHAT?!?&quot; and then you read the story and go &quot;Oh.&quot;</p>

<p>He seems to be the biggest figure in the movement - the best known conspiracy theorist in the world - so he is bound to have haters. He is probably sincere, and is just trying to do something - but it doesn&#39;t take a genius to work out that he is hurting the movement as well as helping. </p>

<p>That said, he has some great guests on his show, he picks up 90% of all stories from the MSM that are relevant to the conspiracy theorist community, and I visit his site a bunch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I feel that Alex Jones has served a great purpose having awakened so many people.</p>

<p>That being said he has slowly gone mad.  On top of the apparent madness he now suffers from, he has attempted to monetise the movement by selling bogus products via fear mongering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say if its really helping or its only expensive piss.</p>

<p>So i am hoping that you have tried it when you say its bogus (or some other kind of evidence or proof for that it doesent work).
Well otherwise is your answer without meaning.
I am not a expert in Health but taking the right dose of vitamnis everday should help you in someway sureley being healthy and loss weight (with sport obviously). Also the Before/After Picture of Aaron Dykes are evidence that it really works. Still Alex Jones isn&#39;t saying that you will drop dead tomorow if you don&#39;t take it.</p>

<p>thanks for the answer!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok scroll down the list of products until you find &quot;CM CREAM&quot; $26.50 plus tax&amp;shipping</p>

<p>This is 2oz of product that is 1.25% menthol.  A common product that can purchased OTC at any CVS or walgreens.</p>

<p>Now look at this</p>

<p><a href="http://www.healthwarehouse.com/bengay-pm-menthol-pain-relieving-cream-nighttime-scent-2oz.html">http://www.healthwarehouse.com/bengay-pm-menthol-pain-relieving-cream-nighttime-scent-2oz.html</a></p>

<p>Same size container, same active ingredients, same product.</p>

<p>You can get 4 units for the price of 1 from alex jones....</p>

<p>Most of the shit he sells can&#39;t be compared easily to a well known product like bengay because it is some obscure fruit extract.  But i guarantee you all his products are WAY over priced just like this CM cream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thats true but Alex promotes only:
Pollen Burst &amp; Pollen Burst Plus Berry
Beyond Tangy Tangerine
EFA Plus 90
Osteo FX Plus
Rebound</p>

<p>If you can find me one of this in cheaper way with the same ingredients i will shut my mouth. This is only &quot;Menthol&quot; Cream so if you are a large Company sure can sell it cheaper than Youngevity that makes it not a scam.If every product would be way overpriced and <strong>wouldn&#39;t help</strong> it would be a scam.
Also Alex Jones is not responisble how they price their products and this doesen&#39;t make his information unreliable only because one product of his partner is overpriced.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my biggest problem with him. People don&#39;t realize it&#39;s all a show. It&#39;s all for money. No one gets that. His niche audience provides his income because he is saying what they wanna hear. His show and his fans create one of the largest, for profit, echo chambers in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your sentiment on this.  It kills me when people criticize him for selling products.  Seriously, how else is he to make enough money to run a radio show, the tv-style show, hire reporters, run the websites, publish a magazine, produce documentaries... ?  I don&#39;t agree with 100% of what he says.  However, people who criticize him for making profit make no sense to me.  He is trying to compete with the MSM.  In order to do that, you need money.  I always see people discredit him for making money, but they offer zero alternative for him to finance his gigantic operation.  I suspect that many of these people are jealous of his popularity.  I disagree with him on several issues, but I give him a lot of credit for waking up more people than all of this haters combined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am going to stand up a bit for David Icke. First time I heard about the guy was on Penn &amp; Teller&#39;s bullshit. Ironically, but one thing he said on the show caught my attention and made me take a more open-minded approach to conspiracy theories; to look also outside the box, even if it was just in case. Nevertheless, the things he was saying appeared too far fetched and crazy, so I kept taking them light-mindledly for a long time. It was only much later on that I realized that some things he was saying made sense and that I had been dismissing evidences simply because aliens and intraterrestials sounded too unbelievable to be true. I am not saying that he is hoax-proof or always right, but that to me it seems that he&#39;s on the right tracks about many things which most conspiracy theorists dismiss. Even if you completely disagree with me on that, you have to agree that Icke has done great job waking people up.</p>

<p>Alex jones is useful if you want to get the &quot;headlines&quot;, its almost like a cable news channel by now.</p>

<p>YOu can however NOT necessarily trust his analysis and would be well advised to turn somewhere else for that.</p>

<p>Check him out if he has a good guest, maybe see one of the shorter summaries of a topic on YT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally like Alex Jones and the infowars site. It&#39;s what woke me up to some of the crazy shit going on in the world we live in. Yes sometimes he can be over the top, but I&#39;ve read things on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that were over the top as well. As far as promoting products through the show and store, I don&#39;t really understand why he loses credibility for selling things on his site. You have to fund an operation somehow and advertisements can be a major source of funding. Also, I wouldn&#39;t call what he does fear mongering I would just simply call it an opinionated alternative news.</p>
