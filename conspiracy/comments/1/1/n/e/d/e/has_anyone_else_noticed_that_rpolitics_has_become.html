    <div class="md"><p>After the first debate, all of the comments seemed like they were trimmed and adjusted to &quot;fit in&quot;. I honestly think the Obama team has a lot more influence on reddit&#39;s political opinions than anyone would originally contemplate. I think he has a team he pays to check <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> almost incessantly through out the day to sway opinions a certain direction. They&#39;re doing a damn good job. It wouldn&#39;t be just one person, maybe a hundred or so that support each other so it looks like it is a common opinion. Then redditors take it from there. </p>

<p>These people obviously participate in other subreddits as well, I&#39;m sure it is their main job to focus on social media. It isn&#39;t illegal to do this yet so why not take advantage of the opportunity? </p>

<p>People are easy to manipulate. </p>

<p>I feel really paranoid about stating this, oh well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is since politicians don&#39;t have truth to work off of, they have to find ways to persuade people they are the right choice. Social networking, especially a site such as a reddit, is a golden opportunity to do just that. It&#39;s like free advertising with little to no effort or funds. Look at all of the stories in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, it is filled to the brim with stories against Mitt Romney. I hate to say it, but if someone took the time to dig, there would be many stories of negative things Obama has done. </p>

<p>All you did was point out an opinion of Alx09&#39;s to &#39;not be true&#39; in your own opinion, did you fail to acknowledge that the use of propaganda is very very real? Humans have the capability to defend anything if they think it is right, it is a matter of what is established in their minds as &quot;right&quot;.  </p>

<p>Example: In Germany when Hitler took over, the Third Reich did not allow foreign newspapers in his country. He kept his citizens uninformed of anything else other than what came only from his mouth. Think of all of the people that only get their political information from reddit. How easy is it to have your social media team downvote bad posts about Obama? Bury them so they don&#39;t see the light of day and replace them with hate stories for Romney? Not hard at all, as long as they pay attention to the stories when they are first posted; keep &quot;new&quot; selected for politics and refresh every few minutes... </p>

<p>I hate comparing this situation to Germany, but that is all I can confidently say I know; I studied it in sociology last month and wrote a 24 page paper on it. I would gladly compare it to something else, but I won&#39;t say I know something if I don&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never claimed to be. I&#39;m not saying this is happening definitively, nor am I saying Obama is intolerant like Hitler, it&#39;s the use of propaganda I am comparing. Propaganda is used to spread biased opinions to take part in building people&#39;s social realities.</p>

<p>The Holocaust screams almost equally with &quot;Hitler&quot;, meaning it&#39;s almost like Hitler = Holocaust in people&#39;s minds. The same techniques of indoctrination can still be used in different ways with out ending in a genocide. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The example of filtering information to masses of people? That seems a reasonable comparison. The Third Reich is the only situation involving propaganda I have studied thoroughly; I won&#39;t act like I know about another instance pretty well if I don&#39;t. Hitler&#39;s name carries much resonance with mass murder, but his strategies to misinform aren&#39;t exclusive to killing millions of innocent people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How has the economy been saved? The government spending has slowed down a smidge, but aside from that all I see is more fed fun-money being pumped into the economy, which only causes temporary and superficial growth. It&#39;s WAY way too soon to say that the economy has been &quot;saved&quot; considering how far under we are. That&#39;s like being stuck underwater, about to drown, and you find a little pocket of air to breathe, and immediately consider yourself &quot;saved&quot; even though you&#39;re still going to drown.</p>

<p>If we keep funding the war machine, and the surveillance police state like we have been, then our only destination is collapse. This is all the establishment candidates like Romney and Obama will EVER do.</p>

When Obama appealed against the courts NDAA decision that ruled it unconstitutional, I posted an article on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> when there was a sizeable gap from the last post (about 20 minutes).

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from about 80 minutes North of San Francisco and it is highly Democrat heavy.  The people think that they are so damn clever and intellectually superior.  It has to be as bad in that way as what I imagine to be the moral superiority of the South to be.  The people there basically think that they are relaxed and thoughtful like Swedes but in reality they just completely support anything that is minority, alternative and different within a system packaged format.  For the people of my home area being black, homosexual or female has a huge advantage.</p>

<p>California has two Democrat female senators; Diane Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.  In addition the female House minority leader Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi lives in San Francisco and people are just proud to hell of her.  So to elect a half-black guy is just common sense for these people.  Just iterate over and over again how important it is to support people that are basically something other than white male and you are doing well.  They are incredibly guilty feeling people who need to approve of everything considered &quot;diversity&quot; without even thinking about it.</p>

<p>A year ago I was part of a scholarship approval panel for some high school students and the theme was &quot;diversity&quot;.  Everyone carried on about &quot;diversity&quot;.  Some people even claimed that the school was so great because it had a high &quot;diversity&quot;.  One of the students was born in Germany and now lived in my area.  She was complaining in her letter how boring and lacking in diversity it is.  It just killed me how the other students believed that it was such a great place because of the &quot;diversity&quot;.  At that moment it really hit me just how much the diversity is good mantra is beat into their heads.  In their weak minds they think, diversity is good, this area is good, so this area is diverse.  They look around and they will have an Asian here and there, a few blacks, a few openly gay people and they say &quot;Yes, we are in fact good&quot;.  They are just absolutely primed to support anyone who can sell that ticket.</p>

<p>[edit] I just unsubscribed to r/politics.  Ahh feels good, at least until the elections are over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree that <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> leans to the left - I don&#39;t think you can blame the userbase or reddit. The bottom line is that Conservatives and far-right people HATE facts, which is something that comes up on reddit often. So they don&#39;t even show their face because even competing on reddit means they have to admit at least partly that their party are career charlatans. That leaves nothing but well meaning independents and a ton of left wingers, so reddit ends up being mostly left. Just like real life! (The conservatives are so specific about who they like that the left ends up being the &quot;everything else&quot; party and has a much wider variety in their userbase.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the corporations are in control of the two-party system. And I&#39;m not talking about politicians hating facts. I&#39;m talking about the people. The OP is about why the default politics subreddit is mostly left wing, and I stand by the observation that conservatives are much more sheltered and really only stick to sites that shield them from other views. Reddit doesn&#39;t do this. Therefore we don&#39;t see them here much.</p>

<p>And to say that the republican party is as diverse as the democratic party in the US, whether you are basing that on race or economical status or both, is absurd. The reason the GOP is constantly purging voting records is because the more people vote - the more the left wins. Have you ever heard of Democrats using voter intimidation? (Answer: No)</p>

<p>NOW... I am not touching on the fact that the choice is a false one, or that the Right vs. Left is just a distraction, so I&#39;m sure I will continue to be downvoted. I&#39;m really just trying to respond to the OP with something other than LOL YA POLITICS IS A CIRCLE JERK. </p>

<p>From my experiences, I think democrats are more receptive to adjusting their viewpoints based on new information, too. Many end up voting democrat because they are so turned off by the right fringe groups that seem to have so much pull in the party, but this doesn&#39;t mean they truly identify as democrats. This is why I called them the &quot;everything else&quot; party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You linked an article that says liberal people are known to hide facebook updates from conservative people. This has nothing to do with my point of them being receptive to evidence and new information. The study is irrelevant to the discussion, unless you consider pictures of Obama with devil horns to be worthy information...</p>

<p>As for your link about Black Panthers standing outside a polling location - I fail to see how this shows that the Democrats use voter intimidation or in any way compares to the official GOP party purging voter registrations. The Black panthers are not even an unofficial arm of the DNC, and are actually more correctly classified as a right-wing para-military group. The only people the intimidate are the easily mislead and scared white voters that watch Fox.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t answer my own questions for you anymore, though. It seems to me like you are playing Texas sharpshooter with all your conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m not a republican or a democrat, so I see intimidation on/from both sides of the futile 2 party system.  And the shit passed around on facebook is equally absurd from both parties.</p>

<p>What I was trying to point out is that you, like many others towing the party line on both sides, have constructed an informational wall around yourself which simultaneously glorifies your side while demonising the other.</p>

<p>Thus the 2 party system survives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now I never asserted that I know your political views, and I&#39;m a bit surprised you assumed I am on the side of one of the major political parties, but I do see why you said it. I posted in the thread to try to offer some debate, but the circle jerk over the OP&#39;s circle jerk post overwhelmed me and now I&#39;m in the negatives. Oh well.</p>

<p>As for the 2 party system - it is a very intricate and tricky beast. I know so many people that vote not because they agree with a candidate, but because they despise or are scared of the other candidate. It has come to the point that everything is black/white... good/evil... and to cast a vote for anyone other than the major 2 candidates would be a vote wasted since it didn&#39;t go towards this epic battle of good/evil.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy into it. I recognize it&#39;s happening. But it still weighs on me daily. And if you want to debate with adults and the masses you have to be able to talk it. I personally think the only solution would be an entirely new system, because no third party will ever win in modern politics. </p>
