       Several weeks ago, the moderators of
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       placed a ban on all self posts (with an exception for Saturdays when no ones on there). One of the best parts of the sub has been the original ideas from the community, and the discussions that have followed. I would have though this would be more important than ever in election season.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the past few Saturdays,
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11t3a9/there_are_three_amazing_discussions_today_on/">
        I have been making self posts decrying this policy,
       </a>
       and they are immediately filtered every time. All discussion of the ban is censored. This weekend, I challenged them on this, and
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YcVSJ.jpg">
        received this as a response.
       </a>
       The mod's allusion to the private sector is what caused the pieces to click together in my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods are either the individuals behind these whack blogs, or they are getting a cut in the ad revenue from their authors. Since the ban there has been a huge influx of articles from a few fringe extreme left blogs surging to the front page, such as nationalmemo, politicsusa, and freakoutnation. The articles are basically shitty self posts, but by these people with amazon ad supported blogs,
       <a href="http://www.politicususa.com/romney-reduce-deficits-balance-budgets-lying.html">
        for example
       </a>
       . With election season in full swing, there is more money in political-related ad markets than ever. By banning self posts, the mods of
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       have been driving tens of thousands of users to these extremist fringe blogs everyday that weren't getting a fraction of the attention before.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        tl;dr
       </strong>
       the mods of
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       have banned self posts because of financial ties to extremist blogs, and are vigilantly censoring all discussion of the policy to protect their corruption.

       Its definitely a problem because you can't post original ideas. Every basis for a thread has to start out as an article. If you don't post a link from a reputable site then the thread is spammed with this site looks like shit.

       Original ideas were banned over a year ago when the
       <a href="/r/poltiics">

       mods took over and banned anything expressing the voice of the American left.

       It would be nice just to get the self posts back. The process of finding out if they are pitchforkable would require all sorts of invasions of reddiquette and privacy. And who knows, it may go all the way to the top. As the mod pointed out to me, Reddit.com is a for profit venture - there may be more business ends of this community than t he users are aware of. Even finding out if these revenue-generating blogs are connected to the mods would require finding out who's running those blogs and then doing sleuthing into who the
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       mods are - and I don't like the sound of that.

       Hate to break it to you, but the mod is right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit doesn't have to allow you to submit

        anything.

       I really don't see a problem to them banning self posts. It's a subreddit about what's going on in politics, not what you think should be going on in politics. Claiming that the mods are getting kickbacks are wild accusations.

       So you have no actual proof that the

       mods are receiving kickbacks, yet your title and your "tl;dr" state that as a matter of fact? Trying to cause a witch hunt because no one cares about your crusade?
