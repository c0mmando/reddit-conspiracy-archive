    <div class="md"><p>For the first time ever? Yikes, that&#39;s a little bit of a stretch.</p>

<p>The public loves the feel good soldier stories, so of course Reddit, as big as it is, will have tons of &quot;Omg, my son is home and I&#39;m so happyyy here&#39;s him with 10 new puppies and the ring a happy little boy gave him in Afghanistan when he cooked him a whole meal while fighting off Al Qaeda with one hand.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but that&#39;s the only reason I made the comment I did about the positive pictures and why they pop up so frequently.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I really missed the point? I weighed in on why I think the positive war pictures get to the front page so often.</p>

<p>There are people and a lot of them who absolutely love the military, and men/women in the service. And not everyone who goes in knows what they&#39;re getting into, and there are people who support the shit out of them even knowing what they&#39;re doing. </p>

<p>Reddit is forever exploding in popularity, which is why we have things on the &quot;front page&quot; of the &quot;front page of the internet&quot; and it&#39;s a bunch of memes, cat pictures, and random facts. It&#39;s indicative of the users and what they like. </p>

<p>Again though, that&#39;s just my two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember, intel such as photos, and reports from around the world where the US is engaged in combat, is very tough to gather and get out to the rest of the world. The US is doing its damn best to make sure that photos like these don&#39;t start flooding the net. And if a few photos do actually manage to make it out and onto the net, It&#39;s either a controlled release by them, used for spin, or it&#39;s genuine. of course that&#39;s a fifty fifty, so make your own decisions on that. </p>
