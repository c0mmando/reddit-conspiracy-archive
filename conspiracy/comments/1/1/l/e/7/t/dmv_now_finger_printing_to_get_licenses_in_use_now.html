    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying I like it (I don&#39;t), but they&#39;ve been collecting thumbprints since 1982. </p>

<p><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1986-07-25/news/mn-272_1_fingerprint-data">http://articles.latimes.com/1986-07-25/news/mn-272_1_fingerprint-data</a></p>

<p>I can tell you that I have tried to subpoena fingerprints from CA DMV (I am an attorney, and was litigating a dispute where the other side claimed a now-dead person had not really signed a deed for property, and we wanted to compare the thumbprint in the notary book to the dead person&#39;s thumbprint to prove they were the same) and CA DMV swore up and down, under oath, that they did not have the thumbprints. I&#39;m talking about a real subpoena in a real lawsuit. Honestly, I think they do have the thumbprints and don&#39;t want to share them, but it wasn&#39;t worth the trouble in that case to spend a lot of time kicking their ass. From a privacy point of view, at least they don&#39;t hand them out to non-law-enforcement just because someone subpoenas them for an ordinary civil case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Height and weight are estimable just by looking at someone, I don&#39;t consider those measurements to be private.</p>

<p>Fingerprints however, can be abused. If they have everyone&#39;s thumb print, they could use it to track who handled things like literature, pamphlets, and money.</p>

<p>Also, this sets a bad precedent. What happens when schools decide that children must give their fingerprints to get lunch, or adults must give their fingerprints to buy things. It&#39;s a significant step towards the state tracking everyone with this technology. If we don&#39;t speak up now, our entire lives will revolve around a biometric measurement that is easily faked.</p>

It&#39;s already been ruled that a right cannot be turned into a privileged and issued a license and fee.  Your right to travel in your own car is your right.  You needn&#39;t present a driver&#39;s license when asked for it.

I&#39;ve been studying law and color of law for a good while now and have come to know the difference.  Saying a statement is false doesn&#39;t make it any more false than me saying it&#39;s true, but from my experience it is.  There was a man by the name of Carl Miller who did a series of recordings... probably in the 80s that would clue you in to this information.  If you&#39;re interested I would suggest you start there... if you can find him.  But I can tell by your simple reply and the quantity of upvotes that you received for it that you&#39;re probably not interested in anything but maintaining the status quo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This comment disturbs me.  If I&#39;m reading it right you&#39;re asking if I can show you HOW we have permission to travel in a manner of our choosing utilizing common methods of travel?  It&#39;s this mind set, that there must be applicable codes allowing us to do certain things that perpetuates a continual means of voluntary servitude.  It&#39;s simple really.  Are you traveling on a road for business or personal use?  If you are doing it for personal use then you a entitled to travel freely and uninhibited.  Are you hurting someone by traveling in a car on a road you pay for?  If no... then why CAN&#39;T you?  Accosting someone and fining them for something they COULD HAVE done is pre-crime.  From what I&#39;ve read on conspiracy sites you guys hate that shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand where you might believe this because I was raised to believe this is the case as well.  I was raised to believe this by people who didn&#39;t understand law and/or their rights and still don&#39;t.   But consider this if traveling in a car was truly a privilege then you would be provided with a means of conveyance free of charge.  This is not the case.  You purchase your car (or someone purchases your car for you or you receive a car that is provided to you NOT by the government) and then you are told when you can and cannot travel in it.  Furthermore your tax dollars go to the production and maintenance of roads.  And you &quot;don&#39;t have the option&quot; (that&#39;s parenthetical because you actually do)  of walking on ALL of them according to various codes enacted.  At one point you did not require a license to drive and then later a license and fee was applied to it.  According to the Supreme court that oversees and determines interpretation of law over all other courts... this is unlawful.  This isn&#39;t to say they won&#39;t do it.  It only requires consent of the people and consent can be injected by creating false belief of what is governing law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Height and weight are estimable just by looking at someone, I don&#39;t consider those measurements to be private.</p>

<p>Fingerprints however, can be abused. If they have everyone&#39;s thumb print, they could use it to track who handled things like literature, pamphlets, and money.</p>

<p>Also, this sets a bad precedent. What happens when schools decide that children must give their fingerprints to get lunch, or adults must give their fingerprints to buy things. It&#39;s a significant step towards the state tracking everyone with this technology. If we don&#39;t speak up now, our entire lives will revolve around a biometric measurement that is easily faked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This comment disturbs me.  If I&#39;m reading it right you&#39;re asking if I can show you HOW we have permission to travel in a manner of our choosing utilizing common methods of travel?  It&#39;s this mind set, that there must be applicable codes allowing us to do certain things that perpetuates a continual means of voluntary servitude.  It&#39;s simple really.  Are you traveling on a road for business or personal use?  If you are doing it for personal use then you a entitled to travel freely and uninhibited.  Are you hurting someone by traveling in a car on a road you pay for?  If no... then why CAN&#39;T you?  Accosting someone and fining them for something they COULD HAVE done is pre-crime.  From what I&#39;ve read on conspiracy sites you guys hate that shit. </p>
