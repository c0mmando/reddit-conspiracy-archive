<ol>
<li><p>Do you believe what you see on the news?</p></li>
<li><p>If so, which news sources do you find are the most honest and unadultered?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>2a. If not, how do you get what you consider to be credible information on world events?</p>

<p>I ask this because I see comments that quote news sources alot, but I also see ones that state the media is not to be trusted. I&#39;m just interested in how you all decide what is credible and what isn&#39;t, since you&#39;re clearly of higher average intelligence than your average American newswatcher.</p>

When you hear a story, do your own research on it and find out how many other news sources are reporting it and what they are saying, then it&#39;s up to you to decide what&#39;s true or not.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you already got some answers but would like to add something, read about PEOPLE who &quot;own&quot; the news and networks, their background, identity, history etc.</p>

<p>And there are NO honest and unadultered. The majority of news networks don&#39;t lie blatantly, but focus on stories that are NOT covered by them. When watching the news for example, always ask yourself, <em>is that all? Why did you cover only theses stories? And regarding tis specific information, why did you only mention the opinion of this side, but not the other one?</em>, and focus on the use of words. They are supposed to be journalists, and they know that every word has his own meaning and effect. </p>

<p>People are not paid to tell the truth. They are paid to tell us what they are asked to tell. So try to find different news sources from all over the world. Look for different POV about any given issue, people with different POV usually cover different matters.</p>
