       I wanted to preface this comment with a disclaimer. I'm not arguing merely to argue. I think my post history demonstrates my interest in openly &amp; honestly exploring topics. I say this because I understand much of the hard and often thankless work that can go into maintaining the integrity of subs, particularly one that deals with the topics and entities that this one aims to. To that end, please take these words in the spirit with which they are intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask these questions in socratic interest of evolving the comprehension of that very integrity.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is completely confidential and and any conversations between us and the users must remain that way in order for us to maintain

         their
        </strong>
        trust and confidence.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is an important distinction there, in how it is interpreted psychologically as well as functionally implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maintaining confidentiality in these communications is important to the trust and confidence of those that rely on that trust and confidentiality.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        telling everyone who reports who about what is not a very good way to keep the confidence of the readers up
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think this is quite debatable, as I'm sure you could understand how such knowledge of the (meta) issues and 'movers &amp; shakers' could be seen as a vital part of comprehending the active and living integrity of his sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand how this might allow the unscrupulous to target those who attempt to propagate integrity and could air our 'dirty laundry' and divisions to those same unscrupulous individuations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am familiar with the tyranny of the majority, and understand the best form of organization is an enlightened &amp; benevolent dictator. I'm just looking for a deeper analysis of these issues to build confidence &amp; trust in your status as enlightened &amp; benevolent.

       You got shadowbanned. Don't blame the r/conspiracy mods. Take it up with the Reddit admins. A shadowban essentially means you can post, but none of your posts show up publicly.

       I think this is accurate. You can look at all the mod's comment history here in r/conspiracy and know that we genuinely care about the quality of posts and the users of this community. I have zero tolerance for gaming a subreddit, and I have not seen anything like that from my fellow mods. Thank you, Luke, for making this point.

       Oh that's interesting.  Hmm...so it is in the code.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really wonder about people like me who have been redditors for more than say 5 years.  Is there something in the code of old accounts that causes problems with the newer, updated code?

       It's not the mods. He was shadowbanned by a Reddit admin. Most likely they didn't like what you said and did this. Basically you can still post and log in to Reddit, but none of your posts or upvotes show up publicly.

       Nope. As you can see from people posting many have never even heard of it. That alone raises concern.

       People who have never heard of it must be incredibly new to Reddit or simply don't look around. I knew what shadowbanning was a week into lurking - but I also know that nearly every time someone gets shadow banned, they blame the mods (especially here) when they have nothing to do with it.

       Regardless of WHY it happens, it is important because it DOES happen. It seems pretty clear to me that because of this people could have no idea of the situation through no fault of their own. Simply hand waving that 'they should just know' seems a bit heavy handed to me.

       I have to ask, in all honesty, you believe that everyone should readily believe what the mods tell them to? I'm not saying there's a conspiracy in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       , but being a moderator of a subreddit that really has open doors for all different kinds of people, they should be prepared to be questioned. These situations aren't getting out of hand or anything, they chose to moderate this subreddit and if they really feel strongly for the truth, they'll put up with a little gripe every now and then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe you and that moderator have history in this subreddit and that's why you respect him?... idk, I'm just trying to understand why you think this post is not reasonable.

       This doesn't answer anything, it's merely condescending. All I'm saying is no one is a hater for having questions, it's okay to question. No one is going off on a tangent saying, "These stupid fucking mods are taking down my posts!", they're stating their situations for people to draw an answer together. There isn't anything wrong with that.

       I don't think the expectation that the mods are behaving dubiously is reasonable or justifiable at all, because the suspicions are able to be allayed by completely observable data, and the suspicious themselves just ignore the data. I am able to know this is true myself by seeing the data and acting as a witness that it is perceptible.

       If these posts show up (they do), then you are very much so "sounding an alarm bell". This is not appropriate for this subreddit. The mods here are attempting to have the utmost integrity and have proven that via sharing modlogs when necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would probably be appropriate in a message to the mods, but not in such a dramatic self-post, IMO. We hope you will continue to use this subreddit and that your posting issues will clear up, but as seen above, it appears as though there wasn't an issue to begin with...

       This is exactly the problem with today's times, blindly trusting positions of authority. He/she should just send a message to the mods? We are people, we are meant to stand up for each other and reach conclusions together. There is nothing wrong with making a self post, I don't find it dramatic in the least. I find it interesting because this is happening frequently on

       I'm starting to wonder if OP had intentions to bolster his own subreddit... not making accusations, but that's what it's looking like. I wasn't aware OP was downright declining to show some evidence when I posted my first comments.

       One would have to look at each case to verify that posts were actually not visible, first. In OP's case, it turns out that all posts actually were visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone is concerned that a post is not visible, than that person should message the mods so they can delve into the situation. Mods have the ability to hide posts. With that said, I'm not aware of that happening in r/conspiracy, and haven't seen it in any of the mod logs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, one could be shadowbanned by admins, but this is pretty rare. I haven't been a mod long enough to know how to proceed to help someone if they're shadowbanned; but I'm assuming we would message admins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically I'm saying that in each instance of someone claiming that their posts are not visible, the user would need to share that with mods to verify its a legit concern. I don't have any theories as to "who" would make a post invisible because as far as I know, it could only be an admin shadowban, or a mod hiding a post (which doesn't happen here).

       You could be shadow banned: which has

       I always seem to click on a link that seems politically unnerving and it does nothing. Others have commented on it so it must have worked at some point but to me, it appears sensitive information, the ones that "they" might not want known are always nonworking. Maybe someone discovers the material and breaks the link before I get to it but it only occurs on what i think would be sensitive info....

       your new sub is just a flood of your own blog spam.

       stop being a fuckface. self-posting every little blog you write is bad taste.

       i assume the majority of your downvotes are due to you essentially self-posting,ad nausea, the same crap.

       Just shut up... Just cause no one was interested in your links doesn't mean you're being "censored", it just means you post crap ppl aren't interested in. Blaming others, or claiming "censorship" in this situation is childish, and reminiscent of the boy who cried wolf...

       My favorite type of r/conspiracy post.... THERE IS A CONSPIRACY ABOUT r/conspiracy.  Honestly reddit has blow up so much in the past year, the OP could be right, the higher ups don't want flow of info, who knows who is really deleting his posts, the internet is a scary scary place.

       Wish I could give you more upvotes for this statement. Wtf is wrong with ppl in this thread? I've posted lots o' links that get no traction, and that was my fault for posting links no one was interested in. How ppl get off blaming others for crappy links is beyond me...

       This is weird because the same thing happened to me 2x last week! I think this sub is being manipulated...who knows if its Reddit, Zionist groups (I'm talking about
       <em>
        you guys
       </em>
       JIDF and ADL)!
      </p>
      <p>
       The main reason that I've been giving posting a huge break is because...it's getting me angry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can sit here and tell people my honest version of how I came to loathe and fear Zionism and their "New World Order" all the time; but what does it change? It helps to think that maybe I am "turning people on" to the truth but it moves so slowly. Granted, it would take a proper Uni study to prove this assertion, but I don't think that I can help reach that critical "tipping point" that it would take to convince people of what is going on around here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm gonna keep looking, but its hard to keep positive after reading all of this terrible news, you know?

       Anyhow, peace brother and enjoyed having you. I'm sure we'll see ya around someday in the future... ; ')

       I have to ask, in all honesty, you believe that everyone should readily believe what the mods tell them to? I'm not saying there's a conspiracy in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , but being a moderator of a subreddit that really has open doors for all different kinds of people, they should be prepared to be questioned. These situations aren't getting out of hand or anything, they chose to moderate this subreddit and if they really feel strongly for the truth, they'll put up with a little gripe every now and then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe you and that moderator have history in this subreddit and that's why you respect him?... idk, I'm just trying to understand why you think this post is not reasonable.

       One would have to look at each case to verify that posts were actually not visible, first. In OP's case, it turns out that all posts actually were visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone is concerned that a post is not visible, than that person should message the mods so they can delve into the situation. Mods have the ability to hide posts. With that said, I'm not aware of that happening in r/conspiracy, and haven't seen it in any of the mod logs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, one could be shadowbanned by admins, but this is pretty rare. I haven't been a mod long enough to know how to proceed to help someone if they're shadowbanned; but I'm assuming we would message admins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically I'm saying that in each instance of someone claiming that their posts are not visible, the user would need to share that with mods to verify its a legit concern. I don't have any theories as to "who" would make a post invisible because as far as I know, it could only be an admin shadowban, or a mod hiding a post (which doesn't happen here).
