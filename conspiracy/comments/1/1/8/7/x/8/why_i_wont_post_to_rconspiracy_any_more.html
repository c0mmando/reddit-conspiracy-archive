    <div class="md"><p>I wanted to preface this comment with a disclaimer. I&#39;m not arguing merely to argue. I think my post history demonstrates my interest in openly &amp; honestly exploring topics. I say this because I understand much of the hard and often thankless work that can go into maintaining the integrity of subs, particularly one that deals with the topics and entities that this one aims to. To that end, please take these words in the spirit with which they are intended.</p>

<p>I ask these questions in socratic interest of evolving the comprehension of that very integrity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is completely confidential and and any conversations between us and the users must remain that way in order for us to maintain <strong>their</strong> trust and confidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is an important distinction there, in how it is interpreted psychologically as well as functionally implemented.</p>

<p>Maintaining confidentiality in these communications is important to the trust and confidence of those that rely on that trust and confidentiality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>telling everyone who reports who about what is not a very good way to keep the confidence of the readers up</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is quite debatable, as I&#39;m sure you could understand how such knowledge of the (meta) issues and &#39;movers &amp; shakers&#39; could be seen as a vital part of comprehending the active and living integrity of his sub.</p>

<p>I understand how this might allow the unscrupulous to target those who attempt to propagate integrity and could air our &#39;dirty laundry&#39; and divisions to those same unscrupulous individuations.</p>

<p>I am familiar with the tyranny of the majority, and understand the best form of organization is an enlightened &amp; benevolent dictator. I&#39;m just looking for a deeper analysis of these issues to build confidence &amp; trust in your status as enlightened &amp; benevolent.</p>

<p>What type of questions and complaints are expressed to you?</p>

<p>Regardless of WHY it happens, it is important because it DOES happen. It seems pretty clear to me that because of this people could have no idea of the situation through no fault of their own. Simply hand waving that &#39;they should just know&#39; seems a bit heavy handed to me.</p>

These situations aren&#39;t getting out of hand or anything, they chose to moderate this subreddit and if they really feel strongly for the truth, they&#39;ll put up with a little gripe every now and then. </p>

<p>Or maybe you and that moderator have history in this subreddit and that&#39;s why you respect him?... idk, I&#39;m just trying to understand why you think this post is not reasonable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One would have to look at each case to verify that posts were actually not visible, first. In OP&#39;s case, it turns out that all posts actually were visible. </p>

<p>If someone is concerned that a post is not visible, than that person should message the mods so they can delve into the situation. Mods have the ability to hide posts. With that said, I&#39;m not aware of that happening in r/conspiracy, and haven&#39;t seen it in any of the mod logs. </p>

<p>Alternatively, one could be shadowbanned by admins, but this is pretty rare. I haven&#39;t been a mod long enough to know how to proceed to help someone if they&#39;re shadowbanned; but I&#39;m assuming we would message admins. </p>

<p>Basically I&#39;m saying that in each instance of someone claiming that their posts are not visible, the user would need to share that with mods to verify its a legit concern. I don&#39;t have any theories as to &quot;who&quot; would make a post invisible because as far as I know, it could only be an admin shadowban, or a mod hiding a post (which doesn&#39;t happen here).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite type of r/conspiracy post.... THERE IS A CONSPIRACY ABOUT r/conspiracy.  Honestly reddit has blow up so much in the past year, the OP could be right, the higher ups don&#39;t want flow of info, who knows who is really deleting his posts, the internet is a scary scary place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is weird because the same thing happened to me 2x last week! I think this sub is being manipulated...who knows if its Reddit, Zionist groups (I&#39;m talking about <em>you guys</em> JIDF and ADL)!</p>

<p>The main reason that I&#39;ve been giving posting a huge break is because...it&#39;s getting me angry.</p>

<p>I can sit here and tell people my honest version of how I came to loathe and fear Zionism and their &quot;New World Order&quot; all the time; but what does it change? It helps to think that maybe I am &quot;turning people on&quot; to the truth but it moves so slowly. Granted, it would take a proper Uni study to prove this assertion, but I don&#39;t think that I can help reach that critical &quot;tipping point&quot; that it would take to convince people of what is going on around here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna keep looking, but its hard to keep positive after reading all of this terrible news, you know?</p>

<p>Anyhow, peace brother and enjoyed having you. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see ya around someday in the future... ; &#39;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey 9000,</p>

<p>I found both posts--I am using RES with Chrome and, I guess it has something to do with the vote system...both were marked as &quot;comment score below threshold.&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks for doing such a good job--I admire your NON-censorship!</p>

All these ppl claiming their posts have been &quot;censored&quot; seem to just be bitching because they didn&#39;t get any upvotes, so then they choose to blame the mods.

    <div class="md"><p>I have to ask, in all honesty, you believe that everyone should readily believe what the mods tell them to? I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s a conspiracy in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but being a moderator of a subreddit that really has open doors for all different kinds of people, they should be prepared to be questioned. These situations aren&#39;t getting out of hand or anything, they chose to moderate this subreddit and if they really feel strongly for the truth, they&#39;ll put up with a little gripe every now and then. </p>

<p>Or maybe you and that moderator have history in this subreddit and that&#39;s why you respect him?... idk, I&#39;m just trying to understand why you think this post is not reasonable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One would have to look at each case to verify that posts were actually not visible, first. In OP&#39;s case, it turns out that all posts actually were visible. </p>

<p>If someone is concerned that a post is not visible, than that person should message the mods so they can delve into the situation. Mods have the ability to hide posts. With that said, I&#39;m not aware of that happening in r/conspiracy, and haven&#39;t seen it in any of the mod logs. </p>

<p>Alternatively, one could be shadowbanned by admins, but this is pretty rare. I haven&#39;t been a mod long enough to know how to proceed to help someone if they&#39;re shadowbanned; but I&#39;m assuming we would message admins. </p>

<p>Basically I&#39;m saying that in each instance of someone claiming that their posts are not visible, the user would need to share that with mods to verify its a legit concern. I don&#39;t have any theories as to &quot;who&quot; would make a post invisible because as far as I know, it could only be an admin shadowban, or a mod hiding a post (which doesn&#39;t happen here).</p>
