        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many times during a debate/conversation I&#39;m having outside of  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> I&#39;ll have some clown show up and butt into the convo with a comment that goes something like &quot;oh god, this guy frequents <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, that explains everything&quot;.  As if this is some sort automatic disqualifier.</p>

<p>Is this the direction that our society is headed? Are we so afraid of alternative opinions that we disenfranchise our opponents based upon their system of beliefs?</p>

<p>Classic examples:</p>

<p>An atheist finds out you&#39;re religious &quot;says the guy who worships the flying spaghetti monster&quot;</p>

<p>Liberal finds out you&#39;re a conservative &quot;1 word, Santorum&quot;</p>

<p>A conservative finds out you&#39;re a libertarian &quot;Isolationist!! &quot;</p>

<p>A feminist finds out you&#39;re an MRA &quot; misogynist!!! &quot;</p>

<p>Pretty much anybody finds out you don&#39;t support Israel &quot;anti-semite!&quot;</p>

<p>When did we forget how to respect other people&#39;s opinions? And furthermore why is it so hard to just converse with someone who doesn&#39;t think the same as you without leveling attacks at them or their affiliates?</p>

<p>I think sensationalism is driving us all mad.  Rush and Cooper are teaching us to be dismissive and avoid debates.  To just accept what the talking heads push down our throats.</p>

<p>Prepping us to be good little echo boxes ripe to be stirred up into a frenzy and equally easy to tame.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t even respect ourselves enough to form our own opinions.  We (not nearly as many of us in conspiracy do this) pick some figure head that is popular and everyone just mindlessly repeats their rhetoric hoping that this somehow makes them sound smarter than their adversaries.</p>

<p>WTF world?</p>

<p><strong>I&#39;ve found the answer</strong></p>

<p>While I agree with this statement, lets look a little deeper inside.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve begun to lose the argument, but you haven&#39;t won it until the audience is willing to objectively think about what you have said.  So IMHO regardless of the fact that your detractor has fail to &quot;slam dunk&quot; you with a logical argument they have effectively shifted the topic away from anything substantial (the subject at hand) and they have created an easy psychological spillway for people to outright ignore any flicker of free thought they may have begun to experience.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a dishonest tactic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aristotle had a good idea there. I personally didn&#39;t open my mind until I statred researching opposing views. I was christian and had a very basic concept of higher power that was until I opened my mind to other belief systems: Atheism, Hinduism, Confucianism, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam, philosophy, Science, Philisophical overlapping of science (or vice versa), etc. Personally I feel like my mind&#39;s reasoning has expanded. I never really payed any attenttion to Conspiracy at a young age aside from the occassional 9/11 video and Metal Gear Solid. What I&#39;ve come to notice is that a cohesive, complex conspiracy takes a very intelligent person to tackle, I think that&#39;s why many people disregard Metal Gear Solid as trivial, and not worth their time. This is because people aren&#39;t able to follow, because to me the more intelligent conspiracy is backed my history.</p>
