       The following is a quick aggregate of strange and surprising facts as well as theories that relate to the idea of an anomalous hurricane disaster.  The theory is the belief that a weather system can be steered, augmented, and manipulated in such a way to be controlled with technology.  The claimed purpose would be to cause a disaster, use the ensuing chaos to institute martial law, and gain total control of the population, while others suggest an election connection.  Why any of this makes sense only becomes arguable when assumed that our society is on the brink of collapse.  This, being the preemptive action in light of that realization.  However, that is a pretty big assumption to come to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it is fair to point out that there are conspiracy theories for just about anything and everything.  And if you find enough “data points” and connect the dots you can reach a very interesting narrative.

       on reddit claims to have been contacted by a reliable family friend who had been called into a military briefing regarding a probable evacuation scenario for the east coast due to an unknown disaster causing massive floods.  The proposed time line in the post does coincide with this hurricane.  Creepy, but hard to find credible.

        How do they think this is possible?

      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Frequency_Active_Auroral_Research_Program">
        HAARP
       </a>
       is a military funded research program along with
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency">
        DARPA
       </a>
       which uses high frequency radio transmitters to collect data on the ionosphere.  It does this by sending concentrated and/or continuous high-frequency pulses into specific sections of the ionosphere with the intent to agitate it. The official purpose of this program is to conduct research and collect data to help advance the performance and reliability of communications, satellites, and the accuracy of GPS and other various research instruments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theorists suspect because of the military and DARPA’s involvement in this program that it is not only for data collection, but for the actual experimentation for the purpose of manipulating the ionosphere along with weather conditions to “weaponize” mother nature.  The act of controlling, influencing, and manipulating the weather is often referred to as “weather modification” and even has a provision in the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Modification_Convention">
        Geneva Conventions
       </a>
       condemning its use in war.  According to the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_modification">
        wikipedia
       </a>
       on weather modification, it is something that has been discussed in the UN as far back as 1975.  This is no longer a hypothetical idea of the imagination, however, the extent of its effectiveness can only be speculated.
      </p>
      <p>
       One
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNxhfp-KwBQ&amp;t=12m54s">
        theory
       </a>
       regarding HAARP is that by targeting concentrated sections of the ionosphere with the intent to agitate it there is potential to even heat up specific sections and effectively displace entire columns of the atmosphere due to the temperature change.  By displacing large columns of the atmosphere one would be able to influence pressure systems and jet streams and thereby have the ability to strengthen, weaken, and steer hurricanes.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        But why?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually conspiracy theories are all based around the idea that someone is benefiting or someone profits from it.  For this reason the purpose of this theory isn’t too clear.  It seems pretty drastic and more of an “End Game” scenario where the only purpose is for control.  So to believe this one you would really have to be convinced that either the financial system is teetering to the point of collapse making monetary profit irrelevant and chaos imminent or resources have become so limited that there is a need to control the population size in order to sustain the “western lifestyle” for that much longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        My thoughts:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It started out pretty damn interesting with some weird occurrences and legit creepy facts, but there are just so many assumptions that have to be made, and some drastic ones at that, that it becomes increasingly unbelievable.  But at the same time some of the cold hard facts are even unbelievable too.  It's confusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, don’t be stupid.  Prepare yourself at the very least to be without power.  I don’t understand people who say “Irene wasn’t bad so this one won’t be bad either” or any other statement along those lines.  It is almost nonsensical to compare one hurricane to another and to base your judgment on that.  This is weather we’re talking about, not cars coming off an assembly line that we expect to be consistent.  If there is anything we can all see from the last couple years is that the weather has been doing some funky things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last year all I did was buy beer, candles, and drugs.  It was definitely fun, but I also should probably be dead.  Also, when you don’t have power and can’t cook food it is also highly probable that chinese takeout will be unable to deliver food to you.  Seems obvious.  Yeah, I should be dead.

       Thanks. I just wanted to present information in a way that could be easily understood without drawing immediate conclusions. I wanted it to be a "here's what's being discussed, here are some facts, draw your own conclusion." Although at times I can't help but include my own opinion, I really tried not to make that the whole point of this self post. Glad people liked it!  Maybe after this one ill try to make sense of some other ones in this sub.

       I might believe that we can generate hurricanes and control the weather to an extent... but to be able to steer it? Starting around Africa?  Wouldn't you have to displace the atmosphere continually along the path to get it exactly where you wanted it to go?  It looks, at the moment, like it will hit around Atlantic City?  Why not New York City for the royal flush.

       I live on the south shore of Long Island and a lot is a stake. Got my beer and my greens, but I'm an upstater and this is new.  Hope my peanuts, bananas and bread are enough for a bit!
      </p>
      <p>
       But, like I was saying, there is a lot at stake.  That's why I think there is a glimmer of truth to this theory. How accurate is long-range weather forcasting?  Accurate enough to predict the upcoming jet stream, simply (ha.. simply) create the hurricane and wait, knowing that it will be pulled, unnaturally, westward into the northeast coast?

       The technology we have is 20 years behind the technology "they" have. That's how I justify it, and I have no real proof. It's a theory. Heck, Japan is 4 or 5 years ahead of us when it comes to cellphones. We're light years beyond what North Korea allows their people to own and do with their life. I am a firm believer that a lot of the technology / amenities we know about had to be "approved" by the FCC or FDA, etc... Not everything makes it to market or sees the light of day. A good example would be Tesla's free energy discovery and ultimately being screwed by JP Morgan in the end because it came down to profits. I'm sure that technology wasn't forgotten about.

       I think controlling the weather would be more expensive than it's worth. It'd be far easier to just take advantage of a natural natural disaster by making sure that the power stays out, that there's no running water, and that the sewage system backs up.

That's why sometimes, if elite control does exist, i sense demonic influence or something outside the normal human psyche.

       Maybe the demonic entity uses a certain blood line because their DNA is easily controlled. Yes, I've been listening to David Icke recently. It's plausible, but who really knows? Just a thought...

       I think theory is too strong a word. I'm often concerned that it might get confused with the scientific definition, rather than the colloquial one.

       I see where you're coming from (I didn't downvote you).
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory">
        Wikipedia states
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A scientific theory is "a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Reading that made me question what "natural world" really means.
       <a href="http://www.rationalskepticism.org/philosophy/what-is-the-natural-world-t22503.html">
        This sums
       </a>
       it up best in my head:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The natural world is all matter and energy, including all the matter and energy in other universes, if there is a multiverse"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I guess where I'm coming from is more hypothetical than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scientific method follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Formulate a question
       </li>
       <li>
        Hypothesis
       </li>
       <li>
        Prediction
       </li>
       <li>
        Test
       </li>
       <li>
        Analysis
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I have questions. I'm still working on the hypothesis.

       My take on Icke's lizard meme is this: the people and organizations he is exposing act very reptilian; that is, they only care about eating, fucking, and hunting their prey with a certain amount of cunning and venom.  The mind will present hard-to-understand impressions as symbols.  David icke's mind sees these forces and entities as lizards since that is what they most closely resemble to his universe of discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, I could be wrong, and there might actually be shape shifting lizard men controlling all of the world's governments from behind the scenes; feeding off "negative energy" and conducting blood sacrifice rituals in praise to forgotten gods and demons.

       Trahaearn apparently.  Good luck with pronunciation.  I just call her Tryst.

       Well, I prayed that she be banished from whence she came in the name of Jesus. I did this so that you may know the truth of forgiveness for debt through He who payed the debt on the cross, Jesus Christ. If you accept this message of salvation and reconnection towards the one true God, you will find eternal life. Keep me updated.

       Also, it is impossible for our species to be eternal.  Although I'll probably outlive most people because of my arrangement.  Still, only so much wear and tear can go into one mortal shell, even if I'm getting boosts from elsewhere.

       Our souls are eternal, yes? Tell me interesting stuff about Tryst. Can she tell you my name? I just want to verify (in some way) you're not trolling me. Which, if you are, it's fine; this conversation was fun either way.

       I think you're misinformed how daemons work...
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not mythical evil creatures that come and go as they please.  They're kind of trapped.  Imagine having no access to your senses, just sitting nearly alone in the dark.  That's life for 99% of the Daemon race.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, very rarely when the universe in its eternal shuffle lines up in just the right way, they can sort of brush our world.  Semi solid state, probably some physics explanation but I'm not a physics major.  Either way, long story short, they can latch onto what little exostential potential we humans have and form a semi-permanent bond.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, when I was born, I was late.  REALLY late.  Doctors were performing a C-section, but according to my parents, they weren't sure I was going to be alright.  Tryst stumbles into reality, and latches onto the first thing she's able to touch in the last several billion years or so, and that happens to be me.  Bond forms, we connect, and I survived the csection.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we're linked until I die.  Or she gets out.  Probably not going to get out ever.  That God guy knows how to do banishment.  Long and short of this link, is that I get access to her vitality, she gets access to physical sensations we take for granted, sight/sound/taset/touch, all that jazz.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not surprised you're worried, the church has been brainwashing generations to keep even these little contacts contained.  Its honestly inhuman what's been done to the daemon race.

       Fighting with Angels over something.  She can't really explain it to me in language that I can understand.  Long story short, Angels found a way to banish them all, God rose to power and did it, daemons are trapped alone forever.

       Also I want to point out that the very purpose of Daemons/Demons are to distract and deter you from your soul ever reconnecting with the one true God through Jesus. Henceforth, your entire life to this point could be lead through deception from Tryst. I would not trust her, even if it seems purposeful. Jesus is the only way to Heaven.

       Also, how can something that has existed for so long and will continue to exist after you, who more or less USES YOU really have any true affection FOR you. I don't think Tryst, by logic, can actually say she truly cares about you.

       As for the election theory, why would either of them want to do it? Why would Romney or people who want him to win trigger a disaster, the type of thing that cements an incumbent's support? If it's not caused by the president, anything terrible that happens to the country rallies everyone to support him. So maybe Obama did it? Why the fuck would Obama, on pace to win the election relatively easily barring any unforeseen game-changers, use science not even perceived to be anywhere close to where we're really at to trigger the biggest unforeseen game-changer in the history of the US and will kill tons of people?

       Well then I suppose starting with the north east wouldn't be a bad start. Home of the most populated city in the country.  The ny metropolitan area is home to over 18million.  In theory if population control is the reason you would want to hit the most densely populated city first while the residents are still skeptical about a natural disasters effect and less likely to evacuate or even prepare.  If for example a massive earthquake hit the west coast killing thousands and then the north east was warned of "Frankenstorm", you can expect a lot more people to take it seriously. Again, in theory, if this was a series of "weather" attacks. NY makes sense.

       I suppose if NYC descends into chaos (rioting, looting, etc.) then it would be an excuse to further police control over the citizens.  Similar to 9/11 as the excuse to pass Patriot after it had previously failed.

       I live in the northeast. Until there is ever actually a destructive hurricane near me I won't even consider this. I'm more inclined to think that it's just the news stations responding to a general need for collective drama. Of course, retailers and anyone selling anything are making money which further fuels the hysteria.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think that's a better explanation. I'm also not an expert on meteorology but I find that the weak link in this theory. I haven't seen any logical, ground-level descriptions of the processes that HAARP could use to actually create a hurricane. All the explanations are more like, "something, something, ionosphere, something, something, magic".
      </p>

       There's plenty out there that explain how weather manipulation is done, and possible to a large extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently a UofU study found a direct link to occurrences in the
       <a href="http://unews.utah.edu/news_releases/stratosphere-targets-deep-sea-to-shape-climate/">
        stratosphere and the circulation patterns in the deep sea
       </a>
       . If we were to be able to manipulate the patterns in the stratosphere, we could manipulate patterns in the sea. So can we manipulate those patterns?
       <a href="http://unews.utah.edu/news_releases/stratosphere-targets-deep-sea-to-shape-climate/">
        Of course we can!
       </a>
       Cloud seeding is nothing hidden or new. It's also been used in
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_warfare">
        warfare
       </a>
       . If the ability to manipulate the weather, and use it for purposeful destruction, wasn't even fathomable, then why would the Geneva Convention care to
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Modification_Convention">
        prohibit hostile use of weather manipulation
       </a>
       in 1977?!? They may as well prohibit the use of Sasquatch breeding, commet steering or light sabers in warfare - were it not possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is plenty to be found about the possible ways in which HAARP could manipulate weather. Why they would, well... thats anyone's guess from moment to moment, but to dismiss the possibilities is to succumb to ignorance.

       Blast, you beat me to it...was going to post about Sandy and HAARP but this is damn good and better than what I would have done.

      <p>
       HAARP is no secret and is easily accessible to the population so it really IS your choice to stay ignorant on the matter. This is just perfect for the people in control because now it gives them something else to work with to distract the population from the election and worry about food/shelter/water and then rebuilding.

       As far as the prediction goes...creepy indeed...I suppose we will have to wait and see what happens with all the FEMA bullshit. America the dumb and docile will believe anything the MSM throws at them.

       was on to something, it's right now. This post has  highlighted a lot of questions I've been asking myself. Even if this storm is not engineered, which I think it is. There are too many conveniences for Obama. He gets to send drones out early for the storm, his new FEMA troops are being deployed and the election campaign is on hold, possibly and potentially being disrupted in a big way. A nice time to prove the failed Fusion centers are good for something. Like a "shelter" I say concentration camp, but I'm extreme.

       I think it could allow the obama administration to deem the election void because of all the absent voters from the northeast. and with all the mass hysteria going on it would delay the election indefinitely and obama drafts new laws and BOOM martial law.

       ehhhh, slippery slope argument. I think hes going to use it more directly.
       <br/>
       If I wanted world domination this would be my thought process-
      </p>
      <p>
       As others have said, he will slam Romney for wanting to cut FEMA, but only if FEMA handles things well (he gets support for funding FEMA). I haven't heard the drone thing but it makes sense that they will use them to monitor the storm and damages/rescue efforts after.  So they hope people will start to like drones because they helped out. Couple this with the recent theft of 75% of SC's SSNs, you have support for government surveillance and things like PIPA, SOPA, etc.  Also, he can say "I was dealing with the hurricane instead of dealing with the election, I care more about Americans than I do about being elected." Thus, he sways some swing voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I will be interested to see the damage from the storm.  The more damaging the more I'll believe it was created, given that if they knew it was going to be bad and had time to plan, then they can handle the recovery extremely (better than they should be able to) well.

       It registered as a big quake, but talking to several locals, no one even noticed it when it happened. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a few bigger ones on that fault in the near future though.

       From the zerohedge comments, don't know the source. but very interesting stuff...
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        It appears Sandy has about 4 hours left before crossing the sharp SST gradient defining the Gulf Stream. That will signal the end of intensifying any further, tropically. But this is when baroclinic energy will really start hitting the storm.
It almost defies logic, this storm. Think about it...
For the last 4 days there's been something going against this storm which would have killed off most other storms but, conversely, there was also some atmospheric mechanism at play counteracting its main hindrance.
It went through the roughest terrain of Cuba, but did so as an intensifying, accelerating storm. Came through on the other side only 5kt weaker than she went in.
Then Sandy met the upper low over the southeastern Gulf. Extremely dry air through a deep layer of the atmosphere, 50kts of shear. Piece of cake. She'll just place herself within the divergent sector of the shear pattern to maintain.
Found a small niche and changed just enough, structurally, to develop an inner core just as she hit the Gulf Stream, to maximize as best a storm of this size could, the additional heat energy provided.
This brings us to where we are at present and in the near future. Leaving the Gulf Stream, yes, but entering a baroclinic environment ripe for explosive development of a cyclone transitioning from tropical to extra-tropical.
Every time this storm met a challenge; mountains, shear, dry air, cold waters, it not only shrugged it off, but grew stronger. It's like this storm is destined to chart a course for the worst-case scenario.
That brings us to tonight when the storm is expected to make landfall. High tide. High astronomical tide. Right angle to the coastline. Bottlenecks and bays. Most densely populated region of the country. Record IKE. A once-in-200 year wind event in a region inland clear cut since the last big event such as this (before any reliable records were kept).

       I like the way you made this post.  You presented facts, some of which I didn't already know (like that the Geneva Conventions actually directly address the issue of weather modification), and you were logical.  I hate the way that so many posts around here just state some weird theory and then just assumes that the theory is fact.

       It was in July when a corporation formed within Haida Gwaii (the epicentre of the first earthquake) launched an artificial plankton bloom by sprinkling iron dust onto the pacific.  The largest project of it's kind.

       There was actually a chemtrail video I was watching from this guy in Colorado who is pretty insistent on the use of chemtrails being a thing.  A commenter on the video said "I've been noticing them do this around BC for the past week".  Another commenter comes back a day later announcing that BC had a 7.7 earthquake.  I'm gonna find that shit now.

       Directing a hurricane toward the Northeast would be huge for business. And it has been. It gets the economic waterwheel moving. All the cash generated from insurance claims, and reconstruction/landscaping contracts. The fact that every home depot has sold out of generators and grocery store selves are barren. That's billions and billions in revenue. At this point, the cost of manipulating weather is probably worth it to them in order to stimulate the economy by the 10's of billions. If any of you are interested in Terence McKenna's "novelty theory," which we are descending into at light speed right now; weather modification would be the cherry on top for what constitutes as "novel". It's interesting to see this mayhem panning out on a graph.

       This hurricane is just being hyped by the media to politically benefit Obama, because Romney wants to cut FEMA and disaster relief funding.

       What no onme has told you these FEMA re-education camps and the end game is a communistic reliance of having FEMA for food dsitribution centers in the whole US, there would be little independant groceries still with all this efficiemcy. You won't be able to buy a candy bar, you will have to buy them with stamps and those will be rationed.

       Someday you all will realize that sometimes, bad things happen. It doesn't mean there's a group of rich jews twirling their mustaches. Nature happens, and sometimes it sucks. If you're in the zone it's going to hit, prepare for it. If not, do something worthwhile... stop making up stories about how the big bad gubmint man is coming to kill you.

       I didn't say it was right, just that for us to be taken seriously we need to look at ALL sides of something. It is pretty obvious that TPTB want to deem everything "climate change", when there is very clearly evidence of changes unrelated to our atmosphere's CO2 content. Do I think climate change is a complete hoax? I don't really know anymore, but I'm not at the point where I'd say that. Although I am
       <em>
        certain
       </em>
       that the changes going on around the earth are NOT a result of
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       CO2 increase.
       <em>
        And
       </em>
       we still haven't figured out
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       they would engineer, or steer, or increase the size of this superstorm, so I think it is just as plausible that they could have been trying to minimize the size of it (obviously not for the sake of being "good guys" or, as you said, we would have heard about it).
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole deal with climate change seems fishy in regards to a possible problem-reaction-solution situation, just as went on with the false flag of 9/11 and (the solution) the war in the middle east. Just hypothesize for a second that climate change as a result of emissions isn't real but they are trying to make us believe it is real. But they can't be
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       pushy about it, or more people would get suspicious, so climate change is "under the radar" in many senses, not discussed at the debates, etc. Once it gets to the point that we are
       <em>
        demanding
       </em>
       that climate change be addressed and "green jobs" and all this other stuff they say "okay okay fine", and then we play right into there hand. The only thing I'm missing is what they could possibly benefit from "green jobs" which I have yet to figure out, and it seems pretty hard to figure out. But these people have decades to work out the logistics of these "plans", and it would be silly to think that some guys on the internet could figure it out in a single conversation. But just because we can't figure it out doesn't make it any less of something to look at. I mean they control the media, and big oil, mainstream everything pretty much, and when you see companies like shell putting commercials out about green jobs and helping the climate change, it should cause everyone to raise an eyebrow and think "what is the agenda here?".

       They are contracts for bullets, not physical bullets. Why they'd need them is speculation, but they don't just have this massive amount of an irregular amount of bullets.

       Thanks for the clarification.  Didn't really check into it. Just sort of stuck it in there.  But from one explanation I saw it was a 4 year contract. I believe it was for 2011-2014.  May be off by a year in either direction, but if that was true then we could assume half of that contract has already or is in the process of being fulfilled.

       It's really impossible to know, but practicality does check out.
      </p>
      <p>
       ATK sells them a shit load of bullets for a discount since they bought so many, DHS eats it up. They don't even have to fulfill the entire contract, they
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       purchase up to x amount of bullets via the contract, so it's possible they just got a great deal out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do need
       <strong>
        a lot
       </strong>
       of bullets to train though. Although the two huge contracts are pretty excessive.

       Not sure if anyone commented on this (too lazy to read at the moment..sorry) but did anyone question the path of Sandy? It's original path was to go out to the Atlantic Ocean after hitting the Caribbean. Not many natural hurricanes form a complete 's' formation and curve back towards the east coast again.

       No I don't think anyone actually mentioned that. But yes. The path is strange and had to have a multiple storm/pressure systems affecting each other in the right way to achieve that result. Rare but not impossible naturally. Our world is becoming a strange place where it seems more and more unlikely things seem to happen that it gets hard to tell which are natural anomalies vs influenced anomalies.

       Very true. Only happens rarely. But I looked through hurricane paths in the past 10 years or so, and nothing can be compared. It's quite odd. Also thought it was funny the other hurricane that was supposedly named "sandy" as well, that everyone thinks was a practice run, is unnamed on the official hurricane tracking site.

       If Hurricane Sandy is indeed a 'weaponized' hurricane, do you think it's just a coincidence that it is happening right before the election? Do you think it could be a way for Obama to secure his reelection?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I realize this is a stretch and that he most likely didn't cause it. But if the storm ends up being really bad, and he is able to handle the situation well, it will definitely help him.

       Yes, you're right. I just wanted to mention the coincidence that it is happening very close to the election. He most likely didn't cause it (I should have said that I realize it's a stretch), but if it ends up being bad, and he handles the whole situation really well, it will definitely benefit him. It just came to mind since Bush was criticized a lot over his handling (or lack of handling) of Hurricane Katrina. America wants to feel safe in a disaster, so if the storm is bad, and Obama actually does something to help, Americans will have that in mind on November 6.

       I think it could allow the obama administration to deem the election void because of all the absent voters from the northeast. and with all the mass hysteria going on it would delay the election indefinitely and obama drafts new laws and BOOM martial law.

       Wait Wait Wait... you're telling me that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has plans in place for mass casualty situations? Get right out of town!
      </p>
      <p>
       And a reddit user said that a family friend who is in the military got briefed on an 'unknown disaster' which would cause massive floods on the east Coast? I wonder if a hurricane would qualify as an 'unknown disaster.' The reddit user probably meant a legion of floating assholes that would flood the streets with baby diarrhea, you know, the really green kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good thing you have a wikipedia source to back up the argument about weather modification! Also the fact that the source link for the hurricane modifying section is dead, and was to a sensationalist pseudo-science documentary anyway only serves to better demonstrate how our state led media has us by the balls and is drip feeding us bullshit about why earthquakes and hurricanes happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, it seems like a certainty that martial law will be declared because of this. Probably worldwide martial law at that. Lets face it, if a hurricane is going to hit New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, it might as well hit the whole fucking world because those are the only places that matter. We'll be calling Chris Christie 'Supreme Chancellor' before the week is out.

       they would engineer, or steer, or increase the size of this superstorm, so I think it is just as plausible that they could have been trying to minimize the size of it (obviously not for the sake of being "good guys" or, as you said, we would have heard about it).

       This whole deal with climate change seems fishy in regards to a possible problem-reaction-solution situation, just as went on with the false flag of 9/11 and (the solution) the war in the middle east. Just hypothesize for a second that climate change as a result of emissions isn't real but they are trying to make us believe it is real. But they can't be
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       pushy about it, or more people would get suspicious, so climate change is "under the radar" in many senses, not discussed at the debates, etc. Once it gets to the point that we are
       <em>
        demanding
       </em>
       that climate change be addressed and "green jobs" and all this other stuff they say "okay okay fine", and then we play right into there hand. The only thing I'm missing is what they could possibly benefit from "green jobs" which I have yet to figure out, and it seems pretty hard to figure out. But these people have decades to work out the logistics of these "plans", and it would be silly to think that some guys on the internet could figure it out in a single conversation. But just because we can't figure it out doesn't make it any less of something to look at. I mean they control the media, and big oil, mainstream everything pretty much, and when you see companies like shell putting commercials out about green jobs and helping the climate change, it should cause everyone to raise an eyebrow and think "what is the agenda here?".
