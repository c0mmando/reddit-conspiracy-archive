It wont matter who wins, neither of them will push for a progressive movement.  The only difference is that Romney is socially accepted as a conman, and Obama can do no wrong.

<p>Can I ask why? Did you do any research on him and see that his short time in senate involved voting in favor of every shitty bush policy we love to rail against? Honestly the only people who really wanted &#39;hope and change&#39; supported Kucinich or Gravel, those who supported Obama were just swept up in the MSM built hype and wanted to vote for a (white friendly) black guy to be president. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my call. Dissent and strong distrust has been orchestrated on purpose over these past few years -- anybody remember Ron Paul&#39;s primaries being blatantly stolen on mainstream TV earlier this year? The dissent reaches a head when Romney is intentionally given the presidency, after being clearly shown to be a liar and an inferior choice, after it is made clear that only fools who trust their idiot media will elect him. He is given the presidency and mass outrage appears to develop organically on the internet -- much of it orchestrated itself, of course -- and also hyped up and popularized by the TV. Once things really set into motion, once people are really legitimately pissed off and ready to act, probably after an agent provocateur or two sets them off, then, only then, do we enter into WW3 while on the dog leash of Israel, while our economy simultaneously collapses at the same time. We will probably see pandemics as well as &quot;natural&quot; disasters while this goes down also -- a true and believable apocalypse scenario. Then America will fall completely -- people will believe it is the woman Mystery Babylon as it is destroyed. Israel will also be completely destroyed -- we will be told this has happened due to the fulfillment of Revelation prophecy and the return of Christ.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to bet at the craps table, bet HARD! All chips in baby. Can&#39;t wait.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t have a clue in hell. You tell me. Anyone who answers that question is either a genius or a fraud. The American economy is still in the grip of a serious crisis; they have an employment problem that is going to get worse. One of the strengths of the United States lay in people&#39;s ability to move from one job to another. That has now come to a halt. They can&#39;t relocate because they can&#39;t sell their home. <strong>The United States is finished</strong>, at least for the moment. There will be more oversight, but people will always come up with new financial products that are not amenable to oversight. What&#39;s happening is that the firefighters keep arriving after the fire.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well.. The way I got it figured there are at least two major factions in the US government. One represents the old money of europe and the their ancient dynastic interests. This faction is the democrats. The other faction is an amalgam of modern and western noblesse and various rich people and these are represented by the republicans.</p>

<p>These two factions work together on some projects and work against each other on others. Mostly they are all aligned around the idea that they are the privileged and rich. So they don&#39;t want to undermine their status in that way as a group even though they are different factions.</p>

<p>However they each have their own particular sources of revenue and interest and that is what they get us to fight for. For instance the Bush family has a lot of connections in Kuwait and Iraq.</p>

<p>If you ever read about ancient roman politics you would see the correlation. The old romans were the same way. The rich were divided there too but they still worked together to maintain their class against the plebs. When that changed and the &quot;populares&quot; style &quot;democratic&quot; party if you will emerged is when the civil wars really got under way in earnest and their republic was torn to pieces.</p>
