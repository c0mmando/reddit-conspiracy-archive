       So, I went to vote, and I have not moved, nor have I missed an election for 12  years.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the sudden this year. My right to vote is challenged "had been challenged and heard by the board of elections at a hearing held before the election, and the board determined that the challenge had merit"
      </p>
      <p>
       After that, I filled out a provisional ballot which I have little doubt won't be counted, and when turning it in the man at the poll said "Boy we sure have seen a lot of these today, who knows why so many have been flagged for provisional only"
      </p>
      <p>
       and I took my leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm withholding my judgement on this until I see how the county turns out on votes, because I feel judging by every election thus far the outcome should be rather obvious if there is some bullcrap going on.

       Yes I realize I won't confirm anything.

       However my county is traditionally... for many many years a outstandingly republican county. Ridiculously so.
      </p>

       If that changes, it will not confirm anything, it will just make me a bit more skeptical that's all.

       It's a Republican Secretary of State, so if anything weird is happening, it will be to benefit the republican party.  Do you mind saying which party you are voting for.  Would be interesting if all the challenges are for one particular party or not.

       I voted democratic 4 years ago, and same this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember this happening before too, I donno if it was during bush or clinton though, but it was a long time ago. I remember that about 40,000 Ohio provisional votes were thrown out though out of something like 100,000.

       Dang those bastards.  The mainstream media is playing up the role of the provisional ballots today too, like they know something is going happen or is according to plan.  Who knows.  I hope we don't have any problems.  Thanks for sharing your story because others might be having the same situation.

       Ah, the provisional ballot.  The supposed savior of the otherwise disenfranchised voter.  Once you peel back the curtain and find out what happens to those votes, you'll never look at elections the same way again.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a nutshell, those ballots are usually never counted at all.  That might upset some people...until you discover that most REGULAR votes are never counted.

       Let me point you in the right direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, Google the phrase "who actually counts the votes"
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, consider the following: How can you confirm that your vote was counted? Or are you taking it on faith that it was? Who are you relying on/trusting to count your vote? Do you know who they are? What are their motivations for counting your vote accurately? Has the voting system ever been vetted for accuracy? Is it in the interest of the powers that be to do so? Or is it more important to them to maintain the ILLUSION of accuracy?

       Californian here, and I would have to agree completely about the fuckupery of the provincial ballot. Firstly, we had about 15 people come into my precinct saying they never received nor signed up for a VBM (Vote by mail) ballot, meaning their only means of voting was through a provincial ballot (a little backstory, I was serving as a polling center assistant for the day, and I processed about 400 people in the precinct I was assigned too). Essentially, they were told their ballot would indeed be counted, however, I was highly skeptical. Furthermore, thinking about the 15 or so people coming in being forced to use a provincial ballot, than multiplying that by about 100, you get close to maybe 2,000 uncounted votes in one city alone. While in a presidential race that might not be a massive swing, that certainly effects local/district policies and politicians. Very, very disheartening to see how fucked up our politic system is at this point.
Edit: sorry if anything sounds convoluted/retarded but I'm typing this on my phone after working 16 straight hours today.
