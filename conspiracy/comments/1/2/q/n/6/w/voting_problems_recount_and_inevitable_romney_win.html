<p>This worries me, say what you will about Obama but he&#39;s not the guy we want to lose... Romney is going to really hurt this country and we are going to witness a civil divide unlike no other if he wins this bullshit...</p>

<p>Going to vote now, I will post any nonsense I encounter...</p>

<p>Also going to a church to vote is wrong, they shouldn&#39;t have any hand in this considering how fucked up religion is in this country and we obviously know religious folks love their mitt..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that either candidate is acceptable would be a logical testament to voting. In that the elites select 2 candidates of which both are acceptable to them (them being the 1% as opposed to the 99% of us which may not agree) and allow us to select between the two. That would mean that votes count. That would imply that we decide between the two candidates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, matters is a personal perspective. Does it matter to the elites whether Obama or Romney is elected, not likely. Does it matter to us? Yes, it can be quite the difference. Sure, maybe not on the issues that matter to <em>them</em> (it seems the M.I.C increases regardless, though maybe wars aren&#39;t sought in the same fashion - Obama seems a lot more reserved than Romney in this regard, I guess we might have to wait and see to know for sure).</p>

<p>But those aren&#39;t the only issues. I&#39;m not interested in voting for a politician that wants to speed up the process by which the elites will pillage the U.S. A lot of people say Obama is doing/will do this. But to be honest, I don&#39;t really see it that way and I think those people are coming from personal biases about his natural positions on things like guns and tax policy. </p>

<p>Man that&#39;s interesting. I haven&#39;t thought about that particular scenario, but r/politics is ripe with talk of voter fraud or manipulation already... What a shitstorm this could be... The way information is much more open than it was in 2000/2004, I don&#39;t know if an election could be stolen like that again without being &quot;obvious&quot;. Anyway, wild times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are just another lefty liberal drone and a fucking moron.  A church is an empty building on a Tuesday and there are a lot of them which is convenient.  Maybe people who go to churches do love mitt Romney, but wtf are you worried about the vote is anonymous.  I guess no one who goes to church could ever possibly be a democrat.  Your vote is an illusion and the machines aren&#39;t off they are doing exactly what they were intended to do which is rig the election.  Furthermore, Romney and Obama are two sides of the same coin so it doesn&#39;t make a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize for calling you a fucking moron OP. I&#39;m very frustrated right now. I voted for a candidate who has a snowball&#39;s chance in hell of winning with the foreknowledge that my vote wouldn&#39;t matter even if I voted for either of the front runners. Still, that shit about voting in a church is absurd. They are numerous and empty on Tuesdays and are ideal for a polling place. If you know who you are voting for beforehand what does it matter the political affiliations of the churchgoers? </p>

About the voting place issue, I haven&#39;t really thought much about it- I tend to agree with you, however.
