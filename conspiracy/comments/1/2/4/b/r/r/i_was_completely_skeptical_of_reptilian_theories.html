        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Then I started reading DMT drug reports in accredited scientific studies, some in forums. I start seeing a consistency: Contact with alien beings but one in particular showed up. Reptiles, humanoid reptiles, alligator-like, scaly skin, most of the time malevolent in nature. Reports of rape, probing and so forth. </p>

<p>After hearing about so many mentions from people who never knew about the subject beforehand, I feel there is something to this Reptilian phenomenon. </p>

<p>If these beings can invade the thoughts of DMT users, why not the world&#39;s powerful?</p>

<p>To be quite frank, I&#39;m scared of this reality. Anyone else having similar thoughts and theories?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how you say you were skeptical like any &quot;rational&quot; person should be. How is it rational to disregard stories from multiple cultures, from hundreds of people, and the fact that people have see such things on DMT?</p>

<p>It actually isn&#39;t &quot;rational&quot; at all to only believe what you yourself see. You need to separate your ego and how you view your intellect from your gut instinct and what you feel in your heart.</p>

<p>How could something written about in many cultures, seen by many people, felt by so many..how could it NOT be real on some level?</p>

<p>The brain is powerful but the MIND is not just the cells and chemicals in your brain. Many eastern cultures have known this - your consciousness is a waveform. In tibetan yogic dreaming you can discover what they consider your true name - it&#39;s a harmonic sound, a sine wave.</p>

<p>This waveform is locked into certain frequencies that we identify as types of brainwaves. A Sanford University experiment on OOB and Lucid Dreaming really explains all this quite well.</p>

<p>During Lucid dreaming some of the subject&#39;s brain waves spiked up higher than they expected.</p>

<p>Some drugs affect the chemical, DMT is a chemical that affects the wave. It tunes your brainwaves and sends you to a part of the Dreamtime that is close to physical reality. And so tens of thousands report the same types of experiences and strange situations.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a recreational drug. You want this pure, not cut with anything or handled by unscrupulous people. You try this shit the way it&#39;s meant to be tried and you&#39;ll have a remarkably different experience than treating it poorly.</p>

<p>When you do DMT properly you don&#39;t &quot;see&quot; anything. Your consciousness is temporarily transported to another place. If you are only seeing things added to your current environment then it&#39;s not a proper DMT experience and is likely not pure DMT.</p>

<p>DMT is not a trip. It&#39;s an OBE.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m sure some of the local skeptics will have a lot of fun with what I said. Doesn&#39;t matter to me at all. True intellect does not feed the ego. It works in concert with intuition, instinct and memory to attain illumination. Get far the hell away from the pop culture polarization of &quot;science&quot; and &quot;spirituality&quot; and stop feeling irrational or strange about things you believe or KNOW.</p>

<p>Precisely.  I agree with everything you have stated in this post, and DMT should be approached with reverence and respect; all in the proper set and setting (which is not to &quot;get fucked up&quot;).</p>

<p>What you have mentioned regarding the brainwaves: here is an interesting experiment that I have conducted the few times I was privileged enough to acquire the sacrament of DMT.  Partake of DMT at the climax of a ritual invocation of what Thelemites might refer to as &quot;The Holy Guardian Angel.&quot;  The apparatus of Ceremonial Magic for Theurgy is one big machine designed to force the mind into a different spectrum of brainwave activity to commune with these &quot;divine&quot; forces.  Of course, you can also contact something(s) rather infernal.  The repeated daily practice of Ceremonial Magick will train the consciousness to slip into the desired spectrum upon entering the environment of the Temple; complete with strongly anchored triggers, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I were making it up. That would have made my life way more manageable over the past year. I hear smoking DMT is way different than taking it through a tea, which is what I did. I know I took an extremely heavy dose too and may have even experienced serotonin syndrome, which would explain some of my negative reaction. From everyone I&#39;ve talked to my experience is really uncommon. It could just be that I had a traumatic childhood, and that I could be one of those unlucky ones predisposed to psychosis, and this was the final trigger. There are significant findings that suggest people predisposed to mental health issues can have them triggered by hallucinogens. It&#39;s probably 50 percent what I brought to the table and 50 percent what DMT brought to the table. I&#39;m actually curious about your positive experiences smoking it, and kind of jealous too. What happens to you when you smoke it?</p>

<p>See, anyone saying they enjoy DMT and comparing it to a trip - probably some college student that didn&#39;t even have DMT. I&#39;ve seen kids smoking a snowcone thinking it was DMT. I could probably sell half of the people in this thread oregano an they&#39;d think it was DMT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. I&#39;ve done other drugs in the past, so I&#39;m no stranger to psychedelic experiences. After DMT, though, doing LSD seemed like drinking a cup of coffee in comparison. I&#39;m also a reluctant atheist. I don&#39;t think there CAN&#39;T be a god, I just have yet to be convinced of its existence so far. Doing ayahuasca felt like the closest I&#39;ve had to a spiritual experience. It&#39;s too bad it was a negative one. The group I was with was really friendly. There were classical musicians from Brazil who played songs all night, and the entire group of 60 people sang in Portuguese. You&#39;re supposed to throw up on ayahuasca to purge some of the drug and also to &quot;purge the negative emotions in your life.&quot; I never threw up, so I had probably a couple pints of the tea in my system, which may explain why my experience was so hardcore. EVERYONE else around was puking into these buckets and weeping. A really strange scene to say the least. There was a shaman in charge and he saw that I was having a rough go of it. He came to look after me and in what I can only describe as a &quot;shared hallucination,&quot; he grew a thousand arms out of his body and waved them over me. I&#39;ve later learned this is called &quot;shamanic passing.&quot; I saw the shaman grow these thousands of arms on other people also and he used them to draw black spirits out of people&#39;s bodies. It definitely seemed like he willed these arms out of himself and that he knew exactly what he was doing. </p>

<p>All of this rams right up against my materialistic / scientific world view, and I still haven&#39;t figured out how to process things, or what I believe now. All I know is the mind, or the world of the spirit (if such a thing exists), is so much bigger than I had ever imagined, and bigger than I&#39;ll ever be able to comprehend. Feel free to ask any more questions!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t fear the stories of a few people. They probably had a bad set and setting. If you look at the numbers psychedelics are by the safest drug, they have the lowest active dose and the lowest risk of dependence. Many people (there&#39;s a study of it) describe their LSD experience as the most, or one of the most, profound experiences of their lives. So if you do things carefully and don&#39;t have underlying mental health problems, you should be fine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;ve taken DMT many times, I&#39;ve never experienced reptilian entities, I have however though, communicated with something that was clearly much more intelligent than I, which was able to answer questions I had as soon as I was thinking them, answers which made sense and answers that I couldn&#39;t have known. So I do believe the experience is real, and for the people commenting saying &quot;it&#39;s the drugs making you think this&quot; you clearly haven&#39;t done DMT, and would venture to say you don&#39;t know what DMT actually is. DMT is pretty much in everything, DMT is in you right now, every night when you dream, it&#39;s the DMT, DMT is in grass, tree bark, just about everything organic on the planet. Our body has a very efficient system to monitor the levels of DMT that are being metabolized. Once you take it, there are antibodies produced to get rid of excess inside of you. It&#39;s easy to say the person is experiencing something that isn&#39;t real, but DMT isn&#39;t like LSD where you can easily not realize what is going on. With DMT you are fully alert, no confusion, and extremely coherent. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tested this with friends taking notes before and fired off questions that I didn&#39;t know the answer to, gotten responses that turned out to be true. This experience has never been negative. I call BS on reptilians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then you should probably keep your misinformed comments to yourself until you do some more research and educate yourself on these topics. Just disregarding indigenous medicines as &quot;drugs&quot; is a very ignorant approach to these discussions. I replied to your comment because it is a timeless example of human ignorance and laziness. Whether the comment was made a second ago or a year ago it doesn&#39;t change the fact it is a gross over simplification and just plain old stupid... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you define as a drug other cultures define as a medicine or a tool to alter consciousness. I do not know about extra dimensional reptilian humanoids, but if they do exist I am sure they are invading our thoughts, society, governments and armies without us even noticing. It could be that in altered states humans tune the frequency of their consciousness to a certain level that allows them to see these beings and other entities not usually observed in our normal conscious states. Obviously, all of this type of conjecture assumes that there is way more to our reality than we as a species realize. Who knows, nothing is impossible!!</p>
