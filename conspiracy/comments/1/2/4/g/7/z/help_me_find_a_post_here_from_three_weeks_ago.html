        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>About three weeks ago there was a post here from someone claiming to have knowledge of an upcoming disaster. The poster claimed that her military relative had leaked information to her regarding preparations for large scale flooding on the east coast. She predicted that the flooding would arrive in &quot;about 4 weeks&quot;.</p>

<p>Well it looks like her prediction may come true.  Predictions of hurricane Sandy&#39;s path now put the storm as slamming into the mid atlantic.  It looks like this could be the worst storm in living memory causing widespread flooding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I think they have been able to disrupt hurricanes for a while. That they do it while they are still close to Africa. But that they can also, crudely, steer them. And Katrina was steered. But this is still controlled by the government. Why would Obama allow this as long as he is still president. True, he doesn&#39;t know everything or control everything, but enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, this <em>is</em> weird, but we are really getting into la-la land if we are going to start saying that they can not only make hurricanes, but decide where they are going to hit.  Someone has to provide some credible scientific hypothesis how this could occur.  Its possible the OP was just fucking with us?  I mean, so far all the OP did was predict a hurricane in hurricane season.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, November is hurricane season. Second, there have been dozens of predictions on r/conspiracy. Let me make an analogy for you. </p>

<p>A blade of grass is in the middle of the golf course,  and all of a sudden, a golf ball lands on it. The blade of grass feels so lucky that out of the hundred of thousands of grass blades the ball landed on it. But the truth is the ball had to land on A grass blade no matter what, so the coincidence is only in the grass blade&#39;s mind.</p>

<p>This is the same situation here. Everyone ignores all the other bullshit posts that are written here, but the second one out of the hundreds of posts comes even remotely true, everyone accepts it as fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sooo... you are saying that because you believe 95% of the things in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to be false... we should discount the other 5% even though it might be true? We accept the fact that he made the prediction and was on the money. That&#39;s a fact. Supposedly coming from a military source is just a mind fuck as usual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m not saying that at all. I don&#39;t think you understood my comparison.</p>

<p>Coincidences aren&#39;t coincidences at all. The human mind draws connections between two things and labels both those events as coincidence even though it isn&#39;t a coincidence at all.</p>

<p>This post predicted a hurricane in hurricane season and everyone is freaking out because it came remotely true. Parts of this story are true, however, some parts aren&#39;t. A military meeting wouldn&#39;t make exaggerations by saying &quot;All the northeast is going to be underwater.&quot; Certain parts of the north east have a few feet of water, but the post made it seem like the entire northeast would basically become part of the ocean.</p>

<p>Predicting the right time is even less of a coincidence. The OP didn&#39;t give exact dates, he just said &quot;in a few weeks.&quot; That can be interpreted as anywhere from 2-10 weeks by most people. If the hurricane happened in December even, people would refer to the post as predicting the future when it really hasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Also, there is absolutely no credibility in the other post. He says he was invited into a secret military meeting. And for some reason a super secret branch of the government that is developing the ability to control mother earth has invited an ordinary citizen into what could be one of the most secretive meetings in the country, and that citizen just shared his information on the internet.</p>

<p>If the government really for some reason had trusted this ordinary person with information that could start a world war, I can assure you that they would keep track on his internet usage and see what he posts. The government already has admitted to eavesdropping on people who are on their &quot;watch list&quot; for suspicion of terrorist acts. You are telling me they wouldn&#39;t keep watch on a citizen that has the knowledge that the U.S. government has developed a weapon stronger than an atomic bomb? Ridiculous. </p>
