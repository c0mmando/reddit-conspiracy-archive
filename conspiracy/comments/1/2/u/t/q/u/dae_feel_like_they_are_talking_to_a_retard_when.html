<p>When you are born, you are born in a country. That makes you a citizen of that country whether you like it or not. This means that you are required to follow all the rules that your country establishes. If you dont like it, then perhaps your country gives you the opportunity to change rules/laws you dont like through a popular vote. If you still dont like it, you are free to start your own country, provided the land you claim for yourself is not already owned by some other country, then you will have to take it by force. Good luck with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why such an aggressive tone? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So then its my sovereign right to beat you to death and take all your possessions. Is this correct?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, no, you are not correct. The initiation of force is never a function of personal sovereignty. I understand that you may be perfectly fine with coercing others to give you what you want, but know that once you commit such an act of aggression, you very well may receive a heavy wrath of arbitration from your victim or an agent of your victim. You don&#39;t have the &quot;freedom&quot; to hinder another human being&#39;s volition. Some unprincipled person such as yourself would suit better in a heavily governed society where the institution with the monopoly of violence can oppress others for you... You wouldn&#39;t want to have to take an oath of non-aggression because you may be too used to sucking at the tit of the plunderer. </p>

<p>Sovereignty is about Self-Ownership and Self-Determination. If we are born of a country that makes us property of the state, what is being a citizen, really? As an infant, did I willingly choose to be collateral for the debt of a government? What divine right does government have to sidestep morality, or are we to assume that murder and theft are moral because the State does it? </p>

<p>What is a citizen anyway, a human resource to be exploited? Are we not, therefore, human-livestock to be farmed for good-production; chattel for all of our future generations to compensate for the debt of this institutionalized gang? Should I assume that you support slavery? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I am saying is that if you are a sovereign citizen, there is nothing to stop me from taking your car because I like it. Or robbing you because I need the money. Or burning your house down because I like fire. Or killing you because I wanted to know what it was like. And if you call the cops, or the fire dept, or an ambulance, then you are utilizing a service established to assist the citizens of that particular country. As a citizen of the United States, I am required by my own moral code to follow the laws that have been established to protect all of its citizens. If you are a &quot;sovereign citizen&quot; (of which, the legal implications, by the way have never held up in court) then you are saying that you are outside of those laws. (quite literally an &quot;outlaw&quot;) and as such, there is nothing you can do to stop me or anyone else from doing whatever they want to you.</p>

<p>Rights? If you are a sovereign citizen, you have relinquished any rights. If you mean the right to defend yourself, that&#39;s fine. But what all this sovereign citizen bullshit does is create a society of the weak vs the strong. There will always be people that take from the weak and there will always be weak to be taken advantage of. If you organize a society where you establish rules to prevent the strong from destroying the weak, you have created your own laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>good link..&quot;the premise that privacy is about hiding a wrong. It&#39;s not. Privacy is an inherent human right.....For if we are observed in all matters, we are constantly under threat of correction, judgment, criticism, even plagiarism of our own uniqueness. We become children, fettered under watchful eyes, constantly fearful that -- either now or in the uncertain future -- patterns we leave behind will be brought back to implicate us, by whatever authority has now become focused upon our once-private and innocent acts. We lose our individuality, because everything we do is observable and recordable.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is when the people who carry the role of good guys are actually bad guys in the power structure.</p>

<p>For example, there was a troll prick on AOL once who used sockpuppets and pretended to be a woman, and conned phone numbers from guys he hated. Then he had his brother in law who was a cop do a reverse lookup on the number and pull private data out of databases available to law enforcement. Once the troll had the address and personal data, he turned off power to the guys&#39; homes, and did other things.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the point: there are corrupt or rotten people  in official positions, and the less you have to give out to anyone, the safer you will be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s your use of retard that I&#39;m taking offense to, but I think you&#39;re the ignorant one. Do you have any idea how much effot it takes to spy on someone? I dont know about other people, but when I say it, I&#39;m thinking that since I have nothing to hide, the government isn&#39;t going to spend the resources required to actually spy on me. And, well, it&#39;s true. I work in a law firm and a lot of the cases we take have to do with federal drug offenders, and a major aspect of those cases is surveillance. It&#39;s a fucking project taking thousands of man hours and a shit ton of money. I&#39;m not saying that we do t have a right to privacy or that I don&#39;t value that right. I&#39;m just saying that unless you&#39;re doing something wrong, the government (usually)  doesn&#39;t give a shit what you&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>I also realize this is like posting a republican/conservative opinion on politics, so I&#39;m fully expecting to be down voted. But I needed to get my two cents in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the argument then is that the definition of bad is what needs to be amended not the secrecy of the act deemed bad.</p>

<p>We wouldn&#39;t want to protect a murderers right to cover up the fact he murdered someone, we demand transparency when we are worried people might be doing bad things in government, people do bad things in their private lives too and the argument works both ways. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it depends, because ultimately if no-one thinks anything is bad, the statement in the title actually works. No-one has anything to hide because no-one will incur negative consequences as a result.</p>

<p>If we think something deserves negative consequences, we want to know so we can impose them. If we don&#39;t we don&#39;t care if we know. The question is then, what deserves negative consequences and not what should we have a right to know about people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha, wow. You dont know what to say to me, so you post about it? </p>

<p>Seems like you took my words into your own interpretation. I also said, if you&#39;re in the wrong place at the wrong time, and theres other factors that go into this. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t make this into a good vs evil showdown of epic proportions. Life isn&#39;t a movie. Yes, we probably have a soon to be revolution..But there&#39;s no reason to worry, if you get over your perception of materialism. That&#39;s all im trying to say. </p>

<p>PS. African-American people were always treated horrible by the US, it&#39;s no different today</p>
