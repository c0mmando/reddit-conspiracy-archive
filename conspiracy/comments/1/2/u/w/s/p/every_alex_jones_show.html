    <div class="md"><p>Spot on.</p>

<p>He&#39;s Zionist-run controlled opposition; no more, no less.</p>

<p>Also a fucking <em>terrible</em> interviewer because he NEVER lets his guests talk without interruption or raving.</p>

<p>If a subject is not pre-cleared with his boss and the guy that signs his paychecks, rabid Zionist Jeffrey Smulyan (CEO/Owner of Emmis &#39;Hebrew for truth&#39; Communications) it is taboo on his show. If a guest happens to mention anything not absolutely &quot;kosher&quot; he has a fit--then cancels any upcoming interviews that guest might have.</p>

<p>Mr. Smulyan does NOT like his beloved Israel slandered. Plus Alex&#39;s Jewish wife/CIA handler Kelly Nichols most likely gives him the old &quot;cock block&quot; if he even entertains the thought of having an &quot;anti-semite&quot; (definition: someone Jews hate) on his show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I can say is, yes he is a over the top, however ayn rand was not ignorant, and was very smart, top of the school in two different schools in academic performance. There is no question to the social problems that lead to collapse of a society are present, and if anything alex gets his predictions wrong because they react and back off slow the collapse. Because in a world outside of the majority of our focus there are some individuals with so much power and money that they can alone adjust entire nations economies. The rigging of the global interest rates, the housing crisis around the western world Europe losing 10 trillion of the 12.6 or so lost globally?</p>

<p>maybe hes moving listeners focus in the wrong direction but there is still good in his work if there is negative intentions or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, with a bunch of idiots like you who hate anyone who makes money for their own, its no wonder the economy sucks.</p>

<p>Its called free market, its called economy, he succeeded and he could and should be getting millions and I for one congratulate him on his success.  It takes a lot of guts, hardship, sacrifice to run your own business and I commend him for his success. </p>

<p>In case you don&#39;t know, he has to sell products and advertise in order to operate and pay 50 of his employees. </p>

<p>At least he is not getting bailout money like your obvious favorite show MSNBC and others get. </p>

<p>I mean I can&#39;t understand all you haters of people who are successful, going after their livelihood and how they make money, yeah they make money, they need to eat and drink too and pay bills and hey if they happen to get some more money after 16 years of work, great for them. </p>

<p>But you go on and listen MSNBC, I mean I know your kind I literally know that you probably listen MSNBC most of the time and online read the DailyKos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except...he doesn&#39;t &quot;run his own business.&quot; By a long shot.</p>

<p>Alex Jones&#39; show is owned by Zionist Jeff Smulyan, owner of Emmis (Hebrew for &#39;truth&#39;) Communications.</p>

<p>Smulyan pays the bills, cuts the payroll checks, and is in charge of EVERYTHING that Alex says on the show. He doesn&#39;t want you to know that though!</p>

<p>ALL money being sent to that huckster goes toward bar mitzvah gifts for his son and such--NOT towards the show or website.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been that way for quite awhile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all you don&#39;t have proof of that. Second he is syndicated radio host, third his show is transmitted by GCN.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t know who told you those lies, but they are just not true and I mean you&#39;d think at least one of his 50 workers wouldn&#39;t spill the beans if the checks didn&#39;t come from Alex Jones? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, get proof the same way I did. Call the syndication department at Emmis in Indianapolis. The number is in an above comment. </p>

<p>Then a quick Google will show you who owns Emmis. </p>

<p>It&#39;s surprising, though, that you&#39;re having such a hard time verifying the truth. It&#39;s all public info on many websites and I believe that Mr. Smulyan even has a Wikipedia page. </p>

<p>Just because you don&#39;t like the facts doesn&#39;t automatically make them untrue; I&#39;m very sorry. </p>

<p>It&#39;s kinda cute how you&#39;re sticking up for Alex though! I&#39;m sure he&#39;d be pleased. </p>

<p>Do you not have telephone or Wikipedia access? </p>

<p>What do YOU not get? </p>

<p>Emmis owns KLBJ AM in Austin, AJs home station. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the station&#39;s press release:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So? They carry Alex Jones, what is the big deal? They carry Rush Limbaugh and at least 10 more shows as well. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t own the Alex Jones show, if you were really curious you could probably find out how the Alex Jones show is registered through the city&#39;s business records, basic information can be provided or even do business with him. </p>

<p>I mean when he writes a check or bank wire it says the company name and ID of the business. </p>

<p>Good one where is your evidence for this statement?</p>

<p>Well, Alex doesn&#39;t offer any real solutions on his show.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You obviously never heard really to his show.</p>

<p>Alex Jones isn&#39;t perfect, yes he is sometime over the top and speaks agressive and straigth forward.If you don&#39;t like that is his show nothing for you.</p>

<p>But it is laughable how many people want to discredit that he is a Zionist,Mason,CIA, the easter bunny.....</p>

<p>the energy created by the array can radar around the compass of the earth by bouncing energy off the charge atmosphere layers, and even knock out nukes and missiles past the horizon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like Alex Jones is a litmus test for critical thinking. Not everything he says is bullshit, it&#39;s only when he puts the Alex Jones spin on it that it becomes questionable. </p>

<p>Shortly after I started listening to him I heard him say some outlandish shit about the matrix trilogy. I think it was just before #2 &amp; 3 came out. I&#39;m sure you can guess as to what his opinion about it was. Basically he said its propaganda to get us used to the idea of having plugs, etc hooked up to our bodies; he also said that if Neo teamed up with the robots in the end he would move to Canada. </p>

<p>That sealed the deal as far as my perception of him: ranting idiot who occasionally spreads worthwhile info at a screaming volume, he always turns up the &quot;fear&quot; dial too. </p>

<p>If he was any kind of thinker, any kind of analyst, he would realize just how brilliant that trilogy is, as a piece of film art and as a superb commentary on philosophy and reality. </p>

<p>He&#39;s an entertainer, and not a very good one at that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to listen to him for entertainment value and the occasional non-insane interesting news...</p>

<p>but one day, he went on and on about how the motion-graphics (logos, intros, ect) of Fox News had hidden diabolical, mind-control subliminal images embedded within the artwork, and how this was researched and studied in monkeys at some secret lab and he had seen it himself; but you couldn&#39;t see it because it was played at 30,000th of second.. blah blah blah...</p>

<p>turns out the artist who had created those intros was a friend of mine.  And I&#39;m damn sure he didn&#39;t do any testing in monkeys, nor create those art assets in some sort of evil lab.  Further more, your television display is incapable of displaying images at that speed.</p>

<p>In essence, he is loud, obnoxious and entertaining.  The man is talented at editing documentaries, but at the end of the day; he is fucking insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s quite the odd ball. Memory like the Univac 1100 but speech impediments and nervous as a hummingbird. Don&#39;t get me wrong. I have listened for 10 years and hardly miss a day. But he starts getting on my nerves with his hyperactivity and other idiosyncrasies.
Anyone notice half the time he puts b for v. Listen when he says Conserbative. David Icke becomes &quot;Dabud&quot;. He also trills his B&#39;s. BbBbBbreak it down. And when he interrupts, even if he agrees, he doesn&#39;t say &quot;Yes that&#39;s right&quot; or Yes anything, he says NO. He&#39;ll actually say &quot;NO NO NO that&#39;s right&quot;. He will even say &quot;Yeah/No&quot; a couple times per show. I have no idea what that means, where it comes from or what. 
The poor guy had his head pounded in several times in his younger years. Maybe that&#39;s why Jessie Ventura&#39;s book &quot;Demo-Crips &amp; Re-Blood-licans&quot; gets pronounced &quot;Demo-Crips &amp; Re-BLUB-licans&quot;.
For a guy who can remember hundreds of 10 year old headlines word for word and what paper they&#39;re from right off the top of his head, he sounds nothing like he should. </p>

<p>Another one of his weirdnesses is that when he is giving examples, he doesn&#39;t stop with the ordinary 3 examples, he goes and goes. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s trying to show how amazing his brain is but he digs up every single thing he can. He will say something like, &quot;I am talking about any vegetable, an onion, a carrot, a pea, asparagus, a rutabaga, a tomato, lettuce, chard, spinach....uhhhhh,...ib..dib..dib...dib...artichoke,..uh,,bibdibdibdib..uhh..cantaloupe,...ib dib dib.. yeah/no that&#39;s a fruit...yeah/no........... </p>

And I keep grinding my teeth and saying &quot;Are you telling me that you&#39;ve said that book title 50 times and you still can&#39;t say &#39;Re-<em>blood</em>-li-cans?!?&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m <em>STILL</em> not going to stop listening to him. I&#39;d love if Lew Rockwell gave as much info as Alex or if Alex spoke like Lew. I also like Allan Watt as a speaker. They just don&#39;t put together the news and information that Alex does, so he&#39;s my guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, I think he can be right a lot, but he tests his credibility by claiming infallibility. &quot;We&#39;re right almost 100 percent of the time.&quot; Then he spends a week trotting out the out-of-context &quot;You didn&#39;t build that&quot; meme and turning Bill Maher into the antichrist.  Or disparaging against the Columbine High School principal as a government operative. Or saying there were four shooters at the school (when it was because the shooters doffed their overcoats on the way in, so descriptions didn&#39;t match and initial reports had two people in overcoats, two without). It just makes me question the other stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jones isn&#39;t a genius, he is wrong/exagerrates quite a lot. However I think he has a much better grasp on reality than most of the public. His knowledge of history is pretty good, and gives you interesting context. Further the first 20 mins of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrXgLhkv21Y">Terrorstorm</a> is one of the best or the best conspiracy production I&#39;ve ever seen.</p>

His advertising is no better than the shit you watch on the t.v , and as all of you are so well informed and are aware of the crap thats put into your faces each day it should be easy for all of you to filter the bullshit(no matter how much) on his show from the good. </p>

<p>Or maybe y&#39;all can stop bitching and not listen to his fucking show because he&#39;s waking up a lot sheeple either ways.</p>
