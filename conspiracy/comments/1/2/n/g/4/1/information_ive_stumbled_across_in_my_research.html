        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before I delve into what I have to say, please don&#39;t take offense to this. This is being written to have an intelectual conversation and for me to get more points of view on the subject from like minded people who, hopefully have some insight. </p>

<p>So you know about the NWO. You&#39;re not worried because of raising in consciousness etc... Reading that leads me to believe you&#39;re one to dabble in things along the lines of Spirit Science, The Secret, We are all one, etc.... any mixture of the above or things that fall under that category (If I&#39;m wrong bare with me).</p>

<p>Where did all that information come from? When did it start popping up in our vocabulary and conversed about? Well if you look into who Alice Bailey and Madame Blavatsky are you&#39;ll find that it stemmed from them. People like Ailester Crowley and the like.... People who were part of the Illuminate. </p>

<p>Follow me on this journey for a moment. So, Illuminate is part of TPTB who are trying to bring about their NWO. They are Luciferians. Lucifer, a creature who masquerades as a being of LIGHT but is dark, is the ruler of this realm(in my belief). He wants to elevate above the LORD, which is why he was cast out of Heaven with his followers to rule this realm. </p>

<p>This is why I believe the Illuminate worship him because they believe him to be our Liberator, and that they can overthrow GOD(Whoever/whatever that may be). So, back to my previous statement. Those who started The Secret, raising frequencies, coming age, NEW age, etc.... are Luciferians. </p>

<p>When you look at the Holy Bible, you find it speaks of the End Times in Revelations. It talks about how an anti-christ will come and people will fall for it. With this train of thought, couldn&#39;t this perception of life, the New Age movement, be the setting stage for the anti-christ? That this new acceptance into all religions being one, and that all these religions, what is their focus? That we can become like GOD. Which was if you recall, what lead man to fall from the garden of eden according to the Holy Bible. </p>

<p>It seems very logical and all kind of falls in place one you look into where New Age mysticism has stemmed from. </p>

<p>Again I don&#39;t mean to offend anyone or bash your beliefs. This is where my research has lead me, and as stated above, I would like to hear your opinions on it. </p>

<p><strong>“The common enemy of humanity is man.
In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up
with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming,
water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these
dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through
changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome.
The real enemy then, is humanity itself.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faq/debateacommunist#DefinitionsofcommonlyusedCommunistterms">Communism</a>: 
A classless, stateless society with no exploitation / a social, political and economic ideology that aims at the establishment of such a society.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faq/debateacommunist#DefinitionsofcommonlyusedCommunistterms">State Capitalism</a>: 
A type of Capitalism, which is not to be confused with Communism or Socialism, consisting of state ownership (as opposed to worker ownership or private ownership) of the means of production.</p>

<p>Having said that, I apologise for being pedantic, though many words have been obfuscated to confuse those not knowledgeable on certain topics. Best we not continue that absurdity ourselves. Complex language is important for us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay lets put it this way, it will be a situation where no one will own land, we will all be serfs under a technocratic elite and we will be allocated an &quot;allowance&quot;, no one can drive, no one can leave the city, food will be rationed, etc.  </p>

<p>edit:  The UN calls China a &quot;model country&quot; here is a good reason why: <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2012/11/03/china-is-building-a-huge-eco-city-where-no-one-will-need-to-drive/">http://business.financialpost.com/2012/11/03/china-is-building-a-huge-eco-city-where-no-one-will-need-to-drive/</a></p>

<p>Building &quot;sustainable cities&quot; which are literally prison cities, that is the point of Agenda 21, building &quot;eco-friendly&quot; slave cities, literally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I have had experience with the supernatural. Personal experience is all we have. And that is something that is irrefutable to me. </p>

<p>I am not taking ONE source (the bible). I am taking my personal experience, hearing information, and seeing how it lines up with that. Which is why I am asking the questions that I am. It has nothing to do with my childhood indoctrination. I have taken copious amounts of LSD, and have read most of the works from the indoctrinated higher ups. Robert Anton Wilson, Israel Regardie, Timothy Leary, Aleister Crowley, Albert Pike.... I am no longer who I grew up as, and am quite far from it. I have undone myself many times. </p>

<p>I do take offense to the majority of statements you made. Saying that I am indoctrinated, and therefore unintelligent, and unreasonable. All of which I am not. If anything I am so far out from that. Because someone posits a question does not mean that they believe either side of the question... they could possibly not even believe in the question itself. Please, before you attack someone for believing something, maybe find out if they believe in it to begin with.... Oh and on the topic of discussion, maybe deal with the topic at hand rather than attacking a person for their beliefs(none or all of these could be mine you don&#39;t know) like a corrupt politician in a debate.</p>

<p>My reasoning for bringing up these questions has to do with where the New Age indoctrination came from. It stemmed from the highest degree of mason which I believe is part of the illuminate pushing their NWO on us....</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to respond to THE TOPIC, I would much appreciate it. Have a good day.</p>

<p>Perhaps the symbols you speak of and read about and keep pointing to (ie. Jesus Christ/Lucifer/etc) are merely preferences for applying values to archetypal human mythologies and imagined super-forces?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The term Lucifer in fourth century Latin was a name for Venus, especially as the morning star. The Latin word Lucifer is composed of two words:  lux, or in the genitive form used lucis, (meaning &quot;light&quot;) and ferre, which means &quot;to bear&quot; or &quot;to bring.&quot;  So, the word Lucifer means bearer of light.</p>

<p>Modern Christianity has altered the symbolic interactionism of the word &quot;Lucifer&quot; and has suggested it means Satan. The two words aren&#39;t one in the same</p>

<p>Regardless of it&#39;s roots, when referred to by the masons(who worship him) they speak of him as one in the same with the Christian Satan.</p>

<p>I&#39;m paraphrasing: Lucifer, our liberator. Who set us free from the bonds of a vindictive God in the Garden....</p>

<p>So even if it&#39;s meaning has been tainted, those who are in question here refer to them as one in the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On a side note, why would you think that (set aside whether or not the Bible is true or just another tool to control us) the modern translation would wish to alter said symbolism?</p>

<p>Lucifer is actually only mentioned in the Bible ONCE, and it wasn&#39;t the Christians that altered the symbolic meaning of the word. It was Enchochic Jews. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer</a></p>

<p>Shows where it is listed. It is in reference to a King Of Babylon who fell from power. It is also interesting because if you take it in that context, there are many who believe the anti christ referred to in revelations was the same king. I don&#39;t know if they make that connection or not.</p>

<p>I believe the king was Nebuchadnezzar II but I could be wrong. He was also the king who started the construction of the tower of Babel, and wore animal skin, drank blood, and other weird shit. </p>

<p>If that is the way the cookie crumbles then the anti christ and lucifer are just in reference to an insane king.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well...the modern day christian church is derived from the spilt of the church around the time of the council of nicea. Which could very well be the enchochic jews.</p>

<p>I dont have all the answers and wont pretend to. But I think the term Lucifer is being attributed to those that bear false witness aka False lights.</p>

<p>I think the term was more talking about those that praise the Gods of the Sky rather than God himself. I do support your thoughts on Nebuchadnezzar II and think you&#39;re on to something. However, I don&#39;t think he was the Morning star. </p>

<p>You seem really interested in this subject. You should consider reading this webpage, as this is where I got my last comment from (i copied and pasted, hehe). <a href="http://www.crivoice.org/lucifer.html">http://www.crivoice.org/lucifer.html</a> </p>

<p>I know, the website talks a lot about the bible (which has been known to be used as control and justification for ludicrous acts) but you did ask about the term &quot;Lucifer&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I can&#39;t necessarily say I believe in the existence of a &quot;NWO&quot;, I think that if there is a group of individuals responsible for shaping and influencing the things that happen in the world in the way that is typically associated with what you mention, that their actions are more guided by sheer greed and the desire to control capital and resources than by some nefarious spiritual agenda. I would even be willing to wager that many of these people are atheists, in that they see how powerful of a control mechanism religion is, and think themselves to be too brilliant and powerful to subscribe to anything like a Luciferian plot to overthrow a God they likely don&#39;t believe exists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm I can see that. But in all Manly P Halls and Albert Pikes books they speak of gaining more LIGHT. </p>

<p>When questioned on what the LIGHT refers to they reply with LUCIFER the Bearer of Light. Lucifer in the BIBLE doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the DEVIL which is interesting, who is this Light Bearer then. Could he be darkness masquareding as light, or is he THE LIGHT. Or is he just referred to in that manner due to his liberating us from the oppression of GOD in the garden of Eden, and in this realm he is our LIGHT. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will be the first to admit I haven&#39;t read much from Halls or Pike, but I think when it comes down to it, most of the speculative analysis based from materials like what you propose, is merely conspiratorial sensationalism, if you will. Based on my admittedly limited investigation related to NWO type subject matter, I would propose that there could be a number of well established and historically prominent people/families that have amassed their resources and have colluded to use monetary systems, declining social awareness through intentional mis/undereducation and cultural distraction (i.e. American Idol), military might, and the corporatisation of journalistic media to advance an agenda of geopolitical and financial domination. I don&#39;t think they want to kill us off, or put us in FEMA camps like some do, but I think once a person possesses so much, but greed is still there, the only thing left to desire is to control people and every last resource on the planet. For example, what do you give a guy that already has everything? The world. It&#39;s the only thing left for them, and what better way to satisfy an ego like that, than to deceive it right out from underneath us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that. They were books written by masons for masons though. I don&#39;t believe they expect standard sheep to be reading these books. Aliester Crowley, did feed into that though because of the sensationalism that followed him, but I can&#39;t help but wonder if there was some validity to his claims. </p>

<p>From my point of view, very few of the initiated know about the secrets and plans of those at the top. If this is true and they are Luciferians, I would move that they don&#39;t even know the plans of the sprits they worship/whatevertheydo at the top. So yes I agree with you I don&#39;t think they want all that. </p>

<p>What good is it if a man should gain the world, but lose his soul? When Alexander the great conquered most of the known world he wept, because there was nothing left for him to conquer. I feel like once you have all that, yeah you&#39;ll screw with people to get your kicks and giggles, but what are you striving for? A coming of the Light Bearer? </p>

<p>Someone else commented and linked me to Alice Baileys Lucis Trust(or Lucifers Trust) where I came across this link:
<a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_newage08.htm">http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_newage08.htm</a></p>

<p>So far it is summing up the point I am trying to get across. I don&#39;t know fully since I haven&#39;t finished it, but it seems to be written much more concisely than what I have presented. </p>

<p>If you think about it makes sense though. Once you are deceived into the false light you lose your soul, which empowers the other side or whatever. It&#39;s quite simple Magik if you know anything about that?</p>

I don&#39;t think there is any real substance to the argument that the people who may really run things do so in any spiritual or mystical capacity.

They see themselves as the teeth and claws of Christ the lion-triumphant; though never mind they tear the innocent almost exclusively, for they are not innocent to them, but <em>unilluminated</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not fully emerged on New Age, New world order and most of those stuff. I&#39;ve only dipped my little finger into it but as of today I have a sense that there&#39;s a conflict of interests here between those two.</p>

<p>I think that in the existence of a &quot;NWO&quot;, their main goal would be to dominate the world. This world, not another plane of existence or anything else. I believe they may use religions and symbols to deceipt people but their ultimate goal would be to just get more money and power in this world, which goes against some of the very strong believes of the new age. </p>

<p>If there&#39;s a secret society that wants to bind all humanity to their power and influence, HERE, not in the after life, I wouldn&#39;t consider they would use the plan to free all human kind from money, hate, greed, hostility against each other and search for inner values of peace, love and the concept that everything is one and the same. Don&#39;t forget the power was in the hand of the church for very long time, and it&#39;s natural to go against it and use everything that leads people away from the church for their own good. The New Age is good for the NWO as a distraction, but it goes against their main objectives. They could be using it against people, and not that they are using it because they believe in it and they made it.</p>

<p>I may be wrong, I&#39;m probably wrong because I don&#39;t have enough Knowledge to back this up, but I do not think the objectives of those 2 paradigms are the same. One is to guide or help people achieve other dimensions, the other is to rule over this physical world, planet earth and get money and power from everyone.</p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;m wrong and their plan is just to make me think like that, and they suceeded. I don&#39;t know. :)</p>

<p>If it&#39;s bullshit, it doesn&#39;t matter for us. NWO probably uses New age to drive people away from the church and other religions (because it benefits them), and it&#39;s very unlikely that it&#39;s mere a tool made by lucifer to get the NWO.</p>

<p>you only really have to read the first few paragraphs to see how basically everything the NEW AGE is pushing came from people inside, and part of TPTB. </p>

<p>That page, led on me on some very interesting discoveries. To read the works of those mentioned, and others associated with them. It&#39;s really quite eerie. </p>

<p>I definitely don&#39;t have the answers or I wouldn&#39;t be asking these questions. One of the biggest things for me, is what if Lucifer was our liberator? What if there is a big battle and each side is just collecting souls (I believe our soul is our essence. What we believe is what we &quot;know&quot; to be true. What we know is how we decide to react interact and exist.... in essence, Our essence. Therefore whatever you believe in you your soul is part of that) for the final battle? What if the illuminate are only evil in our eyes because we are apart from true existence. What if the illuminate are only considered evil because the corrupt church forged this reality for us 2000 years ago? What if the god of the bible is just a way for us to be indoctrinated into loving lucifer hidden under another name.... a lucifer who is evil... or a lucifer who IS the one true god and is actually good.</p>

<p>If that last one were true, then why would we need to be lied to, tricked, or had secrets kept from us. There&#39;s just too much out there, and so much of it is only conjecture. It&#39;s hard to make heads or tails of it. </p>

<p>Or now this is the most radical thought to me.... what if the illuminate know they are evil... know what they are doing is wrong. But they are trying to get the world as bad as possible, to force gods hand, and make him come and fix the world. </p>

<p>Like starting a fire so the fire dept. doesn&#39;t lose funding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t give too much credit to what you read in <strong>the bible</strong> it&#39;s a book that has been edited by too many men. The passages you speak of could have been written by Luciferians or Illuminati or whatever you feel like calling them. </p>

<p>My thought is such. Jesus was showing people how to get into heaven. Not saving our souls. <strong>Be like me</strong> and you&#39;re good to go. <strong>Not</strong> <em>believe in me</em>. This is where the perversion of your <strong>Holy Bible</strong> begins.</p>

<p>If you believe the anti-Christ has yet to come re-think the last 2000 years of civilization. Lucifer <strong>has been reigning</strong> this entire time. And if Lucifer knows the Christ is coming back wouldn&#39;t Lucifer do anything in his power to trick people into believing the opposite?</p>

<p>Regardless of what you believe we are all consciously creating this world and are all one with the Creator. God created reality to be experienced in an infinite number of ways. We don&#39;t end or begin. We just are. </p>

<p>That is a very interesting take on it. I don&#39;t have a response for that. Why would Lucifer care if people believed Christ was coming back or not... if he was he&#39;d do it regardless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t KNOW anything. Everything regarding research into the NWO TBTB Masons, etc... is all conjecture until you are at the highest level. The only way to get any knowledge at all is to get it straight from the horses mouth. This is my summaration of information that I have acquired through studying these cults, and fraternities. After studying them, I&#39;ve started to hypothesize. Recently I have been reading many religious texts and found that The Bible&#39;s interpretation on the end times coincides with what I&#39;ve hypothesized, so I came here to discuss.</p>

<p>Lucifer masquerades as light yet is truly darkness. I am trying to get you to explain yourself with stronger arguments. I in no way agree or disagree, I&#39;m still searching.</p>

<p>My only point is that you say quite a bit without actually saying anything. Make assertions without statements to back them up. Im not even asking for citations, at least just some sort of bread crum on the trail. Something to google, rather than &quot;wrong&quot;&quot;wrong&quot;&quot;wrong&quot;&quot;how could that be right?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The topic isn&#39;t on whether or not the christian god is real. Please stay on topic. </p>

<p>My question posed was if anyone thought that the NEW AGE religion could be a by product of the NWO?</p>

<p>Please the information I compiled was not from one source. The Bible is very historical, and whether or not what it writes about is true or not it exists. I grew up a very strict Christian home. With that I have connections to many people who studied the Bible for years. The Historical facts are true... I&#39;m not speaking on whether or not what was transcribed was truth or drugs or a lie, but that it all correlates. Regardless of whether or not the christian god is real matters not in this discussion and isn&#39;t something I would like to discuss.</p>

<p>We aren&#39;t going to break the metta on a sub corner of the internet over night. This is a discussion that much smatter men than you or me have  yet to come to a consensus on. That being said, I don&#39;t think discussing it will do anything other than possibly someone getting offended, and that was not my goal. </p>

<p>Hope you have a wonderful day, and if you have any thoughts on topic I would love to hear them.</p>

<p>The debate on the existence of a creator or higher power <strong>IS NOT</strong> the debate about the validity of anything in your christian bible. Stop confusing the two. Just because smart men think there may be a god does not mean anything your pastor told you is true. </p>

<p>In fact, that book you are so stuck to is a huge part of the problem with you. You can&#39;t let go of the afterlife myth so you are willing to entertain the nonsense attached to it. Not to mention the history of christian justification for hatred, war, poverty, racism, and a litany of other injustices.</p>

<p>This is a great example of christian falsehood. You don&#39;t actually hope I have a wonderful day. You can&#39;t. You don&#39;t know shit about me. It is smarmy. I would rather have you be a real person than fake pretend to love everyone. Jesus said love, not fake bullshit. </p>

<p>NEW AGE</p>

<p>Ok, let&#39;s actually talk about the new age. What the fuck are you talking about? Do you have a sense of history? First, no one I know who I would consider &#39;new age&#39; calls themselves &#39;new age&#39;. Second - talk about a huge spread of difference. Are you talking about Thelema, OGD, OTO, Pagans, Wiccans, CoS, solo practicioners, witches, warlocks, ghosts or ghouls? There is no &#39;new age&#39; movement. </p>

<p>If you want to make an argument that Crowley was employed by Rosicrucians working through the OGD to start a new age religion under the guise of free will in order to step two: ??? and then profit, I guess I can hang out - but honestly I doubt you have the slightest idea what the fuck I am talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You obviously took the least important statements to comment on until the end. But I will oblige you and retort.
You said: &quot;yeah but there is zero evidence that the christian god is real.&quot;
I said: &quot;the topic isn&#39;t on whether or not the christian god is real.&quot;</p>

<p>Not once did I say anything about whether or not there is a a higher power... Nothing on my side is mixed up.</p>

<p>When at all did I say I go to church or have a pastor? Seems like you are the one who is getting things mixed up. I am a man who has done research, the Bible coincides with some of the research so I cited it..... Not once did I ever make any claims of faith. </p>

<p>I actually do hope you have a wonderful day..... Here I will actually say something about myself giving you the first justifiable ammunition to attack me with. After taking copious amounts of LSD, I realized there was no need for anger or hate. It was a waste of time and energy that could be much better spent fixing the situation. There was also no need to be UPSET at someone because they were only just trying to deal with the hand they were dealt. With that in mind, I have worked hard at keeping that part of my every day life. Much love and light. </p>

<p>I agree they are all different. I don&#39;t know... that&#39;s why this thread was started. To share ideas. Not to attack someone for misunderstanding your point. You seem very cut off from expanding your own horizons and at the first mention of the bible christianity or jesus your nostrils flair. I don&#39;t know why that is so I won&#39;t assume. All I have to say on that subject is just because someone brings something up doesn&#39;t mean that is the line of thought they submit to. </p>

<p>Here is a nicely packaged documentary put together on the subject:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7UlQ3N7P3k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7UlQ3N7P3k</a></p>

<p>If you take the time to watch it and have anything to say that isn&#39;t just hate mongering, please share. Show me the error of my ways, I am a lazy man, and if you have a better way, enlighten me. But please, do not attack me. Much love and light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then who is Lucifer? In your eyes...</p>

<p>Regardless of it&#39;s roots, when referred to by the masons(who worship him) they speak of him as one in the same with the Christian Satan.</p>

<p>I&#39;m paraphrasing: Lucifer, our liberator. Who set us free from the bonds of a vindictive God in the Garden....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your argument. I have been there many times myself in thought. My only concern with that is, if they wrote that, why would they write something that coincides with the unveiling of their great plan?</p>

<p>If it is MY holy bible then it is just as much yours because not once did I claim it as mine, just as you haven&#39;t. </p>

<p>That is a very interesting take on it. I don&#39;t have a response for that. Why would Lucifer care if people believed Christ was coming back or not... if he was he&#39;d do it regardless. </p>

<p>That is a line of thought I am still struggling with to determine if that is or isn&#39;t. It&#39;s hard to trust yourself after taking a lot of psychedelics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On a side note, why would you think that (set aside whether or not the Bible is true or just another tool to control us) the modern translation would wish to alter said symbolism?</p>

<p>Lucifer is actually only mentioned in the Bible ONCE, and it wasn&#39;t the Christians that altered the symbolic meaning of the word. It was Enchochic Jews. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer</a></p>

<p>Shows where it is listed. It is in reference to a King Of Babylon who fell from power. It is also interesting because if you take it in that context, there are many who believe the anti christ referred to in revelations was the same king. I don&#39;t know if they make that connection or not.</p>

<p>I believe the king was Nebuchadnezzar II but I could be wrong. He was also the king who started the construction of the tower of Babel, and wore animal skin, drank blood, and other weird shit. </p>

<p>If that is the way the cookie crumbles then the anti christ and lucifer are just in reference to an insane king.</p>
