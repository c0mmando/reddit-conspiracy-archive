Oh yeah i already know that everybody hear knows that reddit is owned by conde nast, i just want to hear your thoughts about reddit being mainstream and corporate owned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youdonedidit, you gotta realize trolls will be trolls and sheep will be sheep. Make your point in one, well articulated comment and you&#39;ll start building karma again. Getting stuck in a dialogue just gives your opponent a chance to harass and downvote you.</p>

<p>Personally, I believe the intelligence agencies are watching us. But according to congress they&#39;ve been getting too much data to make any sense of all it. So we&#39;re all equally at risk of being targeted for our beliefs. Some might just be more equal than others. Eventually the government might crack down, Lord knows it has been flexing its muscles. Till then. I&#39;m going to stay dedicated to spreading the truth.</p>

<p>Stay happy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything is corporate owned.  And the stuff that isn&#39;t... will have a much smaller userbase because its harder to find.</p>

<p>If you took the reddit code (or a forum) and installed it on your own server... it would take forever to amass over 88k members... 200+ of which are online at any given time.  And we are probably only this active on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because we are on reddit nearly 24/7 anyway.  So when new material is posted, we respond to it quicker as a result.</p>

<p>But really... if you really think they are out to get you, you should be using a VPN and some browser extensions anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you did. You said feminists condone female on male violence and male on female violence and if you <strong>don&#39;t</strong> acknowledge that I will provide you a link to the posts where you said it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not even remotely related to any of the points you&#39;e made last night and you should go reread your posts if you don&#39;t believe me. If you think feminists should address misandry issues, then you should join the conversation and express it (rather than crying about how you don&#39;t understand them like you did last night). </p>

<p>Furthermore, what misandry issues do you think need to be addressed? The only one I can think of is divorce law in some states. With regards to paternity payments and divorce proceedings. Some states have laws where any reports of spousal abuse have to prosecuted, but that knife cuts both ways, so it&#39;s not really a gender issue in that sense. They are for gender equality, it&#39;s just that, you are clearly only thinking about <em>your</em> gender because I don&#39;t think the above compares to the battle women are fighting to remain in control <strong>of their own genitals</strong>.</p>

<p>I think that if people like you and the MRA guys didn&#39;t constantly bemoan mischaracterize and insult feminists then they would probably take up the misandry issues I&#39;ve mentioned with full strength. But seeing as how you are likely going to vote for a president that has no regards for the issues they are facing, why should they listen to you? Why should they care? They are busy fighting a battle to overturn an entire history of being ignored and you want to nitpick them because sometimes in some places divorce isn&#39;t exactly fair and it&#39;s not on their list of priorities. </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you try and have a reasonable discussion with a feminist and convince them that not only are <em>their</em> concerns worth fighting for, but <em>yours</em> as well? I&#39;ve never seen someone do that on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or <a href="/r/mensrights">/r/mensrights</a>. You guys are dead set on telling women how it is - big surprise - they don&#39;t appreciate that!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m probably going to vote for the green party candidate, Jill Stein. </p>

<p>It was a debate between her and Gary Johnson. And while I appreciate some of Gary&#39;s platforms, I have serious reservations with libertarian economic theory, especially with regards to <strong>conserv</strong>ation of the environment. An issue that is given virtually no attention by the democratic party, contrary to popular belief. </p>

<p>So while Gary Johnson is agains the military industrial complex, so is Jill Stein. The key difference being that I think the end result of libertarian markets is corporate tyranny, so why would I vote for that?</p>

<p>And yeah, I wouldn&#39;t worry about the federal reserve, because there is no way that someone that wants to get rid of the fed will get elected. He would be shot in front of <em>everyone</em> before that would happen again. So while it&#39;s a change to hope for, it isn&#39;t realistic to ever expect. But I&#39;m also not someone who believes the end result of government is inescapable tyranny so I don&#39;t necessary have many peers in this subreddit, in that sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I just fucking told you why you illiterate twit. </p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t noticed Ron Paul isn&#39;t running and I don&#39;t agree with libertarians so I&#39;m probably not going to vote for one. </p>

<p>Although there is an interesting correlation between the amount of women represented in a country&#39;s parliament and how much they spend on the military. In this case more women means less military money. So am I voting for her <em>because</em> she is a woman? <strong>No</strong>. Do I think bringing some feminine perspective could create a more moderate sensible environment? <em>Yes, quite possibly.</em></p>

<p>Try to think before you respond to me, please. </p>
