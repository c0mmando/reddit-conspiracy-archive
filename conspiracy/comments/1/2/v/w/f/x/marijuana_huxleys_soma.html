       I was thinking about it today, marijuana has been illegal since the birth of the country or at least a taboo. It's caused a strong following so that it can be legalized. Many people are very pro-marijuana legalization. Also many consider it a big part of their lives. With its legalization on the horizon many people will start using it much more and the government will have the responsibility to control its use.
      </p>
      <p>
       Huxley's soma was used by the people to forget unfavorable thoughts and put them into a state where they didn't care about anything at the moment, to a certain degree. This is how the government in this world stopped people from getting out of control, by pleasure. The government controlled them through making them happy and euphoric. Soma made these people forgetful of anything negative going on at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       People like to come back after a "bad day" and smoke to forget about it. Or smoke to make them feel better, not have to worry about the negative things in their lives, lazy and neglectful (at least for a time limit). I'm not against legalization or for it, in my opinion it I think America is dumb enough and they don't need another factor to abuse. On the other hand people have the right to do to their bodies as they please and shouldn't have anyone tell them they can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       In either case is marijuana, soma?
(I apologize for the repetitiousness, I was merely trying to push my point)
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 1: I'm not arguing it's the only "soma" out there, just another one to add to the effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 2: I definitely agree with its associations, however, from what I've gathered THC inflates/expands the mind of said user, this being a very personal experience, not too different from alcohol. I've been around enough people who are complete idiots w/out THC and then even more so on it (in a more what-they-say type deal not actions). Marley was a great man and THC helped inflate that, but my buddies say dumber shit (again personal experience does not concrete facts) when stoned.
The reason why I can't move on with the Bob Marley argument is the fact that Hemingway wrote some of his best work drunk, while others have murdered people because they stepped into a car (or whatever else). "Write drunk, edit sober." - One of the literary worlds heavyweights.
Also, most people in this world are flat out unintelligent (meaning not formal education, but more of an unwillingness to learn, evolve, adapt, and merely think).

       Marijuana is illegal largely due to the vast uses/benefits of hemp. Ive always thought of weed as a consciousness expander rather than something to numb the day away, but that depends on the person (and quality). Its a good thought, but the obvious attempt at replicating soma has been legal the whole time and marketed/prescribed with all sorts of different names from the pharmaceutical industry.

       Without a doubt, one word: antidepressants. I agree with it's ability to help you think beyond the realm you would soberly stay in, I was just stating my own experiences with THC and what I've absorbed from friends. I was thinking this may be another route to Huxley's soma.
      </p>

       Also do yourself a favor and pick up Botany of Desire, it covers four topics, one being marijuana. It dives into the legality of it, the spiritual nature, the author's personal experiences, biochemistry of it, genetics and pretty much everything about it all in 80 pages. It's a great read! I read it in a day at my university's library.

       I doubt it.  Marijuana is more associated with freedom of thought and freedom from tyranny and resistance.  Bob Marley for instance.  And economically has the same potential.

       To me this line of thought just seems like such bullshit. This not the effect of marijuana, it doesn't turn you into a free thinker, if anything it would be the other way round. Due to marijuana being illegal in most legislatures many of the people who decide to use it are people who already question the system. In this instance the "system" being draconian drug prohibition laws and more and more people are seeing through all the bs that goes along with them.

       I don't think so - cannabis makes me more empathetic, I have a hard time eating meat when I'm high, I think a lot about my impact on the world and vica versa. Generally it makes me question things that I've been conditioned to accept as normal - which is IMO the opposite of what you want if you are trying to control people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again I'm pretty sensitive to it and my experience with cannabis is probably really different from many other peoples.

       My thoughts as well.  Marijuana makes people question their 9-5 routines.  It forces people to ask themselves why their government (to whom they pay substantial taxes to) wants to throw them in jail for growing a plant that colonists were originally forced to grow in their yards.  Soma tuned everyone out, whereas weed makes the public ask "uncomfortable" questions that challenge existing power structures.

        Huxley's soma was used by the people to forget unfavorable thoughts and put them into a state where they didn't care about anything at the moment, to a certain degree. This is how the government in this world stopped people from getting out of control, by pleasure. The government controlled them through making them happy and euphoric. Soma made these people forgetful of anything negative going on at the time.

       better than fluoride? Fluoride doesn't put people into a state of euphoria or give them pleasure, it doesn't cause people to be controlled by their government, it cleans their fucking teeth. Do you really buy into every single little thing Alex Jones claims? rofl

       I can't speak for everyone but pot did the exact opposite that soma is supposed to do.  It didn't block any thoughts but made me realize how many thoughts I dismiss as white noise in my head.  I enjoyed pot if i could focus on something because I could focus the shit out of it... but when I smoked and didn't focus I'd hear every thought in my head at once... and I liked that too.  It was daunting and lead down a LOT of rabbit holes in thought.  Lot''s of philosophical actualization.  I've noticed that people who sound dumb regularly sound dumb on pot.  And people who are introspective sound introspective.  People who are pessimistic... same.  Outwardly pot doesn't change who you are unless you are really high, new to it, and can't stop talking about how high you are.

       It was made illegal in 1936 by Harry Anslinger through tremendous pressure from a few companies--DuPont was the chief push behind this of course.

       As a weed smoker, I agree with your analysis.  It is one kind of Soma, all the "illicit" drugs are Soma, but they are mixing Brave New World with 1984, so by making "soma" available yet illegal, they can advance 2 directives at once.  The legalization of means they are getting into more of the brave new world scenario where they just give us drugs to keep us docile.

       Marijuana that affects the dream portion of the brain (rewrites/damages the hippocampus and temporal lobes depending on how much you smoke) results in hypnosis.  It's like you're writing new code for your computer from scratch. That goes above and beyond pleasure.

       Interesting post.  The difference for me is that usage of Huxley's soma was encouraged by society, whereas with weed it's the opposite.  With soma, there was nothing to think about after you took it.  They simply enjoyed it and that was that.  With weed, you smoke it, realize that it's enjoyable, and then you begin to question why your government wants to put you in jail for what you just did.  Doors open in your mind, and you begin to consider all of the monied interests who profit immensely off of the War on Drugs.

       Come on man, you think Marijuana is soma? But you completely ignore alcohol. You completely ignore sodium laden MSG laced overly abundant fast food. You ignore pharmaceuticals. If anything is soma anti-depressants are soma. You've ignored caffeine, and its often accompanied sugary beverage. Even video games, and must watch TV and the bread and circus we call sporting events deserve some mention here. But maybe even none of them are soma. Maybe we don't have a soma, maybe soma is in the works somewhere. Maybe we'll never have a soma. What we do have is marijuana, and marijuana is marijuana, and soma is soma.

       Alcohol would be closer to soma.

       It's not a direct cause / effect.

       But it is funny that this happens to be the case.

       Anecdotally, marijuana seems to amplify my sensations (food, music, movies) and help with self-awareness. The only emotion marijuana doesn't seem to amplify is anger. Usually when I smoke pot, and I'm not a frequent user so it takes only a toke or two to feel rather magnified, I wind up cleaning my apartment, fixing something, and then reflecting for hours about my current state of affairs. I've read a brave new world and if anything, Soma would be a sort of super-opiate with zero negative side effects.
