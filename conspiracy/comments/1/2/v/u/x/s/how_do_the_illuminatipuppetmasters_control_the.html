       Spiritual awakening (realignment with plant based medicines and plant induced altered states of consciousness). If religion/spirituality can be used to control people, can also be used to set them free.

       I agree with you're main point but I don't think we have to limit ourselves to just "natural" medicine and drugs. I mean, LSD is sweet. Also, mushrooms aren't a plant and they are a really important entheogen. I assume you mean organic or natural when you say "plant based". Anyway, I think we just need more of a balance rather than rejecting everything artificial... but yeah I'm the most "naturopath" of people I know... most of the time I'm on your side of the argument.

       Hi there.
      </p>
      <p>
       LSD is from fungus, which is in your definition of 'natural'. There are species of trees which produce MDMA which I'm sure you're aware of, but you'll also find some species of acacia can contain trace amounts of methamphetamine in it. The psychoactive compounds found in plants are very basic molecules and only a few steps from the essential proteins which make up DNA (remember, plants turn light in to DNA via photosynthesis);
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing on this planet which is not natural - I wanted to make the original statement as simple and far reaching as possible. Thanks for your post, I believe returning to plant induced altered states of consciousness helped us evolve to where we are today, and a combination of technology (internet) and psychoactive plants (from the ground or even cooked in a lab such as
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmahuasca">
        pharmhuasca
       </a>
       ) could produce the kind of change we're all looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheers

       Thanks for your interest, but I'm not selling anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psychoactive compounds found in plants and fungus helped human beings develop language and self-awareness which lead to rapid evolution around 50,000 years ago (about the time we started seeing lots of complex cave paintings). I'm of the opinion we need another leap of intellect and awareness, and the fastest way to achieve this may be through the class of compound called hallucinogens.

       I, like yourself, want to see a happier heathlier world. However unlike yourself, I don't believe there is such a thing as 'evil' - I think the whole idea of evil is intended to conjure mechanisms of fear and control within the psyche.
       <strong>
        If you succumb to fear and a belief in evil, you are right where the 'beast' wants you.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Set yourself free from fear and these strange ideas of evil and negativity. It is possible.

       To discount the existence of evil, is to allow yourself to be spiritually disarmed.

       I didn't discount the idea of evil at all. Since love is all there is, sin (if you believe in such a thing) is a mistake to be corrected, rather than a evil to be punished. This is how you combat evil - through various intelligent forms of empathy.
      </p>

       Forgive me, with heavy terms such as "son of the devil", "veiled mystery religion" and "beast" I automatically put you in a group of personality I try to avoid due to over opinionated self-righteousness (aka fundamentalist religious). I've changed my mind now; Best of luck with increasing your understanding - I'm glad we've been able to share ideas in this format.

       Psychoactive plant compounds can help people establish an even deeper and more personal relationship with Christ. There are Christian churches in the USA (such as the Santo Daime) who use Ayahuasca as a sacrament to Jesus Christ. Being able to worship the Bible (if that is your thing) in a set and setting of upmost respect for the teachings of Christ and the actual substance is a very powerful and positive spiritual experience.

       But I think if we made a group effort like having focus groups and pound out ideas on how to educate the public and in what fashion would greatly raise the success of the message being heard. Maybe a hierarchy because some of the public are not capable of understanding.

       The very simple secret to pounding a message into someone's head is repeating it over and over until they're very sick of it.  You'll notice how members of political party all address the same issue to same way?  "Talking points" are not without purpose.

       The problem you're going to face here is... well, just look at the comments.  It's like herding cats.  For this group to stay on message, they'd first have to agree what the message was.

        How do the illuminati/puppetmasters control the public so efficiently
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They brainwash and indoctrinate us with emotionally based, religiously based propaganda from infancy in such a manner that EVERYONE (or at least the vast majority of us) are 100% sold - hook line and sinker - on the puppet lie that they pander as truth.  And when I say everyone, I mean
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       :  Your friends, brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, grandparents, and everyone you love and hold dear.  Almost
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       you look up to and grow up wanting to be like is in one way or the other, to some extent or the other, controlled and brainwashed by the machine.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        how can we use the very thing they used against us and use it against them.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Be strong and brave enough to go against all those loved ones and cherished idols that you grew up so attached to and knowing that you wanted to be "just like".  Be strong enough to reject all of them and realize that they might have all been wrong.  Be strong enough to know your mother and father and grandparents and all the priests and preachers that you spent your whole like looking up to and honoring and worshiping were all wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very much easier said than done because the acknowledgement of this rejection is not just an intellectual and psychological exercise and separation.  It is a
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       more powerful
       <strong>
        <em>
         emotional
        </em>
       </strong>
       separation and divorcing that has to happen if one is to be truly independent from all the indoctrinating lies that have occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is almost impossible for really anyone on this planet to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how they trap us.  They make us emotionally attached to the lies, and as the lies and deceit infect us and grow inside of us like a symbiotic host/parasite disease, the lies and deceit become
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       with us, and to reject them ends up being a rejecting of our very selves and our very identity as individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, most of us can't do it.  We are unwilling to do it - even if we SEE the ruse; even is we SEE the lie and know that everything's all a hoax on an intellectual or psychological level.  We don't want to give it up.  We don't want to give up the lie.
      </p>

       We become like

       “There is no reason why good cannot triumph as often as evil. The triumph of anything is a matter of organization. If there are such things as angels, I hope that they are organized along the lines of the Mafia.” -Kurt Vonnegut

       In my opinion, the most effective way to control the public is through media. I honestly believe that for maybe around one million dollars, a director with the right mind could actually make a movie that was well researched enough to really paint an accurate picture of what's wrong with the current condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've thought about it before, it would really suck. It would take a large team of people to watch and take notes on every conspiracy video ever made, check every single source and reference... and damn, the amount of books that would have to be read and verified... Then, only the strongest arguments would have to be presented in a relevant, professional, creative, humorous, and beautiful way, which is extremely difficult. It would have to be a work of genius. Changing the minds of many requires enormous intellect and no room for carelessness and poopy, spooky soundtracks, or aliens. OUT&gt;

       p.s. I've done some videography work and I know enough about what makes a good film to know that most conspiracy this or illuminati that films are poo. Not always the content, but the context and all the other jazz that makes for a righteous movie watching experience. I swear to god if i hear Buffalo Springfield's, "for what it's worth" as the score for JFK's assassination again i'll shvitz. Lastly, there's always that one damn song in every conspiracy video, over and over again, that same song. With writing on the screen and slowly magnifying low res jpegs of a baphomet or somthing. It has to stahp.

       The biggest thing you can do, In my mind, is do the research and help everyone else wake up. It doesn't matter how educated you are if you don't tell anyone about the atrocities being committed on the human race. Even if we, the awakened, surely no more than a few million, took to the streets, we are not even 1% of the total population and there is little we can change. We need more numbers.
