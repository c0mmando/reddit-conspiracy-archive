    <div class="md"><p>Well, the Internet isn&#39;t free. I know, because I pay for it once a month. And I seriously doubt much of it is unmonitored. There are too many nice folks drawing a paycheck from the NSA who would have no reason to be employed unless they were listening to our conversations and reading our social media threads. Whether people react to this situation with self-censorship is up to them. At the end of the day, you either say what you believe, or you stay silent, or you lie and say what you think you are expected by others to say.</p>

<p>also allowed them to eliminate the advertisements completely from their lives</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it hasn&#39;t, not for the people who you&#39;re thinking of. The reason we have so many free services on the internet is <em>because</em> ads are paying for them, because people buy that shit. The 18-24m (tech savvy) demographic is one of the hardest to sell to, but everyone outside of that are the ones making the impulse purchases and clicking on/watching ads that keeps the internet chugging along.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&#39;t watched an advertisement for years.</p>

<p>Like I said, maybe you haven&#39;t, but you are the extreme minority.</p>

<p>Online advertising pays my bills, trust me.</p>

<p>People used to love the media because of that ability. Now, the TV is just a cycle of repeating what&#39;s already been found online. Now, websites just repeat what has already been reported but just have their own take on it to keep their viewership happy.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think people are waking up to lies, as much as realizing that TV is slowly becoming irrelevant since it is no longer &#39;required&#39; to seek out certain paths just to find out the news.</p>
