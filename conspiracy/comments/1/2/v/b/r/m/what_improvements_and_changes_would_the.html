<p>Except, the posts of those people you&#39;ve named are not anti-Semitic. They are merely <em>labeled</em> anti-Semitic by you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I and many others would say you are actually anti Semitic. Nearly anyone who checks out your and those others&#39; post histories (and who doesn&#39;t believe the whole &quot;Jews run the world&quot; BS) would agree. It&#39;s why your posts about such subjects are rarely taken seriously anywhere, except <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and <a href="/r/worldpolitics">/r/worldpolitics</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And really, what would you do with your day if you couldn&#39;t scour Reddit for signs of anti-Semitism,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It isn&#39;t what I do with my day at all. A couple minutes of browsing the above mentioned subs and a few others leads me to such anti Semitism spouted by you. For fuck&#39;s sake, your username is a goddamn Menorah. Either way, I work 40 hours a week and have a few hobbies, plus a fiancee, so my day is filled with far more than &quot;scouring reddit&quot; for anything. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and save them up in a file for later reuse as weapons against particular posters?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No such file exists, but please don&#39;t act like it is wrong to link to bigoted posts made by you and your bigoted brethren and act like <em>I</em> am the one doing something wrong. Again, the proof is in your post history. Delete your comments and/or account if you are so ashamed of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;d have to find a new hobby to occupy your time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I have plenty of hobbies. It&#39;s kind of pathetic that you fall back on a variation of the classic failed internet comeback of saying I waste all my time on this. Gonna call me a basement dweller while you&#39;re at it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with tot, bumbling et al. How.come.i can be proudly jewish and not.find them.offensive? So many conspiracy theories involve jews directly. The Rothschilds, the zionist lobby, the unacceptable amount of support israel gets. Why is it anti-semetic to expose the disgraceful loyalty diaspora jews have to israel instead of the countries they were born in. If anything should be changed on r/conspiracy, its that people should not be allowed to accuse others of being &quot;anti-semetic&quot; just because they are fed up with rich zionist criminals like adelson and bloomberg and silverstein. It sickens them that their leaders.brown nose a sandbox the size of delaware. Im jewish It pisses me off too. So stop calling people anti-semites. </p>

<p>In my view this post&#39;s(and these are a small example) are still racism and should be forbidden.But i understand your point. I don&#39;t want to censor &quot;Jewish Zionism&quot; post&#39;s either but when its Hatefull Speech against jews there is the line crossed.</p>

<p>The fact that so many people adopt anti semetic attitudes is a tribute to how well the Zionist elite are able to cloak their intentions and deflect criticism by using Judaism as a shield.</p>

<p>I Personally call it &quot;Rothschild Zionism&quot; because its controlled and payed by them. I am still trying to discuss this here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> but it results in massive Downvoting,discussion&#39;s are ending in insults and white supremecy stuff.</p>

<p>LOL, not according to some posters in this subreddit, they don&#39;t. These censorious posters want certain points of view eliminted, certain opinions hidden from view, certain ideas banned from the discussion. I&#39;m surprised they haven&#39;t already won in this subreddit, as they have over most of Reddit, but I guess it&#39;s because the mods here continue to believe that free speech is something to be valued. But they are never going to stop, you know. They are going to keep chipping away until they get the censorship they are lusting after. Fanatics never stop pursuing their fanatical goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only posters I&#39;d want banned are those who advertise commercial products, and those who deliberately and persistently follow and harass other posters because of their opinions.</p>

<p>By that I mean, those who pop up every time a particular poster makes a post, and come forth with the same personal insults against that poster. It&#39;s not that hard to recognize targeted personal harassment when you see it repeatedly.</p>

<p>Also, now that I think about it, I&#39;d ban all the bots. The one that keeps posting long strings of links really gets on my nerves. One or two links is useful, but 20 or 30 is just spam.</p>

<p>Other than these categories, I can&#39;t think of anything remotely on topic that I want banned from this subreddit. One of the great things about this subreddit, and probably a reason it is so popular, is that people are permitted to voice politically incorrect opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. However this is the nature of this subreddit. Racism is one thing and opinion and free thought are the other. This is where downvoting and upvoting have to come into play. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have to agree with what an individual says, but they do have the right to say it, and argue their point don&#39;t they?</p>
