    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not 100% sure an actual election even took place. Could it be possible the GOP and DNC worked together on this one? Obama was completely protected from any hard criticism, on anything. It wasn&#39;t like anyone had to hold Mitt Romney back either. He was just so happy to be a nice guy. If our political parties did collude to defraud the people, it seems to me the reasons for that would become clear quite quickly. </p>

<p>I hope I&#39;m wrong, and paranoid.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay but Romney didn&#39;t once mention Fast and Furious during the debates. No one mentioned it during the last two months. </p>

<p>And I didn&#39;t say Republicans, I said MSM. If bigger issues, than the several Americans appear to be concerned (abortion, gay marriage, taxes) with were analyzed, the electorate would have realized to the similarities between the candidates. To me it seems strange that the two parties are bipartisan on the agenda&#39;s that I pointed. Yet, their minute differences were the matter of conversation over this election cycle.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Romney didn&#39;t bring it up during the debates because it wasn&#39;t an important issue. Fox tried to blow it out of proportion, but no one really gave a shit.</p>

<p>The NDAA is also blown out of proportion. Obama already said he wouldn&#39;t use it for indefinite detention. </p>

<p>Bradley Manning broke the law.</p>

<p>Drones keep American soldiers safer than ground operations, they are hugely popular. I agree on the MMJ.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember gay marriage ever coming up during the debates. They were mostly focused on taxes and the economy, with foreign policy coming in the third debate, in which Romney agreed on many issues with Obama.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NDAA is not blown out or proportion as it allows the indefinite detention of US citizens without trial. It has been overturned in multiple courts and then federal appeals courts came in to uphold it.  Bradley Manning broke the law, but the fact remains that he is being detained without trial and being treated like a terrorist. The drone war is illegal and are used in places where the US cannot have soilders like Pakistan and Yemen. </p>

<p>Gay marriage didn&#39;t come up in the debates but we know where each candidate is on the issue and was a call to arms for LBGT and pro-equality groups. </p>

<p>The last paragraph, quoted below, is good if you don&#39;t want to read the whole article; </p>

<p>TL;DR:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The leftover money goes to the individual in charge of the super PAC, typically the treasurer, who is identified in the committee&#39;s FEC filing.</p>

<p>Unlike campaign money for presidential, senatorial or congressional campaigns, super PACs are allowed to use the leftover funds for personal expenditures, said Michael Toner, another partner at Wiley Rein. &quot;The FEC has a prohibition on personal expenditures for campaign funds but it does not extend to super PACs,&quot; he said. &quot;I could accept a yacht from a super PAC, for instance.&quot; He noted that the expenditures would still be taxable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s a list of people in charge of the pro-Romney Restore Our Future super PAC:  <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/2012/01/30/7977/pac-profile-restore-our-future">http://www.publicintegrity.org/2012/01/30/7977/pac-profile-restore-our-future</a></p>
