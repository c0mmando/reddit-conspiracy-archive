    <div class="md"><p>Yes, he is very intelligent and has some very good credentials, however, all I needed to hear was that he was the Editor in Chief of &quot;Infinite Energy Magazine.&quot; Is it really not more plausible to you that a very intelligent man would promote such a theory to garner more interest in his magazine than this garbage about how &quot;He was murdered so it must be some Big energy giant trying to keep him from revealing the secrets of free energy!&quot;</p>

<p>And you know what? I&#39;ll do some research of my own.</p>

<p>From: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cold fusion is a proposed type of nuclear reaction that would occur at, or near, room temperature, compared with temperatures in the millions of degrees that is required for &quot;hot&quot; fusion. As a new type of nuclear reaction, it was proposed to explain reports by experimenters of anomalously high energy generation under certain specific laboratory conditions. <strong>It has been rejected by the mainstream scientific community because the original experimental results could not be replicated consistently and reliably, and because there is no generally accepted theoretical model of cold fusion.</strong></p>

<p>Many years after the 1989 experiment, cold fusion researchers still haven&#39;t agreed on a single theoretical explanation or on a single experimental method that can produce replicable results</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most thoroughgoing of the attempts to validate the Pons-Fleischmann experiment was conducted at the California Institute of Technology. According to Dr. Nathan Lewis, leader of the Caltech team, every possible variant of the Pons-Fleischmann experiment was tried without success.
<strong>Using equipment far more sensitive than any available to the Utah group</strong>, Caltech failed to find any symptoms of fusion. The scientists found no emitted neutrons, gamma rays, tritium or helium, although the Utah group reported all these emissions at high levels. And all the cells consumed energy rather than produced it, the Caltech team said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Ordinarily, new scientific discoveries are claimed to be consistent and reproducible; as a result, if the experiments are not complicated, the discovery can usually be confirmed or disproved in a few months. The claims of cold fusion, however, are unusual in that <strong>even the strongest proponents of cold fusion assert that the experiments, for unknown reasons, are not consistent and reproducible at the present time.</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really want to put emphasis on that last one. If even the people who believe it can happen don&#39;t believe it can happen reliably or repeatedly after 15 years of researching it, then why should I trust some nutter on the internet? Especially when said person cannot back a single claim up with an actual source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone thought that it&#39;s more a media thing than govt conspiracy? I&#39;m sure most of you are aware that media likes to keep the big secrets out of sight of the public. Whether it be because of damage to somebody&#39;s reputation (the energy industry, in this case) or the more likely scenario that they are trying to prevent the general panic from worsening. Areas with populations in the millions are under evacuation notices and several states are in a SoE. If the largely ignorant public suddenly was informed of a <em>potential</em> nuclear disaster, how do you think they would react?</p>
