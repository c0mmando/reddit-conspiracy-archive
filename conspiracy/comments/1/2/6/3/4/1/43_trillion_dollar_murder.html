<p>3 and a half hours later that same day (reported on today), the daughters of the executive of CNBC’s digital division (read: their website) are both killed by the family&#39;s nanny who was supposedly “a very nice woman”, “very religious”, and “has always been very, very stable”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just when the waves of paranoia and stupidity seemed too much for me to stay subscribed in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> an actual interesting post appears.</p>

<p>Edit: after reading the article in question I fail to see the connection between the murders and the article. I think the article is a form of publicity for the law firm that wrote it, look at the language in the article: capitalists comrades, Banksters, racketeering, etc. I do not think this type of language is necessary if the case were real, but it is necessary if this is a PR stunt (because you need to get people heated up). The murders were very tragic, but I think the mother walked in on the nanny slitting her own throat so we know she did it. </p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s a <a href="http://dockets.justia.com/docket/new-york/nyedce/1:2012cv04269/333833/">real lawsuit</a>, but I don&#39;t think they believe they could actually win it. What they can do, however, is charge each of the plaintiffs thousands of dollars in legal fees. The more publicity, the more plaintiffs they get.</p>

<p>The law firm (Spire Law) used to be called Mitchell J. Stein &amp; Associates, but Mitchell J. Stein <a href="http://www.calbarjournal.com/September2011/TopHeadlines/TH2.aspx">is no longer eligble to practice law in California</a>. The California Attorney General and State Bar shut him and 3 other attorneys down: “The number of lawyers who have tried to take advantage of distressed homeowners in these tough economic times is nothing short of shocking.”</p>

<p><a href="http://sherriequestioningall.blogspot.com/2012_04_01_archive.html">Here&#39;s a blog post from April</a> from someone who thought their earlier lawsuit (in state court) was great until she contacted them: “It seems they want $10,000 to $18,000 from anyone who wants to join the suit.”</p>

<p>It is copyrighted so I don&#39;t want to paste the whole text in.  Here are a few interesting parts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NEW YORK, Oct. 25, 2012 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Spire Law Group, LLP&#39;s national home owners&#39; lawsuit, pending in the venue where the &quot;Banksters&quot; control their $43 trillion racketeering scheme (New York) - known as the largest money laundering and racketeering lawsuit in United States History and identifying $43 trillion ($43,000,000,000,000.00) of laundered money by the &quot;Banksters&quot; and their U.S. racketeering partners and joint venturers - now pinpoints the identities of the key racketeering partners of the &quot;Banksters&quot; located in the highest offices of government and acting for their own self-interests. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The complaint - which has now been fully served on thousands of the &quot;Banksters and their Co-Conspirators&quot; - makes it irrefutable that the epicenter of this laundering and racketeering enterprise has been and continues to be Wall Street and continues to involve the very &quot;Banksters&quot; located there who have repeatedly asked in the past to be &quot;bailed out&quot; and to be &quot;bailed out&quot; in the future. </p>

<p>Major Banks, Governmental Officials and Their Comrade Capitalists Targets of Spire Law Group, LLP&#39;s Racketeering and Money Laundering Lawsuit Seeking Return of $43 Trillion to the United States Treasury</p>

<p>NEW YORK, Oct. 25, 2012 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Spire Law Group, LLP&#39;s national home owners&#39; lawsuit, pending in the venue where the &quot;Banksters&quot; control their $43 trillion racketeering scheme (New York) - known as the largest money laundering and racketeering lawsuit in United States History and identifying $43 trillion ($43,000,000,000,000.00) of laundered money by the &quot;Banksters&quot; and their U.S. racketeering partners and joint venturers - now pinpoints the identities of the key racketeering partners of the &quot;Banksters&quot; located in the highest offices of government and acting for their own self-interests.</p>

<p>In connection with the federal lawsuit now impending in the United States District Court in Brooklyn, New York (Case No. 12-cv-04269-JBW-RML) - involving, among other things, a request that the District Court enjoin all mortgage foreclosures by the Banksters nationwide, unless and until the entire $43 trillion is repaid to a court-appointed receiver - Plaintiffs now establish the location of the $43 trillion ($43,000,000,000,000.00) of laundered money in a racketeering enterprise participated in by the following individuals (without limitation): Attorney General Holder acting in his individual capacity, Assistant Attorney General Tony West, the brother in law of Defendant California Attorney General Kamala Harris (both acting in their individual capacities), Jon Corzine (former New Jersey Governor), Robert Rubin (former Treasury Secretary and Bankster), Timothy Geitner, Treasury Secretary (acting in his individual capacity), Vikram Pandit (recently resigned and disgraced Chairman of the Board of Citigroup), Valerie Jarrett (a Senior White House Advisor), Anita Dunn (a former &quot;communications director&quot; for the Obama Administration), Robert Bauer (husband of Anita Dunn and Chief Legal Counsel for the Obama Re-election Campaign), as well as the &quot;Banksters&quot; themselves, and their affiliates and conduits. The lawsuit alleges serial violations of the United States Patriot Act, the Policy of Embargo Against Iran and Countries Hostile to the Foreign Policy of the United States, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (commonly known as the RICO statute) and other State and Federal laws.</p>

<p>In the District Court lawsuit, Spire Law Group, LLP -- on behalf of home owner across the Country and New York taxpayers, as well as under other taxpayer recompense laws -- has expanded its mass tort action into federal court in Brooklyn, New York, seeking to halt all foreclosures nationwide pending the return of the $43 trillion ($43,000,000,000.00) by the &quot;Banksters&quot; and their co-conspirators, seeking an audit of the Fed and audits of all the &quot;bailout programs&quot; by an independent receiver such as Neil Barofsky, former Inspector General of the TARP program who has stated that none of the TARP money and other &quot;bailout money&quot; advanced from the Treasury has ever been repaid despite protestations to the contrary by the Defendants as well as similar protestations by President Obama and the Obama Administration both publicly on national television and more privately to the United States Congress. Because the Obama Administration has failed to pursue any of the &quot;Banksters&quot; criminally, and indeed is actively borrowing monies for Mr. Obama&#39;s campaign from these same &quot;Banksters&quot; to finance its political aspirations, the national group of plaintiff home owners has been forced to now expand its lawsuit to include racketeering, money laundering and intentional violations of the Iranian Nations Sanctions and Embargo Act by the national banks included among the &quot;Bankster&quot; Defendants.</p>

<p>The complaint - which has now been fully served on thousands of the &quot;Banksters and their Co-Conspirators&quot; - makes it irrefutable that the epicenter of this laundering and racketeering enterprise has been and continues to be Wall Street and continues to involve the very &quot;Banksters&quot; located there who have repeatedly asked in the past to be &quot;bailed out&quot; and to be &quot;bailed out&quot; in the future.</p>

<p>The Havens for the money laundering schemes - and certain of the names and places of these entities - are located in such venues as Switzerland, the Isle of Man, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Cypress and entities controlled by governments adverse to the interests of the United States Sanctions and Embargo Act against Iran, and are also identified in both the United Nations and the U.S. Senate&#39;s recent reports on international money laundering. Many of these entities have already been personally served with summons and process of the complaint during the last six months. It is now beyond dispute that, while the Obama Administration was publicly encouraging loan modifications for home owners by &quot;Banksters&quot;, it was privately ratifying the formation of these shell companies in violation of the United States Patriot Act, and State and Federal law. The case further alleges that through these obscure foreign companies, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo Bank, Citibank, Citigroup, One West Bank, and numerous other federally chartered banks stole trillions of dollars of home owners&#39; and taxpayers&#39; money during the last decade and then laundered it through offshore companies.</p>

<p>This District Court Complaint - maintained by Spire Law Group, LLP -- is the only lawsuit in the world listing as Defendants the Banksters, let alone serving all of such Banksters with legal process and therefore forcing them to finally answer the charges in court. Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, nor the Office of the Attorney General, nor any State Attorney General has sued the Banksters and thereby legally chased them worldwide to recover-back the $43 trillion ($43,000,000,000,000.00) and other lawful damages, injunctive relief and other legal remedies.</p>

<p>James N. Fiedler, Managing Partner of Spire Law Group, LLP, stated: &quot;It is hard for me to believe as a 47-year lawyer that our nation&#39;s guardians have been unwilling to stop this theft. Spire Law Group, LLP stands for the elimination of corruption and implementation of lawful strategies, and that is what we&#39;re doing here. Spire Law Group, LLP&#39;s charter is to not allow such corruption to go unanswered.&quot;</p>

<p>Comments were requested from the Attorney Generals&#39; offices in NY, CA, NV, NH , OH, MA and the White House, but no comment was provided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesnt need to change the fact they are being sued. What they dont need is <em>public scrutiny</em>. Keep this trial out of the eyes of the public, and maybe they could pay off a judge. But if the whole world is watching, paying off that judge is going to be a lot harder, and now any judgement by that judge is going to be scrutinized.  Its about staying in the shadows.   </p>

<p><em>&quot;had really managed to steal more money than the entire world is worth don&#39;t you think they&#39;d have a better execution than this?&quot;</em></p>

<p>They had great execution. They had the wife say she saw her slit her own throat. All the news press is already blaming the nanny without hearing a single word from her. The only part where the hitman fucked up was leaving the nanny for dead. They broke her vertabrae, slit her wrist and throat and left her for dead. But she survived.  I can only guess the next move is to tell the nanny to confess or her family is going to be wiped out. </p>

<p>Scam Involving Yohannes Riyadi and/or Wilfredo Saurin

In a typical version of this scam, Mr. Riyadi and/or his delegates falsely claim that they have on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York several U.S. Treasury Checks issued to Mr. Riyadi amounting to billions of dollars.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been contacted by several brokers and financial institutions worldwide inquiring about the validity of this fraudulent account documentation, which is being offered as collateral for lines of credit or other types of asset based financing. The fraudulent scheme includes multiple documents which purport to have the signatures of various Federal Reserve officials, including Chairman Ben Bernanke.</p>

<p>In some instances, individuals involved in this fraudulent scheme claim to have met with Federal Reserve officials and claim to have verified that the alleged account is in order. We have also learned that the fraud may include the purchase of certain documents by the introducing brokers.</p>

<p>If you have information regarding this fraud please contact either Robert Amenta, Special Investigator at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or Erik Rosenblatt, Senior Special Agent at the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>

there are a few laws that say you can not loan something you do not own personally.
so all of the people who took out these loans, may be able to get their money back, if the bank can&#39;t prove that they held these funds prior to the loans.</p>

<p>Nope, but if i was a nanny which stabbed two children to death, i wouldn&#39;t try to suicide stab me and *fail. I would just cut both of my wrists and lay down.</p>

<p>What i wanted to say was, that it seems that the nanny was stabbed by the same non-nanny person who stabbed the children. And this person failed to kill her, which is pretty unprofessional for this amount of money we are talking about. theferore the &quot;lol the nanny is not dead?&quot; ;-)</p>

<p>But the media reports, before any investigation, that the nanny killed the children ... thats strange in my eyes.</p>

<p>Do I need a specific source for the fact that he was assassinated too, just because someone doubts me? NO. ANYONE, and I mean ANYONE who is truly educated on the subject knows the truth. Anyone who is oblivious to it, who truly wants to find out will find out on their own. There is no such a thing as education other than self education, and this dude doesn&#39;t believe anyway so why the hell should I give him a source he&#39;s simply going to try and discredit?

i could probably post a thousand fucking links, that&#39;s not the point.</p>

<p>Just like everything in life such as Osama , Hussein, 9/11, Israel, Monsanto, JFK or anything else. All the blatant facts and truth are plastered everywhere. I could source in and out all day every day and people would just discredit out of disbelief.</p>

<p>The issue is that most people aren&#39;t intelligent to process reality since they have been brainwashed not to since they were in diapers watching Disney cartoons they feel as adults they are unaffected by. </p>

<p>People discredit the CNBC murders yesterday as related. People do not want to accept that we are being slaughtered like cattle. Especially the intelligent people but it&#39;s the truth. You think JFK is different? You think the president of the USA makes the decisions? Like my god people. Why do you even frequent this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats interesting that you didnt link to the order itself, and instead linked to someone talking about the order.</p>

<p>Is it so hard to copy/paste the actual order?  Here you go, I&#39;ll do it for you since you seem to lack the ability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SECTION 1. Executive Order No. 10289 of September 9, 1951, as amended, is hereby further amended (a) By adding at the end of paragraph 1 thereof the following subparagraph (j):</p>

<p>&#39;(j) The authority vested in the President by paragraph (b) of section 43 of the Act of May 12, 1933, as amended (31 U.S.C. 821(b)), to issue silver certificates against any silver bullion, silver, or standard silver dollars in the Treasury not then held for redemption of an outstanding silver certificates, to prescribe the denominations of such silver certificates, and to coin standard silver dollars and subsidiary silver currency for their redemption,&#39;  and (b) By revoking subparagraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph 2 thereof.</p>

<p>SECTION 2. The amendments made by this Order shall not affect any act done, or any right accruing or accrued or any suit or proceeding had or commenced in any civil or criminal cause prior to the date of this Order but all such liabilities shall continue and may be enforced as if said amendments had not been made.
John F. Kennedy,
THE WHITE HOUSE,
June 4, 1963.</p>

<p>So, did you actually read the order yet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The wife &#39;claims&#39; to see her slit her own throat.</p>

<p>So let me get this straight. Nanny stabs kids to death in bathtub. Goes around the house and turns off all the lights. Waits patiently in the dark for the wife to come home. Wife comes home to dark apartment. Goes downstairs and comes back up, searches each room and just as she is walking into the bathroom the nanny slices her own throat and collapses. The 3rd young kid see&#39;s none of this. </p>

<p>Mind you, the nanny already has slit her wrist and somehow has a broken vertebrae. </p>

<p>Sounds to me, like maybe the wife came home with the killer still there, and he told her to say that or he&#39;ll be back for their other child. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted this in an earlier post about this:</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/lamseafood.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;q=cache:paNARXgBkBkJ:oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press_releases/n2552_complaint.pdf+mitchell+j.+stein+%26+associates+complaints&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;pid=bl&amp;amp;srcid=ADGEESj5aefHCpIGx0bODZqD7pjjAWtPVenbi6Ck8Tcm7y7_7K0PaNmEDHu_yoQwPE-xqvqI1WFJCwiQyWpMNzpQ7hP1IwnwLHD8mnOTsc6XOUb-7OA8IOU7QJ09TSl8pYEsnE1oDFd5&amp;amp;sig=AHIEtbQCB7_JJUXZf1gfD39buyWmI4sxZQ">this</a> it is the same law firm that scammed thousands out of desperate home owners who were being foreclosed on by banks. </p>

<p>1.
Defendants prey on desperate consumer homeowners facing foreclosure and the loss of their homes by selling participation in so-called &quot;mass joinder&quot; lawsuits against their mortgage lenders. Veterans of the loan modification industry, Defendants use deceptive advertising and telemarketing to recruit consumers to join these lawsuits, at a cost ofthousands of dollars each. Consumers are led to believe that joining these lawsuits will stay foreclosures, reduce their loan balances, entitle them to monetary benefits and potentially get them their homes free and clear of their mortgage.</p>

<p>2.
Defendants often initiate the scheme by sending misleading mailers, including &quot;Litigation Settlement Notification&quot; mailers to homeowners notifying them that they are potential plaintiffs in a &quot;national litigation settlement&quot; with their lender. No settlements exist and in some cases no lawsuit has even been filed. Defendants&#39; mailers nevertheless state that homeowners may receive their homes free and clear of a mortgage, stop foreclosures, and receive thousands of dollars in compensation for damages. The mailer states it is a &quot;fmal notice&quot; and that a phone in response is required, luring homeowners into contacting Defendants.</p>

<p>3.
Once homeowners call the telephone numbers, Defendants engage them with additional false and misleading claims. ·Defendants&#39; telemarketers, who are not attorneys, provide misleading advice to homeowners regarding legal procedures and the likely results and benefits of joining the mass joinder lawsuits. Defendants tell consumers that judges have already ruled that the banks were practicing predatory lending and that consumers have already received the promised results. Defendants make false and misleading claims the mass joinder lawyers have achieved substantial victories against the bank lenders, including obtaining homes free and clear, stopping foreclosures, and obtaining orders rescinding notices of default. Defendants claim that the attorneys handling the mass joinder lawsuits have tried thousands of cases, and only take on qualified clients likely to be helped by the lawsuit.</p>

<p>4.
Homeowners are told that a settlement could happen at any moment and only those who have joined the lawsuit will receive the promised benefits. Defendants repeatedly make false or misleading statements to homeowners to get them to sign a retainer agreement and pay them thousands of dollars. Once homeowners sign a contract to join a &quot;mass joinder&quot; lawsuit and Defendants take their money, as much as $10,000, from their bank accounts, homeowners find they are unable to speak with an attorney with knowledge of the lawsuit. Basic questions such as whether the homeowner has been added to the lawsuit go unanswered. Some homeowners pay Defendants thousands of dollars only to lose their homes shortly thereafter to foreclosure.</p>

<p>5.
Thousands of California homeowners have fallen for Defendants&#39; scam, and Defendants have exported their mass joinder scheme nationwide. In this action, Plaintiff seeks an order permanently enjoining Defendants from engaging in their unlawful business practices, granting restitution for affected consumers, imposing civil penalties, and granting all other relief available under California law. By the filing of this lawsuit, Plaintiff does not seek to interfere with any consumer lawsuits or opine on the validity of any legal theories used to challenge alleged fraud by mortgage lenders or servicers. However, Defendants should not be allowed to violate California law by recruiting consumers into joining even potentially legitimate lawsuits by means of false and deceptive advertising.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Marina Krim, wife of Kevin Krim senior vice president and general manager of digital media at CNBC, had entrusted the care of her two small children to Yoselyn Ortega.. Ortega had worked for the Krim family for just 2 years before this violent &quot;incident&quot;..
Although the New York City Police Department has not been able to interview Ortega because &quot;she apparently slashed her own throat and slit her wrists&quot;, she &quot;remains the main suspect&quot; in the slaying of the Krim&#39;s 2 year old son and 6 year old daughter..
After investigations into Ortega&#39;s background, there were no criminal records and no history of psychiatric issues..
However, Paul Browne, spokesman for the NYPD explains that: &quot;Apparently over the last month she &quot;was not herself&quot;. Other reports about Ortega&#39;s mental state in the weeks prior to the murders reveal that she felt as though she &quot;were losing her mind&quot;.. Ortega also had some financial difficulties which forced her out of her apartment with her son in the Bronx, and led to her moving in with her sister in Harlem. Yet despite these reports, Ortega never showed signs of personal problems with the Krim family..
Raymond Kelly, NYPD police commissioner, confirmed that Ortega was in a &quot;medically induced coma&quot; at the Weil Medical Center, which rendered her unable to speak with police..
Earlier, Scott Cohn, correspondent for CNBC, reports on a lawsuit filed by Eric Schneiderman, one of 10 New York State Attorney General <strong>citing JPMorgan Chase as profiteering from the mortgage-back securities which led to the stock market crash of 2008.</strong> Since Schneiderman filed the suit, eleven US prosecutors and 3 attorneys with the Civil Division of the Justice Department have assisted in the cases&#39; development for the purposes of using the lawsuit for future reference against other Wall Street financial firms..
<strong>In January of this year, Krim was employed by JPMorgan Chase as a strategy consultant for only 3 months. This happened just prior to his employment with CNBC..</strong>
According to court documents regarding the lawsuit, the purpose for seeking legal remedy is:
The deceptive coercive methods employed by mega-banks to facilitate injured parties&#39; participation in loans and mortgages - The fraudulent and illegal use of MERS - Breach of plaintiff&#39;s statutory rights - Purposeful violation of consumer and homeowner protect statues - Processing money from unknown sources in contravention of the Patriot Act of 2001 - Foreclosing upon and accepting money for assets that do not exist..
The lawsuit states that there was a &quot;a systemic fraud on thousands of investors&quot; concerning the mortgage-backed securities first purvey by Bear Stearns, who was later acquired by JPMorgan Chase as part of the US governmental bailout of the banks after the 2008 crash. These securities were sold, according to the lawsuit, willfully and with intent by the seller to defraud and deceive investors. Because the securities were a combination of home mortgages, credit card debt and student loans which were bundled together and sold on the global markets after given a fake triple A rating..
Some of the mega-banks named in the lawsuit are: JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Wachovia, Citigroup, US Bancorp, Ally Financial, GM Acceptance Corporation, One West (owned by George Soros), HSBC, Deutsche Bank, PNC Bank, Bank of America..
Many foreign and overseas banks were named in the suit in conjunction with the mega-banks -- pointing to the fact that financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, and others were using offshore banks to hide their monies acquired by the mortgage-backed securities scam. In essence, these financial institutions took monies from mortgage-holders, funneled it to offshore bank accounts and then after securitizing the loans, took the actual property from the individuals..
The complaint states that the Ponzi scheme concocted by the banksters was &quot;the largest scheme in US history where domestic banking institutions -- on an international basis&quot; conspired together with the common purpose of engaging in a &quot;worldwide scheme to steal, rob and convert the personal property, money and proceeds of such assets of each Plaintiff herein&quot; with the obvious purpose of a conspiratorial &quot;decade-long systematic conversion...that damaged millions of borrowers across the US&quot;..
This lawsuit and the tragic death of two children appear connected. The truth of this lawsuit would bring down the greatest financial hoax of this century. The technocrats are willing to murder two innocent babies of a man who published the lawsuit on CNBC, because keeping the truth hidden is worth more to them than the lives of anyone possibly connected to the truth...</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you what, that was the nanny yelling &quot;You slit her throat&quot; to whoever was doing the stabbing. This wasn&#39;t done by the nanny and the reason the nanny has wounds is because she was attacked as well. Now I guess she is being pinned with it.</p>
