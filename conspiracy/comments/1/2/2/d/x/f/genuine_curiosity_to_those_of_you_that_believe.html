<p>No. As a matter of fact, my father expressed those feelings for them when I was a teenager and I had always thought he was being a bigot. It was only many years after he passed away that I learned why he felt the way he did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had nothing against Jewish people UNTIL I saw 9/11 Missing Links and became convinced Israel was behind 9/11.</p>

<p>Then I thought to myself, if they lied about 9/11, what else did they lie about.  That brought me to the Holocaust which I totally believed was a real thing UNTIL I LOOKED.  The Winston Smith Ministry of Truth is a good web site to go to to see how absurd all the &quot;evidence&quot; for the Holocaust actually is.</p>

<p>So wow...  They lied about the Holocaust, too.</p>

<p>I then I found out that they&#39;ve been forcefully kicked out by their hosts over 100 times over the past 2000 years.</p>

<p>Something is VERY WRONG here, and it&#39;s not me.</p>

<p>I went from thinking the Jews were just another people to thinking that it is dangerous to trust any Jew (even the rare good ones).</p>

<p>Can you blame me for being on my guard after everything I&#39;ve learned about them which they have tried so hard to hide?</p>

<p>Can you blame me for trying to spread the word so that others can take the proper measures to protect themselves?</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to do what&#39;s right, and there is a lot of Jewish social engineering that needs to be undone to accomplish this.</p>

<p>My life is now dedicated to stopping war and usury.  If the Jews were good, they&#39;d do the same, but they don&#39;t.  They come on to forums like this and do the opposite.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been to a concentration camp. Like actually stepped foot inside one, touched it, seen the remnants of the devastation. And you&#39;re telling me that didn&#39;t happen? That all the photographic evidence, all the eye witness accounts and all the confessions, not to mention paper work and planning by the german government, was faked. All of that was made up?

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, I think this guy&#39;s views are a lot less nuanced than your average holocaust denier. Most deniers say things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Gas chambers&quot; were delousing chambers to delouse clothing</li>
<li>Most of the deaths were due to sickness and disease</li>
<li>&quot;Human ovens&quot; did not exist</li>
<li>Hitler never gave any explicit order to kill all the Jews</li>
<li>There weren&#39;t 6 million Jews in Europe at the time</li>
<li>The &quot;6 Million&quot; number has a history that pre-dates WWII</li>
<li>6 Million was the very first speculative estimate of the number of Jews exterminated</li>
<li>There are no records of that many Jews dying or going missing - and Israel claims to have 3 million names though does not release the comprehensive list</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other commonly used arguments, but I think the majority of Holocaust deniers fall into the category of belief that, 1. The number is substantially less than 6 million and 2. The majority of the deaths were caused by poor living conditions (rather than it being an intentional systemic genocide). </p>

<p>There are, of course, answers to most all of the claims of Holocaust deniers, and many of the problems they point out are used to falsely substantiate claims that are much larger. Most people do not know very much about the Holocaust, and know substantially less than the skeptics. In my personal Holocaust education, it consisted almost entirely of reading books published by survivors - which are interesting for understanding their perception of things, but just aren&#39;t very historically accurate.</p>

<p>If you receive an initially very poor education on a subject, then someone says, &quot;let me show you all these facts you haven&#39;t heard&quot;, it can be very appealing to also accept their conclusions as well.</p>

<p>EDIT: I will mention that I do think there is a problem with the religiosity with which many historians treat the Holocaust. There are many historians it seems who care more about preserving the number of deaths and such than about pursuing greater depth of knowledge, and who ruthlessly attack any attempts to explore the facts more deeply. The way that deniers are attacked on the basis of their standpoint rather than on the basis of their evidence is probably why they are able to exist in the first place - it makes historians look bad when they do that.</p>

<p>Are these easily debunk-able or is there any truth to it? I honestly ask because I am unsure, but I remember seeing an image on /b/ a long time ago that showed memorials at Auschwitz and other sites where it said that way less people died, I&#39;ll try to find it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So is this trying to make the argument that a million murders is okay, but 6 million is too many?

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s motivation to lie. It&#39;s just really hard to account for and count that many corpses. There are almost certainly mass graves that we haven&#39;t found, and a whole lot of the bodies would be burned or incomplete. You kind of have to trust the Nazis to both keep accurate records and not destroy those records in order to protect themselves.</p>

<p>Counting the bodies after a genocide is a very tricky process. It&#39;s like the world&#39;s most macabre Easter Egg hunt.</p>
