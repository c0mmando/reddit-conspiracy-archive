        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I hate it and it has ruined my life. I got involved in a nasty business and they stole my dignity and threatened my family. Enough is enough. It&#39;s time to come clean. I&#39;ve thought about telling this story for a long time but have been afraid because I don&#39;t want them to come after me again. I just want my family to be safe. But there is no safety from these people. Only shining light on them can make anyone safe. Here is my story:</p>

<p>I am about ten years out of college, where I graduated with a double major in English and Political Science. After college I went into the work force, made a lot of connections in NGOs (I spent a couple years doing some editing at the CFR and you meet a ton of influential people there,) as well as some major banks that I did some intelligence consulting for. I was building up my resume, but I can&#39;t claim to be a big league guy, but I did work with and for a lot of big players. Things were going well, but then, like many people, I lost my job as the 2008 recession went full steam ahead. With a daughter to feed and a son on the way, me being unemployed wasn&#39;t acceptable. I went through as many contacts as I could, but they were all dead ends-- there was just no work for a guy like me.</p>

<p>One of those contacts would end up calling me back about a month later, while my wife was working her pregnant self overtime to support us, and I was doing some writing for a relatively minor publication. We were making money but just not enough to get by. This contact was someone who had been a higher up of mine when I worked at the CFR and had pretty much gotten me my job at Morgan Stanley. He was kind of an oddball and a bit of a creep but he was one of those people who was really good at making connections. He told me that he knew of someone who could use my writing skills. He said that he&#39;d been reading my columns on world affairs and that my blunt, mildly sarcastic, and sharp writing was exactly what a friend needed. I was thrilled. I had no clue what I was getting into.</p>

<p>I went to the office building where my interview would be. It was kind of run down and not in a great area, which was really not what I expected for a job that I&#39;d been told would pay a base of $10,000 a month with a chance to earn up to $30,000 a month a few years down the line. I&#39;d seen stranger things and I was kind of desperate, so I went in. The interview was not really an interview. I was given a few statements, and was told to write a response to each one that was less than a paragraph long and would change the opinion of someone reading both statements conclusively towards mine... basically arguing on the internet. I did it and I got the job almost right away. I had my own cubicle, complete with all of these binders filled with information, arguments I should be using, and intel on internet personalities. It was very bizarre, some of the binders went into great detail on the cultures and even individual personalities of many forums and users, Reddit included, which is mostly where I worked.</p>

<p>The task was simple. I was going to do through these forums, mainly the worldnews, conspiracy, atheism, and politics section of reddit, and I was going to debate people with anti-American and anti-Israeli attitudes. Software we were using would automatically mark certain users I should be on the lookout for, would let me change accounts rapidly, and would mark every post made by some of my coworkers so I would up vote it. This guaranteed exposure. Over the year or so that I worked there I probably got over three million karma on about 100 different accounts. I would spend the entire work day promoting anything that made the US military look good, anything in support of Israel, supporting gun control, and arguing with anyone countering those positions. This included coordinated character assaults on many users, some of whom will probably read this post.</p>

<p>Eventually, after I had banked a good deal of cash, I started feeling guilty about what I was doing. I&#39;ve always been pretty libertarian minded, which means that I believe that when left alone, people will come to the right conclusions. But we weren&#39;t leaving them alone, we were viciously altering the opinions of the userbase of many sites, including godlikeproductions, abovetopsecret, and Reddit. I&#39;m most ashamed of my activity on reddit because Reddit is a community that I love.</p>

<p>I tried to quit. I was having trouble sleeping at night. My boss threw a fit when I told him. He said that I was one of the best and he wouldn&#39;t let me go. That if this was about money he would see to it that I got a 15% pay increase. I told him it wasn&#39;t. He told me that I would regret leaving, and lifted his shirt a little to show me the pistol he was carrying. I backed out of that office, ran away, and never came back.
Two weeks later out house was broken into. Nothing was stolen, it was to send a message. A week later I left my house to see that my car&#39;s entire engine had been disassembled and left on my lawn. Another message. I took the hint and told my wife to take my daughter to her mother&#39;s house while I emptied our stuff into a u-haul and prepared to move. During this time a rock was thrown through my window. I won&#39;t get into much detail about what happened next because I&#39;m afraid of being tracked, but it got a lot worse, but I made it out of the country. I am writing you from several thousand miles away from my home, still afraid that they are after me, for I know too much. I wish I had never walked into that building. I just hope I&#39;m safe.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask whatever you want but I will not answer anything that compromises my safety.</p>

<p>Edit: Somewhere around here I have one of my briefing pages. You have to understand that we were not allowed to bring anything into or take anything outside of the office. The fact that one of my papers got shoved into my pocket is really more of an accident than anything. I could show you checks, but they were written from &quot;Public Management Systems.&quot; It isn&#39;t like we called ourselves shills are us. I&#39;m going to look for the briefing but you have to keep in mind I&#39;m on another continent, it isn&#39;t like I have easy access to any of the stuff in my warehouse back in the states.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know it by name at the very least, and a google search didn&#39;t turn up much. I want to make it perfectly clear that my area of expertise is not and never was espionage. I am, was, and will remain an analyst of current events and world affairs.

Even if this particular poster is not being honest.  As early as 2006, the pentagon was publicly announcing plans to &quot;wage war on the internet&quot;.  All of the executive orders have been put in place to provide quasi-legal cover for disinfo campaigns against US citizens.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a fairly simple motive.  9/11 has become a major PR disaster, and the criminals who perpetrated it are trying desperately to put the internet genie back into the bottle before the majority of Americans put all of the pieces together.</p>

Logging in and out of the software also automatically meant logging in and out of the forum account into a different one, but it was very simple to log into a different account without opening a new browser session.

And I didn&#39;t work at the Pentagon, but I have done some consultation for the State Department and they used to complain a lot about the people at the Pentagon.

<p>I believe that it was really less about Israel and more about the US. As an intelligence analyst I came across many other analysts who believed that anti-Israeli/semetic and anti-American sentiment usually went hand in hand-- the criticisms of one system or culture often applied to another. We were definitely supposed to make a concerted effort to separate some of the less defensible policies of Israel from the US government-- I cannot tell you how many posts I made explaining how the Obama administration in no way condoned settlement building in the West Bank.</p>

<p>The gun control I think is about trust in the state. Whenever a shooting came along we were supposed to hype up how this could have been prevented if gun control laws were stricter and more guns would just put more people in danger. We wanted people to trust the state to defend them, and not to trust their fellow citizens. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>On a personal level I am not opposed to the existence of the Jewish state, although I heavily disagree with the directions most of their governments have taken.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it had much to do with Judaism. We were really interested in advancing the interests of the American commercial empire, of which Israel is only a small, albeit critical and controversial part.</p>

<p>The WASPs who used to run the country used to be somewhate anti-Semitic. The only explanation that I can see for the new philo-Semitism is ideological Zionism and the rise of a powerful Jewish elite.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Israel is clearly an increasingly fascist and out-of-control state, as is its lobby. If there are powerful elements in the U.S. government that recognize this, do you foresee a scenario where they will come into open conflict with the powerfull Jewish Zionist elements in the U.S.? Under such a scenario, based on your inside information, who is likely to come out on top?</p>

<p>Oh, this is already happening, but behind the scenes because people are afraid of the Israeli PR machine. Very few people who are influential or high ranking American policy makers are against the existence of Israel. At the same time though, many of those people are continuously annoyed and even disturbed by the actions of both Israel and the Israeli lobby. Behind the scenes there is a lot of work to align themselves with &quot;American&quot; interests and more or less ignore Israeli interests. Back when I worked at the CFR and at State a lot of people would privately talk about how annoyingly forceful the Israelis were.</p>

<p>In terms of who will come out on top, the answer is pretty complicated. I don&#39;t think that US public opinion will ever be anti-Israel, or at least not in our lifetimes. At the same time though, policy makers are getting better at appearing to be pro-Israel but secretly just trying to ignore them.</p>

What would be a better alternative to threaded discussions online, or perhaps what would be a method that could prevent this type of mass spamming of conversation?  Further, what are some telling keywords or lingo that might make some of us here believe you a bit more?  Finally, if you indeed have this insight, what are some true conspiracies that you&#39;d care to divulge?  Was the Aurora gunman doped/set up? How about the NY nanny?  OKC bombing? 9/11?

<p>As we know nothing, but nothing, could be further from the truth.</p>

If you are truly worried about safety you would be putting this out to many media outlets and putting your name out there so if something happened the suspicion would be on those your are claiming to have worked for. </p>
