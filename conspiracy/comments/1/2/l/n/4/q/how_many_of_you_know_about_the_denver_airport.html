    <div class="md"><p>Waaay back in the 1990s, when DIA was being constructed, I was a communications subcontractor.</p>

<p>I can confirm that the facilities underground are MASSIVE...and for no &quot;apparent&quot; use.</p>

<p>Do you know that they actually have rapid-transit UNDER the airport, totally hidden, that is said to run coast-to-coast? I saw part of it with my own eyes.</p>

<p>Also had to sign about 10,000 forms stating that I would never talk about it under penalty of law...but fuck them.</p>

<p>DIA is sketchy as hell. In case you&#39;ve never been there it is <em>nowhere near</em> Denver--back when it was built it was out in the sticks, though development of the suburban area around DIA has gotten a bit bigger.</p>

<p>Trust me, the fucked-up (and now partially painted-over) murals on the wall are the <em>least</em> of the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, a bit of it. They used explosives and some sort of TBM with a conveyor belt, then stuck huge bolts everywhere. Note that I was not there <em>during</em> blasting and, in fact, the operations were so far away from us that you could just barely hear the machines.</p>

<p>I only went by an &quot;active&quot; area once when a voice line used for comms in &quot;the Quarry&quot; was accidentally broken. I am fascinated by machines and had questions but my boss effectively told me repeatedly to shut up and work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it was like blocks bolted together. Think q-bert. Kinda.  Poured concrete too, tunnels but square and BIG, two lanes at smallest. Remember that I only saw the construction once, and they were not using shotcrete, at least not that I could see. Where I was at the tunnels were yet to be widened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was at 95&#39; underground and almost all of the elevators went <em>down</em> with the exception of &quot;Big Otis&quot;--the elevator that took us underground--so yes, there are FAR more levels...but of course this was &quot;need to know.&quot; So I have no idea how far down it goes, but I know that its far!</p>

<p>I assume that the deeper fiber/copper must have been pulled by COE or something...because we sure didn&#39;t do it! There was fiber from the datacenter going down...back then I didn&#39;t have a tool like today to measure its length--even if I <em>would</em> have thought of doing it! ; &#39;)</p>

<p>I fully believe that the DIA project is connected to other DUMBS. As I said, there were not only cars down there (supposedly brought down in pieces but who knows)--more accurately trucks and SUVs--but also a rumored super-high-speed rail transit system. There were a few &quot;Rail Control/Switching&quot; rooms (I saw one in fact, but not inside) so there was some type of rail down there...but it was DEEP. The other reason I think they went down quite a bit is that, on the floor that I was on, there was a room with a large hyperbaric chamber. It was never explained to us and we weren&#39;t encouraged to ask about it. I think it was for emergencies if someone had to come up really quick and got nitrogen in their blood. Not sure if this is what it was for though.</p>

<p>AFA symbolism goes, there is a HUGE amount of it scattered all throughout the site as you know! Not really where I was working but who knows? I never saw a blueprint of the &quot;project&quot; so, as far as I know, it may be one gigantic symbol itself. That&#39;s how these people roll.</p>

<p>I have not seen that doc but I will watch it today and let you know! Remember that I knew almost nothing about this type of thing back then (pretty much pre-WWW and such) so I didn&#39;t even know what to look for--although the one mural with the soldier in the gas mask spooked the <em>hell</em> out of me!! I remember thinking &quot;now WHY would you want something like this at a fucking AIRPORT??&quot;</p>

<p>Edit: my phone inserted &quot;150.&quot; Real number 95&#39;.</p>

<p>A hyperbaric chamber has many diffrent medical use&#39;s so i think its legit stuff.What i find really intresting are the high speed rail sytem&#39;s the UN is promoting things like that over the world. <a href="http://diaconspiracyfiles.com/2009/07/11/map-of-underground-tunnels-connects-dia-to-other-sinister-sites/">Possible old underground system map?</a></p>

<p>I heard some rumors that there (general in D.U.M.B.S)are some rooms in luxury with much symbolism so thats the reason i asked.The Documentary is definitly worth a watch.</p>

<p>All what i and probably you know there is some weird shit happening down there...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was an IT subcontractor for a major US telco based near there (not naming names, but you can guess). We were the high-speed copper and fiber provider for all of DIA and &quot;the project.&quot; Basically I set up datacenters, provisioned dedicated lines, and configured the routers and servers. I also installed repeaters for both pagers and personal radios. This was a GSA contract.</p>

<p>COE=Corps of Engineers. This is purely conjecture on my part though.</p>

<p>I have also heard of these &quot;luxury rooms&quot; but was not near any nor did I see one. Where I was there were dorms (think Mt. Weather--stacks of bunk beds in rooms), some &quot;cells,&quot; various electronic/mechanical rooms that I could not get into, and MASSIVE amounts of open space/chairs/beds. Think of a HUGE DMV or something. There was part of a wall with bulletproof glass &quot;teller windows&quot; (don&#39;t know what for) and a gigantic food prep area.</p>

<p>There most certainly was some <em>very</em> weird shit happening there...remember that I only saw just a tiny bit more than the general populace. Like I said, I saw only what they said I &quot;needed&quot; to see and nothing more. </p>

<p>In my first week I tried, accidentally, to get into a room where I was not supposed to be. I stood on the mat, swiped my card, and put my palm on the scanner. Access was denied. Literally minutes later I had two armed MPs nearly tackle me asking what the hell I was doing! Then I was debriefed and told to stay home until they called during which time they checked my background even more deeply I guess.</p>

<p>Never made that mistake again!</p>

<p>EDIT: Holy SHIT! I have seen that map before but don&#39;t know where. That article was indeed right on--that&#39;s exactly what I heard, specifically that it connected to Los Alamos and to the Springs. Wow, that was a find sir!</p>

<p>EDIT#2: Holy SHIT again!! Check out the video on that site under &quot;underground bases&quot; about the secret construction. Phone won&#39;t let me grab the link but a heavy-equipment guy that was there first-hand draws a map that looked at once familiar.</p>

<p>I believe that&#39;s where I was--3.5mi (iirc) east of DIA off Pena Blvd. WOW. Thanks for the site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish that I could; due to very severe compartmentalization there is precious little to tell.</p>

<p>Hmmm, lemme think...well, I can tell you that there is space for tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people down there. Very well-hidden ventilation shafts exchange the air quickly (and filter it), there are underground roads, dorms, trains, you name it. Note that these things I&#39;m talking about are NOT under the airport per se (though DIA has a massive, massive &quot;basement&quot; that I&#39;ve never seen). This was in about 5.5 miles on Pena Blvd as you are driving towards the airport. </p>

<p>You have to remember that things were a lot different back then. They tried as best they could to hide all of this and deny its existence--partially by denial, partially by &quot;hiding in plain sight.&quot; It doesn&#39;t take a genius to see, though, that in the time I was there tens of thousands of trucks came empty and left full of dirt. I saw entire machines like Gradalls and Cat D9s just buried in place--they were too big and heavy to move out of the system so they were simply parked underground where, I&#39;d guess, they remain to this day.</p>

<p>If anybody remembers this DIA was supposed to be the first airport with fully-automated baggage sorting. This whole thing screamed &quot;fraud&quot; from the get-go. This huge job, hundreds of millions of dollars, was &quot;farmed out&quot; to a minority contractor with no apparent ties to ANYTHING...who never got it working naturally. This provided a huge &quot;sink&quot; to tell the taxpayers where their money was going but in reality I suspect it was being funneled into black accounts.</p>

<p>The communication system that I worked on was HUGE even for &quot;airport&quot; standards. This is early 1990s remember--everything was radiation-hardened and triple-redundant. Back then an OC-48 (a big data circuit even for today) was pulled in there along with enough Tellabs/AT&amp;T switching equipment to easily handle the demands of a large city...but it sat dark. 15,000+ phone extensions. Hundreds of state-of-the-art workstations. Underground all locking was performed by a central mechanism--access was via card/PIN/handscan. Certain areas had armed guards and you were told that they would fire on sight...shit like that.</p>

<p>I will type more as I remember it but, like I said, things were SO compartmentalized that I&#39;m sure I only saw a tiny part of what was there. I was working nearly 100ft underground and there were FAR deeper levels. As I said there were MANY rumors about the &quot;true purpose&quot; of DIA (as Stapleton Airport was still operational, not overloaded, and LOTS closer to Denver). One thing I think that I know though--the grand purpose of DIA is NOT as an airport.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah me too. The helicopter was weird though a beeline right over my house. The airplanes may have been drones (at least one of them) they didn&#39;t seem to be flying on the normal flight paths of airplanes landing or taking off in my area.

    <div class="md"><p>if you actually had a slight idea what you were talking about, you&#39;d know drones are capable of sufficient surveillance at an altitude high enough that you&#39;d never, ever see them. </p>

<p>you&#39;d also know that physical surveillance is unnecessary because it&#39;s not hard to compile a decent psych profile on someone simply through electronic surveillance. </p>

<p>and you&#39;d also be capable of using the common sense skills to understand that sending multiple aircraft to scare one person on the internet is a massive waste of time and resources, and that posting about it on the internet does nothing but add to your psych profile by demonstrating paranoia and highlighting the concepts you find to be highly important. </p>

<p>and that&#39;s a free sample of your security analysis, which is inversely a critique of your job performance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree it is a waste of time and resources. And I even said there&#39;s a certain amount of doubt, but the fact remains I haven&#39;t seen any airplanes or copters fly over in similar patterns since that day or before. Just thought it was curious. I don&#39;t care about sounding paranoid if they&#39;re sending a black helicopter to fly 100 yards over my house in a beeline directly from the from the horizon, how the hell do they expect me to act? Want more info for a psych profile: I think this domestic/cyber surveillance/psywar is bullshit and the biggest waste of taxpayer funds in history. There are huge fucking cracks in the engine block of the machine and the only way to fix it is knowledge, civil disobedience, and electing 3rd party or at least &quot;awake&quot; politicians to investigate the crimes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>look bro, on a serious tip, if you&#39;re seriously thinking a helicopter was sent over your house because you read some links online, you&#39;re too delusional to be thinking you&#39;re &quot;awake.&quot; you are not and will never be important enough to warrant the expenditure of those resources. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was a culmination of a lot of shit I&#39;ve been reading and talking about. Posting on this board is not my primary means of activism. It&#39;s just for fun. I think you underestimate how important each individual has the potential to be. I live on the outskirts of town, I can&#39;t explain why a military chopper (practically never see these) would be flying directly over my residence a day after I spent 9 hours researching state-sponsored killings. I really think there&#39;s a lot that they are keeping the lid on, and any one of us has the ability to catalyze the kind of spiritual and electoral revolution that&#39;s going to change the course of this nasty century</p>

<p>The phenomenon is called syncronicity. It happens to people who have raised their consciousness to a higher lever by intense concentration or study.</p>
