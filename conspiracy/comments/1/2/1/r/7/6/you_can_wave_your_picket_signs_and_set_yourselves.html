        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We&#39;ve tried protesting peacefully in vast numbers but our voices fall on deaf ears. We&#39;ve tried civil disobedience, but they attack us with tear gas, hoses, pepper spray, physical violence, and kidnapping. We engulf ourselves in flames, but they wouldn&#39;t spit on us to save our lives.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t go on living with this idea that love will make these assholes see the error of their ways. They laugh at the idea of going to prison when they can so easily buy the &quot;justice system&quot; and walk out scot-free. A small fine and a smile for the cameras isn&#39;t going to dissuade them from accomplishing their ultimate goals. </p>

<p>No, my friends. The time for common sense is here. If you truly want to save the planet, your children, and your children&#39;s children; if you want to live free from the tyranny of the Rothschilds and their ilk... we have to kill them before they kill us. When a schoolyard bully is put in his place by a much bigger kid, that bigger kid doesn&#39;t suddenly declare himself to be the new bully. He stood up to the bully because it was the right thing to do. WE are the bigger kid and we need to kick some serious ass to restore fairness and harmony. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t some paranoid delusion brought on by watching too many conspiracy documentaries, though many shills will try to say otherwise. This is the ultimate logical conclusion to the insanity we see every day; this is the revolution so many have talked about for generations. </p>

<p>I know many of you can&#39;t bring yourselves to take the life of another, but remember this: they would not hestitate to send your child to war, to give them incredibly hazardous vaccines, or expose them to the most depraved sexual torture imaginable. What if it was your child being sacrificed to some Paganistic &quot;God&quot; at Bohemian Grove, or some underground dungeon where they believe harvesting healthy children&#39;s blood will make them live longer? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I could shoot someone, either, but I not doubt believe they could shoot me, or lock me away forever. But this is the only solution I can see to saving ourselves forever. Don&#39;t expect aliens to come landing and declaring peace. Don&#39;t expect the Elite to cancel their agenda. In the end, the physical power is in our hands and we must use it to break our very real chains once and for all. </p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;re all going to die. The only question is how you check out. Do you want it on your feet, or on your fucking knees, begging?&quot; - Dillon, <em>Alien3</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looking back through history, the most effective way to eliminate them is simply to walk away from their contraption, and live in a way difficult for psychopaths to understand and exploit; then they kill each-other as their pie shrinks away. Scientists still puzzle why the pre-Columbian Maya just walked away from their fabulous, monumental cities and complex civilization; but until we have the nerve to do it also, we will suffer similar slavery and bloody sacrifice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need some amount of honest, and limited, and non-self-growing government. Our current government does not believe it is our representative and executive, but our ruler. It long ago decided on its own that what is in our best interests is not its purpose, but instead what is in the best interests of the wealthy and power owners. Add to that the self-serving sociopaths who climb the ladder to the top, and you have a corrupt system. Those who merely picket and whine will achieve nothing, and be laughed at by the elite. The entire DHS and TSA are there to stop revolution, not protect the citizens. That&#39;s why they pushed so hard for it. It&#39;s all about control. We might individually make a decision about what to do. But anyone grouping to do something will be viciously treated as insurgents and terrorists, because those people are a threat to the locked-down power structure.  In the end, it will either be a police state run for the rich, or a civil war. Why do you think all our communications are so tightly monitored? To stop Muslims on horseback with rifles galloping down the Interstates? Who do you think we now have indefinite detention without trial? What truly useful purpose can that serve in stopping foreign terrorists?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Upon reading your post I thought I&#39;d address a few things you&#39;ve said. You are right, the physical power is in the hands of the masses. Unfortunately most of the population isn&#39;t aware of the fact that anything sinister is actually going on. I commend the fact that you see that there is injustice being done basically against humanity as a whole and you&#39;d like to do something about it, but I believe you are going about it all wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When a schoolyard bully is put in his place by a much bigger kid, that bigger kid doesn&#39;t suddenly declare himself to be the new bully.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, sometimes that kid does declare himself the bully, or someone else becomes that bully. It&#39;s called a power vacuum.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not saying I could shoot someone, either, but I not doubt believe they could shoot me, or lock me away forever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then don&#39;t call for others to rise up against tyranny and do your shooting for you.</p>

<p>Honestly, there are other means of dealing with things like this, as other posters have mentioned. What really needs to be done, is people need to wake up and start reforming the laws of the system as auraofambiance has said. Freaking out violently in the streets is only going to cause people to get hurt, imprisoned, or worse.</p>

<p>Edit: Sorry for bad formatting, it&#39;s really late in the morning for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are far too many of them to kill--indeed you&#39;d have to kill 2% of America and most of Israel.</p>

<p>Violence is never a realistic option; indeed it only makes &quot;them&quot; grow stronger.</p>

<p>Look at Hitler--(arguably) tried to annihilate the Jewish population; now they are not only back, but running each and every facet of our everyday life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do we even need a government? Do you like having someone making the rules for you? We need guidelines and traditions that encourage peace, justice and unity, but not a leader to rule over us like a king. That definitely isn&#39;t productive.</p>
