       Being an airline pilot I have been confronted numerous times with the chemtrail hypothesis, sometimes on the internet, sometimes by people asking me on the airport.
I have looked into a bit but so far I have seen nothing about those long white stripes that linger in the air that suggests they are something different than contrails.
Often I hear people remark that contrails should dissipate in a short time and cannot spread. I have looked but I cannot find this claim in any meteo study. If you ask me, contrails are cirriform clouds, and cirriform clouds can last for mere seconds to many hours or even days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing that bothers me is that a lot of aircraft that are accused of spraying are in fact civil airliners, some from my own company and type. If my aircraft was rigged for spraying operations I would certainly know about it for multiple reasons I am happy to expand.

       I don't believe in chemtrails, I talked to my cousins best friend about it for about an hr when we were hammered one time, and he's a commercial pilot. I believe in many other theories but I don't think this one has a leg to stand on.

       Id say they have to exist at a certain point. Why would chemtrails be left out on public experimentation? Here in Oak Ridge where we produce nuclear weapons and enrich uranium, the Y12,x10, and k25 facilities pumped radiation into the populace for days at a time to study the effects without them knowing. So please elaborate on why chemtrails seem so ... impractical.

       The fact that contrails sometimes form a grid does not mean they are chemtrails. All you need to create a grid pattern with contrails is 2 crossing airways and a crosswind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine an airplane flying along an airway leaving a contrail. It encounters a 30 kts crosswindcomponent. 12 minutes later another aircraft passes along the same airway. The contrail of the first aircraft will be blown 6 miles aside by then, creating a parallel set of contrails.
Now add an intersection and you have a grid.

        Before each flight an exterior inspection is performed, I would notice any added spraying equipment such as nozzles which are not listed in the AOM or FCOM.
       </li>
       <li>
        On board there is no room to hide the chemical tanks, so they will be noticed immediately. For example: the baggagehold is divided in so called 'stations'. Each station has its own arm with the center of gravity which means the baggage load at each station can be used in calculating the mass&amp;balance of the aircraft. It would be obvious of a station was made smaller or removed to make room for a chemtank.
       </li>
       <li>
        I would notice if the empty weight of the aircraft would suddenly be higher without any added equipment listed. Whenever an aircraft is modified, it is weighed and the changes noted.
       </li>
       <li>
        The mass &amp; balance of an aircraft is very important for predicting the performance of the aircraft. The extra weight and shifted center of gravity would be noticed by me on takeoff because the calculated trim setting is incorrect and the handling feels different.
       </li>
       <li>
        The fuel consumption will be significantly higher due to the added weight and drag of the spraying equipment.

       There is undeniable proof that chemtrails exist. Just because you're a pilot doesn't mean you would ever be involved in using them. If you ask me, there is not a debate on their existence, it's a debate of why a lack of transparency exists in this field. Please research patents for these things. They date back to the 40's and 50's, more advanced stuff in the 70's and imagine what they can do now.

       What proof is this and how do you define a chemtrail?
      </p>
      <p>
       I acknowledge the existence of weather manipulation by cloud seeding. This has been done for many decades and is not a secret. Cloudseeding however is very different from the long stripes some people regard as chemtrails.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you mean by proof the many test on soil and rainwater, then I wonder how you can correlate those findings exclusively to cirriform clouds that aren't able to cause precipitation and how you ruled out other factors such as natural sources and pollution from traffic or heavy industries.
Has anyone ever taken a sample directly from what you would regard as a chemtrail?
      </p>
      <p>
       That brings me to another point. The air inside an aircraft comes directly from outside. When I fly through what some regard as a chemtrail, neither the passengers nor the crew shows any sign of illness. I find this strange because people claim to get ill on groundlevel where the concentration of the chemicals must be much, much lower.

       I guess my main issue is lack of transparency. If they were more open about it I may be able to answer your questions better. I agree all of the streaks are not chemical. But there would be no reason for weapons treaties and numerous patents for delivery methods and compositions of weather modification chemicals if there was no plan to utilize them.

       I don't think you can say a treaty, paper or patent can be used as proof for the existence for something.
For example, there was a study published that involved dumping large quantities of olivine in the oceans in order to reduce the CO2 concentration. Another one involved injecting the soil of low countries with bacteria in order to raise it so it would be better protected against flooding.

       A treaty stating that you may not use weather weapons was initiated because of the advances in weather modification technology. I respect your stance but still maintain mine. I would rather suspect they are a reality than be fooled into thinking they are nothing more than condensation trails.

       you can search the patents on the US patent office site There is plenty of proof there, but these links lay out a couple of the basics.
You dont do yourself any favors by begging for proof. Google is a powerful tool. Research it for a day or two and see if you still dont believe in things that are real. I'm not wasting any more time for you.

       I have seen patents of air conditioning units for shoes.
The fact that a patent exists is not proof that the concept is actually carried out.

       So look it up. Otherwise you will look uneducated claiming they dont exist. It's carried out every day to offset global warming. They seed clouds with aluminum oxide and other metal oxides. Thats enough proof for me, I didn't approve that.
