I personally myself believe that 9/11 was an inside job but I&#39;m afraid of it being true because then I wonder well what else has our govt done or lied about. What about you my fellow redditors what are some conspiracys you like to share?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another good book to read or look into is David Ickes Global Conspiracy. David talks about a ton of stuff and people bash him for going to certain extremes, but it&#39;s hard to ignore the core concepts he explores in regards to the controlling elites and their agenda at work. Listening to some of his talks might help shed light on some of their other actions.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an interview in particular I enjoy... he lightly touches on a large number of topics, the &#39;dots&#39; in the greater picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the American political system has been hijacked. Eisenhower warned about the military industrial complex about 50 years ago. The truth is the majority of policy will get pushed through, regardless of a blue or a red president. </p>

<p>In this two party &quot;us vs. them&quot; system, the differences are minimal and the benefit to leadership is in the division within the masses. I suspect fascism and major unrest is en route to the USA.   </p>

<p>Many people recoil from this truth; however, the reality is that we all live on tax farms and are merely voting cattle. To understand and accept this condition is the pathway to unlocking your cage and freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it depends on what you define as freedom.</p>

<p>I am self employed - which ensures I make minimal taxation payments to the Canadian tax farm.</p>

<p>I am happy that I have a baseline knowledge that many people do not have. Awareness of this manipulation is painful. I really see and hear what is being said by the politicians here and in the USA. For example the word tradition from a politician is code for &quot;we will not change a damned thing!&quot; I have lost a lot of respect for the &quot;average Joe&quot; because they tend to be void of critical thought. Most people are voting cattle. In a way, society deserves what it is getting. I think Edward R. Morrow said a country of sheep deserves wolves for leadership - I am paraphrasing, of course. Society is fucked and it is their fault. </p>

<p>I have tried to pass on this information; however, I have learned that most will snarl and threaten you if you offer to unlock their cage. Unfortunately, it does not take long to realize that this effort is mostly fruitless. So, you realize you can only help yourself and your family. I try to keep my kids informed, out of the military and church and I try to be a good example for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really do have a baseline knowledge. Society has been fucked and will continue to be fucked. Of course ppl are going to snarl they don&#39;t see what is really going on and if they do they don&#39;t want to believe it. Church is just a whole different ball game but you have a point.

    <div class="md"><p>I hope I am neither. I strive to find a balance in my life, although this is hard to do and requires vigilance. That&#39;s the benefit of seeing the nature of the cage humanity is locked in. You can be free of the dogma associated with either side.</p>

<p>I am in my mid 40&#39;s, so I have the benefit of seeing this social cancer grow through my lifetime in the USA (and here to a slower, lesser degree). I am more concerned for my teen-aged kids than for me at this point.  </p>
