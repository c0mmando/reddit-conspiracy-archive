        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In February 1961, President Eisenhower gave his farewell address from the Oval Office. In this speech, he warned that &quot;we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.&quot;[17] In an interview, published in USA Today the day before the September 11 attacks in 2001, Dylan linked his song to Eisenhower&#39;s speech, saying: &quot;&#39;Masters of War&#39;... is supposed to be a pacifistic song against war. It&#39;s not an anti-war song. It&#39;s speaking against what Eisenhower was calling a military-industrial complex as he was making his exit from the presidency. That spirit was in the air, and I picked it up.&quot;[18]
Lyrics-Come you masters of war</p>

<p>You that build all the guns</p>

<p>You that build the death planes</p>

<p>You that build the big bombs</p>

<p>You that hide behind walls</p>

<p>You that hide behind desks</p>

<p>I just want you to know</p>

<p>I can see through your masks</p>

<p>You that never done nothin’</p>

<p>But build to destroy</p>

<p>You play with my world</p>

<p>Like it’s your little toy</p>

<p>You put a gun in my hand</p>

<p>And you hide from my eyes</p>

<p>And you turn and run farther</p>

<p>When the fast bullets fly</p>

<p>Like Judas of old</p>

<p>You lie and deceive</p>

<p>A world war can be won</p>

<p>You want me to believe</p>

<p>But I see through your eyes</p>

<p>And I see through your brain</p>

<p>Like I see through the water</p>

<p>That runs down my drain</p>

<p>You fasten the triggers</p>

<p>For the others to fire</p>

<p>Then you set back and watch</p>

<p>When the death count gets higher</p>

<p>You hide in your mansion</p>

<p>As young people’s blood</p>

<p>Flows out of their bodies</p>

<p>And is buried in the mud</p>

<p>You’ve thrown the worst fear</p>

<p>That can ever be hurled</p>

<p>Fear to bring children</p>

<p>Into the world</p>

<p>For threatening my baby</p>

<p>Unborn and unnamed</p>

<p>You ain’t worth the blood</p>

<p>That runs in your veins</p>

<p>How much do I know</p>

<p>To talk out of turn</p>

<p>You might say that I’m young</p>

<p>You might say I’m unlearned</p>

<p>But there’s one thing I know</p>

<p>Though I’m younger than you</p>

<p>Even Jesus would never</p>

<p>Forgive what you do</p>

<p>Let me ask you one question</p>

<p>Is your money that good</p>

<p>Will it buy you forgiveness</p>

<p>Do you think that it could</p>

<p>I think you will find</p>

<p>When your death takes its toll</p>

<p>All the money you made</p>

<p>Will never buy back your soul</p>

<p>And I hope that you die</p>

<p>And your death’ll come soon</p>

<p>I will follow your casket</p>

<p>In the pale afternoon</p>

<p>And I’ll watch while you’re lowered</p>

<p>Down to your deathbed</p>

<p>And I’ll stand o’er your grave</p>

<p>’Til I’m sure that you’re dead</p>
