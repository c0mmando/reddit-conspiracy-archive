<p>But 9/11 was a cover-up itself for a massive bond fraud perpetrated by GHW Bush, and his Secretary of the Treasury, Paul O&#39;Neil, which was designed to crash the Russian economy, which is an historic fact.  Both planes that hit the towers hit <em>one floor below</em> the bond trading firms involved.  Both 757s and 767s could be remotely <em>landed and taken off</em>, so aiming them (which leads to suspicions that there were homing beacons in the computer rooms of the bond trading firms) would be a piece of cake, compare to having to land them.</p>

<p>Oh, and the date the fraudulent bonds were to &quot;come due&quot; (need to be paid off)?  9/12/01.</p>

<p>Come on, don&#39;t you see that &quot;antisemitism&quot; is the tool they use to silence you? All that word means is &quot;somebody the Jews hate.&quot; Since when is waking up to the truth anti-ANYTHING?</p>

<p>Israel, along with their sayanim and useful Goyim, perpetuated 9/11 and profited TREMENDOUSLY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah that&#39;s why I said I didn&#39;t feel like hearing it.  I agree it&#39;s a total ploy to subvert the truth.  Just because a group of people suffered tragedy shouldn&#39;t mean they are exempt from criticism.  Especially when you go back and look at the history of the jews being wholesale expelled from just about every nation on earth at one time or another.  I&#39;ve always said stereotypes and the like are there for a reason.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s very interesting about both the WTC and the flight 93 crash is Israeli&#39;s were arrested near both the WTC and just a couple of miles away from the Pennsylvania crash site.</p>

<p>For me and 9/11, how it was done is less important although there is obvious clues, the perpetrators are much more important.</p>

<p>&quot;Furthermore, on 09/11/2001, [blank] of the Pennsylvania State Police detained a yellow Penske box truck upon the request of Newark. [Blank] inspected the vehicle and determined that the vehicle&#39;s two (2) occupants, [blank] and [blank] both identified as Israeli nationals, were on their way to Columbus, OH. When Newark later questioned [blank] of Urban Moving Systems about the vehicle&#39;s presence in Pennsylvania, he could not offer an explanation. According to the moving company&#39;s [blank] the two (2) occupants and their vehicle were supposed to complete a moving job in a different part of the country. [Note: By a bizarre &#39;coincidence&#39;, the route from Weehawken, NJ to Columbus, OH passes within 2 or 3 miles of Shanksville and Indian Lake in PA.]&quot;</p>

<p>This is from the official FBI reports on the men arrested and the only thing that holds any water to this being debunked is the fact that they were eventually released back to Israal although that is obviously not really a good enough conclusion as its not impossible for a higher up to make that happen.</p>

<p>Read it all, it&#39;s the most compelling thing about 9/11 because it comes from the FBI and Police, not a YouTube video or some guy making anything up.</p>

<p>Note that those other buildings conveniently collapsed prior to the time Flight 93 would have arrived. It crashed sometime between <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=complete_911_timeline&amp;amp;day_of_9/11=ua93">10:03 AM and 10:10 AM</a>, depending on the source. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center#Destruction">WTC2 collapsed at 9:59 AM and WTC1 collapsed at 10:28 AM</a>. With the Twin Towers gone there was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:WTC_Building_Arrangement_and_Site_Plan.svg&amp;amp;page=1">clear path from the south to get to WTC7</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The OP&#39;s hypothesis is interesting though not original as it&#39;s been brought up since shortly after the event. The problem I see is that the planes that hit the towers came in over the water and thus had a clear path. They also went for the tallest structures. Coming from PA &#39;93 would have to negotiate a lower flight path over an area that has many buildings of similar height. As I see it a sure hit on Bldg 7 would require a steep descent without electronic aid. That would be nearly impossible for an experienced pilot and quite impossible for an inexperienced one or a person operating the plane by radio control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Twin_Towers-NYC.jpg">this picture</a> and imagining the Twin Towers gone, it&#39;s clear that a plane coming from the south (the right side of the pic) could  miss the tops of other buildings and still hit somewhere in the top 10 floors of WTC7. Considering the 270 degree turn and steep descent of Flight 77 into the Pentagon this seems quite plausible to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That would be nearly impossible for an experienced pilot and <em>quite impossible for... a person operating the plane by radio control</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but I disagree with that assertion (based on Flight 77 flight path) and would need evidence to change my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bear in mind that I used the word &quot;unlikely&quot; rather than &quot;impossible&quot;. We have to keep in mind that the aircraft that hit the towers were flying level and at full throttle. They were in fact moving faster than design specifications allow. The aircraft that hit the pentagon lost speed during it&#39;s maneuvers and came in at less than normal landing speed. (I don&#39;t have a reference at hand for the actual speed). An aircraft of that type would be, in effect, in a ditch rather than a controlled landing. Flying into the WTC7, over the tops of other buildings, at maneuvering speed is unlikely. </p>

<p>I think it more likely that any perpetrators expected much heavier damage to WTC7 and were depending on that as a cover story for the collapse. In the end it would likely have been decided to go ahead with demolition regardless because the whole series of events were so traumatic. WTC7 would make no difference in the peoples&#39; minds, which it hasn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something was bothering me after I posted that last comment. Too late - I didn&#39;t specify that my &quot;unlikely&quot; came from my first comment. My fault for confusion. Something else came to mind late last night that I had considered as far back as late 2001; the hole in the pentagon was at ground level. Maneuvering speeds of the aircraft only became a topic of interest once pilots weighed in on the issue. It&#39;s too bad that much of what they had to say has become lost in the arguments over the physics behind collapse. It would be nice to see a reconstruction of a possible flight path to WTC7.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there&#39;s not really any evidence that these people hijacked these commercial planes and flew them into those buildings.  in fact it&#39;s very implausible that they pulled this off.</p>

<p>With this in mind, it would be more simple to assume that the third drone/bunker buster attack on NYC was scuttled for some reason - maybe the E4B air fortress couldn&#39;t stick around, or the targeting laser wouldn&#39;t work in all the dust.   So now they have a 3rd plane with nothing to do with it, and a building full of explosives. .what to do?  Tell a story that a hijacking was thwarted and the building comes down due to uncontrolled fires.  they&#39;ll believe it. especially if we make a movie about the heroes of flight 93</p>

Perhaps the internal perpetrators concluded it would be easier and less questionable to hit the Pentagon with a missile and just say it was a plane. After all, they did seize all the videos of the attack on the pentagon... Is that not unusual to say the least? AND FOR THE DEBUNKERS OF WTC 7 I have only this to say... First of all, it was admitted that the building was &quot;pulled&quot;. Secondly, many eye witnesses stated that they heard &quot;bombs go off&quot; and &quot;it was like a controlled demolition&quot;. Thirdly, and the BIGGEST evidence of all other than the admittance of the demolition would be that pools of thermite (still burning at up to 2,000 degrees up to 2 weeks after the attacks, similar to liquid lava.) were found at all three collapsed building sites under the debree.. That to me equals, smoking gun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you&#39;re right, nothing at all...just an event that had never before happened <strong>in the history of construction</strong>!</p>

<p>Somehow, that day, it happened <em>three times</em>. Wish I would have played the Lotto that day!</p>

<p>Excuse me for a minute; I have some hearty laughing to do at the &quot;debunkers.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody has deliberately flown fully fuelled jets into New York skyscrapers before &#39;in the history of construction&#39;. Funny then, that there are so many YouTube experts on what usually happens in this situation. The physics of what happened are not difficult to grasp, unless you expect buildings to fall in a &#39;timmmmbbbeerrr&#39; motion like a tree felled in a looney tunes cartoon in spite of not having any sideways force applied to them. Truthers are the laughing stock of the internet, and with good reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A completely different building, on a much, much smaller scale, collapsing under completely different circumstances. That&#39;s me convinced! Have you come up with the answer yet to how such a wide ranging and powerful conspiracy could plan such an intricate operation and yet neglect to find out the &#39;proper&#39; way that buildings collapse, endangering their plan on account of the fact that laymen with no engineering experience can tell just by looking that &#39;that&#39;s not how buildings collapse&#39;? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the fact of the matter is that when you have the media in your pocket there really isn&#39;t any need to worry about if it looked legit or not.

although it would be a lot easier to youtube videos of controlled demolitions and compare them to the world trade centers.  It&#39;s completely evident.  That&#39;s ok though it doesn&#39;t hurt my feelings if you stay willfully ignorant to the facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How come you don&#39;t accept the vast majority of experts who say the way the buildings fell was not unusual?</p>

<p>Such as: <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military/news/1227842">http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military/news/1227842</a></p>

<p>Because you&#39;re very gullible and easily led, and will accept wholeheartedly anything anyone says as long as it re-enforces what you want to believe.</p>

<p>The conspiracy religion thrives on fear and anger, something you have in abundance.  It&#39;s no wonder you were such an easy convert for the people who make their living peddling fiction to people like you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you take one article written for the purpose of debunking &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;(which brings into question where there journalistic integrity was) from popular science in which the main experts quoted are Ronald Greeley(who worked on the Apollo missions to the moon that some people here would probably say were fake) who came to the conclusion after intense study that the &quot;pod&quot; was the right fairing where the landing gear drops down.  Here is a picture of the aircraft in dispute. Notice how the plane is perfectly symmetrical and that the landing gear are down front and center.<a href="http://www.airplane-pictures.net/photo/199803/n76151-united-airlines-boeing-767-200er/">http://www.airplane-pictures.net/photo/199803/n76151-united-airlines-boeing-767-200er/</a>
The other expert that stood out Allyn E. Kilsheimer states he picked up parts of the plane and human remains and all.  I can&#39;t find anything on him, but I&#39;ve never seen those pictures before and the ones I have seen makes the one in the article seem like bullshit.  I&#39;ll also say that when I went to the KCE structural engineering website when stating all of the places they&#39;ve conducted business they name Israel first instead of alphabetical order which to me seems pretty suspect.  There just too much evidence showing otherwise newfriend.  All of the points made in your article may be researched by experts, but there are also experts who make opposing claims.  You can believe whatever you want though like i said before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compared to the other two flights it looks similar to me.  the odd course change near the end could have had something to do with pursuit. All speculation here just find it interesting that 7 fell just as the towers did except for lack of a plane hitting it</p>
