       Obama re-signed the patriot act could not, would not provide proof of who he actually is, birth certificate problems, social security number belonging to someone else, could not, would not provide proof the dead body deltafucks bagged was who he claims it is, could not, would not try terrorist in regular criminal courts like the ones that found the unibomber guilty just fine with out relying on torture, lies and circuvention of due cause, could not, would not give the american citizen he ordered assassinated a trial.  People wonder why Romney, in all his glorious stupidity and lack of fit for the American people has a chance... Its because Obama really IS that bad.

       Obama increased civil liberties compared to bush.  Even heard of warrantless wiretapping? It ended under Obama

       Libya, Syria, continuation of Homeland Security, Guantanamo, Drone Strikes, Fake Bin laden raid, the Goldman Sachs bailout etc... On the other hand Obama has at least given lip service to being secular and socially progressive, has resisted the right wing branch of the Israeli lobby their call for airstrikes on Iran, and we have not had any self inflicted attacks like WTC 93, TWA 800, the Oklahoma Federal building bombing, or 911 on Obamas watch. I would say in many ways Obama has not been as traitorous as Bill Clinton or Cheney Rumsfeld.
I personally see Romney and his big supporters and backers as much worse than what we are getting with Obama. Don't get me wrong they are all destroying America and mass killers in thier own way but the neo conservatives that will follow Romney into the  White House are probably going to be worse than I can imagine.
Also for the record I think Romney is going to win the election based on polling, early voting and Republican voting fraud.

       Yes blunt cowardly video game warfare that is killing innocent targets and further radicalizing Pakistan. Meanwhile we are supporting Sunni Wahhabi overthrows of Shia controlled or friendly countries while uprising in Bahrain, Jordan and Kuwait are ignored. All of this is sure to blow back sooner than later and in a way that will upset the US NATO apple cart and very possibly topple some of our "allies" in the region such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain,

       As a non-American who has followed US politics closely for over two decades, I had high hopes for Obama in 2008 after the clown show of GWB.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, Obama's four years has been a crushing failure - a disaster every bit as bad as Bush. He has destroyed more civil liberties than Bush managed in 8 years and anyone else before him. If you doubt that, do some research on NDAA 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, most of the rest of the world reside under the misapprehension that Obama is a great guy (and maybe he is), but they are unaware of how frankly, toxic his political legacy will be.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what it's worth, I am fairly certain that Romney will be every bit as bad as Obama - the US electorate have a real
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton%27s_fork">
        Morton's fork
       </a>
       of a choice in this election.
      </p>
      <p>
       So take a step back and do some research what Obama has really achieved - it's not pretty.

       It's okay to have someone rebel everyone once in a while. It reminds us of just how much power media outlets have over common opinions. It is good for us to see what believing lies upon lies can do to a person. Notice how hateful he/she is? That's extremism at it's finest. But the fact that he/she is reaching out says non-vocally that he/she is curious.

       I can't be brainwashed by a multitude of information. I avoid getting information from only one source so my mind stays open. Even then I still question everything I read. I'm sorry if you feel that my comment is offending to you, but you're being an asshole by judging a whole group of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You post because you want people to respond. You're not always going to like responses. Where are your facts? Sources from non-bias outlets? If you take the time out of your day to do some real research and post some legitimate sources with questions and an open approach, you might realize that you currently aren't digging deep enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I feel I should add I don't think I am impenetrable when it comes to extreme opinions, but I actively make sure I keep myself in check quite frequently. Everyone is susceptible to being a bit extreme every once in a while. I know I can be.

       As most people should by now realize, Obama is the solution to the Bush problem within the larger context of the constructed Hegelian Dialectic, and of course the problem and solution are always controlled just as in the past 300 fucking years. It's the same fucking game over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this isn't readily apparent you should really do some more research because this is conspiracy 101. They're a one trick pony. All you have to do in any case is identify the problem, the solution, and the desired outcome. Sometimes it's hard, but in mass-manipulation areas they are always staring you in the face because they must.

       Well...it certainly depends on what you mean by "better".  He's probably better at sucking off Rahm.  And probably better at reading off a tpt.  But he's just another puppet...same as Gwb.

       Obvious troll is obvious, but still, the system is corrupt. Our "options" both support capitalist interests that benefit only the rich of the world. The reason why so many people have such shitty lives on the other side of the globe is because global capitalism keeps them there.

       If you're interested, I can find the PDF of my social problems class I took last spring. It is a legit textbook that lays everything out right in front of you in a non-biased way. It's kind of shocking because some of the horrible things the US does to the citizens of its own country and others is absolutely horrendous.

       I see... so why are we trying to decide what is the lesser of two evils? Which person tells the least amount of lies? They shouldn't be lying to us at all. Honest question: do you watch mainstream media? I don't want to degrade you, but I want to know what kind of perspective you're coming from. It's a bit befuddling to me why this matters to you. You just hand over your rights for what you deserve as a citizen and just deal with what we're all being dealt? Attempting to rationalize with the side that doesn't give two craps about you?

       four letters NDAA.  Bush never did anything that comes anywhere close.  Obama has expanded the Drone war, Expanded the war in Afghanistan, and continued the bush policies domestically ( i.e. total police state).  Guess I lost your respect.  Oh well.  Now tell me how is he "better?"

       Better at hiding the evil that he is?  Yeah.  You know, you're right.  I have to agree with you on that one.  He
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       better than Bush in that respect.

       I think, however, that what he's better than Bush at doing (hiding his evil) actually makes him

       than Bush...if that's even possible (which I didn't think it was until Barry came along).
